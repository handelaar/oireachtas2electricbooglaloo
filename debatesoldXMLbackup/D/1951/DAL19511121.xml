      <P>I am not prepared to withdraw the conditions that are imposed in cases in which applications for permission to inspect documents in the State Paper Office are granted.  The conditions include the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  that all notes and manuscripts are submitted to the officer in charge of the office; and</P>
      <P>(2)  that, in the case of any document reflecting unfavourably on an individual, the name of both the writer of the document and the individual concerned are omitted.</P>

      <P>As regards the last part of the question, existing legislation dealing with working hours, rates of wages, etc., is binding on all employers without distinction. If it is the Deputy's suggestion that the Government should seek additional powers to enforce wage rate and working conditions, other than those which are prescribed under statutory authority, while I should be reluctant to undertake this, I am prepared to consider it further if I am assured that it is desired by the trade union movement generally.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the public are at present paying extra money for the importation of foreign sugar and that the beet growers were deprived of £837,000 during the three years that the previous Government had charge of the industry, £837,000 more being paid to the foreigners for sugar than was paid to our own people, would the Minister not consider that this would be the best way to deal with it, namely, by calling a conference of the parties concerned?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the <Col N="1013" /> Electricity Supply Board have considered the rural electrification of the Valleymount area in the Counties of Kildare and Wicklow and whether, in the computation of the cost of the high tension lines, allowance will be made for the difficulties of the area caused by the artificial lake constructed by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the Valleymount area has been considered for selection on a number of occasions but has so far failed to qualify, as the ratio of fixed charge revenue to capital cost is low.  The area will be considered again for selection towards the end of this year, but the prospects of early development are not good unless a higher proportion of householders agree to accept supply.  The existence of the artificial lake does not materially affect the economics of providing supply for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I have a letter from the Electricity Supply Board stating that the objection to giving a supply in this case is wholly one of the cost of high tension lines; and that the cost of the high tension lines arises out of the fact that part of the area has been denuded of population by the artificial lake?  Does the Minister not agree that if the area that is now covered by the lake was populated in the same way as it was before it was flooded, there would clearly be a denser distribution of population and, therefore, a smaller <i>pro rata</i> cost on the high tension lines?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information except that which was given to me by the Electricity Supply Board.  I understand from that board that the difficulty in getting this area on the priority list is that a sufficiently high percentage of the householders in the area have not agreed to accept supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that but, on the whole, I think it is undesirable that there should be any impression created that decisions of the board in a matter of this kind are influenced in any way by political pressure.

The newspaper report is inaccurate <Col N="1015" /> in so far as it gives the impression that the rate of 21/3 per quarter was quoted by shipowners whereas, in fact, it was the rate at which they were asked to transport the grain.</P>

      <P>Some days ago I received a letter from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union concerning the employment of workers in the fertiliser manufacturing industry, and I have been examining the position.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers state that their sales are slow, compared with other years, and that their storage problem has become acute.</P>
      <P>This situation is attributable partly to higher prices this season for fertilisers due to higher costs of imported materials, partly to the lateness of the grain season this year which has delayed the clearance of grain from merchants' stores in which they would normally be now laying in stocks of fertilisers, and partly to a substantial carry-forward of fertiliser supplies from last year, particularly by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there appeared in a provincial newspaper of October 27th what purported to be a statement made by me at a public meeting in Dunmore on Sunday, 14th October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not make the statement in the form in which it appeared.  I was refuting statements that had been made to the effect that there had been a curtailment of expenditure on minor employment, bog development and <Col N="1022" /> rural improvements schemes since the change of Government in June.</P>
    <P>I dealt with each service separately, and gave the following information:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Rural improvements schemes&mdash;Provision, 1951-52&mdash;£125,000&mdash;same as in previous year.  Expenditure 1st April to 31st August, 1951&mdash;£61,000, as compared with an expenditure of £34,000 in the same period of 1950.</P>
    <P>Minor employment schemes&mdash;Provision, 1951-52&mdash;£95,000&mdash;same as in previous year.  Expenditure 1st April to 31st August, 1951&mdash;£6,000, as compared with an expenditure of £2,000 in the same period of 1950.</P>
    <P>Development works in bogs used by landholders and other private producers&mdash;Provision, 1951-52&mdash;£90,000&mdash;to which was added £30,000 in September, making a total of £120,000 available. Expenditure 1st April to 31st August, 1951&mdash;£58,000, as compared with an expenditure of £14,000 in the same period of 1950.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is, of course, aware, a provision of £40,000 is also included in the Estimates, 1951-52, for development works in bogs acquired by local authorities, but so far as bog development schemes are concerned when making my statement I was dealing only with works of this kind administered directly by my office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked the Parliamentary Secretary was whether he was aware that, according to a report handed to the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of this meeting at Dunmore, he made the statement that the amount of money allocated for bog development schemes in 1951-52 was the same as in previous year, although such is not the case.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that there is £30,000 more this year in the sum which is being administered by his office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no reply to the question which I put down.  The Parliamentary Secretary is quite welcome to go into anything he wishes. The question I put down was as to whether he was aware that in the issue of the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> for 27th October, he stated at a public meeting in Dunmore, a report of which was supplied to the <i>Connacht Tribune</i>, that the amount of money allocated for bog development schemes&mdash;that is subhead (I)&mdash;is the same as in previous year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I am prepared to make a statement.  In the 1951-52 period the provision in the printed Estimates for bog development schemes for landowners and private persons was £90,000.  That was £30,000 of an increase on the previous year.  I would point out to the Deputy that in the 1948-49 Budget framed by Fianna Fáil before it went out of office, the figure was £90,000.  It was reduced by £30,000 each of the two subsequent years.  The £90,000 in 1951-52 would not at all compare with the £90,000 in the 1948-49 Budget, owing to the increase in wages and other things.  It would not be capable of doing three-fifths of the work.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether it is a fact that recruiting agents for British firms attend at employment exchanges and there arrange for the emigration of unemployed workers; and, if so, how long this arrangement has been in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recruiting agents for British firms are not permitted to attend at employment exchanges and there arrange for the emigration of unemployed workers.</P>
      <P>The position at those offices in regard to emigration is that machinery is established there for the primary purpose of assisting the Departments of External Affairs and Justice (Garda Síochána) in administering the Government's restrictions on emigration to employment in Great Britain which prohibit, in the main, the granting of travel identity cards for employment purposes to men who are in employment in this country or for whom suitable employment is available here or will be available within a reasonable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This policy is carried out in co-operation with the British Ministry of Labour which has appointed a liaison officer, not a recruiting agent, resident in Dublin.  Under the arrangement my Department has undertaken to forward to the liaison officer the applications for employment in Great Britain of persons who, being free of the restrictions, make such applications entirely of their own accord.  This restrictive machinery was first introduced in 1941 when travel permits <Col N="1031" /> became necessary for intending emigrants, both men and women, and when the activities of British employment agents were curtailed by the prohibition of Press advertising, etc.</P>
    <P>Irish citizens entering Great Britain for employment on a travel permit issued by the Minister for External Affairs and holding a written offer of work in Great Britain approved by the liaison officer were assured of freedom from military service, liberty to return home at will and participation in the British schemes of compensation for war injuries.</P>
    <P>The restriction on Press advertising disappeared with the abolition of Press censorship in 1945.  The restriction on emigration of women became impracticable in July, 1946, with the cessation in Britain of control on their employment and the consequential withdrawal of the employment visa in their case which enabled them to enter Britain freely as visitors and remain there at will.  Since July, 1946, the position has remained unchanged.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wrong in some of his conclusions.  If a person in this country accepts work in England of his own accord, officials of the labour exchanges are expressly forbidden to suggest that the person should emigrate.  However, if they do receive an offer of employment, then they attend at the labour exchanges. A representative of the liaison officer may be present, or he may not, to discuss the employment offered.

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he will take <Col N="1034" /> steps to obtain from the Egyptian Government a complete statement of the Egyptian Government's case in its present dispute with the British Government and to make copies of the Egyptian Government's case available in the Library of the Oireachtas for the information of Deputies and Senators.</P>

      <P>Our newspapers have published the various statements made by the Egyptian Government regarding their dispute with the British Government. As I do not see how we could effectively intervene to settle the dispute, I feel it would be unwise to take such an initiative as the Deputy suggests in his question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state on the basis of the memorandum prepared by the Director of Forestry on 24th January, 1949, and reproduced in appendix I of the Forestry Mission's Report, the number of even days' employment that would be given on the average per 100 acres (a) on development fencing, etc., from date of acquisition until planting; (b) on maintenance, thinning, felling and all other work carried out in the forest or at sawmills or elsewhere to bring the timber to the same stage as it would be if imported, during each period of five years (or other convenient period) from the date of planting until the date of maturity of the trees so planted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>On average, the initial development and planting of 100 acres gives a little over 3,000 days' work, or full employment for a year for ten men. (In the case of mechanical drainage and preparation for planting the full-time employment would be less, say six men per year.)</P>
      <P>Maintenance work thereafter would provide about 200 days' employment per annum for one man for 100 acres.</P>
      <P>Thinning.&mdash;Employment on thinning necessarily varies with the intensity and frequency of thinnings, which in turn depend on the species used and the conditions under which they are growing.  Generally, thinning is undertaken at intervals of about five years. On the basis of an admixture of species etc., and frequency and extent of thinnings on the lines contemplated by table III of the document mentioned by the Deputy, employment per 100 acres would amount to about 50 days' work per annum for one man between the 15th and 20th year of the crop rotation; the extent of the employment given would increase progressively with each five-year cycle, and would amount to as much as full-time employment for five men between the 45th and 50th year.</P>
      <P>Clear-felling of 100 acres of mature timber would afford full-time employment for a year to 30 men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not give the Deputy a reliable estimate of the employment likely to <Col N="1044" /> be given in the conversion of forest produce in sawmills or similar plant. My Department's experience of such conversion is too limited to enable a reliable estimate to be made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the lands of Mrs. Sims, Coolbeggan West, Knockmore, County Waterford, taken over by his Department for afforestation, comprise for the most part arable land suitable for tillage and fit to produce wheat, corn and potatoes and, as there is agitation in the district for the division of this land among the small holders, if he will reconsider the decision to plant the land and request the Land Commission to divide the land.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission inspected this area in 1949 but decided against its acquisition for their purposes. I am informed that, although some of the land was formerly tilled, it is of poor quality generally.  There appears to be no reason to alter the decision to plant the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum price which my Department at present pays for land for planting is £8 per acre. The price actually paid for any particular area depends on its suitability for forestry purposes.  The average price per acre paid for land, including unplantable land, during the period 1st April, 1951, to 30th October, 1951, was approximately £4 per acre.</P>

      <P>In January, 1947, following an investigation of the matter by a committee of inquiry, I had the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting informed that a sum of £7,500 would be made available as a subsidy towards the cost of producing legal textbooks which would cover much the same ground as &ldquo;Wylie&rdquo;, &ldquo;Carleton&rdquo;, &ldquo;Babington&rdquo; and &ldquo;O'Connor's Justice of the Peace&rdquo;.  The scheme which had been suggested by the committee of inquiry provided that the incorporated council would assume responsibility for the nomination of editors and the general supervision of the editorial work.  The offer to provide a subsidy on the basis indicated still holds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice what are the difficulties of enforcement which deter the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána from making a by-law directing that heavy vehicles must maintain an interval of 25 yards from each other, and whether the same difficulties exist in the enforcement of the &ldquo;dimming&rdquo; by-law; and, if not, why not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The main difficulty in the enforcement of such a by-law is that it would be necessary in practice to prove that a driver found inside the 25-yard limit was not about to pass the vehicle in front.  To prove this, it would be necessary to keep the vehicle under constant observation and this could be done only by mobile patrols. Such patrols are not, however, available for the Dublin-Naas road at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it desirable at this stage to emphasise that in opening this debate the Minister for Industry and Commerce set a high standard for <Col N="1050" /> Deputies generally.  He concentrated upon the needs of the nation.  He did not indulge in personalities or anything likely to cause bitterness or ill-will in the House.  The fact that his speech was applauded by fair-minded Deputies in every part of the House is evidence that the stand which he took in regard to our economic problems was appreciated by fair-minded Deputies in every part of the House.  It is right also to emphasise that it never was more necessary for Deputies of all Parties to leave aside purely personal or Party considerations and get their minds down to the urgent need for making this country secure economically, because without economic security the independence and even the survival of this country is endangered. I think it is right now to advise the Opposition Parties, particularly former Ministers, to give of their best, in cooperation with the Government, in dealing with the present economic position of the country.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to remind former Ministers of the mistake which was made by ex-Ministers 20 years ago when, by opposing the national demand on Great Britain, they inflicted on this country an economic war which lasted for five years.  It is possible for ex-Ministers to do serious damage to the nation in its endeavours to increase the industrial and agricultural output and make provision for the entire population so as to avoid the necessity for exporting our young people.  They should be warned by the mistakes made by embittered ex-Ministers 20 years ago and, even though they may be bitter to-day, they should not allow their bitterness to influence them into taking a stand which is contrary to the best national interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that the standard of debate set by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was high, and I may say that the standard set by him was followed by those who spoke after him, with the exception of Deputy Dillon. I only heard portion of Deputy Dillon's speech and the portion I heard I would say was a fine speech regarded as oratory.  Having regard to the physical gestures and the facial contortions of the speaker, it was, in fact, a work of <Col N="1051" /> art, but when you blow off the froth and examine it as it appears in cold print in the Official Reports, you find that there is nothing in it but a mean. low, coarse charge against certain Ministers of the present Government, a charge not based on any facts, because Deputy Dillon is not interested in facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated that it is common knowledge in the corridors of this House that there is a sort of private war going on between two Ministers. It is very easy to make a false charge of that kind, but it is very difficult to refuse it.  Any Deputy can come into this House and say that it is common knowledge that Deputy Dillon frequently beats his wife and there is very little that Deputy Dillon could do about it.  I have been in this House since 1938 and I have never been absent one day on which the House was in session during that period.  I think I have as much knowledge as any Deputy of what takes place in the corridors of this House and I have never heard any suggestion, such as Deputy Dillon mentioned, that there was this bitter conflict between two members of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know what good Deputy Dillon hopes to do by making these false and malicious charges.  I know that there is a certain type of low mentality such as that of a toothless old woman in a back tenement room who would probably derive a certain amount of satisfaction from making false accusations against her neighbours. But I do not think it is necessary for a person in public life, merely in order to attract the limelight to himself, to make those dirty and lying charges, because there is nothing behind them.  Has Deputy Dillon suggested that he had any proof that there was a conspiracy hatched by two Ministers such as he described in this House?  Was he present at the Cabinet meeting where these matters were raised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was Deputy Dillon present?  A person who makes a charge <Col N="1052" /> ought to try to prove it.  It is not necessary for a person against whom a charge is made to try to prove that it was not true.  Was Deputy Dillon present, disguised perhaps as a shaggy dog, while this matter was discussed at a Cabinet meeting?  I think Deputy Dillon has done much more harm than I believed at one time it was possible for him to do in the public life.  He has brought a certain amount of ill-will into the public life of this country which would not otherwise be brought. It would be well for those who have the best interests of the country at heart to weigh this situation carefully and ask themselves: where is Deputy Dillon leading us?  because it is inevitable that those who are setting themselves out to attack the policy outlined by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce are following Deputy Dillon's lead.  The policy outlined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is a policy to keep this country independent by making it vigorous, self-reliant, and fully developed agriculturally and industrially.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that Deputy Dillon is determined to lead the country in the opposite direction.  Some Opposition Deputies have alleged that the recent speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce were calculated to create alarm, gloom and discontent. Deputy Dillon made that suggestion.  But, if that was his intention, as I pointed out last Thursday he was anticipated by the former Minister for Finance who was the first person of ministerial rank to draw attention to the serious position of the country in regard to our balance of payments.  If there was this conspiracy between Ministers in the Cabinet it would appear that Deputy McGilligan was up to his neck in it because he was the first to raise the question of the gravity of our economic position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one reads Deputy Dillon's speech and analyses it&mdash;indeed, even if one does not read it very carefully but merely reads the summary of it given in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;one is forced to the conclusion that the country has no future.  There was nothing constructive in his speech.  It was purely destructive.  It was merely an indication that nothing can be done to <Col N="1053" /> advance the national interest.  He attacked the cement industry.  He attacked the managing director of Cement, Limited, in a very vulgar and malicious fashion.  I heard that portion of his speech in which he dramatically portrayed the meeting of the directors of Cement, Limited; he told us that there was a vacant chair and the door was open; he told us that a dark villain with a foreign name entered the room.  His appeal was to the lowest instincts of our people when he made these charges, charges that he has made repeatedly against people with foreign-sounding names.  If someone in Denmark or some other country invariably based charges against Irishmen because their names were Murphy or O'Kelly I am sure that we would all regard his standard of mentality as being very low.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon thinks there is a certain public for that type of abuse. I think the gentleman who was recently attacked will deal very effectively with Deputy Dillon's charges.  I do not suppose that will worry Deputy Dillon. To-day he has probably forgotten all about these charges.  At this moment he is probably locked in some soundproof room preparing a new set of malicious falsehoods against some other set of persons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is very rarely constructive here but outside he sometimes lifts the veil and lets us see what ideal he is anxious to achieve.  Over the week-end he indicated his ideal for the country.  In the rural areas we have an individual who is known by different names in different districts. In my part of the country he is known as a gabbler.  He specialises in matchmaking. Deputy Dillon is apparently setting out to make a match between Mrs. Britannia and Uncle Sam.  He will marry these two esteemed individuals and some time after the marriage he will get them to adopt, legally or illegally, the Irish Republic as their child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a contrast here between the two policies outlined.  We <Col N="1054" /> have the policy of an independent self-reliant nation developing her own resources to the full, including her industrial and agricultural potential, in order to make the country stand on its own feet.  On the other hand, we have the policy outlined by Deputy Dillon of making this country so helpless that it will eventually have to be picked up into the arms of Mother Britannia where, as a helpless infant, it may perhaps be allowed to play with Uncle Sam's gold chain.  That is the ideal Deputy Dillon has laid before the country in opposition to the ideal aimed at by the Tánaiste when introducing this measure.</P>
      <P>Those who want the country to remain for all time a weak and helpless infant dependent for its existence upon its helplessness and upon the pity its helplessness inspires can follow Deputy Dillon.  Those who want the country to remain independent and to become physically and economically stronger must accept the policy laid down by the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>The only interesting part of Deputy Dillon's speech was that part where he spoke to Deputy MacBride like a patronising father in relation to money. As we all know Deputy MacBride has been asking questions relevant to our monetary system and to the manner in which the finances of our State are managed.  It was rather amusing to hear Deputy Dillon quietly warning Deputy MacBride to lay off these matters.  He more or less compared Deputy MacBride to an infant playing on the floor with an atomic bomb; the atomic bomb, he said, is harmless enough so long as it keeps rolling about but when it is hit in the right place at the right time it creates a terrific bang.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is exactly the type of warning that has been given to everybody in connection with our monetary system: lay off it; you do not understand it; the less you say and do about it the better.  I do not want to go into this question I asked last week, I elicited the information that the volume of money has increased within the last 20 years by £182,000,000.  I would like Deputies to concern themselves with the question as to how that <Col N="1055" /> £182,000,000 increase in the volume of money came about.</P>
    <P>Did that increase in the volume of money come about by reason of the fact that there was a shower of currency notes from the sky?  Is it not clear that this money was created by somebody out of nothing.  If somebody has that important power, then it appears to me desirable that the matter should be investigated.  If an average of £10,000,000 per year is created and added to the sum total of money in existence, would it not seem to be ordinary common sense that the power of creating that money should be under the control of the State and not of banking concerns?  I am not one of those who claim that that change would bring about an immense benefit to the country, but at least it would bring about some benefit.  If, for example, the money required for housing could be created free of interest instead of being created by a private financial monopoly, then we could have houses at a much cheaper rate than we have them at present.  It now costs £1,000 to build a worker's house in rural Ireland, but the position is that that worker, the taxpayer and the ratepayer have to pay £2,000 to somebody for that house.  I do not know why that should be absolutely necessary, in view of the fact, as I say, that there is an annual increase in the amount of money created apparently out of nothing.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a good thing if we could have that matter investigated. We had a commission of inquiry into banking, a commission which issued its report in 1938.  In my opinion, that was a rather lopsided commission.  I think it would be better if we had a commission representative not only of those who create money but of those who have to live in this country, of those who are concerned not only with banking interests but also of those concerned with the social side, the monetary system and how it operates. I have indicated that, apart altogether from these deep financial problems which Deputy Dillon warned us not to touch on any account because of the danger that we might blow ourselves <Col N="1056" /> up, there are the ordinary day-to-day economic problems which we have got to face up to.  I think the most urgent matter is to ensure an immediate expansion in the volume of our agricultural and industrial output.  That, I think, is a pressing problem.  It is necessary and desirable to talk about long-term planning, such as the development of housing, hospitals, afforestation, the generation of electricity, etc.  It is necessary to think in a long-term way of these matters, but with our present adverse balance of payments, it is necessary also to think of the immediate future, and see how we can strengthen the nation's position by increasing our volume of output.</P>
    <P>We know that the volume of industrial output has increased very considerably since the cessation of hostilities. On the other hand, the volume of agricultural output decreased very considerably last year, and, on the average over the last three or more years, it has been very substantially below what it was during the war period.  That decrease is, in the main, due to the mistaken policy of driving the farmers away from tillage.  There are people who say that tillage exhausts the land completely.  I know land which has been tilled intensively over a long period, and it is as rich to-day as it was 20 or 30 years ago. Mixed tillage farming, with proper crop rotation, does not wear out or deteriorate the land, but it does ensure that the maximum output will be secured from it.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why our agricultural output is low is because we have cut down the area under cereal crops under the guidance and direction of the late Minister for Agriculture.  By refusing to give a price for oats and feeding barley two years ago, the area under these crops was drastically cut as a result, and so we were left dependent for feeding stuffs for our poultry and pig industry on imported maize. When it became impossible to obtain the imported maize at a reasonable price, the production in both the pig-raising and poultry industry declined heavily.  Now, we could remedy that position right away.  The first step to <Col N="1057" /> remedy it would be to secure that the acreage under oats and feeding barley for the coming year would be increased.</P>
    <P>If farmers are given reasonable prices, and if they are assured that there is no danger of a collapse in prices, you will get an increased acreage in the case of both oats and feeding barley.  The result of that will be that we can feed more poultry and more pigs.  These are two branches of the agricultural industry which can be expanded very rapidly.  We can have a vast expansion in the poultry and pig industry, and that will mean that we will have more bacon and eggs to export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we ensure, in any trade agreement that is made with Britain, we get a reasonable and a fair price for our exported bacon, that will, to a certain extent, govern the price of pigs.  In addition, it will be necessary to assist the farmers in every possible way to utilise home-produced feeding stuffs.  That will call for the <Col N="1058" /> development of a large area of potatoes and other fodder.</P>
      <P>That is a matter, however, which can be gone into more fully when we are dealing with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>There is, however, one matter which causes deep concern because it hinges upon our imports and exports.  In the course of his speech last week, Deputy Dillon referred to the very solemn and important conference which was held between the then Taoiseach and the editors of the four daily papers.  It appears that those worthy gentlemen were summoned into the presence of the then Taoiseach and presented, I might say, with four nose muzzles which they were asked to wear for a while so as not to expose the adverse balance of payments position.  I wonder did the then Taoiseach, when he was telling those gentlemen that he intended to embark on a policy of stockpiling, tell them what he intended to stockpile&mdash;that he intended to stockpile millions of pairs of beautiful nylon stockings?  Did he tell them that he intended to stockpile thousands of tons of imported butter&mdash;not to put it in cold store but in the stomachs of those well-to-do people who could afford to buy butter off the ration&mdash;or that he intended to import socks from Hong Kong? Did the then Taoiseach indicate to those gentlemen that that was the kind of stockpiling policy which he was going to embark upon when he wanted protection from the Press?</P>
      <P>When we get down to this question, I want to say that I do not think that we have, over the past four years, imported a sufficient quantity of the raw material which we need for agriculture. I refer to fertilisers.  It is unfortunate that we cannot produce fertilisers in this country to any extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to stockpile at all we ought to get fertilisers wherever we can and at the cheapest price.  In regard to this particular commodity the Government will have to be drastic in ensuring that the fertilisers are sold to the farmer at as a low a price as possible, that the margin of profit in that industry from the moment the fertiliser is purchased abroad until it is landed on <Col N="1059" /> the farm is as low as is humanly possible. This is a vital commodity and if, by reason of the increase in the price of fertilisers, farmers are forced to reduce the amount used, it will result in a reduction in the output from the land.  That is what we have to avoid at the present time and, for that reason, I think it is important that it should be a first priority of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that farmers get the fertilisers at the lowest possible price and on the best possible terms.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report dealt with many matters but there is one matter in regard to which they were on reasonably sound ground.  They drew attention to the amount of goods that are purchased in this country under the hire-purchase system.  These goods are, in the main, luxury goods&mdash;furniture, cars and other items of that kind. They are either luxury goods or semi-luxury goods.  It is an extraordinary thing that a young man starting out in life can, if he wishes, purchase a car costing £300, £400 or £500 by paying down a relatively small deposit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not? What is the objection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection, but there is this point.  If you have hire purchase in regard to luxury or semi-luxury goods why should you not have a similar system in regard to things that are necessary to increase production? As I say, a young man can purchase a car by paying one-third or one-fourth of the price, but he could not purchase a few cows if he wanted them to build up a dairy herd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to essentials <Col N="1060" /> for agricultural production or for any other line of productive activity, there should be a real effort to secure that, if credit is required, it will be made available and that it will be made available on the right lines.  There is too much credit for the purchase of certain luxury articles but not enough for the purchase of productive goods.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Government will have to turn their attention to short-term credit in regard to tillage, the linking up of better credit facilities with the growing of wheat and other cereal crops.  As we know, under enlightened leadership, the Irish Sugar Company provided very substantial credit facilities for the purchase of fertilisers over the last few years and the net result of that expansion of credit for the purchase of fertilisers has been a very substantial increase in the output per acre.  That is one of the things we must aim at.  There is no use in hurling abuse or bandying words about. We must get a little more per acre out of the land while keeping the land in its condition of fertility.  That is a practical aim.  All the other things which, perhaps, attract a certain amount of the limelight or secure certain headings in the daily papers are non-essential.  The essential thing is to get expansion in our output and it is by adopting practical measures in that direction that we are going to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to indicate that a very intensive drive will need to be made in regard to the production of turf next year.  In this connection I have a feeling that the distribution of the available manpower in this country is somewhat haywire.  I believe that the important work that has to be carried out in this country is in the main of a seasonal nature.  Tillage is to a certain extent seasonal as are turf production and drainage.  Turf, tillage and drainage are, in the main, works which must be carried out during the summer months but road making, for example, which employs a very considerable amount of the labour available in this country, is work which can be carried out to a large extent in the winter time.  I think an effort should be made to ensure that the maximum amount of work to be done on the roads should <Col N="1061" /> be done during the winter months so that all labour that can be secured can be made available for the tillage and turf production programme during the summer.</P>
    <P>If that is to be Government policy, it will be necessary to contact the local authorities immediately about it and to ensure that their finances are such as will enable them to undertake a fairly considerable amount of work on the roads in the early part of the year and divert a considerable amount of the labour to the other essential, productive work in the summer months.</P>
    <P>These are all points which require urgent and immediate attention and I think that this debate has served a useful purpose inasmuch as it has proved beyond a shadow of doubt that the charges that were made by the various Opposition Parties against the Government are absolutely without foundation. Anybody who listened to the speeches of various Opposition leaders would have been led to believe that the Government have been trying to create a scare in regard to the economic position of this country over the past couple of months.  But anybody who listened to the speech of the Tánaiste introducing this debate will certainly confirm my assertion that, instead of trying to create a scare, we are trying to create public confidence in our nation and in our policy to overcome all difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

The same note of confidence and of courage was contained in both of these addresses.  They were simply, as I said last week, intended to encourage the people to get down to the job of building up this nation and of making it economically secure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is concerned with a motion of no confidence by the Opposition in the present Government.  For that reason it is a debate which is of considerable importance to the country. As a result of this debate, it might be possible that a new Government would be elected by the Dáil and, if not by the Dáil, certainly by the people.  It is the right of the Opposition from time to time, by a motion such as this, to challenge the Government's right to continue in office when it feels that the affairs of the country are not in good hands. The motion which was tabled was put down by the Leader of the Opposition after he had given considerable thought to the present position obtaining in this country and to the consequences likely to flow from it.  The Opposition's motion asks that Dáil Éireann should decline to give a Second Reading to the Supplies and Services Bill because, in effect, it has no confidence in the Government seeking the powers contained in that Bill. The Supplies and Services Bill is a yearly Bill which entitles and empowers the Government to take action to conserve supplies, to maintain prices and, generally, to carry on the affairs of the country in the interests of the people.  We say that, in relation to these important functions, we have no confidence in the present Government &mdash;for three main reasons.  First of all, we say that, because of the White Paper issued by the Minister for Finance and because of other ministerial statements, the Government have attempted deliberately, within the past <Col N="1063" /> two months, to cause public uneasiness, public panic and public anxiety with regard to this country's economic and financial position.  We say also that the Government adopted this attitude deliberately, for political purposes, that they did it without foundation and that, accordingly, they are not entitled to the confidence of this House.</P>
    <P>Surely, if they appealed to the people they would find a similar answer awaiting them at the polls.  If the Government doubts my statement, they should dissolve the House and try to-morrow. Secondly, we say that, in relation to the economic problems facing our people, serious problems undoubtedly, relating to prices and generally, this Government has no policy, good, bad or indifferent.  Thirdly, we indict the Government for their deplorable conduct during the past six months in dealing with the problems which face our people.  It is on those three grounds that we ask the Deputies in this House, not constrained or tied by Party pledges or subject to the lash of the whip, to exercise their right as free men and to give, through the machinery of Dáil Éireann, a chance to the country to elect the Government that it wants.</P>

      <P>We would dearly like to see you try it.  We in opposition are appealing to Deputies who are voting on this important Bill.  If they consider the case which we make in favour of this motion to be a sound one and if they act as independent free-minded Deputies and support this motion, by doing so they will know that the only possible result is the dissolution of Dáil Éireann and an appeal to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening this debate the Tánaiste very naively suggested that the Opposition, <Col N="1064" /> in putting down this refusal to the Second Reading of this Bill, were doing something extreme.  He pointed out that it was a very extreme step to take to refuse the Government the powers set forth under this Bill and to withhold from them the power of fixing prices.  He conveniently forgot that he and his Party took an exactly similar course when this Bill was before the House this time 12 months.  In the autumn of 1950 the Supplies and Servises Bill was introduced here and was opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party, supported, of course, by Deputy Cogan. If the Fianna Fáil Party had their way last year they would have ensured by their votes that the then Government would not have the powers of controlling prices&mdash;the very same powers sought for in this Bill.  In opposing the Bill, the Opposition are taking no unusual or new step.  The only difference is that this time the Opposition have a case, whereas there was no case last year.</P>
    <P>I said that we were opposing the Bill on three grounds, the first being the deliberate campaign to cause panic amongst the people.  I do not want to go over much of the ground that has been covered in the debate so far with regard to the country's financial position, or its economic problems, but the public will realise that as a result of this debate, the Central Bank's Report and the Minister for Finance's White Paper a discussion has inevitably arisen concerning the country's financial position, its external assets and so on.  The Government, on their side, have suggested that for seven or eight months of this year the country has lived beyond its means, frittered and wasted away its external assets and done something which, if the country were an individual, could only end it in the bankruptcy court.</P>
    <P>We, on our side, have described that as being a moan and as being complete nonsense, so far as this country is concerned. We have taken the stand for better or worse&mdash;and we believe we are right&mdash;that Ireland is to-day sound, financially and economically, that she is one of the great creditor nations of the world and that she is certainly solvent and creditworthy.  Unfortunately <Col N="1065" /> the Government apparently do not share our views in that direction.</P>
    <P>I only wish that the Tánaiste, in relation to the speeches he made in September and October, as Tánaiste, was still the same Seán Lemass who spoke as the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition in his salad days, or at least in his more salad days, on the 6th March, 1948.  Then as Deputy-Leader of the Opposition, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, Deputy Lemass had this to say and it is reported under the banner heading: &ldquo;No need for austerity&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was neither in our budgetary position nor external trade balance any justification for imposing on our people a policy of austerity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;austerity in Britain had not been a policy desired by the British Government or people but was the unavoidable and unwanted consequences of depleted external resources&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let no Deputy interrupt me because Deputy Lemass went on to say further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Irish external resources had, on the contrary, been enormously expanded during the war and there was no particular level of external assets which could be regarded as sacrosanct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bold words, very courageous words on 6th March, 1948&mdash;&ldquo;no level of external assets that he would regard as sacred&rdquo;.  He pointed out that our assets were so swollen by the years of the war that it was the clear duty of the then Government to draw upon these external assets to give to our people the goods and the services they needed.  Deputy Davern might be interested to hear me finish the quotation. Deputy Lemass, having said that there was no level of external assets which could be regarded as sacrosanct, goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was no justification for forcing our people to do without goods or services which they needed and which could be purchased for sterling.  There was no need to cut down worth-while projects for development merely to maintain the <Col N="1066" /> external assets at their present level.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to make a demand</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in the interests of the country for men of courage and vision who would spend our external assets in the interests of our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the words of Deputy Lemass as Deputy-Leader of the Opposition, speaking, I am certain, with the support of the present Taoiseach, on 6th March, 1948.  What did he demand then?  That the Irish Government had a duty to its people to go to Britain and to take from Britain whatever credits we had there and to put those credits at work here at home to give to our people, as he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the services which they require and which could be bought for sterling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That being the view expressed by the Tánaiste, as Deputy Lemass three years ago, it is difficult to reconcile that view with the speeches which he and his colleagues have been making for the last three or four months.  The only possible way in which those two points of view can be understood is by the belief that one of them is insincere. Was the Tánaiste insincere in March, 1948, when he asked the Government to throw prudence and caution to the wind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I say it was an appeal to throw prudence and caution to the winds when the Tánaiste said in March, 1948, that there was no particular level of external assets that could be regarded as sacred.  Was that an in sincere view or was it an insincere view that was expressed by the <Col N="1067" /> Taoiseach in the Mansion House and the Minister for Finance in this House and elsewhere that, at all costs, we must preserve the level of our external assets?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance speaking in this House on the 18th July, 1951, as reported in Volume 126, column 1898&mdash; and I would ask the House to compare these two points of view&mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is a grave matter for reflection that our external assets have been reduced by £90,000,000 during the past three or four years, that a further reduction of £60,000,000 is in prospect this year and that only a small fraction of this total disinvestment is offset by an addition to our productive capacity...  Allowing for extern holdings in Ireland of non-nationals, our net external assets were estimated at £225,000,000 in 1949.  If the present rate of disinvestment continues, Ireland will, by 1954, have lost her creditor status.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are two divergent points of view.  One is sincere; one is not sincere.  It is interesting to follow out the views that have been expressed by different Ministers here before they tried a political trick last September and overplayed their hand.  The present Minister for Finance soon after the <i>Sunday Press</i> was born&mdash;the Taoiseach will remember that fateful month&mdash;got an itch in his writing hand and on November the 30th, 1949, we have an article under the heading: &ldquo;Diddlum-dandy or what Devaluation has done to your £.&rdquo;  The article is signed by &ldquo;Seán MacEntee, T.D., Minister for Finance 1932 to 1939.&rdquo;  Then Deputy MacEntee gave his views on the whole sterling position.  He had some interesting things to say.  I am sure the Department of Finance would have been horrified to read this particular article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Press</i> in November, 1949.  Deputy MacEntee referred to devaluation and to its effect on this country.  In his own inimitable way, he compared a country which devalues as &ldquo;nothing better than a shyster debtor,&rdquo; and he continues,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" />&ldquo;Only a fool, we know, would continue to entrust his savings to a bank which in respect of every £ he had previously deposited with it forced him to take the equivalent of only 14/-.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was what Deputy MacEntee had to say before he became Minister for Finance.  He commented on the fact that Britain, the country that held our sterling credits, in devaluing was paying us 14/- for every £, and he said that only a fool would continue to keep this money in a bank that did just that. I will not bore the House by reading the whole of this Diddlum-dandy article, in which he criticised what he called the Coalition Government&mdash; the inter-Party Government&mdash;for its financial policy in endeavouring to keep our money in Britain.  Referring to the then Government, he ends on this glorious note:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They are dooming the Irish people to go down with the British ship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, which is the sincere view?  Is it the view expressed by the present Minister for Finance, as Deputy MacEntee, in November, 1949, that by keeping our credits in Britain we were dooming our people to sink with the British ship or is it the view that was expressed by him as Minister for Finance on the 18th July of this year when he said that it was a grave matter that we had spent some £90,000,000 over four years?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these two views expressed by the present Tánaiste and by the present Minister for Finance while they were out of office in order to compare them with the views which they have expressed since assuming office because I believe that this whole campaign has been deliberately designed and carefully fashioned by these two Ministers for two purposes only, both of them being political purposes. The first purpose was to discredit the policy pursued by the inter-Party Government and the reputation of the previous Minister for Finance. The second purpose was to justify the introduction this session of a Supplementary Budget.  This campaign might have succeeded were it not that these <Col N="1069" /> two Ministers overplayed their hand. It was in this House, eventually, on the 7th November that the Tánaiste admitted failure and changed the views he had previously expressed with regard to the country's financial position. It would, perhaps, be helpful to follow the events which took place while this campaign was in full spate. On October 7th, 1951, the Tánaiste fired one of his first shots when he spoke at the annual dinner of the Professional and Service Organisation. His speech was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are as a people spending far more than we are earning.  The right solution is to increase production in agriculture and industry as rapidly as possible so that we can afford to keep up the public services we desire and the capital investment which we need.  That is a policy of work not by some sections or some individuals but by everybody...  We cannot expect to maintain the standard of living represented by an increase in the volume of imports which is now 60 per cent. above pre-war while our exports are actually less than pre-war. We cannot expect to be better off while working less or have lower prices with rising costs.  Saying these things may not be the recognised road to public popularity but somebody has to say them and responsibility rests on the members of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a gloomy picture, but the Tánaiste had a solution:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The nation has, therefore, either to face the cutting down of Government spending or the raising of the tax revenue.  Either course is unpleasant for any Government to contemplate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a serious statement, made by a responsible Minister.  In effect, he told business people, those running small shops, those trying to raise a family and to work for their living, that all of us were spending too much, that we could not afford to live at the rate at which we were living.  The Tánaiste's hosts at that annual dinner may perhaps overlook an invitation to him next year because he wiped away their business that particular night. <Col N="1070" /> He was not finished there, however. He went to the annual dinner of the Publicity Club of Ireland, and what he had to say there was reported in the morning papers of the 12th October, 1951.  Having referred again to the country's financial position, saying that the balance of external payments this year will amount to the intimidating total of £70,000,000, he continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Simple facts tell us what must be done.  We must reduce imports... This is a real crisis we are facing and it will not be easy for us to escape it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then another gentleman joined in the campaign&mdash;the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Government.  He spoke at some Fianna Fáil gathering in Cork and he was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 14th October, 1951, as follows&mdash;I think this shows part of the purpose behind the Government's campaign:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lynch said that recent statements by the Tánaiste had brought us to a realisation of the economic plight in which our country had been left by the Coalition Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People were grateful for this exposé of their true position.  Further on, Deputy Lynch said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The people prefer and expect their Government to keep them <i>au fait</i> with the real facts, no matter how distasteful to them, instead of empty references to three and a half years of unsurpassed prosperity the Coalition would have us believe we enjoyed during their period of office.</P>
    <P>If reckless dissipation of our external assets and of the people's savings is the price of one, two or three years of so-called prosperity without regard to our future stability, the Coalition are welcome to the kudos they hope to get out of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even without Deputy Lemass's disclosures everybody knew that the pursuit of such a policy would bring the country to economic ruin in a very short time.  The purpose of the campaign was becoming clearer.  It had its political side very clearly displayed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> There were other efforts also made in the month of October, all part and parcel of the same campaign.  It is obvious, for instance, that the Government's daily paper, the <i>Irish Press,</i> was enlisted to assist in the campaign. In an article in the <i>Sunday Press,</i> dated the 21st of October, 1951, entitled &ldquo;The Public Purse&rdquo;, the editorial writer&mdash;he may or may not be a Deputy of this House&mdash;says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recent disclosures of the critical state of the country's finances have come as a shock to the public, but to none so much as to those who had been led to believe that in recent years the nation was enjoying unparalleled prosperity.  The facts emerging to-day have smashed that illusion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, the purpose of this campaign was clear, because of the political unpopularity of the former Government to paint present Ministers as those who were following a difficult path with courage and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I will not bore Deputies with other quotations but the Tánaiste spoke again on October 22nd and he followed the same line.  Then we had the Report of the Central Bank.  I do not want to discuss that report in detail but it is at least amusing to find the reception it received from the country. The <i>Irish Press</i> had played an important part during the month of October in preparing the ground for the Report of the Central Bank.  The <i>Sunday Press</i> had published its editorial about &ldquo;The Public Purse&rdquo; and all the Press support for the Government was clearly preparing the Government for the report.  I know that it would have been difficult for the <i>Irish Press's</i> political masters, the present Government, to have been cross with the editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> when he received the report on October 24th with the famous editorial &ldquo;That Deficit.&rdquo;  After all, he was only doing what he thought he was supposed to do.  He was praising the Report of the Central Bank and he was chiding the Leader of the Opposition for daring to have said that the report was groundless.</P>
    <P>That editorial has been referred to <Col N="1072" /> in the House and I do not propose to refer to it in any detail again.  The writer of that editorial of the 24th October, 1951, was so consumed with enthusiasm for this Report of the Central Bank and so determined that he would carry out what he believed to be the policy of the Government that he even condemned the land project.</P>
    <P>He indicated that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon's &lsquo;land project&rsquo; under which as much as £500 an acre has been spent in reclaiming land which will scarcely yield an annual return of 1 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>is the type of public works condemned by the Central Bank Report.  At this stage, this country and its citizens were in for a dose of Fianna Fáil austerity.  The Tánaiste had left behind &mdash;far behind&mdash;the brave words that he had spoken on the 6th March, 1948. He had forgotten the appeals to courage and to vision that he made then and the whole atmosphere of crisis had been created.</P>
    <P>It was in that situation that this motion was tabled.  I do not think that anyone on any side of this House can have any real doubt as to what took place in Government circles after this motion of no confidence had been tabled by the Leader of the Opposition. The effect on the country was immediate.  Public opinion, which had been in some doubt up to that, immediately became strongly behind the Opposition.  The Tánaiste, particularly, found that he had started something which looked like sweeping himself and his Government from office.  Only a week could elapse between the tabling of the motion and its discussion in Dáil Éireann.  I have no doubt that during that week there was a great lot of comings and goings in Government Departments.  Perhaps there was an emergency meeting of the Cabinet Sub-Committee.  Perhaps the political chiefs were summoned there for their reaction.  Perhaps Deputies Cowan, Cogan and ffrench-O'Carroll were consulted, but whatever went on, there was only one way to get out of the difficulty.  The boldest and brassiest Minister had to be sent into the House to put a face on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce comes in here forgetting what he said about a crisis being there, forgetting all that had been said in the last months and calmly says: &ldquo;I am going to lead the opposition to the Central Bank Report.&rdquo;  That saved the Government for the day and it ensured for them in this division their majority, but from a national point of view do the Government consider what is taking place?  Do they not realise that, as a result of their speeches and that campaign, this country is gripped by one of the greatest business recessions ever experienced?  Do they not realise that, as a result of that campaign, small people engaged in legitimate business have become bankrupt? Do they not realise that such anxiety has been caused to investors generally that the reputation of the country has been seriously harmed?  There is very little use for the Tánaiste to come in here, as he did during the debate, to say that there was no restriction of bank credit.  Does the Tánaiste shake his head?</P>
    <P>In Volume 127, column 318 of the Dáil Reports, dated 7th November, 1951, the Minister is reported&mdash;this is one of the unchanged reports&mdash;as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The next thing I want to emphasise is that, so far as the figures available to the Government are concerned, they would indicate that there has been no restriction of bank credit.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>No restriction of bank credit in the country!  I do not know if the Minister, when he made that astounding <Col N="1074" /> statement, had forgotten the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The <i>Irish Press</i> may be very embarrassing in all this discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That article went on to say:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I am not saying that the Minister or any other Minister of <Col N="1075" /> the Government directly gave any advice to the banks to restrict credit. I do not propose to do what the Minister did when the Government changed in 1948&mdash;have questions asked here by ex-Ministers about restriction of credit. I want to point out to the Minister, however, that, as a result of speeches by him and by the Minister for Finance since last July, the banks felt it was necessary for them both to restrict credit and to call in credit.  Now that that period has passed, now that the Minister admits that this country is financially sound, now that he admits there is no crisis and now that it has been shown by Government admission that Deputy Costello was right all along the line, I am entitled to complain about the damage which has been caused to the country, to its business and to its credit, by the campaign carried on by the Minister.  There has been a serious restriction of credit. The Minister tried to deny it when introducing this Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The next thing I want to emphasise&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;he emphasised it all right&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;is that, so far as the figures available to the Government are concerned, they would indicate that there has been no restriction of bank credit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Tommyrot!  If the Minister had not been interrupted by Deputy Morrissey, that particular sentence would have been accepted by the tame cattle behind him as being the view of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows the folly of interruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows the value. The public generally in relation to this <Col N="1076" /> matter have had a dose of financial discussion in the past three or four weeks, and indeed for some months before, and when, before the House met, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister were engaged in a controversy in speeches they were making, there was considerable doubt as to which of them was right.  I remember that the <i>Irish Times</i> ran a series of articles: &ldquo;Which man is right&mdash;Lemass or Costello?&rdquo;, and apparently the Minister for Finance now complains that the <i>Irish Times</i> thinks that perhaps, after all, Deputy Costello might have been right.</P>
      <P>Now that it is all over, the country appreciates the action taken by the Leader of the Opposition in saving the country from quite an uncalled-for policy of restriction by the present Government.  We have at least ensured that our capital development programme will be continued; we have at least ensured, within certain limits which will be discussed later, that the broad programme of rebuilding this country will not be interfered with by the petty politicians who are for the time being the Government of this country.  We have not, of course, got from the Government in this debate any very clear statement as to the manner in which these schemes will be financed.  The Minister wants taxation and maybe he will win the day.  That is as much as I want to say about the White Paper and the Central Bank's Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to this campaign carried on by the Government, there was a very foul campaign carried on by the Minister for Finance, who time and time again stated deliberately, here and outside, that the last Budget was introduced by the former Minister for the deliberate purpose of budgeting for a deficit and that the State this year would not have enough money available to pay ordinary Exchequer needs.  That is completely without foundation and it is a mean effort by the Minister for Finance, who does not believe in the slightest in it.  If he believed that, the country is entitled to know why, when he became Minister for Finance within six weeks of the Budget being introduced, he has not yet introduced a <Col N="1077" /> supplementary Budget.  If, as the Taoiseach said the other day, the country would be £10,000,000 short this year, why has a supplementary Budget not been introduced?</P>
    <P>Ordinary prudence, the duty of a trustee, the ordinary obligation imposed upon any Government if they believe that kind of talk, would dictate that course.  No supplementary Budget has been introduced and none will, and the country is entitled to draw an inference from that.  We know well that that campaign is a mean political campaign, without foundation, deliberately indulged in by a politician. We know well that the former Minister did his duty as a trustee of the people in relation to financial matters and that he left behind him a sound policy and a sound Budget and, above all, a buoyant revenue.</P>

      <P>Now, may I say a few words about prices?  In relation to this debate last year, I mentioned that the Fianna Fáil Party opposed and divided on this Bill.  They sought to deprive the Government of the powers in this Bill, saying: &ldquo;Look at the prices.&rdquo;  Every Fianna Fáil Deputy here last year for four long weeks spluttered and stuttered about the burden of prices.  There was a wail from every one of them in regard to price increases. The whole effort was directed at depriving the Government of the people's confidence in relation to its price-control policy.  I have no doubt that the defeat of the Government on the financial side of this debate had its compensation.  I have no doubt the Tánaiste said: &ldquo;Well, anyway, they are not talking about prices this year.&rdquo; He is making a mistake.  He will hear a lot about prices&mdash;and not in a dishonest sort of way such as we had it last year.  He is not going to hear it from us as we had it from them, that if they were in office none of these price increases would take place.  We are going to express our resentment&mdash;I am glad the Taoiseach is in the House&mdash; against a political trick that this Government and its allies have played on the people, endeavouring to convince <Col N="1078" /> them during the last election that if only the political fortune wheel would turn, if only they might be returned to office, then all those price difficulties would disappear.  That is what we resent and that is what we are going to complain about here in this debate.</P>
      <P>Do not let the Taoiseach think that his followers, his Ministers and his Deputies, did not indulge in that type of campaign during the general election. If he thought that, it would indeed be very foolish.  Deputy Vivion de Valera spent some time during the general election on the question of price control.  He is reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 8th May, 1951, speaking at Gardiner's Place in his constituency, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Major de Valera claimed that the rise in the cost of living had got out of control.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It had got out of control on the 8th May, 1951.  Those words were followed by the present Minister for Finance on the 16th May, 1951, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of that date in the following way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Norton had said that their first task would be to enact legislation to control prices and what was said by the Party leaders was reechoed by the lieutenants; but in their wild extravagance they were letting the cost of living play the devil and all with us.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielBourke" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking not about the present, but about the month of May of this year.  The cost of living then was &ldquo;playing the devil and all with us&rdquo;.  Then, on the same date, a Fianna Fáil candidate, whose words, apparently, were not accepted by the electorate, as he was not elected, was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> as saying this&mdash;and this is to the women of Dublin:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The housewives of Dublin would have an opportunity on May 30th to strike a blow against those who produced a Government black market in essential foodstuffs.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Then there is a discussion on the different price increases.  All are asked to go out on the 30th May and strike a <Col N="1079" /> blow for themselves.  Then, on the 19th May, the present Tánaiste was let loose on Dublin City.  This is to a certain extent an important speech, as it shows the complete cynical disregard of honour by certain members of the present Government.  This speech of the Tánaiste, published in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 19th May, 1951, is devoted almost entirely to the question of prices and price control:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Seán Lemass, speaking at Townsend Street, Dublin, last night, said that Fianna Fáil could not promise that all difficulties would disappear if a Fianna Fáil Government was elected or that all prices would come tumbling down, but it would be able to operate an intelligent and consistent policy to solve these problems.  That was what a Coalition Government could never do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was the Tánaiste, a few days before the poll, saying to the women of Dublin: &ldquo;We do not promise you that all prices will come tumbling down,&rdquo; and the poor people were supposed to look up with wonder at Deputy Lemass and say: &ldquo;Well, that means perhaps the price of the pint will not come tumbling down, but everything else will.&rdquo;  That was an insincere speech, because it tended to deceive.  The Tánaiste went on to promise that Fianna Fáil would be able to operate an intelligent and consistent policy to solve these problems, the problems of prices.  And that was a policy &ldquo;which a Coalition Government could never put into operation&rdquo;.  That was a huge confidence trick being played by the present Tánaiste on his hearers at Townsend Street, as reported on the 16th May of this year.</P>
    <P>The story does not end there.  Deputy Vivion de Valera again becomes active. As reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 23rd May, 1951, Deputy de Valera addressed a meeting&mdash;and the report is composed entirely of details of the Deputy's complaints with regard to prices.  Different price increases are dealt with in detail and then here is the assurance given by Deputy de Valera to his hearers in Abbey Street.  Under the heading &ldquo;Prices&rdquo;, here is what Fianna Fáil was going to do:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" />&ldquo;Coupled with the drive to increase production and secure supplies, Fianna Fáil would exercise a practical price control to prevent exploitation of scarcity conditions and protect the housewife as far as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the view of the different wives in Deputy de Valera's constituency now, but I am certain that they want no more of Fianna Fáil's protection.</P>
    <P>Other speeches were made at the same time, but the whole campaign in the election, and for months before it, was directed to convince the people of this country that only under Fianna Fáil would there be effective price control and, while all prices would not come tumbling down, prices would undoubtedly be reduced.  We know, and those who indulged in that campaign knew also, that it was dishonest, cynical and insincere to make that type of speech and that it was done for shrewd political motives in order to attract in large voting centres, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities votes which Fianna Fáil otherwise would not have taken.  There is no doubt that, in Dublin City and in Cork, their campaign succeeded.  They won thousands and thousands of votes here in the City of Dublin because of their complaints about price increases and because of the assurance inherent in their speeches that, if only they were returned to office, everything would be cured and prices would not be increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, who has left the House, published an advertisement in his own constituency specifying the details of the reductions he was going to introduce.  In the City of Cork the Fianna Fáil organisation published an advertisement quoting in detail the price reductions they were going to effect.  Every voter, on the morning of the election, saw a Fianna Fáil advertisement complaining about price increases, referring in detail to the different price increases and carrying the implied message that, if the people changed their political beliefs and supported Fianna Fáil, everything would be perfect.</P>
    <P>It is with that background in relation <Col N="1081" /> to this important Bill, and by reason of the events that have taken place since last June, that we in the Opposition make our complaint and lodge our protest, on behalf of the people of the country.  We do not say that the fault lies with the present Government; we do not say that had we been in office we could have controlled many of the increases which have taken place, but we do complain of the hoax which was played on the gullible electorate of this and other cities throughout the country and we do make particular reference to certain price increases which were deliberately brought about by actual Government policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, as Deputy MacEntee, talked about the price of bacon and meat in the speech to which I referred which he made on the 16th May, 1951, and which was published in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  Since the change of Government the present Fianna Fáil-Browne-Cowan-Cogan coalition have removed the control from bacon and meat.  In relation to bacon the result has been a drop in the price of pigs to the farmers of 25/- a cwt. and an increase by 25/- a cwt. in the price of bacon.  That is a result brought about by direct Government policy.  Those who want to buy rashers in this country to-day or a pork chop or any other item produced by the bacon industry are entitled to ask if the price they have to pay is part of &ldquo;the intelligent and consistent policy in relation to price control&rdquo; which the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised in his speech on the 19th May.</P>
    <P>Meat has been decontrolled and in relation to that there is one thing I would like to say.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reference to meat prices, tried a rather despicable political trick.  He spoke here in this House on the 7th November, 1951, in relation to meat prices and purported to deal with an action of his immediate predecessor, my father.  He spoke when he knew that the former Minister was ill in hospital and unable to controvert or deny his assertions. He proceeded to tell a pack of garbled falsehoods concerning the events which led up to the eventual decontrol of meat.  It is not always easy to catch up <Col N="1082" /> on a falsehood; it is not always easy to nail a lie and I know that any words of mine will certainly not have the same significance as the words of the Minister, but I have no doubt that an opportunity will be given to the man he was endeavouring to malign to deal far more adequately than I could with that particular effort of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The facts are that before the change of Government the Prices Advisory Body had recommended, with relation to meat prices, that an increase of 3d. per lb. should be allowed.  The Minister said no.  He did not consider that that price increase was one which should be passed on to the consumer, but realising that a recommendation from the Prices Advisory Body was one which must carry considerable weight the former Minister pursued the possibility&mdash;unfounded, apparently &mdash;of decontrolling hides to see whether a smaller price increase on meat could be allowed in consideration of an easing of the situation elsewhere.  It was when that review was going on that a summons was taken and likely to be brought against a butcher.  The Minister pointed out that in any event a price increase would have to be allowed and that it would be invidious if a butcher were prosecuted for selling at a particular price when in all probability a price increase would be granted.  The prosecution was being brought in respect of a price charged which was less than that recommended by the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>It is from those innocent facts that the Tánaiste deliberately and maliciously, for political purposes, endeavours to suggest some sort of frame-up with regard to meat prices.  I know well that he would not have dared to have tried to do it if the person in question were sitting in the Front Bench listening to him.  It is certainly unbecoming to the good name of this House that Ministers should avail of a mean opportunity of that kind to cause harm to the reputation of others.  I only trust that the Tánaiste will remain in the House, even for ten minutes, perhaps in two or three months time when the matter can be more adequately dealt with.</P>
    <P>That is the position which we find in relation to prices to-day.  In the <Col N="1083" /> last six months there has been a consistent upward trend in the price of practically every commodity, some of it caused by circumstances outside the control of the Government, some caused by direct Government policy, by the determination of this Government to buttress its support in this House by buying political support in the way of increased prices.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the justice or where the honour lies for Deputies who used&mdash;misused&mdash;their throats in this city with speeches about the price of butter and who, calmly, in a month's time, themselves increased the price of butter.  Where is the honour or where is the justice in that?  I only hope that the possibility may be within our reach of having those individuals before the bar of public opinion.</P>
    <P>In other respects also they have continued this political hoax on the people of this country.  I do not know what evidence of policy they have shown in the last six months.  If we had had in power in the last six months a Government of get-rich-quick businessmen, I do not believe that prices could be any higher than they are now.</P>
    <P>When the Government assumed office six months ago, the Tánaiste referred to the need for a more realistic price level in the country.  I do not know what he meant by that but, so far as the people are concerned, it has, apparently, entailed paying more and more for everything they have to buy.  Now, when we find that position upon us, we have the Minister for Finance coming forward and saying: &ldquo;You are spending too much.&rdquo;  Of course, we are spending too much.  Of course, the ordinary worker's housewife is spending too much.  She spends too much by reason of increases in prices. It is little consolation, with price increases taking place, to be told: &ldquo;You now have to look forward to perhaps smaller wages&mdash;if the Central Bank's Report were put into operation&mdash;less work, no rationing of commodities and perhaps further price increases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We, the Opposition, in these circumstances, are entitled to demand from the Government now, even though they have perhaps ensured their win in this <Col N="1084" /> debate by dubious methods, some clear expression of their policy in relation to price control, in relation to capital development and the various other matters which affect the country.  If we do not get that clear indication, we can only hope that sooner or later, and I hope it will be sooner, the friendship which was fashioned on 13th June last, between Deputy Cowan and the present Taoiseach, between Deputy Cogan and the present Minister for Local Government, and with Deputy Flynn, now back in the ranks of Fianna Fáil, may strain and that an opportunity will be given to Deputy Cowan's constituents, to Deputy Cogan's constituents, to the ordinary people of this country, themselves next time to elect a Government for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago Deputy Cowan came into this House, if you please, with a motion of no confidence in Ireland's Government because prices were rising.  Twelve months ago Deputy Cowan tabled that motion in this House, asking the Dáil to declare that because of the level of prices then obtaining it had no confidence in Ireland's Government.  There he is sitting to-day supporting a Government as a result of whose policy there is a price increase to an extent never before experienced.  There is not a whimper out of him.  What is the justification for that kind of conduct, and where is the motion of no confidence now?  Will Deputy Cowan be man enough or sincere enough or genuine enough to say: &ldquo;If I was right about price increases 12 months ago, I am doubly right now&rdquo;?  Will he be man enough and sincere enough to join with the Opposition in ensuring the defeat of this Government in this debate, in giving to the people an opportunity of electing a Government they desire?</P>
    <P>No doubt, Deputy Cowan has made his bed and will sleep in that bed until somebody overturns the mattress; but the ordinary people are not fools, they cannot forget the burning questions that were before them last June&mdash;a mother and child health scheme, so eminent in its importance that even Governments must fall to have it put into operation&mdash;now forgotten by Deputy Dr. Noel Browne.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Deputy will agree that the only way in which there can be public confidence is by soundly managing the nation's affairs. That is what we have been elected to do.  It has been regarded as good tactics, apparently, by the Opposition to try to divert the attention of Deputies and the public attention generally from important basic facts and to try to pretend that in putting these basic facts before the people we are playing some mean political game.  A number of statistics have been bandied about in this House.  It seems to me that the basic figures which sum up all the others are relatively few and can be easily understood.  When the Budget was introduced and the Estimates for this year presented, for the non-capital services a sum of £72.45 million was envisaged as the sum required.  It appears now that before the financial year ends Supplementary Estimates amounting to between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000 will have to be introduced. Full provision has not been made for these Estimates.  It is only to the extent of £1,500,000 that provision has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the Department of Finance to go carefully through the <Col N="1086" /> Estimates and let me know, on the one hand, what savings are likely to be effected in the services for which provision has been made and, on the other hand, what is the likely increase of revenue over the sum that was expected at the Budget time.  The figures that have been given to me are: that there is a saving hoped for, at present, of about £1,500,000, and that it is possible that there will be an increase on the estimated revenue of about £2,000,000.  So that, if you take the £1,500,000 for which provision was made, the £1,500,000 in savings and the £2,000,000 in possible increased revenue, there may be £5,000,000 as a set-off to the sum of between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000&mdash; for the moment we will take round figures and say as a set-off to the £10,000,000 gross, in Supplementary Estimates.  That means&mdash;there is no way of getting round it&mdash;that there is £5,000,000 of a deficiency for non-capital services.  That is admitted. Ordinarily provision would have to be made for that by way of taxation, I take it.  It is agreed that these are non-capital services.  So that, at the end of this year, if this estimate is right, we shall find that we have been short in the provision which we have been making to the extent of close on £5,000,000.  Is that a disputed fact or is it not?  That is on the non-capital side.</P>
    <P>Let us come now to the capital side. For the capital services, there was originally envisaged an expenditure of £29.43 million.  To meet that there was unexpended of the American Loan Counterpart Fund a sum of about £24,000,000.  I think the Minister for Finance indicated at the time that the difference of £5,000,000 would have to be made up by borrowing.  He regarded it as capital expenditure which would justify borrowing.  But there was £5,000,000 short there.  In addition, there is £4,000,000 of new capital expenditure to be met.  Therefore, in addition to that for which provision is made&mdash;we have £5,000,000 short, but I am not talking about that at the moment; that will be possibly met by certain unexpenditure on capital account&mdash;there is this £4,000,000 additional capital expenditure, in addition <Col N="1087" /> to the £5,000,000 which I have been speaking about on the non-capital side.  That is £9,000,000 on this year's running which will have to be met, assuming that at the end of the year these calculations are found to be correct.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is possible for anybody to dispute calculations which are made by the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance.  But what better expert advice can we in this House get than the advice of the people who have had a long experience in the accounting of public money?  It is a commonplace for Deputies to abuse the Department of Finance.  Over a long period of years I have had my own disputes with the Department of Finance&mdash;I am sure every Government will.  But I must say this, as far as the officers of the Department of Finance are concerned, that my chief complaint against them is that they have been trying to be better than the Government. But in their anxiety to serve the public weal, they have been constantly at pains, on every occasion on which expenditure is being contemplated for which the means are not obvious, to make that fact clear to the Government.  I think it is very good that they should do so.  Surely no Government wants to hide its head in the sand and to proceed in a direction in which there are dangers, if these dangers can be pointed out to them.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Department of Finance to point out to the Minister for Finance, if he does not see it himself, and, through him, to point out to the Government the direction in which they are going.  It is for the Government then, knowing all the facts which have been brought out by the Department of Finance, to take their line and to choose their policy in their wisdom even though it may not be in accord with the view of the Department of Finance.  I am sure that has been done by successive Governments. On more than one occasion, I think, we did it because we believed that our judgment of the public weal was superior to the judgment of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I often thought that that Department <Col N="1088" /> was inclined to think too narrowly in relation to the financial side and did not take fully into account other considerations which must be taken cognisance of by any Government that thinks upon the public weal as a whole.  I think that is the correct attitude for any Government to adopt. Surely, then, Deputies ought not to try to ride away on a pretence and act as if the Department of Finance and its officials were the enemies of the public.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has given us these figures in the same way in which the Central Statistics Office would give us estimates in relation to a variety of things in connection with which we might be anxious to have figures.  Some time ago, I gave some figures which were given to me by the Central Statistics Office.  I wanted to know the truth and I wanted to get the truth as nearly as it could be estimated. Until the end of the year we have to deal mainly with estimates.  At various times and over various periods we have to deal with estimates.  When the Central Statistics Office gives me estimates, I know that they are estimates prepared by people who have no cause to serve except the cause of truth, and who are independent in the sense that no Government that I know of has ever asked the director of that office to supply figures to prove a specific case.</P>
    <P>Possibly, the figures having been supplied, the compilers of them may be asked the basis on which they are calculated. They may be asked if the basis is a sound one.  They may be asked what the actual basis is.  Surely nobody would suggest that the Director of the Central Statistics Office, or his staff, would cook figures to prove some case in favour of one side or another.</P>
    <P>We have built up at some expense this Central Statistics Office.  We believe such an office serves the public interest.  These figures are important to us.  They help us to judge the past.  They give us an idea of past trends.  They help us to understand present trends and to take such action as the trends may indicate.  Let us not suggest, therefore, that these figures are given by that office simply to serve <Col N="1089" /> some Government's political viewpoint or to prove some particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the White Paper later.  I am dealing incidentally with the Central Statistics Office because the figures which were furnished to me by that office in relation to emigration were questioned in somewhat the same way as those in the White Paper have been questioned.</P>
      <P>Let me pass on now to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is an independent body, deliberately set up with independent powers for good public reasons.  Some Deputies may think there should be different statutory provisions governing that body.  They can hold that view if they like.  These matters can be debated; but, as long as the Central Bank acts under the statute under which it was established, it is doing its duty and no more than its duty.  The recent report which it issued is, in my view, in accordance with the statute under which the bank was established.  We may not agree with the bank's views.  Here and there we may even question its figures.  Let us question the views and the figures, but do not let us suggest that the directors of the Central Bank are the tools of the Government, or anything of that kind, or a body of irresponsible people who have no interest whatsoever in the public good.</P>
      <P>The bank is not directly charged with guarding the public welfare as we are here.  But it has been given certain statutory duties and certain statutory powers and, so long as it performs those duties and exercises those powers in accordance with the statute, we have no real cause to complain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank was set up with two main objectives: one, to safeguard our currency and the integrity of our currency and, secondly, to ensure that, in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim should be the welfare of the people as a whole.  The Central Bank is entitled to collect data and to publish reports.  It is entitled to publish the <Col N="1090" /> data it collects either in the form of a report or otherwise.  All the Central Bank has done in its reports from time to time is to take the data available in the public accounts in relation to public finance and analyse those data from the financial point of view.  It has indicated the trends which the accounts show.  It has made certain suggestions from time to time.  It has given advice as to what might be done and it has issued warnings with regard to the dangers to be apprehended.  That has been done in this report as it has been done in previous reports.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not fair to that body to suggest that the members of it are the tools of the Government and that they produce these reports because the Government want them.  Neither is it right to think that the Government&mdash; remember, the Central Bank is an independent body&mdash;have any responsibility for the report.  The report is the report of the Central Bank.  It is a public document.  It is intended to give information to the public from the point of view of the Governor and Board of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment the constitution of the Central Bank.  The governor is an experienced public servant who had formerly been secretary of the Department of Finance.  The present secretary of the Department of Finance is a member of the board. He also is a member because of his close acquaintance with the financial activities of the State.  That is the reason why he was made a member of the board.  I am not sure if he was a member of the Currency Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>He was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Currency Commission was established in 1927, and it was the then Government who made the secretary of the Department of Finance a member of the Currency Commission, for the very good reason that it is desirable that there should be on such a body someone who is in close touch with public activities in regard to finance.  Who are the others? There are three directors representing the commercial banks.  If you examine their names, you will see at once that <Col N="1091" /> they are not simply bank directors or men solely associated with purely banking activities.  They are men who have close contact with the commercial and business life of the country, manufacturing and commercial.  I do not think you would say that these men would have any special leanings towards one type of Government or another.  They were put on because, first of all, in financial matters the Central Bank, obviously, ought to have some association with the commercial banks, and, even though they were put on from that point of view, they are men of very wide knowledge of the commercial and business life of this country.</P>
      <P>Next, you have two men whom you might call professional economists. One of them was a public servant.  He was originally, I think, a Professor of Economics.  He entered the public service and, for a period, was on the Fiscal Inquiry Commission.  He, also, both from the theoretical and practical point of view, is a man with a wide knowledge of business affairs, manufacturing and commercial.  Then you have two other directors.  One was put on as a representative of organised labour&mdash;or, rather, as a man who had wide knowledge of organised labour&mdash; and another is a representative of the farming industry.  So, if you look at the personnel and see the qualifications of the members, you will see that the Board of the Central Bank is not, in any narrow sense, merely a financial or banking board, but that it is broadly representative of the various interests affected by finance and is a body whose views deserve consideration.  We need not necessarily accept those views, but, again, let us not pretend that they can be brushed aside as of no consequence whatever.</P>
      <P>It is true that we are not compelled to accept the views of the Central Bank Board or to adopt the measures which they suggest as the best measures to meet a situation, but if we are wise, when we are choosing the line we are going to take ourselves, we will take careful note of what they say, and, if we decide to depart from the suggestions which they make, we should be able to give good reasons for doing so.  That is common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> A previous speaker said that, on some occasion, the Tánaiste had said that we should throw prudence and caution to the winds.  I am perfectly certain that the Tánaiste never made such a wild statement as that, because any person who throws prudence and caution to the winds is depriving himself of the power of directing his course intelligently.  You cannot throw prudence and caution to the winds, if you want to choose your course properly.  A Government will take note of the suggestions even of their political opponents.  You will take note of objections to the course you have in mind, and, if you are acting rationally, it is only when you have balanced your own reasons and views with those of the opposite side that you will finally decide your line of action.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the Department of Finance, the Central Statistics Office and the Central Bank, because, in my opinion, there have been most unfair attacks or what appeared to be attacks upon them.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there has been a very big change here on this side of the House with regard to our general policy.  I will leave that over for the moment, and hope to come back to it before I finish.  I will only say at this stage that it is not true, and that if there is one thing that is evident it is that our Party as a Party, and our organisation as an organisation, has been consistent in its national outlook and in the views it took right through, with regard to the welfare of the nation.</P>
    <P>But let me come down to the narrow question of accounts.  I have pointed out, with regard to the Exchequer accounts, that we estimate that there will be a shortage of cash on the non-capital side this year of roughly £5,000,000, that there is £4,000,000 additional on the capital side for which no provision was made and that the balance of the American Loan Counterpart Fund was at the beginning of the year £5,000,000 short of the £29,000,000 odd which was then estimated for capital expenditure.  I think it is right to say that that is a position which cannot be allowed to continue, <Col N="1093" /> and that we will have to make up our minds that, if we want Government services, we must make provision for these services.  I am talking now of the non-capital side.  We must make provision for them by getting the equivalent revenue.  At the present stage, unless there is some abnormal buoyancy which the Department of Finance cannot anticipate, that will mean that, in the coming year, we will have to face additional taxation.  Now, taxation is not a pleasant thing, but any Government that expect confidence in their conduct of affairs must make up their mind that, if they are to be the instrument for rendering to the community services which the community demands, then they must tell the community: &ldquo;If these demands of yours are to be met, you will have to supply the means of meeting them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position with regard to the Exchequer accounts.  Let us look now at the broad position as revealed by the community accounts.  The most important of these accounts is the balance of payments accounts.  If we look at the balance of payments over a period of years we will note at the start that, during the war, because we were not able to get the goods and services that we would get in normal times in return for our exports, we built up, we increased, our external credits&mdash;because that is what it really means.  We built up our external credits by the amount of about £160,000,000.  It was a very substantial addition to our external assets or credits.</P>
    <P>It was said very often during that period that these credits, being external, were not quite secured, and that there were risks in connection with them.  We knew quite well that there are certain risks in connection with credits which you have outside, and that, for one reason or another, dependent upon action over which you may not have control, you may not get full value for these credits when you try to realise them.  Now that is undoubtedly an important and proper consideration to keep in mind.  You have to ask yourself, what are the alternatives?  During the war, however, there was certainly no alternative to allowing these credits to increase, <Col N="1094" /> because it was not possible to get such goods and services as we would normally require in exchange for our exports.  The result was that these credits increased by £160,000,000.</P>
    <P>What has happened since the last war?  The first year in which we had any improvement in the position regarding supplies after the war was about the last year we were in office&mdash; 1947.  There were a number of items which we badly needed at that time, as a result of the hold-up during the war years.  The result was that we had to call upon £30,000,000 of our external assets, in addition to what we got in exchange for our goods and services. That was necessary in order to supply deficiencies in raw materials and to provide replacements of equipment. Thus we used £30,000,000 of the £160,00,000.  The next year we used £20,000,000 and the next year, 1949, £10,000,000.  That was a good trend, as I hope I shall be able to show.  It was a trend in the right direction.</P>
    <P>So far, I have accounted for £60,000,000 of the £160,000,000.  The following year, 1950, we used a further £30,000,000, and this year the estimate that has been given is £70,000,000 or £69,000,000.  I suggest that we should not consider whether it is £70,000,000, £69,000,000 or even the £50,000,000 which the Leader of the Opposition thinks would be the amount.  What we should concentrate on is that these amounts are increasing and that, in a very short time, at the present rate of diminution, our net external assets will disappear and we will no longer be a creditor country.  It is a trend, as I said a couple of days ago, which is important and it is a trend that we must try to stop.</P>
    <P>When I mention £70,000,000, I am not able to go further than the estimates that have been given to me.  I cannot tell you whether we will use £69,000,000 of our external assets this year, or £70,000,000.  I can only give you what is in the estimate.  If these estimates are given to us in this House as being the best we can get, we will have to regard them as the best we can get unless it can be shown they are wrong.  Even taking £50,000,000, we used £10,000,000 in 1949, £30,000,000 <Col N="1095" /> in 1950, and we were going to use £50,000,000 in 1951.</P>
    <P>If we were able to show that this expenditure from our external assets represented a capital development of a productive kind in this country, we could be more complacent, to a certain extent, about our position.  However, we cannot be complacent.  It is not true to say that our disinvestment abroad is offset by equivalent production of capital assets at home.  Taking the year 1950, analyses of our imports do not go to prove any such contention.</P>
    <P>As a normal community with normal progress we should, in addition to the amount that we require for consumption, be able to produce in savings enough for normal capital development. Any country that is not able to do that cannot regard itself as being in a really sound position.  Taking the figures for 1950 into account, one cannot claim, on the basis of them, that we are in a sound position or in a position that should be allowed to continue. The present trend has to be arrested, or ultimately we will come to the end of our resources.</P>
    <P>I will quote for a moment from <i>The Sayings of Poor Richard.</i>  Poor Richard was none other than Benjamin Franklin&mdash;a famous statesman, a wise philosopher and a wise man.  I remember one of his sayings very well.  It ran, very simply, like this: &ldquo;Always taking out of the meal-tub, and never putting in, soon comes to the bottom.&rdquo;  If we are going to take out constantly of our external assets, which produce a handsome sum annually for us&mdash;a very handsome sum&mdash;and if we are not able to show that we are saving here at home and that we are putting these savings into productive enterprises, we will get to the end of the meal-tub too, and I suggest that we would get to the end of it in a fairly short time if the rate at which we have been going were to be continued over any considerable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of my speech, I will be quite ready to discuss any points on which there is disagreement, if the Chair will so permit.</P>
      <P>Let me point out the things that ought to be the concern of every member of this House.  There is a political stunt afoot by the Opposition to try to divert public attention.  I have always had a strong belief in the possibilities which we have in this country.  I have the same belief in them at the moment. But we must act prudently and wisely unless we are to lose the opportunities we have got.  I do not want the people who will be born in five or ten years' time to be in any worse position than we find ourselves in to-day.  It is to save them and to ensure that this country is in a reasonably good position, not merely for the moment but for all time, that we should strive.  That is the consideration that we must bear in mind.</P>
      <P>Every public representative ought to be equally interested in that matter. I do not think that they ought to allow any preconceived notions to prevent them from accepting the arguments which I am putting forward. If there is any flaw in my arguments, let us hear about it.  On the basis of the estimates available to us, I say that our external assets had increased by £160,000,000 at the end of the war. If the estimates be correct, we will soon have exhausted whatever was added by compulsory savings during the war years.  Compulsory savings, by their very nature, are savings that we do not like.  But if you have, incidentally, gained something by being forced to take a line of action which you do not like, surely you are not going to be foolish enough to add to the unpleasantness of taking that line of action the further disadvantages of losing what you have incidentally gained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was bad enough that we should have been compelled to accept certain undesirable privations during the war years, but, having been so compelled, <Col N="1097" /> that we should waste whatever advantage accrued to us&mdash;the advantage that we gained these credits which entitled us to claim goods and services from the sterling area&mdash;is simply ridiculous.</P>
    <P>There will be a difference of opinion as to whether the advantage was wasted or not.  The Opposition will hold that it was not wasted.  I am only stating what we have and what we have lost.  We certainly have lost capital which would have been useful in other ways.  To the extent to which it has been wasted, we have lost it, and we have lost the yearly revenue from that capital which gave us goods and services.  We did not export any further goods, nor had we to give any new services, to get the dividend that came from this sum of money.</P>
    <P>However, there is a balance still left.  It is my view and the view of my colleagues in the Government, and I submit it ought to be the view of every member of this House, that inasmuch as these assets put us in the position of being able to make, whenever necessary, claims on the sterling area, we ought to be careful about dissipating these particular claims. They can be very valuable.  Recently, I pointed out Britain's present position, in which she has to ration her people severely in the matter of food and in which she has to prevent her own people from buying goods which they produce in order that these things &mdash;motor cars and other goods&mdash;may be available for export so that she can buy other necessities.  One can hardly imagine Britain which, before the first world war, was a great industrial and creditor nation, getting into such a position that she would not be able to buy sufficient meat for her own people or that they would not be able to get for their own use the motor cars and other goods that they were producing. But we know that that is her position to-day, and we know that that is a reflection of the fact that during two world wars Britain has sacrificed so much of her external assets, credits and claims on other countries that, in order to meet her necessities to-day, she must provide for exports and deny her people imports to the extent that we all know of.  We do not want our people to get into that position if we can <Col N="1098" /> avoid it.  It is our duty to see that, as far as we can prevent it by any action of ours, that will not happen.</P>
    <P>As far as borrowing is concerned, if you get the figures you will find that there was more public borrowing in the last three years than there was in the whole of the time that a Fianna Fáil Government were previously in office.  We were in office from 1932 until the spring of 1948.  If you take the public loan issues during that period and examine the use made of them, you will see that £10,000,000 was used to settle a claim for £100,000,000 which was pressed on this country, and there was some loan redemption during that time.</P>
    <P>In addition to this diminution of our sterling assets that I have spoken of, we have borrowed more in the three years of the last Government's Administration than the previous Fianna Fáil Government had done in 16 years, although those 16 years covered the period of a world war.  In addition, we must take into account that, in the period from 1948 to 1951, an external loan of £40,000,000 was raised.  External loans are to be distinguished from internal loans in this: taking the community as a whole, internal loans simply change the internal distribution of wealth within the country, but, when you incur external loans, these external loans are a debt on our community as a whole to a foreign community.  They will have to be met in capital and whatever interest charges there may be will have to be met either by the diminution of our external assets, if they are in any way convertible, or by exporting goods or services to an equivalent amount.</P>
    <P>Looking at that period of three years, seeing the diminution of our external assets over the period, and seeing the relatively high borrowings during that period, we realise that we are going on a road on which we cannot continue to go without ultimately coming to the wall.  It is to apprise the people of that and, in the first instance, to apprise the Dáil of that, that the White Paper on the trend of external trade and payments has been published, and that statements have <Col N="1099" /> been made by Ministers, either in this debate or in anticipation of such a discussion of the position.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Ministers have changed their position.  It is an old dodge, which has been used many times and of which I have complained before now, to pretend that your opponent is holding a position that he does not, in fact, occupy.  Then the guns are turned on that position, and when it is found that he is not there, it is said that he was driven out of it.  That is an old dodge, as old as politics.  To my knowledge, it has been used against us many a time over the last 20 or 30 years that I have had anything to do with public life.  It has become so old that I do not think that anyone ought seriously to try it now.</P>
    <P>The point that has been made by Ministers is that there is a situation this year which, from the Exchequer point of view, is difficult, and which, if it is to continue into next year, will be more difficult.  We must face up to it with regard to our external assets. It is a situation which indicates quite clearly that we are not saving as much as we should, that we are spending in consumption what ought to be put aside for the capital development which is essential if we are to progress.  As far as I understand it, that is what the Ministers have been pointing out. They have been trying to warn the public that, if they want these public services which bring a recurring charge on the Exchequer, then they must be prepared to meet them by taxation. The people will have to face up to that&mdash;that they can either have the services and the taxation or do without the services as well as the taxation.</P>
    <P>That, of course, brings us to the question as to what it is legitimate to borrow for.  I do not think anybody will seriously contest that, if there have to be, for one reason or another, constantly recurring charges over a long number of years&mdash;say, 20 or 30 years&mdash;the charges cannot be met otherwise than by taxation and that you must have an annual revenue to meet them.  I have been talking about <Col N="1100" /> borrowing.  A great deal of the borrowing is certainly, whatever else it may be, not for reproductive purposes in the sense that it produces directly a financial return.  It is quite obvious that a number of these capital schemes do not do that.  You have only to analyse them to see that; in fact, you need not analyse them.  You have only to look at the increase in the public debt and you will see that the annual charge for the service of debt, which represents the charge on financially non-productive capital expenditure, has gone up from £4.2 million at the 31st March, 1948, to an estimated £7.35 million in the present year.  That is, it has gone up by three-fourths.  That means that next year, if that estimate is correct, before we can provide for any public service at all, we shall have to meet a charge on the public debt to the extent of £7? million.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy and I could have a long chat&mdash;he has a foolish idea about how we should meet those difficulties&mdash;it would take a long time to talk the whole matter over. The Deputy is one of those who have got ideas at the back of their heads that by financial manipulation you can do as you please.  You cannot. Finance, if it is of any value eventually, represents a background of real resources. If you have not a background of real resources, finance will not do it for you.  If a pound note will not buy something equivalent to the normal value of a pound, it is not of much use. When the value of the £ goes down you can, if you wish, print off £ notes in large numbers but you will not get much for them.  I think at one time in Berlin one had to pay a million marks for a tram fare.  There is no use in talking like that.  If there was any use in that, as the Deputy seems to think, we would have a wonderful world, and what he seems to want would have been done long ago.  Do you think that people would be struggling with all these difficult problems with which we are at present struggling if a solution could be found by the ready method suggested by the Deputy?</P>

      <P>My goodness, tradition !  Does the Deputy not know that the world is not run by tradition, that there are people who are struggling with problems like these and that they would readily apply these solutions if they thought these solutions were useful ?  It is only necessary to think that out, not merely to talk in phrases and to accept them as formulae, to see that things expressed in phrases like that are fundamentally untrue.  There are certain things you can do and things you cannot do.  The truth is that, in the long run, the amount you can do is not very much.  I have been a long time studying these matters.  I suppose I am older than most Deputies here and I had an opportunity of studying questions of social credit, and so forth.  I was interested in them and I went and had a chat with Major Douglas himself on one occasion.  I have examined the question as well as it was possible to examine it and, if there was any advantage to be gained from some of these suggested remedies in this country, I was in the position for some years in which I would have been only too glad to utilise them.</P>
      <P>I am not going to deny that some of the views which Major Douglas put forward gave a certain start to economists and others.  They have been examined and economists have been able to find out what was valuable and what was of no use in them.  I have great respect for the Deputy and I hope my remarks will not be interpreted otherwise, but I do think he has not given to these particular matters the study they deserve if he does not want to be misled by the formulae and phrases which he uses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to analyse the situation as I see it.  We have this borrowing and we shall have to pay these charges. The only way in which you can justify all this is to ensure in the first place that if we exchange these external assets for assets at home they are really productive.  If we were to be on the safe side, we would have to say that they should be invested so as to be equally productive at home.  I am not going to say that that can be insisted upon in all cases.  You may be <Col N="1102" /> able to say: &ldquo;Very well, there is a certain element of amenity value and welfare value in some of these&rdquo; and you may be prepared to sacrifice a certain amount of immediate financial return but you cannot have it both ways. If you do it from the amenity and welfare point of view, it is no longer a productive asset from the financial point of view.  If you want to have an annual income from the financial point of view, then you are not ready to make the sacrifice which utilisation of these assets for amenity purposes at home entails.  It is a great advantage to get in here some millions of pounds every year in goods and services for which we have to pay nothing new except the income from our external assets.  That is an advantage and we should be very careful before we forgo it.</P>
    <P>The summing up of the whole question is this: If we want to be in a position to look forward with safety to the future we must, as a community, say: &ldquo;Very well, we cannot continue along this line; we shall have to produce more or consume less.&rdquo;  Which is better?  Obviously to produce more.  Let us try to produce more then.  There are opportunities of producing more.  Our biggest industry is agriculture.  This is not finding fault with the previous Government at all. Our agriculture, in our time and during the time of the previous Government, has not been producing all that we believe it could produce.</P>
    <P>I believe that we can improve our agricultural output if we set about it properly and it would be worth while to put capital into that development, because that development will give a good return.  You have the land rehabilitation project and so on.  My view is that if money were put into agricultural development at the present time, it should at first be put into those lines which can give you almost immediate results&mdash;that is, to get lands that are short of fertilisers, lands that have not been brought up to their full productivity, and bring them as quickly as you can into full production.  The first care then should be the lands which are capable of giving an immediate response to the efforts put into them.  You will find, <Col N="1103" /> in the main, that these are the good lands.  The next step would be to get the marginal lands, lands that are not so good.  If these are properly utilised they will give you a fairly immediate return.  Let us next put any capital we have to spare into the less developed and less productive, submarginal lands.  I would say that that is the line upon which we should proceed and not in what appears to be the more or less opposite direction. Let us, therefore, set out to increase our agricultural output as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side the cement project has been mentioned.  I think the House will admit that any capital, whether private or public, put into that industry&mdash;to the extent to which it gives us our own requirements&mdash;would be money well spent.  The development of our shipping to meet our essential needs in time of war and, during the period, to give a fair annual dividend would be good business.  The development of our sources of electrical power would be good business. The development of our bogs, particularly if we used the fuel on the bog to produce electrical power, would be good business.  A number of such projects will yield almost immediate returns or very early returns.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the social point of view&mdash;and it was here that we parted company with the recommendations of the Central Bank.  We believe that while the remedies which they suggest might produce the results which they had in mind, they would also produce a number of other results which would be very undesirable.  We do not want to have unemployment in this country so long as the people can be put at productive work.  I admit that sometimes it is difficult to organise really productive work and I am sure that nobody in this House wants work of the type which used to be given for exercise to the prisoners in some military prisons long ago when, for exercise purposes, the prisoner had to take a cannon ball from a pyramid on one side of the barrack square and put it on a pyramid on another side of the barrack square and then take it back <Col N="1104" /> again.  That may have been exercise, but it could not be described as fruitful work.  Our people should not merely be employed; they should be usefully employed, which means increasing the wealth of the community as a whole.  That type of work which will increase the wealth of the community with the greatest rapidity is the best.  If we have production which is not yielding such immediate results naturally we would be inclined to classify it a bit lower down the scale.</P>
    <P>Take the question of afforestation. The Fianna Fáil Party have always held that planting is desirable to the extent to which it is reasonably easy to get the amount of land on which we should, within our resources, plant trees.  I pressed the Department for a number of years but the Ministers used to point out to me that they could not get land as fast as I was pressing to build up forests.  It takes, I suppose, 20 or 30 years before you get anything really valuable in the way of the forests which you plant, but meantime you are giving useful employment and, if slowly, you are building up a national asset.  The important thing is to be reasonable in these matters, to put things in their proper order and proper sequence and proper priority.</P>
    <P>That has always been our attitude to afforestation.  If other Parties have been converted to our way of thinking certainly I am very happy about it.  If they have been converted to that general idea and if, as a Government, they have been working to that general idea it means that the present Opposition and the present Government are of one mind on the matter of afforestation. The only difference, then, between us in regard to any particular enterprise is whether it is one that ought to be engaged in or ought not to be engaged in because of the financial implications.</P>
    <P>Those who are thinking strictly in terms of finance and in terms of inflationary pressure and tendencies will quite properly point out that if you proceed with a scheme of capital development, and pour out money at a time when there is a shortage of home-produced goods, you are distributing spending power without having goods to meet it and that you are, therefore, <Col N="1105" /> to that extent increasing inflationary tendencies, that is, the tendency to increase the bidding for the goods available.  I do not know whether the economists would agree with me but inflationary tendencies in cases like this have always seemed to me to remind one of people at an auction.  If the people at the auction have plenty of money in their pockets and if they desire or need the goods very much they will bid for the goods to the limit of the money which they have to spend.  If you increase the amount of money which they have in their pockets and if, at the same time, there is only a limited number of desirable goods at the auction, the bidding for these desirable goods will naturally send up the prices.  We cannot ignore the fact that by proceeding with schemes of capital development of that sort&mdash; there is no use in our saying that they are wrong: it seems to me that they are not wrong&mdash;we increase the tendency of rising prices unless production of goods generally is increased as well. As a rule, if people are let, they will look for the highest prices which their goods will fetch.  The question then arises whether the State is in a position to control effectively that tendency.</P>

      <P>Let us follow that to a conclusion.  Apparently, we have not all the goods in this country which we want as otherwise we should not be spending so much on getting goods from outside.

      <P>If we had a barrier and did not have the goods coming in from outside we should then have inflation. It is true, therefore, that expenditure for capital purposes unless the Government can control prices has the effect&mdash;I am not saying it is the principal effect&mdash;of sending up prices. If any Government in any State&mdash; because it is true of other States as well as of ours&mdash;could devise an absolutely effective method of controlling prices then that effect need not necessarily arise.  If the price level could be stabilised money which would otherwise cause inflationary pressure would be made available by way of savings.</P>
      <P>Rising prices have been referred to. In 1947 we had a situation of rising prices.  When we set out to meet that situation then we thought it would be only a temporary phenomenon.</P>
      <P>It appeared to me at any rate in the autumn of 1947 that what was happening was that the excessive demand for the goods which at that time were beginning to become available was expressing itself in increased sums being paid for these goods, and that that situation would remedy itself in a very short time by the increased production which would take place in the various countries as soon as they could turn their whole manpower and machinery to the production of consumption goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it would be a purely temporary phenomenon.  I thought we could help to stabilise prices at that time by subsidies, getting the money for the subsidies by taxing goods which were not as essential as, for instance, bread, tea, sugar, and so on. However, we do not seem to be quite in that position now.  Looking ahead in 1947 it seemed to everybody that soon manpower and machinery would be producing ordinary consumption goods, whereas, in fact, they are now being used for other purposes, such as the manufacture of instruments of war. More and more people in other countries are being taken out of industries for the production of consumption goods and are being put into industries manufacturing goods for war.  Of course, the unemployment situation in those countries is being met by the <Col N="1107" /> fact that there is employment in these war industries.</P>
    <P>I might also say, in talking about employment here, that this is an aspect of the matter which did not seem to be properly appreciated by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank spoke about the position of full employment.</P>
    <P>With regard to emigration figures&mdash; again I am to indicate that I am only giving the figures I got&mdash;I wanted to know the truth and I asked for the most accurate figures that I could be given in the way of estimates.  I was given the best estimates I could get. Emigration in 1947 was estimated at 10,000; in 1948, 28,000; in 1949, 34,000, and the estimate for 1950 indicated that the figure was not likely to have been less than 40,000.  These figures showed increasing emigration for these years.  Of course, if you have emigration and there is employment across the water, unemployment here would relieve itself because those who would otherwise be unemployed would go abroad for employment.  The Central Bank Board does not seem to have realised that we had this emigration and that it was a problem which is a fundamental national problem.</P>

      <P>I say that the Central Bank did not seem in their report to have adverted to the fact that one of the consequences of their recommendations would be to cause unemployment in certain directions.</P>
      <P>They seemed to think that the fact that there was a high level of employment indicated that the opportunities for full employment for our people were actually realised.  The truth is that the present comparatively low level of unemployment is accounted for by emigration.  It is obvious that when people find they cannot get employment at home they will emigrate for employment abroad.  We believe that the employment of our people and the maintenance of our nation's strength in that way is a fundamental matter and that everything that the Government can do to maintain employment should be done.  We cannot, I admit, have it both ways.  There is a danger in capital development that it will help of itself to tend to an increase of prices.  But that risk will have to be run.  We will do our best to minimise it, but it is better to face that risk than run the risk of having the unemployment which would result from a neglect of capital development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there is any other aspect of this matter that I should cover.  I am talking to you as I see it, and I am approaching the matter in the same spirit as I would like other Deputies to approach it.  I think that consideration of the direction in which we are going is a serious matter.  It will require the efforts of all Parties in this House and the efforts of the people to correct the wrong trend which is apparent at present.  I think it can be corrected.  I have the same belief in the fortunes of this country <Col N="1109" /> to-day as ever I had, but naturally I would not like to see us missing a point of advantage.  After the war we were able to see that we were in a position for a very advantageous advance; our position was a good one in that we had escaped the misfortunes, the military destruction of the war, and had an opportunity of giving attention to preparing post-war plans and had to a certain extent virgin soil to work with in regard to a number of matters.  It seemed that we could really make progress and be a much more prosperous nation than we had hitherto been.</P>
    <P>That is what I think we ought all endeavour to do&mdash;to bend our efforts towards that&mdash;but we will do that only if we face facts.  We will not do it if we deliberately turn our backs on things that are disagreeable.  We must face the things that are disagreeable, the obstacles in our way, and try to get the better of them.  We believe that the policy for which we have always stood and which we have always advocated, the policy of using the men, the materials and the money of this country for development purposes, is the right policy, and I ask members of the House not to deal with this in any petty political fashion but to help the Government to get the people to gird themselves for the effort required.</P>
    <P>There is no need for any of the exceptional austerities which have been referred to, but there is a need, undoubtedly, for the individual to contribute to the State funds, the State revenues, if the individual wants the State henceforth to do for him what he formerly did for himself.  If we are to have increased social services which will be met from annual revenue, if we want to improve health services, if we want a number of other things, we must be prepared to pay for them in the only way in which they can be paid for, that is, by increasing the State revenues.  That is best done again by increased production by individuals and by increased production by the corporations in which individuals band themselves when they get into business.  That is our approach.  I have tried to talk as <Col N="1110" /> simply as I could about this matter and I ask the members of the various Parties to face up to these problems. If my words get to the public at large, I would like the public to look at these facts calmly, as I have tried to look at them, and to take the measures which the need seems to suggest.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider the advisability of setting up an economic council to plan the capital development and investment programme for the country as a whole? If there is agreement, why not do it on an all-Party basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I differ completely on this question of on whom the responsibility should be placed.  There is a fundamental difference of outlook.  I believe the national interests are best served by having a Government with a definite policy which they put before the people and which they are elected to carry out and an Opposition which criticise and point out any objections to that policy. That is the way in which the country's Government will best be carried on.  I believe that if you try to have the sort of thing to which the Deputy always seems to be harking back, an all-Party body, it will not work, that it is nothing but compromise, nothing can be done unless there is common agreement. I do not think his suggestion works.  In the long run also, I think it is bad, because the tendency is to hide from the people a number of things which the people should know.  Under our present system, if any Government try to hide things, it is the business of the Opposition, and in their interest in the ordinary political way, to show these things up, so that the people will have an opportunity of seeing both sides of a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for instance, Fine Gael were facing us as in the old days, I have no doubt that we would now have a very strict criticism of capital development for certain reasons and along certain lines.  We are not now going to have that and it has this advantage, that we have at least agreement on capital development now, but I think it ought to be the responsibility of a Government, when they are the Government, <Col N="1111" /> to put forward their plan and to do their best to carry it out.  So far as development is concerned, if the Deputy will go back to some early speeches of mine some years ago, he will find that I did suggest a development council or something of the sort.</P>
    <P>I am almost certain of that.  One of the first things we did when we first became an Opposition was to try to get an economic committee&mdash;we were discussing wheat and so on&mdash;on which there were representatives of the Government of the day and ourselves as Opposition.  The arrangement broke up after a very short time because we disagreed fundamentally in regard to certain matters, and these disagreements were bound to mean that, if there was any attempt to get common ground, we would get nowhere.  It was the Government of the time who took the initiative in getting rid of it, and, as a member of the Opposition, I believed that in that matter they were right, that it just could not be done.  We wanted a certain line of development in regard to wheat-growing, and they believed it was not the right policy, and so on.  In these economic matters, the only thing for us to do is to accept the Government, to press certain things upon it if the Opposition want certain things done, and, if these are not done properly, to criticise it and let the public be the judge.</P>
    <P>So far as a development commission is concerned, when we got into office I thought of having a headquarters planning staff, in addition to the ordinary Government Departments, attached, as I thought was the right place, to the head of the Government for the time being&mdash;a planning headquarters staff as an army might have an operations staff.  I soon found when I went to examine it home that what was happening was that I was providing a fifth wheel to a coach, which was going to cause all sorts of trouble, and that the right thing to do was for the Ministers in the Government who were dealing with these matters to form a committee, as we did in preparation for peace&mdash;a ministerial committee which would plan out the amount of capital expenditure required, priorities, and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> I still believe that is the best way to do it, that, for this general planning of capital development, the best way is for the Ministers immediately involved to be in a Cabinet committee, and to put up plans, and, if possible, to get Cabinet agreement for them.  Each Minister would then go back to his own Department.  If it were a question of, say, supplies, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would deal with it.  If it were a question of making capital available, the Minister for Finance would deal with it, and so on.  That is the best and only practicable headquarters planning staff.  Each of these Ministers would have the expert advice of his own Department, and if necessary he could bring in somebody from outside as a sort of unattached, external person to give advice.</P>
    <P>When I was head of the Government previously, I had an economic adviser. There was an economist whose views, when financial and other matters came up, I consulted from time to time and with whom I discussed some of these matters as a check upon the views that might be expressed by others&mdash;not that his views were going to supersede the views expressed by departmental experts, but just to get an outside independent point of view which helped from time to time to get a new approach to a particular problem.  I think that is the way to get development done&mdash;put the responsibility on the Government of the day and let the Government, through a Cabinet committee or otherwise, do the planning. If the head of the Government wants any independent information which he thinks might be of value to himself and members of the Government, it could be got, but the idea I originally had of an independent development council or a headquarters staff would not really be effective in the long run. Now, I have been talking to people who have had experience of government, and, though they can differ with me if they wish, they know at least there is reason in what I say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in the concluding stages of his speech, expressed his belief and his hope in the ability of the country to develop and <Col N="1113" /> progress.  It is because all of us have the same fundamental belief that we are so concerned with the developments that have taken place in the field of financial policy, so far as the formulation of that policy is concerned, during the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went on to say that he believed it was essential that the material wealth, the men and the physical and mental ability we have, should be fully utilised for the development of the country.  Many of us have grave doubts that that can be done if the type of policy that has been enunciated, not merely during this debate but prior to the debate, by spokesmen of the Government, and that has been set forth in the Report of the Central Bank and, with all due respect, that has been repeated by the Taoiseach to-night, is going to be the guiding policy in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has now proceeded for some weeks and it would be unpardonable for those of us who are coming in towards the end of the debate to seek to go into detail to the extent that was warranted in the earlier speeches; but it is essential that all of us who have a viewpoint should express it on the more outstanding questions.  In so far as the Central Bank Report is concerned, I personally have not got the slightest objection to the members of the board of directors of the bank making any kind of report they want to make, no matter how stupid it may be and even though everybody in the country denounces it and repudiates it. They are quite entitled to make the report, just as anyone is entited to express his opinion.  The important factor is not the making of the report but that it is made by certain people, who have got not merely a certain status in being members of the Board of the Central Bank, but some of whom have very direct and close contacts with the banking system as a whole.  I think it is fair to say they are very influential members of that leading group which can formulate the policy of the commercial banks.  It is from that point of view we have to consider the report and its implications, more particularly when we find its publication coinciding with the expression of views by spokesmen of the Government, both prior to and <Col N="1114" /> during this debate, on public policy in regard to finance.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, as the Taoiseach said, when it is sought to suggest that the spokesmen of the Government are to any extent committed to the report, and bearing in mind the statement made by the Tánaiste in the opening of the debate, that will be repudiated; but I have equally no doubt in my mind that, commencing with the speeches made immediately after the general election, the basis was laid for the creation of an atmosphere which was to welcome and make possible this Report of the Central Bank and the policy laid down.  We have only to throw our minds back to the speeches made by leading members of the Fianna Fáil Party when they declared that the country was almost on the verge of bankruptcy, that a most serious crisis faced us, that they were facing difficulties in taking over the Government, that they were almost uncertain as to whether they could overcome them.  Even in the early days&mdash;June and July&mdash;we had references to the standard of consumption, the necessity to pay as you go and the obligation to cut our cloth according to our measure.  I do not think these speeches were purely accidental or made without having some ultimate viewpoint in mind so far as the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>When, out of that general atmosphere that was being built up through the speeches of representative members of the Government, we then had the development finding its ultimate expression in a report such as this, it is not unfair to place some of the responsibility&mdash;we may differ as to the degree of responsibility&mdash;on the Government for the present situation and for the fact that the report has created widespread consternation in the country.  It is unfortunate for our people that this approach to financial policy coincided with quite a number of other factors.  It is unfortunate that we have a situation wherein, not by the formulation of a definite policy or by the issuing of direct instructions but merely by the operation of various pressures here, it is possible for a <Col N="1115" /> private banking system to affect fundamentally the trade and commerce of the country at a particular time.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the general reports one receives from persons engaged in trade and commerce that there has been operating over a recent period, if not a policy of restriction of credit in respect of commerce and trade, at least such a tightening of attitude that, brought together with other factors, is causing some recession in trade.  Those factors may include prices at such a high level that the public cannot buy or the reluctance on the part of the public to buy at those prices even though they have the money.</P>
    <P>It may be also the question of additional imports and a certain amount of stockpiling&mdash;although I think the word &ldquo;stockpiling&rdquo; is a misnomer.  Adding all those factors together, we have now got the present situation, which the Tánaiste indicated on one or two occasions during the past week as being that of a somewhat minor recession. There is a considerable degree not merely of actual unemployment but of the type of under-employment, short-time, which creates even greater difficulties in the homes of the working people.</P>
    <P>When one looks for an immediate solution to that problem, it is not very easy to find it.  I have mentioned that stockpiling might be one of the factors affecting a number of trades at present. It is quite easy to suggest that the admission of additional supplies of manufactured articles should not have taken place.  When one recalls the criticism made by Fianna Fáil, when they were in opposition, as to the failure to bring goods into the country in case there were grave shortages arising out of the world situation, one wonders at the change in attitude and also at the ability to forget something. It is very easy to make mistakes and the Tánaiste will recall that on one occasion in regard to the boot and shoe trade he, in pursuance of a principle that we would all have supported&mdash; namely, to try and bring about a reduction in the prices of boots and shoes &mdash;entered upon a certain policy with regard to imports, a policy which for <Col N="1116" /> various reasons did not operate in the way he intended, and we had a similar crisis in the boot and shoe industry early in 1947 to what we have with regard to the clothing trade now.  In so far as there was a question of bringing supplies into the country, however, I think that a criticism can be made.  Criticism can be directed not only at the last Government but I think at most Governments which have been in office in this country during the last 20 or 30 years for failure to appreciate the defects of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>We frequently do this and, although we pass compliments to the efficiency of a system of private enterprise, we forget its defects.  It was very easy in the latter part of 1950 and at the beginning of the present year to suggest to merchants and manufacturers that they should take advantage of every opportunity to bring in supplies.  It was very easy to suggest that word would be passed to the banks to make available reasonable accommodation.  When those merchants, however, started to find pressure exerted upon them by their suppliers, by the general situation in the country and possibly, although on this we have not very definite information it appears, also by their banks it was very difficult for those individual merchants and manufacturers to understand the logic of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>If we did require importers and manufacturers to bring in and carry additional supplies of goods, surely the first essential was to ensure that, if those additional supplies were brought in, they would come in as stockpile and not merely as advance buying. Knowing the difficulty, from the point of view of financial resources and accommodation for credit that often faces manufacturers and merchants, there was an obligation on the Government to ensure that the financial burden that would be placed upon those who would bring in additional supplies would not be greater than they could bear, so that it would be possible to put those additional supplies to one side, in so far as they could be maintained without deterioration, and keep them out of the normal stream of commerce and trade in the <Col N="1117" /> country.  If they were allowed to enter that stream they should be allowed in only at such a rate of progress and under such control that they would not create any economic disturbance.  We did not do that and now we have additional streams of articles coming into our wholesale warehouses, from them to the shops and finally to the consumer which have created this present disturbance which exists in many of our trades.  Quite frankly, I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is correct when he says that we must wait for the process to wear away, but, in the process of waiting for the surpluses to be exhausted, a good many ordinary decent men and women will be exhausted, too, trying to exist on half pay or unemployment benefit. That, however, is part of a system which we all commend and we must take the bad with the good.</P>
    <P>In so far as this present difficulty is concerned, it does seem to me that whatever might be said by any section or party in the country, the only real assistance that can be given towards easing the present situation must come from the Government itself.  I am frankly of the opinion that the basis of our difficulties at the moment in respect to our trades and many of our industries is in the main lack of confidence, a lack of confidence which started fundamentally with those who have got, as it is quite clear that they have, real control of the credit resources of the country.  The Taoiseach may have faith in the future of the country but I doubt very much if those who control our commercial banks have very much faith in our country, and if they have they do not operate on faith.  From that point of view I feel that the present situation&mdash; it is not a crisis but it does contain a number of problems&mdash;is one in which we must try to restore what has been so badly shaken, that is, the sense of confidence and the feeling that it is possible to extend to our manufacturers and traders that accommodation which is the normal, if you like, lifeblood of both industry and commerce under our present system.</P>
    <P>That restoration of confidence, in my opinion, can come only from the <Col N="1118" /> Government itself.  Whether that is possible or not, I do not yet know. Certainly up to the moment, from what I have heard in this debate&mdash;I have listened to a great deal of it with very marked attention&mdash;I personally doubt it, because it seems to me that the Government themselves not only have no confidence but have not even an agreed policy.  If the Government of the country have not yet made up their own minds on what is to be the policy it will be very difficult for them to induce ordinary men and women to place confidence in a policy not yet enunciated or agreed upon or to restore confidence which is very badly shaken.</P>
    <P>I not only listened to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and read it subsequently in the Official Reports, but I also listened to the speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the major portion of the Taoiseach's speech to-day.  May I say with every sense of respect that, in the first place, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should address his remarks to his own colleagues in the Government?  In his speech opening the debate the Minister for Industry and Commerce rejected not merely the policy of the Central Bank but their approach to the formulation of that policy.  He was proceeding on lines that I think practically everybody in the House will agree on, because we all believe in a policy of expansion.  We all believe that only on a basis of expansion rather than contraction is there not merely any hope for the future of the country but any hope of getting out of the present difficulty.</P>
    <P>When we come along, having listened to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and listen to the speech of the Minister for Finance &mdash;after all who should be more authoritative on the financial policy of the Government than the Minister for Finance?&mdash;we are faced not alone with the lack of any statement of policy but with a speech that, in my opinion, is no credit to the Minister for Finance. I do not doubt his ability to make a speech of a high standard if he desires to do so but his speech was not worthy <Col N="1119" /> either of the Government or of this House, because in a situation when even the newest members of this House are trying to address themselves to the problem, possibly under great difficulty, and certainly without the expert advice and adequate information available to the Minister for Finance, he merely repeats for us in one form or another various factual statements which have already appeared in different official documents.  He gives us a lecture&mdash;it rather appeared to me as though he read out a lecture&mdash;on what was significant in parity in currency and then he sat down.</P>
    <P>Those of us who had waited expectantly to hear the second portion of the enunciation of Government policy on the present financial problems went away without any indication of what that policy would be so far as the Minister for Finance was concerned in the debate in this House.  Subsequently, and outside, of course, he did express himself.  It is interesting to know that with the opening speech of the Tánaiste there has been a gradual swinging away from the very definite and outright statements made by the Tánaiste in relation to the policy set out in the Central Bank Report until, when we have completed the circle, we find ourselves right back in the middle of that report with the policy accepted.</P>
    <P>What is the basic approach of the Central Bank to the present situation? It is summed up by the word deflation. Deflation is in fact a contraction and contraction means, to put it in the form in which we have had it during the course of the last few weeks, that you have to pay out of your current income for whatever you want and in order to do that you have to reduce your consumption.  I do not in any way profess to be an expert on economics. In fact I am hoping to learn as this debate proceeds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always hopeful anyway.  I do not know whether those who speak so lightheartedly of the need to reduce our consumption standards realise how close they are coming to the policy set out in the Central Bank Report.  If, for argument's sake, we have to pay for all our capital <Col N="1120" /> investment, or a very large part of it, by taxation, whom are we going to tax? I take it for granted, because I can only go on past experiences, that that taxation very largely will be levied on the ordinary mass of the people and the purpose will be, not merely to raise financial resources but also, by taking from them some of their spending power, to ease, as the Taoiseach says, the pressure for increased imports and, therefore to ease, what he has now indicated to us, the processes that are causing inflation inside the country.</P>
      <P>If the mass of the people are going to consume less, they are going to buy less; there is going to be less for people to sell to them; there will be less people required in the shops to sell the goods; there will be less necessity for the shops to buy goods from manufacturers, and right down the whole line of production and distribution of goods there will be a gradual and steady contraction and we will end up with the reduced consumption that seems to be the beloved policy of the directors of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>That in itself would not be so bad if it was like a water tap that we could turn on and off.  Most people who have watched the policy of deflation being applied in other countries have noticed that one very marked feature of a policy of deflation is that it is very easy to start and very difficult to stop, and I think that particularly the Tánaiste, who has not merely spoken in favour of a policy of expansion but has indicated the lines along which he thinks that expansion should take place, should set himself very definitely against the application in a concealed form of the policy openly set out in the Report of the Central Bank, because the danger in the present situation is not so much that the policy of deflation proposed by the Central Bank will be applied as a result of a full-dress debate in this House, the acceptance by the House of that policy and the translation of that policy into legislation, but that the policy will be applied without legislation in many ways, and it can be done by ordinary administrative measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent that has already started.  There has been a number of questions in this House with regard <Col N="1121" /> to the new policies with regard to housing and, while there is nothing very marked about it, members of the House who are associated with the Dublin Corporation will tell you that they have already started to have the effect of slowing down housing activities. It is just as effective if, by the application of red-tape measures, you prevent the spending of money over a given period, as if you refuse to provide the money.  That is one feature that has already made itself felt.</P>
    <P>We have had other references in regard to other forms of Government expenditure and it is not unknown to many of us who have in small ways come in contact with Government Departments that it has been much more difficult in recent months to get decisions on small matters which involve expenditure than it was in previous periods and I am not thinking of the period of office of the previous Government but even of periods of office of the previous Fianna Fáil Government. Therefore, from that point of view it is not sufficient to have a public statement made by the Tánaiste that the policy of the Central Bank is not being accepted by the Government and that they propose to proceed on a policy rather of expansion, but it is equally important that other spokesmen of the Government should realise that, while they are hedging and trimming their sails, as they have been doing for the past few weeks, and trying to convince the people that certain measures should receive their support, many of the measures that they are speaking of are at the basis of the whole policy set out in the Central Bank Report and that once we start on that particular road we will find extreme difficulty in reversing directions before we have done too much damage.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that in regard to the immediate difficulties&mdash;and I am thinking of the difficulties in regard to many of our manufacturing industries and traders and the resultant disemployment and short-time of working men and women&mdash;it would be helpful if at this point such a statement could be made from the Government that <Col N="1122" /> would assist in restoring confidence in the industrial and trading position, and would make possible a relaxation of the tightening up of credit which has undoubtedly taken place.  That would help to ease the financial position of many of those who are facing exceptional difficulties at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is to be accepted that in so far as the excess supplies of goods in the country are concerned it is almost impossible at the moment to do any more than to wait for them to work themselves out.  There is a general feeling in the country that we are about to face straitened times, that not only have the banks to protect other people's money which they happen to hold, but that ordinary men and women have to conserve what few pounds they have because there is the likelihood that they will have to fall back on them very shortly.  So long as that atmosphere of nervousness and fear and trepidation in respect of the future prevails in the country, we will have this hiatus in certain of our manufacturing industries and in many of our distributive trades.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the key to that situation, the possibility of remedying it, lies in the hands of the Government, and requires from them that they should be clear in their own minds as to the policy to be pursued and that they should speak with one voice.  Up to the present there have been many voices, and no more contradictory voices have been heard in respect of the opening statement made by the Tánaiste than some of those belonging to colleagues alongside him on the Front Bench.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, we have had references to the adverse trade balance in this country and the question of our external assets.  I feel that if we sat down and examined this problem of imports during the past nine months of this year, as we did when the capital programme of Deputy McGilligan was examined in this House, we would find that there was not such a great difference of opinion as to what imports were necessary and what percentage of the total imports <Col N="1123" /> brought in could have been done without. Personally, I do not believe that the amount of stockpiling referred to in this House is anything like as big as suggested, because when you take out of the total imports such factors as wheat, essential raw materials for industry, timber, medical supplies and, presumably, things like butter, tea and sugar in the given situation, we are left then with a relatively small quantity of certain manufactured goods.  In respect of these manufactured goods, I certainly would agree that it would have been better if a more exact and careful control had been exercised over the imports.  But that is not an unusual feature of our trade position.  It is one that has arisen out of our industrial weakness inside the country itself.</P>
    <P>The most marked feature that I see in regard to our trade position is not so much the adverse trade balance, not even the failure of our manufactured exports to continue to increase, as&mdash; the one factor which seems to be basic to our whole discussion&mdash;the complete failure of Irish agriculture, not alone to respond to the policies that have been applied in the hope of bringing about improvements and productivity and ability to provide exports, but to meet to any reasonable extent the rightful demands of the community upon it.  So far as industry is concerned, there has been a quite marked increase in production, and particularly in productivity in comparison with 1938.  We have had a small but steady growth in our manufactured exports. They have to try to force their way into the export market under much greater difficulties than agricultural exports because, as we have been told in this House, so far as agricultural exports are concerned, practically every country in the world is waiting to get food in one form or another.  It is not so easy to get every country in the world to take our manufactured goods. To the extent to which we have succeeded in building up, even in a small way, our industrial exports, that is a commendation for Irish industry and those engaged in it and for the workers who have increased their productivity.</P>
    <P>When we turn to look at agriculture, <Col N="1124" /> we get an entirely different picture.  I do not think that farmer Deputies will object when I say that so far as the main sections of the community that engage in production are concerned, during the period from 1939 the agricultural section has been the most fortunate and has received the biggest increase in return for the labour they apply in their industry.  Not only have they gained through improved prices, through the easier position so far as the agricultural market is concerned both in this country and abroad, but they have been given continuous and increasing assistance and support both by the previous Government and by the Fianna Fáil Government prior to 1947. In fact I think they receive a good deal more from the community than they contribute.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to agree that, so far as the standard of life of our people in agriculture is concerned, they are entitled to have that standard raised and to get an adequate return. But when the community, through the Government and the Oireachtas, set out&mdash;possibly not always in the best way, because farmer Deputies are always criticising the Government whether they support it or not and are always generally dissatisfied, the same as trade unionists are&mdash;to assist agriculture, the community is entitled to a better return than is shown by the figures when we find that agricultural exports not only failed to increase but that, in respect of the main export of live stock, there has actually been a very small reduction during the past year.</P>
    <P>More important still, without going back over a considerable period of years, there has been no significant change whatever in the output of our agricultural industry.  Yet, we are told that agriculture is the basis of our whole economy.  Deputy Dillon went so far as to tell us that agriculture was the only thing in this country that produced wealth.  Like a lot of Deputy Dillon's economics, that wants to be reconsidered and reformulated.  However, accepting Deputy Dillon's statement in regard to the basic importance of agriculture, it is essential, when we face a situation such as we have, when we have a large <Col N="1125" /> adverse trade balance, when we have a problem facing us as to whether we are going to eat into our external assets in order to give effect to our domestic policies, when that particular section of our economy which could fundamentally and in a large measure contribute to the easing of that problem of our foreign trade is failing to do it, that it should be pointed out and regard paid to it.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of balancing our trade is concerned, I agree with the Tánaiste that, through properly co-ordinated and planned industrial expansion, we can expect to cut out many industrial imports which we take in at present.  We can also expect in a more limited form to be able to increase our industrial exports.  But the only field in which we can expect a fairly large measure of success within a limited period is that of agricultural exports, because we still have all the foreign markets available to us.  We also have in agriculture a field of activity in which in certain ways it is possible to get a much more immediate and quick increase than in our limited field of industrial resources.</P>
    <P>Whatever other aspects of this problem the Government addresses itself to, the immediate one, I think, should be agriculture.  If farmer Deputies, as they do repeatedly in this House and are entitled to do, come in and press their claims for improved prices, for additional assistance for the agricultural producers, they in turn have to accept their responsibility to give an enhanced return to the community from agriculture because it is in their hands that one of the most immediate and easily applied remedies lies in respect of the problem we are discussing.</P>
    <P>So far as industry is concerned, as I have said, we have already had quite a marked increase in industrial output. We have had an increase in industrial productivity and our figures in that respect bear reasonable comparison with what has been done in other countries, even countries that have not, like ourselves, actually been physically devastated by war.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly much more can be done in that respect.  I think two helpful <Col N="1126" /> suggestions can be put forward.  Just as our agricultural producers are given protection by the community, protection to which they are entitled in order to safeguard the Irish market for them and to make that market a basis from which they can enter into competition in foreign markets, in the same way Irish industrialists have also been given protection and special care by the community.  But that protection is not given to the industrialist because we like the colour of his eyes. Neither is it given, as has been said on many occasions, so that some individuals can acquire wealth beyond anything they normally expected in the earlier years of their lives.</P>
    <P>National policy is being applied.  If that policy happens to provide benefits for certain individuals, that is their good fortune; but, in so far as subsidies are given by the ordinary consuming public to the Irish manufacturer engaged in industrial activities in a tariff-protected industry, the community is, in return, entitled to place certain requirements upon that industry. One of these requirements, as was indicated by Deputy Norton, is that if an industry is enjoying protection it should not be allowed to stand still.  It should be required to work on a basis of progressive development.  It should be required more and more to undertake such additional forms of manufacture as will reduce our present imports.  It should be required to make its contribution where it is technically possible towards closing certain of the gaps that exist at present in our industrial economy.</P>
    <P>I admit it is not always easy to do that because I appreciate, quite clearly, that if I have a small industry in which I am getting a reasonable return for my investment I am not very much inclined towards undertaking an additional burden and worry by entering into some possibly speculative field of development, which may be very important to the country as a whole but does not afford me any immediate return.  Yet, so far as my industrial activity and my return is dependent upon the protection and the subsidy I receive from the public generally, there should be that public <Col N="1127" /> requirement placed upon me, and that requirement should come from and be directly under the control of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is charged with implementing our industrial policy, a policy upon which we all agree, of protection for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In the second place, we have appeals made repeatedly to Irish workers to give their assistance in increasing industrial production and productivity. On the whole I think Irish workers have given a fairly good return in the light of the general situation, particularly when we recall that even up to the present time we have not yet balanced the gap between the rise in prices and the rise in wages, and when we remember that our wages to-day are still short of the 1939 level, and that we have forgone 12 years during which we would normally have been entitled to make some real progress in our standard of living generally.  Bearing in mind the experience our workers had during the years 1939 to 1947, they have not responded too badly at all in so far as their contribution is concerned towards increasing industrial production and productivity.  I agree that much more can be done. But I wonder why it should be done and on what basis.</P>
    <P>In the course of the period of office of the last Government an approach was made suggesting that some definite lead should be given in relation to workers' participation in management.  A somewhat elaborate memorandum was submitted and certain proposals were made.  Possibly some of them would require legislation. We got a blessing and an expression of the hope that this could be brought about by voluntary agreement between the employers and the employees.  That will not make for any great degree of progress.  Anybody who has read or heard the views expressed by Irish industrialists in recent years knows very well that there is no great depth of voluntary acceptance on their part of the principle of bringing those who are called their partners in industry into the field of management.  If they do not bring them in, if they persist in <Col N="1128" /> keeping them outside the room where the problems of management and industrial production are considered and decided, why then should they expect those they shut out to make any contribution?  Why should they expect the workers to make a contribution towards increased productivity and industrial output if the additional fruits of that higher output and productivity will be claimed, as they have been in the past, by one side only?</P>
    <P>I think the Tánaiste should consider this aspect of the matter.  It is quite clear to anyone who knows anything about industry that the ordinary average worker, who does not think very deeply, perhaps, on the problems on the particular industry in which he is engaged, very often knows many wrinkles and many ways in which savings could be made and production increased, and in which productivity in relation to the individual worker might be improved. But he gets no invitation; he gets no encouragement; and he will get no recognition if he does try to make that contribution.  Yet he is told that Irish industry is just as much his concern as it is of those who own it; that he has as much interest in the development of Irish industry as any other member of the community.  But when he tries to express that interest and to take his proper place the door is very tightly closed against him.</P>
    <P>If we accept that our problems in relation to our balance of payments and the use of our external assets, our resources for capital investment and the level of our domestic consumption will all be materially eased if we are able to increase our agricultural and industrial exports and if we are able to reduce the cost of production in agriculture and in industry and if it is clear, as clear it is, that a marked contribution can be made by workers in industry towards bringing about that change, particularly in relation to industrial output, then it is worth while making the effort.</P>
    <P>Similar remarks can be passed in regard to agriculture.  There are a number of wage earners engaged in agriculture. Let me say&mdash;we have gone over this ground before&mdash;that the adverse <Col N="1129" /> attitude of the farmer Deputies here to questions in relation to the wages and the working conditions of farm labourers is not very encouraging while they expect their labourers to make their contribution to the greater prosperity of their farmers. If we require this policy of expansion to be applied and if we expect all sections to make their contribution then there must be a recognition of the contribution that can be made by all sections and we must get rid of the idea that because the farmer says that the farm is his private property and the industrialist says the factory is his private property, the locked door must be maintained against the men and women who make their contribution and, in return for that contribution, receive a weekly wage.</P>
    <P>I would like, particularly, to refer to the statements which have been made in the course of this debate and outside the House in regard to the question of the level of consumption in the country.  Quite clearly, when we speak in terms of carrying out our capital programme on the basis of taxation we notice a difference in the shading between the Tánaiste and other members of the Government.  The Tánaiste spoke in terms in which he took it for granted that part of that capital programme would be undertaken by borrowing, but he did pose the question as to whether all of it could be undertaken without increased taxation.  Then we got the final shading when we arrived at the point where the suggestion was almost made that, unless we are going to provide all the resources for our capital programme out of taxation, we cannot expect to be able to carry it out.</P>
    <P>Clearly, we have to consider the question of the level of consumption in the country.  I often wonder, when people talk about the level of consumption, whether they ever try to break it down and whom they mean when they refer to the level of consumption.  We are repeatedly told by the newspapers, we are told by the Central Bank and by other public spokesmen, that we are consuming too much, that we are living at too high a standard, that we are spending too much money on everyday <Col N="1130" /> things and should save something, and that we are importing too much goods for everyday consumption.  It appears to be taken for granted that the people of this country are living as they never lived before, that they are living far and above all other groups of people throughout the civilised world, and that it would be a good thing for our souls if we retrenched a bit and got on to a somewhat lower level.</P>
    <P>Who is to get on to the lower level? Is it 180,000 old age pensioners, the 50,000 or 60,000 unemployed, the 80,000 farm labourers, the 30,000 widows and orphans, or is it the several thousands of men and women eking out a living on public assistance?  Now, they are not small bodies of people, or is it the 50 per cent. of our people working for wages?  According to the White Paper issued in connection with the first Social Welfare Bill they are only receiving less than £3 10s. a week in wages.  Where are they to cut down on consumption?  It is a fair and a reasonable question.  We get, taking together the 180,000 old age pensioners, the 80,000 farm labourers, the 30,000 widows and the 50,000 unemployed a very large section of our total Irish population, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 300,000.  Many of these have dependents, wives and children. This is the section which is to make its contribution towards capital investment by eating less, by wearing less, by cutting out some luxuries, and, generally, by coming down to a lower standard.  Is not the thing completely fantastic?</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion talking to a manufacturer when I was looking for more wages for our members.  He said to me: &ldquo;Look here, Larkin, if you go out and get the farm labourers another 5/- a week I will give your members an increase of 10/-.&rdquo;  It would be very good economics for him to do so because, as he explained, if the farm labourers get an extra 5/- they would be able to buy an extra pound's worth of the particular commodity he was producing, and that increase in output would provide extra work and higher wages for the workers engaged in his factory.  If we are going to start by telling people who <Col N="1131" /> are already living, not on the 1938 standard, but on some kind of a standard that possibly could have been applied to the Stone Age, that Ireland's future depends on their going on a still lower standard&mdash;telling the old age pensioner that he has got to do with, possibly, one cup of tea less in the day, that he has to cut by half an ounce his tobacco consumption in the week, that he has to reduce the few slices of bread he manages to eat, or tell the widow that she has to cut out some of the milk which she manages with great difficulty to give to her orphan child, or tell the farm labourer that he has to cut his consumption on his wage of £3 6s. a week&mdash;then I am very much afraid that the hope which the Taoiseach expressed in the future of this country is going to be a vain hope.</P>
    <P>Let us look at other sections, those who are employed and in receipt of wages.  The over-all consumption in this country since 1939 has, I think, increased by something like 9 per cent. So far as the mass of wage and salary earners are concerned, I find great difficulty, when going through the various industrial categories, in coming across large groups of either salary or wage earners who have managed to keep their wages in line with the rise in prices, or who can be said to be enjoying the same real standard, or the same standard of real wages, which they had in 1939.  I have no doubt that there are small groups which have managed to do that, mainly those engaged on piece work or where there has been, for some reason, a radical improvement in basic rates. That, however, has generally resulted from the fact that the rates pre-war were far too low.  But the general run of wage earners are not able to show any marked advance in their standard of life to-day as compared with 1939. It will be argued by most of them that, in fact, their standard is down.  One never seems to get anywhere when one is arguing against the Government, unless one accepts the official figures. I prefer to accept the official figures because they serve my purpose just as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> If the great mass of salary and wage earners have to-day a lower real standard in relation to their wages and salaries or even an equal standard, to what they had in 1939, does the Tánaiste or the Government regard the standard of 1939 as a standard on which a marked saving and reduction in consumption can be made?  I doubt it very much.  Therefore we find that, having taken out the most unfortunate section of our community, the farm labourers, the old age pensioners, the widows and unemployed and those on public assistance, and having put them on one side and said: &ldquo;Well, at least we are not going to expect anything from you,&rdquo; and then having taken the salary and wage earners, men and women with family responsibilities and examined their picture and decided, as I think it is reasonable to decide, that there is not very much contribution which they can make in the form of savings or by adopting a lower standard of consumption, what are we left with?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, somebody else, and that is why I wonder why you are so quick to avoid it.  I know you will immediately pull me up when I start speaking on profits or a slow return. I know what the technical difficulties are.  I am not for a moment going to side-step the fact that, even under the past Government, we could not get the application of the profits tax that we should have got despite the pressure put on, but it does seem to me that we have got in this country a relatively small group of people who already have got certain reserves.  If Deputies look at the White Paper they will, first of all, get the figure of, I think, £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 of undistributed profits. No doubt some expert cost accountant could succeed in getting an even higher figure for us, but even that figure is something to go on with.  We know that at the time when the excess profits tax was stopped it was producing somewhere in the neighbourhood of about £4,000,000 a year.  In addition I think I am quite right in saying that there has been a steady rise in the rate of profit since the end of the war. <Col N="1133" /> That is shown in the reports of the public companies.</P>
      <P>I think it is safe to say that, on the whole, public companies do not show higher returns than is generally the experience of the branch company. Therefore it would not be unreasonable to suggest that there is money there available which, if we apply our minds to it, can readily be applied to capital investment.  Much of that capital investment is of direct interest to those who have this money because I believe investment in industry is just as important as investment in electricity production, turf production or any other public undertaking so long as it is an investment that is going to add to our productive capacity.</P>
      <P>There is also another aspect of the matter.  If you look at the Report of the Revenue Commissioners there is one very interesting table in it in which they report on the payment of death duties.  They give an introductory paragraph to that section in which they say that the amount of wealth on which death duty has to be paid and the manner in which it is held by those who die is a fair cross section, or microcosm, as they call it, of the wealth held in the hands of the community as a whole.  It is a very interesting table because when you examine it you find that out of 10,000 estates which came under the attention of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the payment of estate duty, no less than 5,000 were less than £500 in value.  Of the 10,000 I think 300 were less than £100. They did not even merit the attention of the Revenue Commissioners in so far as payment of duty was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take that as a fair cross section of the community we find that of the total wealth in the hands of the community a very, very small amount is held by a very large section of the community. In fact, the average person in the country, after working for 65 or 70 years giving fair and honest service to the community in whatever walk of life he happens to be placed, finds himself, when he passes from this sphere, in the happy position of not having to leave very much behind.  That is a very fair picture so far as the masses of our people are concerned.  Yet these are the people who, after a lifetime of <Col N="1134" /> work, are not able to leave even £100 or £200 after them, who are to cut down consumption and provide the resources for our capital investment policy.</P>
    <P>I am as anxious as the Tánaiste to see schemes coming into operation.  I firmly believe that if we are to depend for putting these schemes into operation on what we will obtain from taxation, we may as well sit down and give up the job.  It cannot be done.  We must find other ways and means of doing it.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate there has been a good deal said in regard to banking policy.  I do not know whether I am as crazy on that as my friend Deputy Hickey is, but I agree with a good many of the things he said.  I do believe that we should reexamine the whole position of our Central Bank and see if we cannot make out a more effective instrument through which we can harness and utilise credit resources in our country. It seems to me a completely anomalous position at the moment that we have a group of gentlemen constituting the board of this very important institution and that, year after year, they issue reports and not only does nobody pay the slightest attention to them, but everybody rejects them.</P>
    <P>So far as the Reports of the Central Bank are concerned, if these reports were correct we would not be worrying about the future of this country. We would have had no future about seven or eight years ago because, year after year, they said unless the country adopted the policy they laid down, we were heading for bankruptcy.  No Government has followed their advice. Every Government has rejected it, and the country is still going along.  We are not in a critical position and we are not facing immediate bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>What is the use of having gentlemen like that in charge of this institution? They may be very good technicians in regard to the manufacturing of banknotes. It might be very interesting to go down on a Thursday to see them burning up the old banknotes that are too dirty to use, but if they are entitled under the Central Bank Act to give a certain amount of advice to the Government, even though it is not accepted, is there any value in their <Col N="1135" /> giving advice which, year after year, has proven wrong?</P>
    <P>But there is a more important factor which I referred to earlier on.  There are a number of these gentlemen who are in very close association with our commercial banks.  They occupy very influential positions in the banking world.  If they are parties to reports of this nature and the policy set out in that report, is it unfair to say that some of that unacceptable policy&mdash;unacceptable by the Government and the other Parties in this House&mdash;has leaked out through them into our commercial banks in the form of a complete and full blown policy of deflation?  Yet we are told that the commercial banks have not restricted credit.  If I were a director of a commercial bank, and I did not restrict credit, I think I would have failed in my responsibility, because here embodied in a report by a very influential institution on which there would be sitting gentlemen for whom I had a great respect, is advice to implement a policy of deflation which I would not have been able to do within my own limited field.  I would suggest that instead of the refutation of the report&mdash;because they are quite entitled to submit it as we are entitled to discuss it&mdash;as an indication and as an earnest of good faith, it would be a good policy for the Government to change the personnel of the Central Bank if the Government is determined, as the Tánaiste says, to pursue a policy of expansion.  Otherwise there will be a continued feeling that while the report is rejected publicly some of the advice will be accepted privately.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I think that while we have our problems in relation to our trading position, we should recognise that in our modern economy one of the fundamental instruments for dealing with industrial trading problems, the problem of our general economic expansion, is the instrument of credit.  It does seem to me worthy of consideration whether or not it is in the best interests that the Oireachtas, which is charged with the responsibility of undertaking the expansion of the country's economy, should not have some powers in relation to the making <Col N="1136" /> available of the credit resources which are at the disposal of the country.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that it would be objectionable to have, for argument's sake, the banking system of the country nationalised and the financial policy of that nationalised banking system made the victim of the political cockpit here in the Dáil and made subject to the vagaries which take place in our political life.  I know that politicians are frequently regarded as lacking in a sense of responsibility. All in all, it seems to me that we have a good deal stronger sense of responsibility than many of those who to-day control our banking system.  At least, whatever irresponsibility we suffered from was largely of a temporary character and very localised, but there is a general concern and desire among all Parties to do what they believe to be in the best interests of this country, and of its people.  That is a question that would very strongly be in issue when we come to the question of those who control our Irish banking system.</P>
    <P>In many of our banks the control does not lie in this country at all.  For instance, if one wants an overdraft of £1,000, an application has to be sent to London, and London has to examine one's bona fides before the local bank manager will give the overdraft. Clearly, it is a position which is not healthy from the point of view of this country.  There is the further factor, as far as the policy of our commercial banks is concerned, that they take in other people's money and charge them for looking after it, receiving it and paying it out.  On the basis of those deposits, they make credit available to their customers but it is left to the good sense of the banking directors as to what relationship will be maintained between the credits they make available and the deposits.  Those arrangements are largely determined by the directors and the orthodox policy of the banks.  It may be a very good policy from the point of view of the banks' shareholders, but it may be an equally bad policy from the point of view of the interests and development of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true, so far as the banks are concerned, that they are quite at liberty to expand and reduce <Col N="1137" /> the amount of available money in the country by the process of their credit operations.  I think that we should be very interested in this question.  If that power is exercised, as it is, by a group of private individuals, is there a good reason why we should not examine the possibility of having that same power to expand and reduce our credit to meet changes in the economic situation of the country, have it brought under a more direct national control, where it would be directly associated with the national policy being pursued in regard to the general expansion of the country's wealth and activities?</P>
    <P>Some Deputy suggested that a very grave warning should be issued to the banks and that they should be told that they would be nationalised if they did not behave themselves.  Everybody in this country dreads the word nationalisation, and yet sitting opposite me in the person of the Tánaiste is one of the greatest nationalisers we have had so far.  He has done it on a practical basis because he is convinced of a practical proposition that certain undertakings can be carried on best only under national ownership.  When we speak of the danger facing the banks&mdash;that some day we may nationalise them&mdash; I do not think we should get lost in social theories revolving around this word nationalisation.  The Electricity Supply Board is such a vital economic factor in our whole economy that, quite clearly, its proper functioning could only take place under direct over-all national control, and we should bear in mind, when we come to deal with such an equally fundamental factor in our economy as banking, and the control of our credit, the possibility, if not of the nationalisation of our banks, at least of the creation of some instrument which would be available to the Government so as to enable them to have the same powers as a small group of private individuals now wield.</P>
    <P>Surely that is not asking too much. Even from the most conservative of services, clearly, in the present situation we have had a lot of heart-searching, even from business men, <Col N="1138" /> with regard to the role of the banks, feeling that the power which is in the hands of the board of directors of our banks is too great to be exercised by a group of private individuals not subject to any public control or required to conform to any social requirements in respect of economics and industrial development.</P>
    <P>If that is the case with the conservative business men who want us to keep our hands off private property, surely those of us in public life who feel charged with the responsibility of the community as a whole should pay stricter and more careful attention to this most important sphere of our general economic activity and see if it is not possible to induce our people to place a portion of their resources with some institution, such as a State bank, which would make it possible for the Government to utilise these resources over a long period for the purpose of long-term planning, and which would enable the Government to make available credit in the same way and in the same manner as the private banks do to the small business man on the basis that many other people are placing deposits in the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>Actually, the main issue before the House is not the Report of the Central Bank but the Supplies and Services Bill.  I do not think that we serve any useful purpose by trying to convince one another as to which of us said we were going to reduce the cost of living more.  I feel that we are both somewhat to blame.  I still believe, as I have stated before, that prices to-day could be lower than what they are, even though I believe, in regard to prices on the world market, that they would have risen over the 1939 prices.</P>
    <P>I am a trades union official.  If I am sitting on a tribunal and a number of workers come before me and ask for an increase in wages, it is more than likely that I will grant them that increase. I may examine their applications very carefully, but my sympathies will be with them.  In the same way if a group of manufacturers and traders put their case before a tribunal consisting of manufacturers and traders, it is more than likely that they will get the increase sought.  I think that in the <Col N="1139" /> present situation, while we do not make the workers go before a body which does not believe in wage increases, we should insist that the machinery we are going to use to control prices is composed of men and women who feel it their duty to be opposed to increases in prices unless these increases are more than proved to be necessary.  In other words, the onus should be on the applicant.  I think there is good reason for that.</P>
    <P>The present tribunal, I think it can be said, has served a definite purpose. I think their report in the paper to-day &mdash;I am not expressing any opinion on the merits of the claim&mdash;indicates that they are serving an educational purpose, in so far as they enable the public to understand the factors that enter into the composition of prices.  I think, however, much more than that could be done.  So far as the tribunal is concerned, it should be almost completely the procedure that all applications should be heard in public and while I agree that the ultimate responsibility for making decisions must remain with the Minister, I personally think that again it should be the exception that the Minister would make a decision to increase prices without having a recommendation from the tribunal.  I recall the Minister for Industry and Commerce said in regard to recent increases that he had such recommendations but I feel that the obligation to compel those seeking increases to go before the tribunal to sustain their case is not sufficiently stringent.</P>
    <P>I think that all of us are aware that the system of costings necessary to arrive at final prices which exists in practically all our industries and distributive trades, is such that on reading over the whole list, it is possible to find relatively small additions and percentages creeping in, which, in the total, represent quite a considerable portion of the final cost.  It is along these lines that closer examination should be made.  I recall that in the case of certain applicants who applied for price increases, and who were not small business men who might be excused on the grounds that they had not got the facilities to prepare complete <Col N="1140" /> and proper costings&mdash;these were representatives of some of the largest industries in the country&mdash;on examination before the tribunal they had to admit that they did not even know what they paid for the containers in which they sold their goods.  That is unforgivable.  Others appeared and made claims for certain allowances, and when challenged on the figures they were putting forward, they said it was an unusual case.  That is equally unforgivable.</P>
    <P>We had a case in regard to another industry, and a member of the tribunal pointed out that figures, not available to the tribunal, clearly indicated that within the industry a considerable number of firms had made what could be regarded as excessive profits.  There was a long argument as to whether these figures should be made available to the tribunal because they come from the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That, I do not think, is the important feature. The important feature is that those figures were figures which had been examined by the prices section, not for one year, but year after year.  They were figures on which increases had been allowed, and yet a member of that independent tribunal could take these same figures and maintain on them that there had been excessive profits.  That is why I say that while I do not suggest that in the present world situation we could avoid higher prices, I still believe we could have lower prices to-day for many commodities than at present operate.</P>
    <P>It is not merely a question of finding proper machinery to control prices; it is, above all, a question of having adequate machinery, the personnel of which believe it their duty to refuse to grant any price increases unless the case is proven, not even 100 per cent. but 105 per cent., because we have had the background since 1939 in which the possibility of securing a price increase was fairly large. Ordinary economic conditions tended towards that.  I am not entering into the old argument as to the responsibility of the present Minister for that, as I do not wish to go over old ground, but we all know that there was a succession of increases, one after <Col N="1141" /> another, and I think it time that we started to put on the brake.  I have pointed out on numerous occasions that when a worker wants an increase in his wages which his employer is not willing to give him he has to go before the Labour Court and he has got to make a very good case before he gets it.  However facile that may have been in the early days, it has got pretty tough of late, and it should be equally tough for the manufacturer who wishes to get an increase in the price of the commodity which he produces.</P>
    <P>That is the only comment I want to make in regard to prices, but I would urge on the Minister that the tribunal that has been established&mdash;I know he is not committed to it finally&mdash;should be given not merely a reasonable period in which to show its value but that it should have his support, and, above all, the support of his officers in the prices section so that when applicants go before the tribunal they will realise that they are going into a court in which, if you would like to put it that way, they are presumed guilty and they have got to prove themselves innocent.  If we can, as the Tánaiste hopes, arrive at some price stability, some other problems will become easier than they will be if we are going to have this continuous spiraling of prices with unfortunate workers chasing after them with demands for still higher wages.</P>

      <P>It would appear to me that this House and probably the country as a whole has gained considerable benefit from the debate as it has developed over the last few weeks. Probably that benefit might have been greater if the speeches coming from the ministerial benches had been of a more objective character.  We have witnessed in the last few weeks, since the debate commenced, a remarkable and striking example of the effective use to which an Opposition Party can be put in a modern democracy.  The part which the Opposition has played in the last few weeks since the Dáil reassembled, and prior to its reassembly, in bringing the Government to its senses and in putting forward the facts of the economic situation, <Col N="1142" /> without prejudice and in a cold, objective fashion is, I think, a remarkable, and probably an extraordinary, example of the effective role which an Opposition Party can play in a modern democracy.</P>
      <P>Speeches made by the Minister for Finance and by the Tánaiste have been quoted here from time to time by Opposition speakers.  I propose to quote them again very briefly, not for the purpose of making any political capital out of the statements that were made&mdash;I think, incidentally, if we did wish to make political capital out of them, considerable use could be made of them in that way&mdash;but merely to point out to the House the nature of the problem which was put to the country by the Ministers when they made these speeches, to show how that problem was distorted by ministerial speeches and to demonstrate by facts published in their own White Paper and contained in their own statements and in the Report of the Central Bank, that the conclusions which they drew from these figures were false and misleading. That would appear to have been a deliberate course of conduct in order to gain either some sort of political capital from these deductions or to discredit their opponents.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Price of Creamery Milk&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, having regard to the existing costs of production, the present prices paid to the producer for milk supplied to creameries and for milk sold for human consumption are inadequate and that immediate steps should be taken to increase the price so as to give the producer the cost of production plus a fair profit.&mdash; (Deputies Ccrry and Cogan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the very outset I would like to express my amazement that the movers of this motion continue to address their remarks <Col N="1143" /> to it since the Minister, in reply to a question put down here by Deputy Palmer and myself, assured us that it was his intention to set up an expert and impartial authority to go into the matter of costings in relation to the dairying industry and to do so at a very early date.  We accepted that promise in good faith.  What construction, therefore, can we put on the continuance of this motion other than that the Deputies who proposed and seconded it either have a lack of confidence in the word of the Minister on their own side of the House or that it is an arrangement that they be provided with a platform to air their views.</P>
      <P>So far we have had a contribution from the proposer and seconder of the motion and from the Minister for Agriculture.  I must say that I was pleased with the confident note struck by the Minister for Agriculture.  It would seem that he has become enthused with a little confidence in the Department for which he is now responsible. His attitude is a complete reversal of the doleful and sad prognostications which we were accustomed to hear from him and his colleagues when they were in opposition.  However, I do not agree with everything he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 14th of this month he repeated a falsehood in this House&mdash; column 805 of the Official Report of the Dáil Debates&mdash;that, actually, no increase had been granted between 1947 and 1951 in the price of milk.  He failed to advert to the fact that in 1947 the farmers were leaving their skim milk to the creameries at a price of 2d. per gallon although production in that year was only 154,250,000 gallons.  In 1948, when the inter-Party Government took office, production increased under the aegis of Deputy Dillon who was then Minister for Agriculture to 170,000,000 gallons.  In 1949 it reached the all-time high figure of 206,750,000 gallons.  That indicates that the industry was making steady progress. Side by side with that, although a higher price was obtainable for the skim milk at the creameries, the farmers were taking home all they <Col N="1144" /> could get of that commodity because, as a result of the 1948 trade agreement, they were able to feed that skim milk to calves, young pigs, poultry and so forth&mdash;which is something which they could not do in 1947.</P>
    <P>The Minister was naïve in suggesting to the Opposition that his Party would not avail of this matter for the purpose of achieving cheap popularity because the problem of the dairying industry was the spearhead of the political campaign in the south of Ireland in the recent general election.  In the country, the inter-Party Government was pilloried as having neglected the interests of the dairy farmer.  The people went to the polls on that issue. In my own constituency of North Cork and in West Cork, East Cork, South Kerry, North Kerry, Limerick, Clare and all the dairying counties the inter-Party Government was given an overwhelming mandate to maintain the policy which they were implementing on behalf of the dairying industry and all sections in relation to agriculture as well as other Departments.  A different attitude was adopted in Cork City in relation to dairying.  It was put up to the citizens of Cork City that the inter-Party Government were remiss in adding an impost of 2d. per lb. on the price of butter to the unfortunate consumer. It is hardly necessary to dwell on what the consumer has suffered since.</P>
    <P>The Minister further stated that he is not aware of the economic price of milk and that he has no proof that the present price is not an economic one. When he was in opposition he was quite emphatic in advocating a price of 1/6 per gallon.  Of course, that price to-day would bear no comparison to the costs of production as they are now.  I intend to indicate some increases that have taken place since then.  I have the word of the proposer of the motion that the last increase granted in the price of milk has been completely absorbed by the increase in wages and by further increases affecting the dairying industry.  Deputy Corry makes incessant play in this House of the importation of butter. The Minister was quite right to reprove him and in pointing out that the reason for it is the increased standard of <Col N="1145" /> living of our people.  Over the past four years the consumption of butter has increased by one and a-half ounces per head of the population.  Of course, another contributing factor is the expansion which has taken place in our export trade of chocolate crumb, dried milk and condensed milk.  The Minister, however, was not correct in stating that the chocolate crumb industry in my area was not expanded in recent years.  I hope he will turn a deaf ear on those Deputies sitting on the Government benches who advocate a restriction in output of these valuable exports.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that, so far, not one reference has been made by any contributor to this discussion in support of a scheme to increase the gallonage of our dairy herds.  Some form of embarrassment seems to permeate the Government Benches in this connection. There was no reference to schemes introduced by the last Minister for Agriculture&mdash;schemes such as the land project, the Local Authorities (Works) Act, the Farm Buildings Scheme, cheaper ground limestone, a scheme for the elimination of uneconomic cattle, a scheme for a more scientific approach to the improvement of the soil of this country, the striking advances which have been made in the matter of veterinary attention to our dairy herds, and many other schemes also.  The Minister stated that the reduction which we experienced last year was attributable to the weather conditions.  I was very glad to hear that honest statement and to know that the Minister concurred with Deputy Murphy when he made that suggestion, because when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture he was even alleged to be responsible for the bad weather.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Minister to facilitate the extension of the erection of silos. I believe we would not be affected so much by weather conditions if we went in more for ensilage.  I also ask the Minister, in the administration of his Department, to employ every means at his disposal to develop cow testing schemes, so as to make it attractive for farmers to ascertain the correct milk yields of their individual cows.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> So far, my remarks have indicated progress, but we must now look at the other side of the picture.  Production costs continue to increase to a disturbing extent.  This is noticeable to an alarming degree in the prices of properly balanced feeding rations for dairy cattle.</P>
    <P>Labour costs have already been adverted to.  The mover of the motion was quite correct in saying that the last increase was completely absorbed in consequence.  A labouring man is taken up for a half day in transporting the milk to the creamery.  Difficulties in securing milkers to return on Sundays and holidays are increasing more and more.  Milking machines, when properly manipulated, are proving a great boon in relieving the situation.  The House must appreciate, however, that the small farmer cannot afford to avail of this amenity.  High interest loans and their purchase have been pertinently adverted to to-day by Deputy Finucane.  I believe that the reply he received from the Minister was not encouraging in that respect.</P>
    <P>We are all in complete agreement that the grasslands of our country require a considerable amount of fertilisers.  Present prices, which, we are told, may be surpassed in a month's time, place manures outside the capabilities of our farmers to purchase.  Restriction of credit to merchants in the present crisis is adding still more to the difficulties attending this situation.  Transport costs&mdash;I am referring to the cost of transport of milk to creameries&mdash; continue to present an ever-increasing problem.  The humble ass cart, spring car or converted truck, which are utilised, have all rocketed in price in recent months.  Insurance and petrol are hitting the hardest, while repairs, whether at garage, forge or carpentry works, run up closely the initial cost of these.</P>
    <P>Progressing from the question of costs, overheads present another disturbing picture.  The amount of rates payable to local authorities has increased by alarming proportions.  The last White Paper was issued in 1947 <Col N="1147" /> setting the price at that time.  I am not advocating the slightest curtailment in the many schemes of social necessity, but it would be only just to suggest that expenditure, such as the upkeep of main roads, mental hospitals and vocational education, should be borne by the State.</P>
    <P>I am indeed surprised that the promoters of this motion omitted one very strong argument in favour of immediate remedial action by the Government in granting a fair margin of profit to the creamery suppliers. We hear every section complaining of the increase in the price of this, that and the other thing.  I contend that the tradesman, professional man and merchant have a steady income in the winter months with certain exceptions. Generally speaking, they have a steady income, but in the case of the small dairy farmer there is not a penny to be got from the creamery throughout the whole of the winter months. During those months he has to rely on the merchants in the small towns and villages and on his co-operative society to facilitate him with credit until such time as the cows come into milk again and the cheques once again are available to meet the debts which he incurred over the winter months. Therefore, the impact of the cost of living at the present moment is as much a concern to the small dairy farmer as it is to any other section of the community.  I am sure it was an inadvertence on the part of Deputy Corry and Deputy Cogan that they forgot to refer to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which should be well borne in mind by the Government. In 1947, when this White Paper was issued, there was no competition from the fattening industry.  Consequently, the price prevailing then was not subjected to the same competition and farmers maintained their dairy herds because they had no other means from which to derive a livelihood.  The position to-day is very different.  I know that.  Even some of the most progressive farmers in my constituency, as indicated by the returns from the Munster bull sales, are to-day purchasing <Col N="1148" /> Hereford bulls which is an indication that it is their intention to leave dairying and go in for fattening.  That is not a happy augury in our present situation.  Neither is it that tattooed heifers are taken into the open fairs and sold there.  That, of course, indicates that the farmer takes in the good animal because he is caught up for cash.</P>
    <P>Although we accept and appreciate the Minister's guarantee that this board will be formed in the very near future, nevertheless, we know from experience that their deliberations will last over quite some period.  Consequently, I would suggest that a tribunal be set up which would be in a position to go into the matter much quicker and to make an interim report to the Minister so that the board, which is contemplated, will have more time to go into the many facets of our dairying industry and provide whatever Minister will be in office, when the report is available, with all the required statistics and all the facts which will clear away from the political scene all this question of making political capital out of the difficulties which attend the dairying farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion.  I hope that the Minister will accept it and do something about it immediately.  I think the general difficulty we have had to face in this country as regards dairying up to the present is that we always acted too late.  We waited until the industry had gone down to such an extent that it is very difficult to get it back into production again.  That has happened in the past and it seems to be the policy adopted all along the line.  Some years ago, Deputy Dillon boomed with his usual Churchillian thunder that the farmers who were not able to produce milk at 1/- per gallon were lazy and ignorant fellows.  At the same time, he boasted that he had increased the cost of production and agricultural wages by 33? per cent. He boasted that he had been responsible for other amenities and facilities to the agricultural workers and at the same time he said the farmers should be able to produce their milk at 2d. a gallon less, in spite of the increases of which he <Col N="1149" /> boasted.  The result was that production decreased and we had to import butter last year.  I understand that at the moment we have an order for 6,000 tons of imported butter this year which is not produced by farmers who are getting 1/- a gallon for their milk.</P>
      <P>As regards this costings committee that the Minister has spoken of, we have been hearing about that for a very long time.  The Minister for Agriculture is the fourth Minister who promised the costings committee.  Deputy Dr. Ryan promised it some years ago. The present Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, promised it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also told us that he was going to set up a costings committee.  Now the Minister for Agriculture says that in the course of a week or so he will be able to give us the personnel of that committee. Even if the Minister does give us the personnel a great deal of work will have to be done before the committee starts its costings survey and, even assuming that they are able to start their survey in April or May of next year, it will take over 12 months to collect the data and some months more to correlate them and get the information we seek.  Acceptance of this motion in terms of saying that a costings committee will be set up in the near future means that nothing is going to happen for about two years, and if that is what the Minister's proposal in regard to this committee is, I do not think it is going to be any good and I think we are going to continue to import butter for some time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks who can say what is the price.  The Minister has facts and information in his Department; he has costings carried out by the Cork Milk Producers' Association in his Department; he has costings carried out by the Mitchelstown Co-operative Creamery in his Department; and he could get the costings carried out by various universities in Scotland and England.  I am not suggesting that he can take these costings and say: <Col N="1150" />&ldquo;That is the price,&rdquo; but he can get all the quantitative data he wants from them.  He can get the number of manhours, the quantities of feeding-stuffs, and so on, and can scale these up to present-day prices.  It is quite easy for him, if he is really anxious to get a sound basis upon which to fix the price of milk, to do it immediately without waiting for two or three years, when there will be very little milk in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowe" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this motion for an increase in the price of milk.  The House will agree that agriculture is our basic industry. Eighty per cent. of the wealth of the country springs, directly or indirectly, from agriculture, and costs of production have gone up enormously in the past year or two, and particularly in the past year.  Artificial manures, to mention only one item, have gone up 100 per cent.  I bought North African mineral manure at £6 15s. 0d. a ton this time 12 months ago and it is £14 to-day.  Concentrate has gone up enormously as well, as have also wages.  It is a seven-day week job for the 12 months of the year, with no half-holiday and no Sunday off, and you have to be on the job all the time. It is a paying proposition for only six months.  You get a return of cash for six months, and, for the other six months, you are handing out.</P>
      <P>Dairying, as Deputies will agree, is the bedrock of the agricultural industry. It is the pivot around which the industry swings, and, if the dairying industry goes down, the whole agricultural industry goes down.  From the point of view of employment, dairying gives more employment than any other branch of the industry, and I appeal to the Minister to grant this increase and give a guarantee for five years, so that the dairy farmers can plan ahead.  It has scarcely ever been known that a dairy farmer who went out of production returned, because the cost is too great, and it is, therefore, in the interest of the State and of the community that the dairy farmers should get a reasonable price for their milk.  They will then be in a position to buy what industry produces.</P>

      <P>I should like first to congratulate the Opposition Front Bench on their attendance here and on the attention they have paid to this motion.  When one looks across and sees a large number of intelligent gentlemen carefully listening to the arguments being put up, one realises how deeply interested they are.  I should like also to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture for Formosa on his presence and on his contribution to the debate.</P>
      <P>One thing is absolutely clear, as the Minister made very plain when he said he was groping in the dark as regards costings.  I want to make one submission in that regard, namely, that some three years ago I was kind enough to post to the then Minister for Agriculture a copy of Professor Murphy's costings on milk.  Professor Murphy afterwards told me that another copy had been sent to the Minister by University College, Cork, but when I asked the present Minister if any copy of Professor Murphy's costings on milk were in his Department, he said there were not.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister for Formosa would be kind enough to restore to the Department the only costings in relation to milk taken in this country, costings which, to my mind, he had no right to remove.  They were sent by me to the Minister as Minister for Agriculture so that he could learn something about the troubles which farmers who have to produce milk are suffering from and one would think that a document of that description would be left by the ex-Minister on his withdrawal.  One would think that he had done damage enough to the agricultural community and that, on his removal from office, he would at least leave behind him these costings.  He was not satisfied with taking one copy; he took two. The copy he got from the university in Cork and the copy I sent him were both taken home.  I hope his absence to-day means that he is somewhere doing penance for the injustice and wrong he did the agricultural community during the past three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to congratulate the <Col N="1152" /> two Deputies on the opposite benches who spoke and who now advocate supporting an increase in that price.  Considering that Deputy O'Sullivan when he was speaking here told us all about the verdict of the people in North Cork, surely when those people put him in here as Deputy, one of the principal planks on his platform was a 1/- a gallon for five years, put forward by his Minister, Deputy Dillon?  This would be only the second year of the five under which the farmers were to produce milk at 1/- which is 2d. per gallon less than Deputy Paddy Smith gave us in 1947 when he was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister was working in the dark, and that the Minister for Formosan Sugar did not leave this document in the Department and enable him to have some light on his subject.  As regards the arguments put up, the only Deputy who opposed the motion was Deputy Flanagan.  He is conspicuous here for a number of years as a Deputy who never produced anything and never will.  He wants the producers to feed him, to produce milk for him, to produce butter, bacon and eggs for him and hand them to him on a platter, so that he may sit down and eat them and complain very bitterly about the price he has to pay.</P>

Had they done that, a number of decent dairy herds in North Cork, in the Deputy's constituency, would not have been sold out, and there would not be so many of these Hereford bulls coming in.  They came in in despair.  They did not <Col N="1153" /> believe me when I said we were going to get rid of brother James so quickly.</P>

It is rather a pity that Deputy O'Sullivan did not use his kind influence on him.  When Deputy O'Sullivan was travelling North Cork a few months ago&mdash;in fact, I heard him in Fermoy; he made a trip over to see me &mdash;he advocated 1/- a gallon, guaranteed for five years.  This is only the second year of the five in which the farmers were to produce milk at 1/- a gallon, so there would be three more years of purgatory to go through, only for the Minister for Formosa being deprived of office.</P>
      <P>That does not change the position. When the Minister told us he was groping in the dark, he said he had no proof that the present price is not an economic price and no proof that it is an economic price.  I have given the figures as borne out by the costings and I have given the increases since. I have also pointed out that this country may very well find itself in the self-same position as regards butter that it finds itself in to-day as regards sugar, where the unfortunate consuming public have to pay an extra 1d. a pound for their sugar.</P>

      <P>I will relate it to the motion very quickly.  In fact, it is far more closely related to it, as the two <Col N="1154" /> by-products of beet&mdash;beet-tops and pulp&mdash;go very largely into the production of milk, far nearer than even ground limestone or the reclamation scheme which sunk a few million pounds in a bog.  However, I am pointing out that the situation created among the farming community by a wrong price for milk might very well have the same result as the situation created by the previous Government when they refused in 1949 an increase of 4/6 per ton on beet.  That resulted in bringing into the country 93,000 tons of foreign sugar which is now costing the consuming public a 1d. a lb. more than Irish sugar produced in the factories here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We paid £837,000 more for that sugar than we paid to our own people and you could very well have the self same result with regard to milk.  I have here the statement made by the creamery managers of Deputy O'Sullivan's constituency on the 13th June last when they were dealing with the situation which would be created through Deputy Dillon's refusal to pay an economic price for milk.  They pointed out that the quantity of creamery butter produced this year would be at least 15 per cent. down on last year's production.  They also pointed out that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present sterling equivalent of creamery butter prices in the United States, Canada, Belgium and Germany to-day ranged from 449/3 to 550/- per cwt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the net result of three years during which the dairy farmers of this country had their backs to the wall and were pounded by increased costs of production each week, each month and each year, and were met by a Minister who believed in the policy of bringing the stuff in from abroad.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not long here.  If the Deputy takes my tip he will play a bit tougher.  If not, he will be missing next time.  I am telling him <Col N="1155" /> as an old hand that he will not be so long at all in that job.</P>
      <P>That is the danger I see and people like Deputy Flanagan who howl because the farmer gets 2d. a lb. on his butter might very well see their constituents paying an extra 1/- or 1/6 for butter and paying the foreigner for that as we paid for the sugar.  That is the situation which could very easily be produced.  Deputy O'Sullivan alluded to it when he told us about the dairy heifers being sold and the Hereford bulls brought in.  The farmer of to-day is not the foolish man who did as his grandfather did.  Those days are gone.  The farmer of to-day is not going to produce milk if it does not pay him.  The only reason you have any quantity of milk in the country is the reluctance of farmers with dairy herds to do away with the years of toil, trouble and care which it took to build up a decent milk-producing herd. That is the only reason.</P>
      <P>You have a Department of Agriculture which is a joke.  It is supposed to desire the improvement of our dairy herds but it spends thousands of pounds every year on premiums for Aberdeen-Angus and Hereford bulls&mdash; to improve dairy herds!  It refuses to give any premium whatever to the milk-breeding breeds of this country. Reading the proposals and suggestions sent down to county committees of agriculture by the Department of Agriculture you would think that the Department of Agriculture was staffed by Scotchmen who are looking for Scotch beef bulls and apparently every Minister who goes in there has been inoculated with the needle.  They talk about Shorthorn dairy cattle and every second generation a Scotch beef bull is brought in to keep up the appearance and reduce the milk yield.  I never saw more craziness from any Department of State in my lifetime than I have seen coming from the self-same Department of Agriculture.  If the Minister takes my advice, he will get rid, and quickly, too, of the advisers who are advising him on his live-stock scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that this motion has brought from the Minister the <Col N="1156" /> response of his undertaking immediately to set up a costings board. We will then know and the people will be glad to have some knowledge of the costs of production of milk and butter. We will not be placed in the position of having Deputies like Deputy MacBride howling around the country about the farmers and the prices they are getting for butter and the cost of butter to the consumer.</P>

      <P>Deputies go shouting through the country when any increase is given.  The same Deputies who howled about the 2d. per lb. on butter had, in the same week, 4d. per lb. on margarine and they did not say a word about it.  The same Deputies will safely troop into the Lobby on every question which will further increase the cost of production to the farming community.  Whether it be for social services or anything else, they will blow up the rates and have no hesitation in that at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister has guaranteed that prices will be reduced between now and April next.  He also states that he will have the advantage of having a costing organisation in operation long before then.  It should be in operation, he says, before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister will have an opportunity between now and April of reviewing the cost of production of milk.  I should like the Minister to consider that there is a very wide <Col N="1157" /> difference between the production of milk on grass and the production of milk for winter consumption, and there is a very wide difference between the farmer who, as was pointed out by Deputy Crowe to-day, has no income for six months, whose beasts are fed on grass for six months and during the other six months are dry, and the farmer who must have 30 or 40 gallons of milk for his retailer or customer on Christmas Day just the same as he has in the month of June.  That difference was very clearly indicated by Professor Murphy.  At that period I think the cost was 18.45d. per gallon for seven months of the year and 8.10d. for the other five months-that is a difference of 10d. a gallon between the summer production and the winter production, and that is what I would like the Minister to take into consideration. I am sure that if the Minister has had the advice of Professor Murphy, who prepared those costings, he will know that that is the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a definite guarantee here that he will revise prices between now and then.  He has also told us that he is now setting up a costings board and that he has already found a man to take charge of the costings board.  That means that we will get it.  Deputy Lehane was quite right.  We have been promised that costings board here for a number of years.  We were promised it by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Dillon came along in high glee and told us: &ldquo;Yes, you will get a costings board.  Certainly I will set it up and find out the costings of everything on the farm.&rdquo; Everything on the farm would be costed according to Deputy Dillon while he was shoving up the costs to the farmer but he was adamant when a motion was brought in to increase the price of milk and he trooped the whole regiment into the Lobby against it.  For three years and a couple of months he was adamant on the price until he found that he was departing and then on his death bed he willed the old farmer a penny a gallon. &ldquo;Go home and God bless you.  You are getting a penny a gallon more.&rdquo;  That was the week before he departed.  As a matter <Col N="1158" /> of fact, the candles were lighting around the corpse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that a Select Committee of the House should be appointed to examine and report to the Dáil on the question of the desirability of the abolition of capital punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I want to make clear at the outset is that in this motion I have refrained from asking the House to commit itself to the abolition of capital <Col N="1159" /> punishment.  My only request at this stage is that the House should set up a committee to examine the question and report back to the House.  I hope that this motion can be considered away from any atmosphere of Party controversy and that we may be able to approach this topic objectively and without any unnecessary conflict among different Parties in the House.  If the House adopts the motion there will be a later opportunity, naturally, to consider in much greater detail and with a great deal more preparation the substantive proposals that may emanate from the committee that is set up.</P>
    <P>Presumably, too, the Select Committee set up by the House will have an opportunity of obtaining all the relevant data relating to capital punishment.  A matter of this kind would be better considered by a committee of the House than by a specially constituted commission.  It is essentially a matter upon which Deputies would be in a position to exercise judgment and also to sense the public opinion of the country.</P>
    <P>It is probably no exaggeration to say that the concept of capital punishment had its origin in barbarism.  Originally it was based on the concept of revenge&mdash;private revenge in the first place, which gave place gradually with the organisation of society to a more organised form of revenge. That outlook persisted over a very considerable period of time.  Gradually the revenge motive ceased or was, shall we say, placed more in the background, and gave way to the concept of punishment. But even for a period of time the concept of punishment was not very far removed from the original idea of revenge.  Gradually, as time went on, it became more necessary probably to justify capital punishment, and different reasons were given for it. One reason given was that it was used as a deterrent, as a preventive.  That applied not merely to capital punishment, but to other forms of penal punishment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the position in Ireland of having adopted the penal code and a great many other institutions here without really examining them on their merits.  They were part of the legal and political structure handed to us at the time that we obtained control of our own affairs. By reason of many historical factors that occurred immediately afterwards there was never any objective examination of that penal code, and in a great many respects our penal code at the moment&mdash;our legal code generally, I might say&mdash;is very out-dated, because whereas in England a great many alterations have been made in the legal code generally and in the penal code also, we have not kept pace with the alterations that have been made. I do not say that by way of criticism of this House or of Governments.  I am merely suggesting it as a fact which I think any lawyer knows.  The same, I think, applies to our punishment code.</P>
      <P>If the question were put to us at the time we obtained control of our own affairs, I doubt whether we would have adopted capital punishment.  I think that very few of those who composed the first Dáil and the second Dáil would in those days have considered the adoption of capital punishment. The natural tendency would have been against it.  I doubt, too, whether the people of the country, if the matter were referred to them, would be particularly anxious for capital punishment. It has been associated in the course of our history with many events which caused a revulsion of feeling amongst our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many grounds upon which one can attack capital punishment, there are many grounds on which one can defend it and I do not propose to review all these grounds here.  I propose to mention some of the principal ones that would influence my viewpoint in considering this question. The first one, and it is one which may <Col N="1161" /> not be shared by many, is that I take the view that if the State assumes the right to take life and gives effect to that decision it is not unlikely that other persons, possibly persons who very often are not well balanced, persons who are not normal&mdash;and it is mainly people who are not normal who commit crime&mdash;may not realise that they have not got the same right as the State.</P>
    <P>I am not denying the right of the State to take life.  I think the State has that right, but that it should limit the exercise of that right to cases where it is essential for the preservation of society.  I do not think that the State should ever take life unless it is absolutely necessary for the preservation of society.  Certainly, it should not take life by way of revenge. It should not take life by way of punishment, merely for the sake of inflicting punishment.  The only circumstances in which the State is entitled to take life I think is where it is the only way left by which the State can protect society.</P>
    <P>The minute the State takes life, a person who is not well balanced may well argue to himself in justification, quite wrongly and illogically: &ldquo;If the Government are entitled to execute somebody, to take life, why am I not entitled to do it?&rdquo;  I am not saying that that is a valid argument.  I do not think it is a good argument, but it is an argument that certainly the unbalanced mind will readily put forward.</P>
    <P>Linked with this particular argument is the question as to whether or not capital punishment is a deterrent. I think that experience has proved in those countries where capital punishment has been done away with that capital crimes have not increased.  On the contrary, in many of these countries capital crimes have decreased.  It is very difficult to be ever absolutely certain that an increase or a decrease in crime is due to any particular change in the form of punishment or in the law that prevails.  Be that as it may, I think it is fairly clear that there has been no substantial increase in capital offences in countries where capital punishment has been abolished.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I left a notebook in <Col N="1162" /> which I had some notes on this subject at home, and I have not now got with me a full list of the countries where capital punishment has been done away with; but, broadly speaking, I think the position is that capital punishment has been done away with in the Scandinavian countries&mdash;Sweden, Norway, Denmark &mdash;in Holland and Belgium, and I think in most of the Swiss Cantons, not all of them, and in a number of other European countries, including Italy in recent times.  It has also been done away with in a number of States in the United States of America&mdash;in Michigan, Rhode Island, Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kansas, North Dakota and South Dakota.  Most of the central and South American Republics have also done away with capital punishment.  In quite a number of countries it has been abolished, except in relation to the crime of treason in time of war or emergency.</P>
    <P>It does appear to me that the experience of these countries points to the fact that the abolition of capital punishment has not led to any increase in serious crimes.  Reverting, then, again to the proposition I propounded a few moments ago that the State should only take away life where it is absolutely necessary for the preservation of society, a query is immediately raised in our minds as to whether or not, in view of the experience gained in other countries, the maintenance of capital punishment is necessary here for the preservation of society.</P>
    <P>In many respects I think capital punishment creates a morbid attraction which, on occasion, actually helps to promote crime.  I have had a good deal of experience in criminal cases and I have often come across criminals who had a morbid desire for publicity coupled with a morbid interest in capital charges.  I think that has been the experience of a great many lawyers who practise in the criminal courts.  Capital charges certainly arouse a morbid and unhealthy interest in the minds of a large section of the public, an interest which I think ought not to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>In the course of this discussion I <Col N="1163" /> hope that some of my colleagues here who are lawyers will express their views on this particular matter.  I have not really discussed the matter with any of my lawyer colleagues but I would like to warn the House in advance against their views because it has been the experience in most countries, and certainly in England, that lawyers as a whole and judges in particular, have always been strongly in favour of the retention of capital punishment.  In the past they were strongly in favour of maintaining capital punishment for the offence of larceny.</P>
    <P>The House will remember no doubt that up to 120 years ago a person could be executed for stealing 5/- or over. There were no less than 200 offences on the Statute Book in respect of which persons could be executed.  Various efforts were made in England&mdash;not here, of course, because we had not control over our own destiny&mdash;to remove the death penalty from a number of these offences.  All efforts made for the abolition of the death penalty from this long string of minor offences were strenuously opposed for a period of about 20 years by the judges and by some of the leading lawyers in England.</P>
    <P>It might be well that I should refer the House now to some of the statements that were then made by the then British Lord Chancellor when dealing with capital punishment.  Lord Ellenborough, speaking in the British House of Lords on a measure dealing with the abolition of capital punishment in regard to larceny said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I trust that your Lordships will pause before you assent to an experiment pregnant with danger to the security of property, and before you repeal a statute which has so long been held necessary for public security.  I am convinced with the rest of the judges, public expediency requires that there should be no remission of the terror denounced against this description of offenders. Such will be the consequence of the repeal of this statute that I am certain depredations to an unlimited <Col N="1164" /> extent would be immediately committed.</P>
    <P>My Lords, if we suffer this Bill to pass, we shall not know where we stand: we shall not know whether we are on our heads or our feet, Repeal this law and see the contrast&mdash;no man can trust himself for an hour out of doors without the most alarming apprehensions that on his return, every vestige of his property will be swept off by the hardened robber.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position was such that a Select Committee was set up by the British House of Commons to examine the whole position and this Select Committee published a report in 1819 dealing with the opposition of the judges and the lawyers.</P>
    <P>This paragraph from their report I think is applicable probably to the present day as regards judges and lawyers. I am not saying that in derogation of the profession, but I think it explains probably their attitude on the matter. I quote from this report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Highly as the committee esteem and respect the judges, it is not from them that the most accurate and satisfactory evidence of the effect of the penal law can reasonably be expected. They only see the exterior of criminal proceedings after they are brought into a court of justice. Of the cases which never appear there, and of the causes which prevent their appearance, they can know nothing.  Of the motives which influence the testimony of witnesses, they can form but a hasty and inadequate estimate.  Even in the grounds of verdicts, they may often be deceived. From any opportunity of observing the influence of punishment upon those classes of men among whom malefactors are most commonly found, the judges are, by their stations and duties, placed at a great distance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that already, 100 years ago, the British House of Commons reached the conclusion that lawyers' views and judges' views on this question were not necessarily the most useful views to have.  It was, as a result of the establishment of this Select Committee, that, I think, in the year 1820, capital <Col N="1165" /> punishment in respect of larceny was done away with.</P>
    <P>Another reason which certainly influences my viewpoint in approaching this whole subject is my lack of absolute confidence in human judgment. I think that the courts and the judges, like Governments, are all quite liable to make mistakes, and often do make mistakes.  It is just too bad when a mistake is made in regard to a man who has been executed.  It is all right when a man has only been sent to prison.  Here, in this City of Dublin, we have had in recent years, at least, I think, two cases in which men were convicted of different offences after trial by a judge and jury, and sentenced to various terms of penal servitude.  In one of these cases, if my memory does not lead me astray, the trial judge said that he agreed entirely with the jury's verdict.  Yet, after these two men had served a period of their sentences, it was found that there had been a miscarriage of justice, and they had to be released by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I suppose these mistakes are unavoidable, and one does not blame anybody for them, but one wonders what happens in a case where a similar mistake is made and a man has been hanged.  I know from my own experience that certainly in one case, not a political case, in which I was involved as a lawyer, I had grave doubts as to the accused man's guilt. These doubts have been greatly intensified since, but nothing can be done.  It is too late.  Are we entitled to take these risks?  Deputies know how we all make mistakes, no matter how sincerely we try to avoid making mistakes.  We know how unreliable the human memory is; we know how impressionable people's minds are; we know how, in everyday life, each and all of us make mistakes of fact and mistakes of recollection.  How often have you thought that you left a certain paper in a certain place, or your bunch of keys on the mantelpiece, and afterwards found it in your pocket?  How often have you, in error, suspected somebody of having done something on you, and then discovered afterwards that he had not.</P>
    <P>All these mistakes occur in criminal trials just as well as in everyday life. <Col N="1166" /> They are probably even more pronounced in criminal trials because, when witnesses are put on the stand, there is a certain glamour and a certain air of publicity.  A certain partisanship develops inevitably, and people are inclined to make mistakes and to stand over the mistakes they make.  That, in my view, is an additional reason for not inflicting a punishment which it is beyond the power to remit.</P>
    <P>I think that very few people who commit serious crime ever, in advance, consider the consequences of the crime.  In most cases they are people who are not normal.  Very few normal people will commit murder. The person who is not normal is hardly likely, in advance, to consider the consequences of the crime.  Some capital offences may be committed by people when they lose their temper, and when they are acting under the impact of some strong emotional passion. In these cases, too, I think it is unlikely that the person will, in advance, have an opportunity of considering the consequences of the crime. To those who do, the very small percentage of people who commit serious crime and who would have an opportunity of contemplating in advance the consequences of the crime for themselves, I think that the dread of a life sentence of imprisonment is probably a greater deterrent than capital punishment itself.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride has given notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 31 of the 14th November, 1951.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister for Finance, on that occasion, whether he was prepared to request the Central Bank to furnish a report of its &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; for the year ended the 31st March, 1951, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 36 (1) of the Currency Act, 1927 (No. 32 of 1927) as adapted by Section 11 of the Central Bank Act, 1942 (No. 1922 of 1942).  The Minister, in his reply, stated that the report referred to had already been furnished to him and that he had presented it to each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of the statutes mentioned in the question.  In fact, the Minister for Finance declined the request which my question implied &mdash;that the Central Bank should be asked to furnish a report of their &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have asked leave to raise this question on the Adjournment in the hope that it will be possible to discuss this particular net issue away from the heat and the controversy of the major debate which has been taking place in regard to the Central Bank Report.  I would ask the Minister to bear with me in discussing this question and to realise that there is a considerable amount of force in the case which I propose to make to the House on this question.  The Report of the Central Bank, which has been under discussion, is laid on the Table of the House in pursuance of the provisions of Section 36 (1) of the Currency Act, 1927. That is expressed on the face of the report and is indeed the only statutory provision which would enable any Report from the Central Bank to come before this House or to be laid on the Table of this House.  I would refer the House to the provisions of Section 36 (1) of the Currency Act, 1927.  This Act, of course, dealt with the Currency Commission which was the predecessor in title to the Central Bank, but, by adaptation and by the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1942, the term &ldquo;Currency Commission&rdquo; can be interpreted as meaning Central Bank.  The section provides as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The commission&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>which in this case can be interpreted as &ldquo;Central Bank&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;shall within six months after the <Col N="1168" /> expiration of every year prepare and send to the Minister a report of its proceedings during such year and the Minister shall present every such report to each House of the Oireachtas immediately upon receiving the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Put plainly, the section provides, firstly, that the Central Bank shall provide the Minister with a report of its proceedings.  The Minister must lay that report on the Table of the House immediately.  The Minister has no discretion in the matter.  Immediately upon receiving a report of the proceedings he has to lay it on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;a report of the proceedings&rdquo; mean?  What does it involve? I submit to the House that it means a report of the doings, of the meetings and of the main decisions of the body in question.  I looked up a number of definitions, legal definitions and ordinary dictionary definitions, and the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; means: a record of business done or a record or account of the doings of a society or of a company. I think we all probably know what a record of proceedings means. It means a virtual account of the decisions come to by a body.  In the Standing Orders of this House it is directed that the Clerk of the House shall keep a record of the proceedings of this House, and a journal is issued, a copy of which I have with me, which is published every day giving an account of the proceedings of the House. This journal is headed &ldquo;Proceedings of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  It is prepared by the Clerk of the House, submitted to the Ceann Comhairle and published. It is a record of the proceedings and decisions of Dáil Éireann.  We have not got very far to search, therefore, in order to find out what is meant by the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;.  We have it in the Standing Orders of the House. I feel that the House, including the Minister for Finance, would take a very poor view of the Clerk of the Dáil if, in the course of the report of the Proceedings of the Dáil, he were to express his views, however justified they might be, on the proceedings of the House, or if the Ceann Comhairle <Col N="1169" /> were to add a little footnote saying what he really thought of the different Deputies or of the decisions reached by the House.  We would all promptly proceed to sit on them both if they adopted such a course.  Yet that is what has happened in this Report of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There are many other bodies who, by statute, are bound to lay, through some Minister, a report of their proceedings before this House&mdash;for instance, Bord na Móna and a great many other statutory bodies.  They certainly have not so far taken it upon themselves to advise on policy or to criticise the policy of the present or of past Governments. If they should follow the example of the Central Bank we may well find ourselves in the position where all these bodies will proceed to voice their political views or their views on impending legislation, or on trends of one kind or another.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, a Chinn Chomhairle.  I was coming to that point.  I have examined all the reports of the Central Bank since its inception in 1943.  Originally the reports did, I think, conform generally to the concept one would have of what a report of that nature should be. However, I think the reports were not, even then, possibly as full as they might have been in regard to the &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; of the Central Bank. One can go through the present report and one will find no account of its proceedings.  One does not know how often they have met or what decisions they have come to.  One gets general advice, a record of their note circulation and statistical data which would be better coming from the Central Statistics Office.  One gets a Table setting out post office savings bank deposits and saving certificates, a list of which and a list of the amounts involved has, presumably, already been published by the Post Office and is also contained in the statistical returns of the Central Statistics Office.  There is a section dealing with the balance of <Col N="1170" /> payments, a section dealing with the balance of trade which, presumably, one can get in the existing statistics, and there is a chapter on &ldquo;The General Monetary Review&rdquo; which is a political and economic harangue to the country.</P>
      <P>You get something on hire purchase, something on the European Payments Union, but you will find no record of the &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; of the bank.  I do feel the Minister should not consider this thing as a criticism of the Minister himself or the Government, but that he should regard it objectively. Is it wise to allow a body of this kind, or indeed any other similar body set up by statute to discharge certain functions, to go beyond the powers given in the statute and to omit to discharge the duties placed upon it?</P>

      <P>In the course of the last few weeks, I have had to put a good many questions to the Minister for Finance in relation to the Central Bank to obtain information that should, in my view, have been contained in a report of its proceedings&mdash; how often the directors met, what decisions they came to, what they were in fact doing.  They tell us that they spent £161,000 on running the Central Bank.  They do not tell us how they spent that money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>We might have a little more information as to how they spent this £161,000.  They refer to their London agent.  They might tell us who their London agent is; when they appointed him.</P>
      <P>They might give us all the usual information that one expects to get from a company when it is preparing a report of its proceedings.  I respectfully submit that we have not had this information, and that it is creating a dangerous precedent to allow statutory bodies of this kind to depart from the strict terms of the statutory powers that were given to them.</P>
      <P>In the course of the last few days we have been told repeatedly from the Government Benches that this House has no control over the Central Bank. It is an independent body, and the Government has no control over it.  If that be so&mdash;I do not accept that position&mdash;at least we have control over the type of report it is to present to us. We can insist that it comply with the one and only statutory requirement it is bound to discharge to this House, namely, the one imposed upon it by Section 36 (1) of the Currency Act, to furnish a report of its proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all seriousness I would ask the Minister to consider the dangers involved in not insisting on a strict adherence to the provisions of the Statute in that respect.  Even if one assumes that the Central Bank is a highly responsible body, obviously it is not in possession of information which the Government may have in a given situation.  A future Government may find itself gravely embarrassed in the discharge of its duties and in giving effect to its policy by policies advocated or by reports or statements of this kind.  Might I put this one simple illustration to the Minister?  Supposing that a Government intended to float a loan for which there was a great necessity, and that just on the day before the loan was to be floated a <Col N="1172" /> report was issued by the Central Bank saying that the State was not credit-worthy; such a situation might be highly damaging to the Government elected by this House.  That is very nearly what the Central Bank did in this case.  I would ask the Minister to consider this very objectively, and to take steps to ensure that the Central Bank would furnish to this House a proper report of its proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one can only begin by saying that the Deputy is endeavouring to enforce on the Minister for Finance the same narrow, legalistic interpretation of the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; in this context which he wants to foist upon the public. There is no justification in the terms of the Central Bank Act for the argument which the Deputy has put before the House.  As everybody knows, and as the Deputy must know, the term &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; is a term of art known, of course, to lawyers but not capable of an interpretation which can be universally applied.  The Deputy's own reference to the proceedings of this House has demonstrated the false basis upon which his argument has proceeded. He has asked us to assume that in respect to every type of body, every institution, there is a general definition of the term &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; which must be accepted and adhered to.  If that were the case, why would it be necessary for this House, for its own guidance, to define what is meant by the term &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>We have had to do it in our case. Every Committee of this House has got to accept and adopt a form of proceedings and naturally observes it. It adopts it by definition, prior definition, and by a definition which has been formed by precedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no set definition of the word &ldquo;proceedings,&rdquo; either in the Central Bank Act, 1942, the original Currency Act, 1927 or in the amending Act of 1930.  Therefore, the Governor and the Board of the Central Bank are entitled to interpret the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; for themselves and to give a report of their proceedings in the form in which they think <Col N="1173" /> it will conduce to the greatest public good.  It is because, of course, the Central Bank have done that in a manner which will bring home to the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; the gravity of the present situation and how it has been brought about, that Deputy MacBride has endeavoured to becloud the issue and to suggest that the Central Bank, in the manner of their report and in the form in which it has been presented, are not observing the obligation imposed upon them by statute.  What are the obligations imposed on the Central Bank by statute?  The first obligation, deriving from Section 36 of the Currency Act is to present a report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and those proceedings must be directed to one primary end and to certain other ends that are ancillary to it.  The primary end of the Central Bank is laid down in Section 6 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which, <i>inter alia,</i> declares that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the bank shall have the general function and duty of taking (within the limit of the powers for the time being vested in it by law) such steps as the board may from time to time deem appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and ensuring that, in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And as ancillary to that function of the bank, to enable them more fully to discharge their obligations under Section 6, the Central Bank Act provides, in Section 8:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the bank to do all or any of the following things on such occasion and to such extent as the board shall think proper, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) make provision for the collection and study of data relating to monetary and credit problems <Col N="1174" /> and publish informative material in regard thereto;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The publication of informative material is a natural proceeding of the bank&mdash; can it be held to be anything else?&mdash; and must be presented in such form as will warn the people, if necessary, that financial policies and financial procedures are endangering the integrity of the currency and thereby also endangering the welfare of the people as a whole.  That is the main purpose to which the Report of the Central Bank is directed.  That is the main purpose to which all their proceedings must tend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Central Bank are advocating nothing.  They are warning the people; they are suggesting remedies; they are indicating to the people the position in which they have been left.  That is a useful function. It is a function which the people are entitled to expect the Central Bank to perform.  That is a proceeding which is the basic and essential feature of the whole character of the institution. It is fundamental to it.  Unless they do that, there is no use in having such an institution.  It is because they are trying to do that that the Deputy objects.</P>
      <P>Let us see what is the alternative. The Deputy has suggested that the Central Bank Report should be modelled on the report of the proceedings of this House.  If that were the case, this is the sort of thing we should expect to have to wade through, page after page:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Governor of the Central Bank took the chair at 3 p.m. (or 3.15 p.m. or 4 p.m., as the case might be).</P>

      <P>and so on.  We would have page after page, of the Report of the Central Bank composed of <i>trivia</i> like that.  Of course that is what Deputy MacBride would wish, because the Deputy has indicated to all of us that it is the function of the Government and the responsibility of the Government to prevent the Central Bank from telling the people the truth, that it might be embarrassing on occasions.</P>

Deputy MacBride has said that Governments might find that embarrassing.  There is no doubt that Deputy has found it embarrassing that the Central Bank should tell the people the truth about the present position of the country <Col N="1176" /> after three years administration of a Government of which he was a member. We do not find the report embarrassing if he does.</P>

It was to assist the latter to overcome this handicap that my Department's scheme of loans for the purchase of milking machines was introduced, and having regard to the number of applications made under the scheme to date, I cannot agree that the rate of interest charged denies farmers the opportunity of availing themselves of the credit facilities offered for the purchase of these machines.  I consider that the terms of the scheme are favourable, and I do not propose to seek approval for a reduction in the rate of interest.</P>
