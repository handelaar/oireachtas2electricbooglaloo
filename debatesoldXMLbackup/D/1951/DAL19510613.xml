      <P>In the normal course of events, it would fall to me to nominate for re-election the Deputy who has served as Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Fahy, for a long number of years.  I am given to understand, however, that he does not propose to offer himself for re-election and I gather that, if his name were put forward, he would not accept election. In these circumstances, I feel that it is my duty to nominate a Ceann Comhairle, even in the peculiar circumstances in which we find ourselves in this House to-day.  Accordingly, I submit to the judgment of the House the name of Deputy Patrick Hogan of Clare as Ceann Comhairle.  Deputy Hogan has been a member of this House for a long number of years.  He has acted for a considerable period as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  He has a thorough knowledge of all the procedure and practice of this House and is in every way well qualified for the position.  During the time and term when he occupied the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I think it must be said that he filled that position with dignity and outstanding fairness to all Parties.  I submit the name of Deputy Patrick Hogan as one well qualified for the position of Ceann Comhairle.</P>

Ach san obair do rinne Seán Ua Coisdealbha le trí bliana anuas, tharraing sé an spiorad sin ar ais agus tá an spiorad sin ann anois.</P>
    <P>In asking you to select Deputy John A. Costello as Taoiseach, I ask you to do it because, just as we promised when we asked the Dáil to nominate him as Taoiseach in February, 1948, just as we promised that he would bring a new spirit back into Irish politics, that promise has been very adequately fulfilled.  In accepting the responsibility of being Taoiseach and of bringing together into the Government the number of Parties that sat in the Government under him, he brought back into our country that spirit of unity, that spirit of harmony, that spirit of strength that was eternally our strength in our struggle for our independence.</P>
    <P>Nothing was more indicative of the man than that there should come to him in February, 1948, the Leader of Clann na Poblachta and the Leader of the <Col N="19" /> Labour Party to ask him to surrender all his own private interests and accept the leadership of a Government at that time.  I say that that very action, more than even his own action in doing it, and the work he has done since, was indicative of the man.  We can all say that his work subsequent to that has lived up to the indications of his character and of his spirit of sacrifice. That is shown by the fact that men were able to come to him in the circumstances of February, 1948, and ask him: &ldquo;Will you surrender your person, your business, and all your other interests, change the whole course and form of your life, and accept the leadership of an Irish Government to bring a number of Irish Parties together to form a Government?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the 20's he had seen opportunity after opportunity lost to our people because we were not able to carry on, into the days of our independence and our own national Parliament, the spirit of unity that enabled us to win that independence.  All through the 30's he had seen opportunity after opportunity lost in strengthening our economy in the world circumstances of that particular time.  All through the 40's, in a quickened atmosphere where our people's senses quickened with danger, he had seen opportunities lost to strengthen the cultural and spiritual life of our people&mdash;because there were these differences there.</P>
    <P>We had all seen, in the way in which the 1948 election was fought by the present Opposition Party, that there was every likelihood that these ever-growing seeds of division and discontent were going to be continually spread among our people.  In these circumstances, he accepted the responsibility of forming a Government.  And in the three years and a half, approximately, that passed, every day that passed has strengthened the people's confidence in themselves and in their ability to face their difficulties and their ability to co-operate. The sacrifice that he made then is adequately reflected, not only in the work that has been done for the people and the work the people have been able to do, but in the realisation of the people's morale and in the lesson the <Col N="20" /> people have learned for themselves that Irish Parties, Irishmen and Irishwomen are able to join together and impress the spirit of harmony and the spirit of unity on a Parliament and get an executive that will impress that spirit on its work of administration.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the last election we still saw the seeds of division being persistently sown by the present Opposition.  We were able to hear a front bencher of the Fianna Fáil Party gibe at the possibility that a MacBride would work in an Irish Parliament or work in Irish circumstances with a MacEoin or a Mulcahy; we were able to hear gibes issued from platforms that a Norton of the Labour movement was able to work with an Everett of the Labour movement.  It is in these circumstances that we again ask that our people will realise that we have to bring back, by work and by sacrifice, into our Irish life, particularly into our political life, that spirit of unity and that spirit of dignity that characterises our people in their homes and in their general work&mdash;that spirit of dignity and of high purpose that is reflected in our general national aims and general national character.  The circumstances of the world to-day are too complex; the gifts that our people have and the power of our people to manifest these gifts in activities and in production of various kinds are too great to have our spiritual resources and our material resources scattered and dissipated by the setting of Party against Party, the keeping of men divided and women divided in their political work&mdash;because there flows from that the same spirit of division and the same loss of effort and loss of enterprise in every aspect of our people's life.</P>
    <P>The very circumstances in which the recent general election took place emphasise the necessity for close cooperation, close understanding, close working together, and close looking at the facts of our Irish life, if we are to make a success of our people's work here and if an Irish Parliament is to be faced with gathering and keeping the spirit of harmony and unity that will help to protect and build up our <Col N="21" /> people.  It is, therefore, on his merits, the merits that were such that he was able to be asked by these various Parties to make the sacrifice that he did make in February, 1948, the merits he has shown in his work for the last three years and the hope that he has inspired and continues to inspire in the people by his leadership of the various Parties that sat under him, and for the purpose of rooting firmly in our political, social and economic life that strength and that harmony and that dignity that we were able to maintain when we were struggling for our liberties, that I ask the Dáil to elect Deputy John A. Costello as Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion that Deputy Costello be elected as Taoiseach.  I do so in the full knowledge, a knowledge which is available to the country as a whole, that during the past three years he has filled that extremely responsible and difficult position with credit to himself and credit to the nation and that he has shed lustre on the various groups which comprise the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>During the three years which have passed, the Government under Deputy Costello has had a creditable record of achievement of which it is quite entitled to feel proud.  If one searches the pages of history for the past 100 years, one will find no three years more fruitful in achievement than the three years during which Deputy Costello has been in charge of the nation's affairs.  He and the Government under him have given the nation a peace, a prosperity and a stability that it has never known before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent election, the main issue&mdash;in fact, the only issue&mdash;was whether there should be one-Party Government or inter-Party Government. That was the one issue in this election.  And while I concede to Fianna Fáil that they campaigned in favour of one-Party Government, it is they and they only who got whatever mandate there may be limited though it is, for one-Party Government.  No other Deputy in this House got a mandate for one-Party Government.  The <Col N="22" /> clear and unambiguous view of the electorate, as expressed through the ballot box, was in favour of inter-Party Government and no Deputy here to-day can ride away from his responsibilities in that respect.</P>

These wishes, in my view, can best be respected by nominating and electing Deputy Costello as Taoiseach, and because his return as Taoiseach will ensure a continuance of the peace, stability and prosperity of the past three years I commend his nomination to this House.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Deputy Éamon de Valera be nominated as Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>In the case of a man who has been for a long time an outstanding figure in Irish political life and who has held office as Head of the Irish Government during two separate and historically important periods, there is not much that can be said that would add anything to the public knowledge of him. The whole story of Deputy de Valera's life&mdash;as battalion commandant in the Irish Volunteers before and during 1916, as the man elected President of the Republic in 1919 and national leader in the eventful years that followed, as Head of the Government here during the enactment of the Constitution and during the very difficult years of the second world war&mdash;proclaims that, whatever other qualifications he may possess, he has the personal capacity, the integrity and the experience to carry the responsibilities which will again be his if this motion which I am proposing is accepted by the House.</P>

    <P>If personal qualities and not Party strengths or loyalties were the sole consideration that would decide this issue, <Col N="23" /> I would leave the record to speak for itself and be confident of the outcome. In the circumstances of this Dáil, however, other arguments must be advanced.  Deputy de Valera, whom I am proposing should be nominated as Taoiseach, is the Leader of the largest Party in the House.  Whatever views we may hold as to the interpretation of the results of the election as a reflection of the public will, and I do not think it can be said that the results were decisive, the appointment of the Leader of the largest Party, the Party which secured the election of representatives to a number exceeding by five that of all the other Parties combined, would appear to be the outcome in closest accord with the public will.</P>
    <P>Apart from interpreting the public will as reflected in the voting in the election, we here, as the elected Deputies of the people, have to decide what arrangement we can make is likely to be most conducive to the public interest in the circumstances that may exist in the future.  A Government supported by the largest Party, a homogeneous Party of 69 members in a House where 74 is a majority, has clearly a better chance, to put it no stronger than that, of realising that stability of internal political conditions which is a prerequiste to the preparation and fulfilment of a comprehensive programme of national development, and such a Party is more likely to obtain that public co-operation which will be necessary if the problems which are likely to arise for us from the world situation are to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The case for the election of Deputy Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach rests primarily upon his personal qualifications for the office and his position as Leader of the largest Party in the House, but there are other matters to which I think I should refer, two matters upon which it may be necessary to make some definite statement.</P>
    <P>We are not asking for an unlimited mandate.  We are not asking for an unknown mandate.  We do not think it is reasonable in the circumstances of this House that the name of a Deputy should be put forward for the position <Col N="24" /> of Taoiseach without an indication of the programme which the Government nominated by him will endeavour to fulfil.  We have published, prior to the meeting of the Dáil and in sufficient detail, I think, to make our intentions clear, the outline of the main aims towards which there will be directed the energies of whatever Government Deputy de Valera may nominate if he is chosen.  It is upon the basis of that programme, published in advance of the meeting of the House, that we are asking for this motion the support of Deputies who are not of our Party. For those who may be interested, I wish to give a specific assurance that it is to implement that programme, and for no other purpose, that we are seeking to form a Government.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in a section of the Press that if Deputy de Valera is nominated as Taoiseach he will take an early opportunity of dissolving the Dáil and precipitating another election, although those who make that suggestion do not follow it to the point of conceding that another election would add to Fianna Fáil's representation in the House.  We do not think that another election is in the national interest.  We believe that, despite the rather acrimonious note struck by the Minister for Education, if Party differences and personal commitments could be left aside, the programme we have outlined, the programme for the fulfilment of which we have pledged ourselves to work if the opportunity is ours, has the support of Deputies, perhaps the majority of Deputies, on both sides of the House.  It certainly will be our ambition to prove that that belief is well-founded by keeping the Dáil working on it&mdash;for the full length of its constitutional term, if possible.</P>
    <P>I am moving this motion in the sincere conviction that its approval by the House will contribute to the national welfare and that it will be the result of to-day's deliberations which the majority of our people will regard as the most satisfactory outcome of the present political situation here.</P>

      <P>It is obviously our function here to-day to do two things: first of all, to seek to implement as far as we can the will of the people who have sent us here; and, secondly, to provide that Government which we think is the most suitable and the one most likely to lead our country in the period ahead of us.</P>
      <P>We have not had normal political development in our history.  It can be readily conceded by all Parties in the House that, in the course of the last 30 years, we have not had any normal political thinking or political development. Most of our political thinking, most of our political development has been based on events that occurred 20 or 30 years ago.  Much of it, unfortunately, has been based on rival personalities. I had hoped that in this situation, 30 years after the civil war, it would have been possible for all the Parties in this House to get together in an effort to provide the one type of Government that the vast majority of our people want, a Government representative of the main national Parties, pledged, first of all, to the achievement of our national territorial unity and pledged, secondly, to the economic development of this nation.  I believe that it would be possible to provide such a Government.  I think that if it were possible that such a Government would be provided, it should be provided for a fixed and limited period of time, such as two years.  It could be elected on that understanding.</P>
      <P>I have urged this view on a number of occasions: I urged it immediately after the election and I would like to urge it again here on this occasion.  I would like to appeal here to the Leader of the present Opposition to indicate whether he is prepared in these circumstances and for those objectives to join in the formation of a national Government proportionately representative of the four main Parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that we should be able to cast aside prejudice or pride in providing for the nation the type of Government which I know the vast majority of the people want.  We are able to do it; we are able to cast <Col N="26" /> aside these personal differences, these barren disputes about the past in ordinary social contacts; we are all able to cast them aside even in the field of sport.  Why then is it not possible for the members of this House to cast them aside when it comes to providing a Government for the people?</P>
    <P>Before passing on I think I should mention that the Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, did indicate, in a letter which he sent to another Deputy of this House, Deputy Cogan, his attitude.  He indicated that if this proposal were to be profitably pursued it would be necessary that the Leader of the Opposition should indicate his intention of altering the decision which he already announced earlier, namely, that he should indicate his willingness to participate in such a national Government. I mention this letter because I saw a statement in some of this morning's papers that the letter sent by Deputy Cogan had never been replied to by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>If it is not possible to form a nationally representative Government, then in present circumstances I must support the most representative type of Government possible.  I do this for a number of reasons.  In the first place, the people, however indecisively, have indicated by a very clear-cut majority that their desire, that their will, is for an inter-Party Government and that they are opposed to a one-Party Government. If I am right in saying that the first function of this House is to seek to interpret the will of the people, then obviously the result of the recent elections must coerce this House into supporting an inter-Party or representative type of Government. Secondly, I think that better results are likely to be achieved by a Government representative of different interests.  In a country such as ours it is essential, I think, that the Labour Party, the representatives of the organised workers in the country, should form part of the Government. That is essential for the stability of the Government and for the welfare of the workers who constitute the vast majority of our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> It has been my privilege in the course of the last three years to work under the leadership of Deputy John A. Costello.  I had the privilege of knowing him before and I was one of those who recommended him to this House as Taoiseach.  My experience in the course of the last three years has confirmed the very high opinion in which I held him then.  Deputy Costello in my view has rendered a signal public service to this nation by accepting grave personal loss and inconvenience when he accepted the responsibility of Taoiseach.  He has proved in the course of the last three years his ability and his integrity.  He has proved, too&mdash;and I hope that this will be remembered by members on both sides of this House and by our people&mdash; that he was prepared to put the national interest before every other consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a long period I have consistently advocated and suggested that a national Government, proportionately representative of all Parties in this House, was desirable.  I have based my arguments in support of that contention on the fact that we elect the Dáil by proportional representation and it seems reasonable that we should follow that system to its logical conclusion and elect the executive council of the Dáil by the same process.  In the recent election I advocated that policy and I make no apology for so doing.  During the course of events since the election my constituency executive in Wicklow have advised me to seek to secure that objective if possible and, if it were not possible, to act as my conscience might direct in the selection of the Head of the Government for the next five years.  I approached the Leaders of both sides.  I have been informed by the Leader of the Government in the usual legal language that the matter would receive consideration if some indication were given by the Leader of the Opposition.  I have received from the Leader of the Opposition a very clear-cut statement that he sought a mandate for a Government of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and having sought that mandate from the people and secured the largest representation in the House, he was not prepared to go back on the mandate which he sought.  I am not one of those who hold that any political Party should repudiate a mandate which they have sought from the people.  If a programme is put before the people by a political Party at an election&mdash; whether that programme be for the preservation of the link with the British Government or for the severance of that link, or for anything else&mdash;the programme should be adhered to.  The people of this country are the masters on the day of the election and they expect the people whom they elect to keep faith with them and to honour the promises which they have made. Therefore, I accept the explanation of the Leader of the Opposition and I accept the fact that the formation of a national Government, composed of all Parties in this House, is not possible. In the instructions which were given to me by my constituency executive, it was clearly set out that a national Government should be a Government with the Leader of the largest Party at its head and that all Parties should be represented proportionately.  I consider that that is a sound and reasonable proposition. It is possible that such a system is not workable under our present Constitution. It is possible that amendments to the Constitution would be required in order to enable that position to be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two alternatives before the country&mdash;either to carry the proportional representation system to its logical conclusion and have all Parties represented in the Government or to adopt the same system as that which is adopted in other countries and which provides for the establishment of what is known in those other democratic countries as the &ldquo;two-Party system&rdquo;. It has been clearly indicated that a national Government on the lines which I have advocated, and which my constituency executive directed me to <Col N="29" /> propose, is not possible.  I am, therefore, faced with the position that I must decide which of the two Governments suggested by the nominators here to-day offers the best prospect for the welfare of the country.  On this question I cannot be guided by Party prejudice, by class prejudice or by personal prejudice.  On this question I must be influenced by what I consider to be the best Government for this country.  There is no yardstick which I can apply to this matter except the consideration of which of the persons nominated for the position of Taoiseach would, in the present circumstances, provide us with the best Government over the next five years. On considering this matter from every angle, I am satisfied&mdash;satisfied beyond all possible shadow of doubt&mdash;that Deputy Éamon de Valera is in a position to provide the better Government for this country.  Therefore, I have decided that his nomination shall have my support in this House.</P>
    <P>I consider that the proposal to elect Deputy de Valera as Head of this Government is necessary and desirable.  In the first place, he has behind him a large Party&mdash;almost 50 per cent. of the membership of this House.  He is, therefore, in a position to carry out a programme of construction and development without being subjected to the pressure of various organised sections who will seek, perhaps, to obstruct him in carrying out that programme&mdash;as happened in the last Government. I am satisfied that the programme which has been submitted to this House by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party is fundamentally sound and constructive.  That programme is available to even the most illiterate of Deputies and can be studied by them. It is on the basis of our future welfare as a nation that we have got to deal to-day and not on the basis of past differences or past disputes.  I hope we have left that past behind us.  I hope that, in the next five years, whoever is elected to the position of Taoiseach will concentrate on the present and the future and will avoid going back into the past and arousing bitter old memories of the past.  There is constructive work to be done&mdash;constructive <Col N="30" /> work for agriculture and constructive work for industry.  There is work of national importance to be done in strengthening our economic position so that whatever the future may hold, whatever the world situation may hold for us, we shall at least be in a position of comparative self-reliance and independence.  It is also essential that in the present situation the man elected to the office of Taoiseach must be in a position to strengthen the defences of this country.  He must not be hampered by any group who may have affiliations with those who seek to weaken the defences of this nation. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on a number of occasions in my constituency proved beyond all shadow of a doubt that the Labour Party is closely associated with international Communism.</P>

I have expressed the view that, in my opinion, the Leader of the present Opposition Party is in a position to offer a better prospect of economic and social development, of a strengthening of our national position throughout the world and of a strengthening of our agricultural position, than the Head of the outgoing Government.  I am satisfied that the Head of the outgoing Government is not in a position to make such an offer.  From my experience over the past three years I am satisfied that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, was not in a position to make a constructive contribution to the advancement of this nation.  He was hampered and hamstrung.  We know he <Col N="31" /> was obstructed by Ministers who sought to advance their own personal ambitions or the ambitions of their immediate friends rather than to advance the interests of the nation.

I want to say now that, in electing a Government for this country, we will elect a Government which will stand for decency, for clean government and for the elimination of jobbery and corruption. I want to emphasise now, in the strongest possible way, that these are the ideals for which I stand: ideals of justice, ideals of honest and clean Government, fair play for every citizen no matter whether he be born in a castle or in a cabin, and no matter whether he be a private in the National Army or an officer of some other army.  Each citizen is entitled to right and justice, and I am satisfied that, in electing Deputy Éamon de Valera to the position of Head of the Government, we will be electing a person who will stand for those rights fearlessly, honourably and honestly, no matter what pressure may be placed upon him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said, and I think it is right <Col N="33" /> that it should be said, that the outgoing Taoiseach was a man of great charm and courtesy, but charm and courtesy are no substitutes for moral courage.

I think there is grave danger in electing a weak and incompetent system of Government such as we have had over the last three years.

      <P>When I stood as an Independent Deputy in the recent General Election, it was my intention, if returned to this House, to pursue that Independent status as rigidly as possible.  In trying to visualise to-day's election of Taoiseach, I felt that I would be in a position to abstain from voting, but in view of the inconclusive result of the election and the closeness of to-day's vote, I <Col N="38" /> feel that it would now be an evasion of my public duty if I were to do so.</P>
      <P>In the issues which I have put before the Dublin South-West electorate, I have clearly indicated my reasons for my resignation from one of the Parties which is supporting the inter-Party group, and I have indicated, equally clearly, my lack of confidence in the inter-Party Government, principally because of their vacillating policy.  I believe that in the present political stalemate, where any elected Government can only enjoy a small majority, it is vital that there should be leadership by someone who can command respect and trust both within and without our shores.  Therefore, in to-day's issue, I cast, without hesitation, my vote in favour of Deputy Éamon de Valera.  By supporting the Fianna Fáil Party as an Independent Deputy I am not committed to them by any Party or inter-Party affiliations.  I have made the reason for casting my vote in favour of Deputy Éamon de Valera quite clear. The extent and duration of my support for the Fianna Fáil Party, if they are to-day elected to Government, will depend purely upon the manner in which they deal with the practical issues with which the Irish people in the recent general election have so clearly indicated that they are most concerned.</P>

      <P>It is the wish of my constituents that I should to-day advocate the formation of a national Government.  From what I have heard, however, there seems to be very little likelihood of such a Government being formed.  I would like to hear from the Taoiseach&mdash;and his reply will influence me to some extent in the way in which I shall vote in this division&mdash;if he has accepted the demands made at the Labour Party meeting held last Thursday.  If he has accepted these demands, will he indicate now to the House what the demands are?  His reply will influence my decision in the division taken on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I would like to give my reasons for casting my vote on the election of the Taoiseach in favour of Deputy Éamon de Valera. I would like to make it clear, too, that on all occasions I have stated that I <Col N="39" /> am not completely opposed to a conception of inter-Party Government.  I believe there are times when the formation of an inter-Party Government is a desirable development and can play an effective part in the control of the destinies of the country. I believe that such an occasion arose in 1948.  I believe that the record of the inter-Party Government has been a sound one as far as it went.  For that I think the Taoiseach deserves a certain meed of praise.</P>
      <P>I have also stated, however, that in my view the inter-Party conception of Government, where there are included in that Government certain groups, politicians and political Parties, large and small, holding divergent, contrary and sometimes diametrically opposite views on the method by which the social betterment and happiness of our people can best be achieved, can work satisfactorily for a time.  When such groups come together it is possible for a period of time for those groups to find common ground.  Fortunately, that common ground is found mainly on matters which are not of vital importance to the community and upon which there is no really fundamental difference between the political Parties.  I think that is the reason why it was possible for the inter-Party Government to make progress until such time as it became quite obvious that the ideological differences which must exist between Parties professing different social philosophies must clash. When that clash came it then became necessary for one or other Party to compromise on its principles.  I believe that is an inevitable sequel to the inter-Party conception of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that recent events were a perfectly logical conclusion to that particular form of Government.  It is obvious that in a Government such as that the larger and more powerful group must exercise the greatest influence on policy.  In the inter-Party Government that group happened to be the Fine Gael Party.  Quite obviously that Party allowed their political associations and their political supporters to influence the <Col N="40" /> decisions of Dáil Éireann contrary to the best interests of the community as a whole.  It then became necessary for the smaller Parties to accept that dicta or take the only step which remained open to them by refusing to compromise.</P>
    <P>I am not now concerned with the incident that has passed.  It is over as far as I am concerned.  It is now immaterial.  I think, however, that it is an important pointer to those who wish to support the inter-Party conception of Government in the future. I have studied the 17 points put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party in recent weeks.  They are points on which, as Deputy Lemass has said, the majority of us on both sides would agree as being the most desirable and the most likely to bring a reasonable degree of prosperity and happiness to our people.</P>
    <P>As an Independent, I propose to offer my support to Éamon de Valera and the Fianna Fáil Party so long as they continue conscientiously and sincerely to pursue those ideas and ideals for the betterment of our people and our country.  I keep to myself the right as an Independent to use my discretion upon any occasion on which the need arises to vote as I think fit in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to make it quite clear that as an Independent I have asked for no understanding nor have I received any guarantee from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I will vote for the election of Deputy Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach and I shall continue to vote for the Fianna Fáil Party so long as that Party conscientiously pursues the objectives laid down in their 17-point programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to maintain my support of the principle of inter-Party government. My mind to-day goes back to the opening of the recent campaign which was signalled by the Fianna Fáil newspaper with the headline: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil against the Rest.&rdquo;  That theme was taken up by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, who said in every county in Ireland:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am asking for a clear majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> I will form no Government except on the votes of my own supporters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That theme and the theme of Deputy Lemass that Fianna Fáil were fighting the election on the 1948 programme dominated the campaign.  But long before the campaign was over Fianna Fáil had jettisoned lump by lump its 1948 programme.</P>
    <P>The whole country was littered with lumps of that programme which they jettisoned as they went along and no issue was left but the one issue, clearly stated: &ldquo;Trust Dev.&rdquo;  The gates of every cemetery in Ireland were adorned with placards: &ldquo;Put him in.&rdquo;  If the Irish people did one thing in the last election, it was to declare resolutely that they had no intention of putting Dev. in the graveyard or anywhere else. The only thing that Fianna Fáil left in issue was: &ldquo;Did the Irish people want a Government formed by Deputy de Valera leading a majority of Dáil Éireann?&rdquo; If they did not want that, they could not get a Dev. Government at all.  The Irish people said most categorically: &ldquo;We do not.&rdquo;  Now Deputy Lemass, with that superb and brazen aplomb with which I am only too familiar and which I have long admired as leaving Burmese brass in the shade, boasts of the fact that, like the Duke of Plaza Toro, he led his forces from behind.  Deputy de Valera fights a general election and when he has been defeated produces his programme! Certain it is that the 1948 election programme with which he embarked on this election was jettisoned.  Compulsory tillage went the first week.  The wages freeze went the second week.  The price freeze went the third week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Annie Oakley piece.  We are coming to that. I am describing the strip tease politics as they divested themselves of every rag of decency when they embarked on their campaign.  Their raiment was old-fashioned.  It was a bit shabby. It was the 1948 design, but at least it covered their nakedness.  They passed <Col N="42" /> the post limping and naked and then came the bargain sale.  To-day Deputy de Valera is the Annie Oakley of Irish politics: &ldquo;Anything you can do I can do better.&rdquo;  Is there any one single feature of the Plaza Toro programme, produced not on the eve of the general election but on its morrow, is there a single item of that programme that does not represent a synthesis of the speeches made by members of the inter-Party Government during the campaign?  Is there a social security scheme?  Are there increased old age pensions?  Is there a land rehabilitation programme?  Is there even my modest proposal for Connemara?  It was no great thing, a very poor thing, but mine own.  It now appears as the plume in the bargain hat of the Annie Oakley of Irish politics, but though it be a poor thing, little to boast of, nothing for which any rational man claims gratitude who professes to be conscious of the obligations and the duties of the office which I had the honour to hold, it was precious to me and I do not like to see it as an adornment of any Annie Oakley's bargain hat without acknowledgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It degrades Irish politics; it degrades us all, that a Party can come into this House boasting of the fact that it claims the suffrages of the Deputies of this House on a programme, not a programme that it did not dare to produce, but a programme that it was not fit to produce before the campaign began, because to every single particular of that programme it was converted by the members of the inter-Party Government in the course of the campaign.  I know that because I personally kicked them off compulsory tillage.  My colleague the Tánaiste kicked them off the wage freeze.  My colleague the Minister for Finance exposed them with the documents that Deputy Lemass had inadvertently left in the waste paper basket.  Have they no shame or are there no depths of servile degradation to which members of the Fianna Fáil Party are not prepared to sink?  I would not care if it simply meant the degradation of a political Party, but they do represent a large minority of <Col N="43" /> our people&mdash;no one can deny that.  And their conduct, their demeanour, their standards are seen in the world as the standards of our people.  They are shameful standards, they are contemptible standards, and it is a grievous thing that a large Party, a great Party&mdash;any Party which returns 69 Deputies to Dáil Éireann is a great Party in my estimation&mdash;should stoop to clamber into office over the prostrate bodies of men whom they derided, misrepresented, insulted and outraged for three years until such time as they saw an opportunity to use their folly to serve their ignoble ends.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that I hate the doings of this day when I think of the impending ruin of so much work in which I was proud to have a share. I was proud to find myself a colleague of William Norton.  I was no stranger to the Taoiseach; we had been colleagues before.  I was proud to find myself a colleague of Seán MacBride's. Three better colleagues no man ever worked with, and I am not unconscious of the fact that I am not the easiest colleague in the world to work with. That is, perhaps, one proposition that is unanimously accepted in this House. If it is, is there not something dear, is there not something admirable, is there not something precious in the inter-Party Government that got so much done and that found in its doing that to talk of ideological differences within our own tribunal is to label the man who speaks of them as mentally remote from 99.9 of our people?  What ideological differences, if words retain their meaning, divide any two Deputies on any side of this House?  I think of ideologies as representing democracy, dictatorship, Fascism, Nazism, Marxism. Who says that there are differences of that character between any two men in the public life of Ireland? I am a politician and I despise the sneering tone of the neo-politician who speaks contemptuously of politicians. I am a politician and proud to be a politician.  My father was a politician and my grandfather was a politician and, if every Deputy in this House has as good reason to be proud of his forebears as I have of mine, I congratulate <Col N="44" /> him.  I am proud of them because they were politicians and I am proud to be a politician in the public life of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I vacillate between sympathy for folly and something closely approximating to hatred of evil when I hear Deputy Dr. Browne saying: &ldquo;The past is past.  The incident associated with my departure from the Government is all over so far as I am concerned.&rdquo;  I give him the charity of thinking that that is the folly of childish inexperience and lack of capacity to appreciate the nature of his acts.  But people on all sides of this House who know the devastating reverberation of the tale he purported to tell all over the world wherever there are enemies of Ireland or wherever there are enemies of the Catholic Church cannot say grandiloquently: &ldquo;It is all over as far as we are concerned&rdquo;?  The echoes have only begun to roll and not all the eloquence of every Deputy can catch up with the mighty army of lies which is marching behind that standard at this moment all over the world to prove that in Ireland it was true what Salisbury, what Balfour, what Carson said&mdash;that Home Rule was Rome Rule.  That is the brief for every slanderer, for every libel merchant of this country all over the world and, what is worse, for those who do differ from us most fundamentally in the ideological sphere that is their brief to prove that to be free men you must destroy the Church.  I know he never meant that.  I know that ideologically he and I think the same.  I know that if my Catholicism were compared to his, the comparison would, in all probability, be to my disadvantage, but he must forgive me if it makes me sick with horror that his inexperience, his lack of wisdom, his incapacity to understand the consequences of the things he said and did, should bring upon us the irremediable disaster of his published allegations.  I am aghast that in the presence of that situation I should hear him say: &ldquo;It is all over so far as I am concerned.&rdquo;  It will not be all over in the lifetime of the youngest man in this Dáil.  If it was folly, God forgive him for his folly.  All I can say is that it would be hard to believe, in the atmosphere in which I <Col N="45" /> worked beside him, that it would be hard for any man who wanted to succour the poor and protect the afflicted from the consequences of poverty and the knowledge of want not to find a way and a dozen willing hands to help him inside and outside the Government to which he belonged.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say all the cross things which Deputy Cogan seems to live in dread of my saying about him. But, as he was repudiating his colleagues, as he was declaring his great conversion, as he was binding himself to the chariot with a silken cord, to which he may shortly discover hemp will be added when the Fuehrer is installed, I noticed a benign smile spread across the face of Deputy MacEntee and his head seemed to nod like the wise old mandarin, rejoicing on the lost groat being found, on the vagrant sheep returning.  As I turned from that pleasing spectacle of avuncular solicitude, my eye lit upon the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, column 30, Volume 110.  On this occasion, Deputy Cogan was also speaking, but I venture to say that on this occasion the oscillation of Deputy MacEntee's head was horizontal rather than vertical, because here is what Deputy Cogan was saying in those halcyon days, while he was still a carefree, vagrant sheep:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Just as King Herod sought to destroy an Infant rival, so Éamon de Valera sought to destroy a new Party in the field.  He had failed to destroy that Party completely but he has succeeded in destroying his own. When I tried to instil into the mind of that senile delinquent, the Minister for Local Government, some sense of responsibility and when I reminded him of the danger of a midwinter election which would inflict a grave injustice on a large section of the rural population....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I trust that Deputy Cowan and the senile delinquent and King Herod between them will be able to restore the circulation of Deputy Cogan's feet. Will he think me unkind if I say: Ave Salve atque vale?  Travel softly lest those feet grow cold again.  He is not the first simple, kindly creature who <Col N="46" /> has walked into a parlour and found there nothing so exotic, nothing so arresting as King Herod, neither a Tetrarch nor a chief priest, nothing but a hairy spider.  The Tetrarch and the chief priest at least went through the form of giving the victim a trial, but the fly that walks into a spider's parlour is like the young lady from Riga who went out for a ride on a tiger &mdash;I know the poem goes on that they both came back from the ride with the lady inside and a smile on the face of the tiger.  Whether it be a tiger or a spider, Deputy Cogan will find the accommodating stomach of the spider or the tiger waiting to wrap him in a consoling animating warmth which will guarantee him against his senile and delinquent friend's anxiety lest his feet be unduly cold.</P>
    <P>Surely these Deputies must be ashamed; surely these Deputies who gloried in their resolution to be all or nothing, surely those Deputies who, ten days ago, confidently prophesied that the inter-Party Government would acquire by purchase the votes wherewith to command a majority, will feel our people justified in saying to them: &ldquo;It was you who spoke of these votes as being up for auction.  In whose shop window are they now displayed?&rdquo; We never bought them; we never said they were for purchase; we never indicated that a single one of them, no matter how strict his censure was upon us, was corrupt.</P>
    <P>We are not ashamed and we make no apology to argue with, to reason with, to urge on any Deputy of Dáil Éireann to lend us a hand, but I challenge anyone in this House or outside it to maintain that, despite the ferocity and the bitter injustice of some of the criticisms levelled against us, it can ever be said by any of these men that we said they were for sale. It was Fianna Fáil who said that; it was Fianna Fáil who repeated it.  Am I unjust if I say to Fianna Fáil now: &ldquo;How come they in your shop window?&rdquo; They are your only claim to form a Government in this country, and it was you who stigmatised them as the purchasable dross of Irish public life.  How can men accept that stigma and serve those who put that <Col N="47" /> stigma on them?  Do they deny putting that stigma on them?  Do they deny that day after day since the final count was published their newspaper had no comment to make upon it but that?  There was bargaining; there was an open market.  They are the people who now assert that the highest interest of the public life of Ireland is to be served by reneging all they put before the people when this campaign began by getting their title deeds from Deputies whom they thought it right to stigmatise as potential articles of commerce.</P>
    <P>If I thought of any Deputy in this House as someone eligible for purchase I would cut off my hand before I would disgrace this country by constituting part of a Government returned to office by a man who would sell his trust for money.  It is a dreadful thing to say of a Deputy chosen by our people.  God knows we are not all angels, and we do not profess to be. God knows this Dáil is not a kindergarten, and thank God it is not.  It is an arena of free men where hard blows are given and taken in the ordinary course of our public life.  That is what it should be and it is as that that I am proud to belong to it.  I am not suggesting that election by the Irish people is a certificate of angelic virtue for any man, but it is a certificate that he is a decent man or he would not be a representative of our people in our Parliament.  It is Fianna Fáil who choose to withdraw that certificate of character, and, having withdrawn it, to lean on those they slandered to get power.  Thank God, the inter-Party Government never had to do that; thank God, the inter-Party Government never proposed to do it; thank God, the inter-Party Government never had to seek, and no one would have dreamt it would accept the support or suffrage of a purchasable man.</P>
    <P>I should like to go on with the work we are doing.  It was hard work and it was work in which there was little monetary reward for those who undertook it, and God knows that that is true of our predecessors just as much <Col N="48" /> as it is of us.  Our predecessors who served as Ministers of this State were shamefully, meanly and contemptibly underpaid, and that should be redressed at an early date.  I claim no credit&mdash;nobody dare do so, standing in front of men who served for 18 years as Ministers of this State &mdash;for forgoing the right to adequate monetary reward for serving as a Minister. Dozens of other men have forgone it in similar circumstances in this country and made no moan about it.</P>
    <P>I do not deny for a moment that I gloried in being afforded the opportunity of doing something to complete the work on the land of this country that had been begun in a previous generation.  I am not ashamed of the record of myself or of any of my colleagues. I think it is a record of which all of us have a right to be proud, and, if there is one I would mention who did as much as or more than any of us to give this country its rightful place in the world, to raise it in the estimation of every nation and to give those of us whose duty it was to go abroad in the name of Ireland pride in our office wherever we went, that man was Seán MacBride.  He and I were for many a long day at diametrically opposite poles in the political life of this country.  To-day, in regard to many matters relating to economics and possibly to politics, we might not see 100 per cent. eye to eye, but we found it possible to work together for common ends.  It was an honour and a privilege to work with him and some day those who poured slander upon him, because it was safe to slander him for he had so many enemies who rejoiced to see him slandered, will regret much of what they said and will feel the bitter wound themselves of the man who throws a weapon unaware that the weapon he is using is a boomerang.</P>
    <P>I value my repute in the public life of Ireland.  I am proud to remember that a part of my public life was in the closest possible association with as distinguished a public servant as this country has ever had, Seán MacBride. I am proud to have served under as good a Taoiseach as this country ever has produced or ever can produce.  I <Col N="49" /> deal in no hyperbole.  I do not describe him as the unprecedented God-sent leader of the Irish people.  I describe him as as good a Taoiseach as this country ever had or ever can produce. There will be his match in every generation.  Our people have not ceased to produce them and, with God's help, they never will.  I envy anyone who comes after us who is privileged to have the very high honour of serving in an Irish Cabinet under so splendid a Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is too early to deliver a valedictory address.  I have been 32 years on the roads of Irish politics and that pilgrimage leaves no space for wishful thinking.  If the decision of this House requires us to leave down the work we are just beginning, so be it.  That is the fortune of politics and only a fool engages in politics if he is not prepared to take the rough with the smooth.  I lay it down, if I have to, with reluctance for I loved to serve. I only hope and pray that the work we have started, that we have only just started, will not be destroyed in malice or envy or spite.  I heard so many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies jealous of our achievements denigrate the things we had done.  I knew they were doing it because they were jealous.  I implore them, if they do not consider it a sin against consistency to label the Deputies of this House as purchasable merchandise and glory in their right to form an Irish Government by their suffrage, so far to strain their consistency as to allow the plans they so much blew upon to carry on for the benefit of our people.  If they are not able to build, let them not destroy; if they are not able to create, let them not sterilise; and if they are not able to treat the work of governing Ireland as a glorious adventure, in which it is a privilege to give all that one has, let them not turn it into a base, mercenary traffic of corruption and intimidation.</P>

      <P>In the situation that now exists, the responsibility of deciding big issues rests on a few individuals. Each of us carrying that responsibility must act in accordance with his conscience and do what he thinks is best in the national interest.  If I interpret correctly the mind of the people, they want a period of stable Government. The country wants us to-day to elect a Government that will be able to remain in office for the full statutory term of five years.  I had to ask myself&mdash;and I have to ask myself yet&mdash;in what way that stable Government can be found. Can a group of Parties, opposed by a solid bloc of 69 Deputies, assisted by some Independents, give us stable Government?  Or can that bloc of 69, assisted by a number of Independents, give us stable Government?  I think that the bloc of 69, generally supported by a number of Independents, will give us a stable Government; and in the peculiar circumstances in which this House finds itself, I think that the largest Party in the House, because of its voting strength in the country, has a duty to accept office and give, if it can, stable Government to the people. Whatever my own personal views in the past may have been, my duty as a Dáil Deputy is clear.  I must vote for Deputy de Valera to ensure, so far as I can, <Col N="51" /> stable Government for the country.</P>
      <P>There are other reasons why I should vote for a new Taoiseach and a new Government.  The dissolution of the last Dáil was brought about by the action of the inter-Party Government in throwing overboard, without the authority of this Dáil, the free-for-all mother and child scheme, and substituting for it a scheme with a means test; and also by the unconstitutional action of the Minister for External Affairs in bringing about the resignation of the Minister for Health, Dr. Browne, from the Government.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, a Chinn Chomhairle, I wish to submit that if a charge of unconstitutional action against a Minister is to be made, it should be made to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and adjudicated upon by it; and that otherwise the Deputy is not in order in accusing a Minister appointed by this Dáil of unconstitutional action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne himself, and those of us who supported him in this House and in the country, were vindicated by the electorate. Those who were foremost in the blood hunt against Dr. Browne were either defeated or humiliated by the electorate.  The inter-Party Government, by insisting on a means test, were acting contrary to the spirit of the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all anxious to see an end to Partition.  We all know that many of our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties have a real fear that if they unite with us they will be ruled not by the lawful Government but by the Bishops.  It has always been the endeavour of patriots to establish beyond doubt that there was no foundation for those fears.  But the declarations and action of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for External Affairs and other Ministers in connection with the mother and child scheme, and the reckless nonsense spoken by the Attorney-General on occasions, have unfortunately accentuated the fears and postponed the peaceful ending of Partition.  Grave national damage has been done and if <Col N="52" /> the Taoiseach and his Minister were to be permitted to remain longer in office the prospects of a friendly settlement of the Partition question would be seriously jeopardised.  The damage done must be repaired as quickly as possible, the fears of our Protestant fellow-countrymen must be allayed; and that can be done only by the election of a new Government, that will carry out its duties according to the laws and the Constitution, without fear, without favour and without religious discrimination.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government approved of the action of the Minister for External Affairs in arrogating to himself the powers and responsibilities of the Taoiseach and for that action they must now be brought to account. I believe in the ideals of James Connolly. In his lifetime, James Connolly was condemned and vilified from the same sources as I am condemned and vilified from to-day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We all know that Deputy Costello carried grave burdens and rendered sterling service during his three years of office as Taoiseach.  Although I have to vote against his re-election and to criticise certain aspects of his administration, I feel that he deserves the sincere thanks of the nation for a difficult job of work well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give my reasons for the way in which I intend to vote in the election of Taoiseach in this new Dáil.  I have not the power of oratory displayed by the Minister for Agriculture.  I was glad I had not those powers of oratory when I listened to him speaking in this House in connection with a colleague of mine, Dr. Noel Browne.  I am glad for the sake of the country that Deputy Dillon is an Independent, and as such is speaking only in an independent capacity.</P>
      <P>I find myself in the position of one who is a real Independent in this House to-day.  I have no thanks to offer to any political party for my return here as a Deputy.  I can actually say that I received much more criticism and that I was slandered in a bigger way by members of the inter-Party group than by members of the present Opposition.  But, when I decided the manner in which I would cast my vote, I had to leave out of my mind any trace of bitterness in connection with that campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three things open to me: 1, I could vote for Deputy Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach; 2, I could vote <Col N="55" /> for Deputy John A. Costello as Taoiseach; 3, I could abstain from voting.  I cut out the third immediately because, no matter what my personal views are in connection with the people on either side of the House, I think I was elected here at least to cast a vote for one or the other.  When I examined the issues such as they were, in the election, I found myself fighting in Roscommon in a lone capacity. I resigned from a political Party due to the fact that I believed a colleague of mine in that Party had been disgracefully treated within that Party.</P>
    <P>I supported a colleague of mine in his stand within the Party in connection with the mother and child scheme without a means test.  It might interest this House to know that a mother and child scheme without a means test belonged to the Clann na Poblachta Party and was not the pet or private concern of the particular Minister in the case.  That scheme came from the organisation to which I belonged. I resigned because members of that Party ratted on their colleague in connection with the implementation of that scheme.  I have never, however, at any time during the campaign or prior to my resignation, stated that I opposed a system&mdash;and I repeat a system&mdash;of inter-Party government.  I felt all along that the responsibility of the recent crisis lay at the door of the Party to which I belonged and I still feel that the responsibility should lie at that door.</P>
    <P>When the different Parties went to the country in this campaign Fianna Fáil asked the people to give them an over-all majority.  They asked the people of Ireland to return a one-Party Government and give them a majority over all the parties, all the Independents, who stood in that campaign. The people of Ireland made their decision and my view at any rate is that they did not want Fianna Fáil to have an over-all majority in this Dáil.  We all agree that the people are the bosses; they put us here to carry out their wishes and I think that the verdict of the people on this occasion was indecisive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> I remember that in the by-election some time ago in Donegal the Leader of the Opposition made a very strong case against the inter-party Government. He described the inter-Party Government as a platypus, some kind of unnatural animal that exists in Australia or elsewhere.  He pointed out&mdash;and I think rightly on that occasion&mdash;that the inter-Party Government was formed after the election by people who, before the election, never mentioned that they were prepared to take part in such a Government Deputy de Valera stated in Donegal that the people of Ireland had not given a mandate to the different Parties in 1948 to form an inter-Party Government. That is not such a long time ago.  In the recent election, however, various Parties composing the inter-Party Government did go to the country as a platypus, if you like, as a strong front against Fianna Fáil.  The people of Ireland again gave a decision and in this case, too, I believe it to be indecisive.</P>
    <P>In all sincerity I would like to say that I can see no difference in the world between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael except the difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  It is an artificial difference at the moment, a difference based on personal animosities, and if these Parties and their leaders were big enough they would forget the past, join together and form one group.  They have one ideal and there are other people in this House who do not agree with the outlook and policy of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I believe that the people are at present somewhat bewildered.  They have given no mandate to Fianna Fáil and did not return them with an over-all majority.  The issues in the recent campaign were confused by the tragic episode of Deputy Dr. Browne, and if that tragedy had not occurred I believe that the people's decision in the election would undoubtedly have been in favour of the inter-Party Government. At the present time the people are somewhat uneasy, and I believe that what they would really like is a caretaker Government.  They want a period in which to sum up the situation, and in that period it is essential that we <Col N="57" /> should not have a very strong one-Party Government.  If the people need that type of Government at a later date they are the bosses and could say so decisively, but at the present moment they have not said so.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have put up a 17-point programme.  They did not put up that programme before the election.  They did not tell the electorate, the people of Ireland, that they had 17 points to offer and that they were going to develop the West of Ireland and do things for it which they neglected to do for the 16 years they held office.  In saying that I am not praising the inter-Party Government for any great work they did in the West of Ireland in the last three years.  The problem of the West of Ireland has been completely ignored by the inter-Party Government and by their predecessors, Fianna Fáil, who held office for 16 years.  Now at the last moment, just before the election of the new Government, the Opposition offers us certain points about the development of the West.  I regret I cannot at this stage accept them as being sincere, coming from a Party which, for 16 years, failed to implement any policy for the development of the West.</P>
    <P>Again on this matter I find myself in a difficulty in connection with one group in the inter-Party Government &mdash;the Fine Gael Party&mdash;who have, as far as I can gather, tied themselves up completely with the question of private enterprise.  I believe that private enterprise will not solve the problems of unemployment and emigration in the West of Ireland.  It is essential that whatever Government is in power will give to the Industrial Development Authority sufficient funds to set up industries in rural Ireland and thus give permanent employment to the youth at present going across the sea.  Fianna Fáil have offered nothing to the people of Ireland in that connection.  Fianna Fáil have given no promise to set up industries in the West or to supplement private enterprise by State concerns.  The inter-Party Government have at least got it to their credit that they took the first step in that direction when they set up the Industrial Development Authority.  I <Col N="58" /> hope they will take the second step in the very near future by putting funds at its disposal to enable it to carry out the necessary work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the people have not made their final decision.  I am only one individual, but I do not believe that the people gave a mandate to Fianna Fáil to go back as a strong one-Party Government. I think that the best thing that could happen in this country for the present would be to preserve the <i>status quo</i> and to let the people decide at a later stage whether they want to return to power, with an over-all majority, the people who now comprise the Opposition or whether they wish to strengthen the hand of an inter-Party Government.  Personally, I could not accept the 17-point programme put forward by Fianna Fáil. I believe that, as far as they are concerned, if they are returned to power, we shall be back to a dictatorship system once again, because the leopard cannot change its spots.</P>
      <P>For the reasons I have outlined, even though I find myself in disagreement with sections of the inter-Party Government, on this occasion, as a complete Independent, I find that I am in conscience bound to cast my vote for Deputy Costello as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest against the insincere and hypocritical speech which was made by Deputy Cowan.  I hold that any Deputy of this House is perfectly entitled to cast his vote as he thinks fit, with or without explanation. However, if a Deputy attempts to give an explanation to the House as to why he has changed his mind, I think he ought to give the real reasons and not imaginary ones.  Deputy Cowan says that he will vote for Deputy de Valera on the basis of stability.  He says that a Party of 69 members, plus some Independents who will support it, offers a better type of stability for the country than an inter-Party Government. Deputy Cowan voted for an inter-Party Government in 1948 <Col N="59" /> although the Fianna Fáil Party was the largest single Party in the country at that time, just as it is to-day.  It is obvious that something has happened since 1948 which has caused Deputy Cowan to change his mind and to cause him to withdraw his support from the ideal of an inter-Party Government and to transfer it to the ideal of a single-Party Government.  He has not explained what it is that has caused him to change his mind.</P>
      <P>I protest particularly against the liberty which Deputy Cowan has taken in his references to the late James Connolly and to the Labour Party. There is scarcely a Party left in this country that Deputy Cowan has not tipped his toes to.  He has never contributed anything to the Labour philosophy of this country and he has no right to mention the late James Connolly or the Labour Party which was founded by him.  We must strongly resent any such references by Deputy Cowan.  He came into the Labour Party&mdash;his stay was brief.  He tried every Party in the country&mdash;now it is going to be the Fianna Fáil Party.  He expressed fear of a dictatorship by Fianna Fáil.  He need not worry. There is no room for two dictators in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan has carefully concealed the real reason for his change of heart.  His association with the Clann na Poblachta Party was brief. Since he was expelled from that Party he has had his knife in the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride, who is the Leader of that Party.  Not alone has Deputy Cowan set himself up as an authority in the political sphere, but he wants to be accepted as an authority in the moral and theological sphere.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the uninterrupted <Col N="60" /> and unchallenged references made by Deputy Cowan during his speech this afternoon.  I think I am entitled to refer to the remarks which he made.  He omitted to say that he has set himself up as the authority on morals.  He has set himself up over the heads of the Hierarchy and Priests of this country to interpret Catholic moral and Catholic social teaching.  He omitted to say this afternoon that he considered himself a better authority on these subjects than anybody else.  I am sure that his outlook in that respect will not be accepted on any side of this House.  Certainly, it will not be accepted by those of us who are sitting on this side of the House and I am equally sure that it will not be accepted by the Deputies on the Opposition side of the House.  However, when he goes over to the Fianna Fáil Party he can preach that policy and theory to them, though I do not know what success will attend his efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have decided to vote for Deputy Costello and others have decided to vote in favour of Deputy de Valera.  That is their own business. My protest is against the hypocritical and insincere speech made by Deputy Cowan.  He spoke about everything but the particular matter which has caused him to decide to vote in favour of Deputy de Valera. Deputy Cowan was expelled from Clann na Poblachta, and since then he has nursed a grudge against the Minister for External Affairs.  Deputy Cowan seized his opportunity as a result of the position which arose in connection with the mother and child scheme.  I do not want to dwell on the history of that scheme now.  The members of the House are well aware of it.  Deputy Cowan saw an opportunity of getting his own back.  He jumped into the arena and, as he boastfully claims in his election address, he forced a general election. If he casts his vote in favour of Fianna Fáil I should like to ask him why he has changed from the principle of inter-Party Government, for which he voted three years ago, to the principle of one-Party Government, which he supports now.  I should like to ask <Col N="61" /> him, further, why he should try to hide the real reason.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to detain the House.  It is my intention to reflect for a few moments on the two candidates who have been nominated for the high position of Taoiseach of this country.  Deputy Éamon de Valera has been proposed and duly seconded, and Deputy John A. Costello has been proposed and duly seconded.  In a few moments I, as an Independent Deputy, will be expected to record my vote on what I know, and what my experience has been, of the two candidates, not on what the inter-Party has been or what they would do if re-elected, not on what Fianna Fáil is going to do if elected, and not on the past history of Fianna Fáil, because it is too sad, too bad and too disastrous to be reminding this House of it on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I would like to warn Independent Deputies in particular, because not one of them told their constituents in the recent general election that, if they were returned as members of this House, they would follow Deputy Éamon de Valera into the Division Lobby and have him elected as Taoiseach of this country by their vote.  I would like to hear Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll on that, or Deputy Peadar Cowan or even Deputy Dr. Browne or any other Independent Deputy.  For example, I would like to hear Deputy John Flynn, in whose constituency one of the candidates was almost torn to bits.  I would like to know if Deputy John Flynn told the people of South Kerry, who pulled the headlights off Deputy de Valera's car, that Deputy Éamon de Valera was going to be his choice of Taoiseach in this country.  I hope and trust that Deputy John Flynn will have the courage, within the next ten minutes, to tell Dáil Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope that is one question that will be answered.  Now I am a purely Independent Deputy. I am independent in every sense of the word.</P>

      <P>I topped the poll in my constituency when in opposition; I topped it as a supporter of this Government, and, please God, I will top it again in opposition whether Fianna Fáil are in, or whether they are out.  Deputy de Valera came to my constituency.  I must refer to that, as he is now one of the candidates. He is now wondering whether or not he is going to get my vote.  I want to reflect for a moment on the fact that when he visited my constituency, and he did so on more than one occasion, he dwelt completely and solely on Deputy Flanagan, but, at the last general election, he said: &ldquo;There is no use.  He is as solid as the rock of Dunamaise, and we will not mention him,&rdquo; and he did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made in this House to bargaining.  There has been such, and such will go on to the end of time, because power is mighty to grasp.  A man who has been in power for 16 years and has been relaxing for three years has more energy, courage and determination to grab power, and to leave nothing undone to grab it and grasp it again, and he has done so.  In an hour from now I, probably, will be sitting where Deputy Eugene Gilbride is sitting now.  There is not the least doubt that I have served for three years under the leadership of Deputy John A. Costello.  I have done so to the amazement of Deputy de Valera, to his surprise and to his disgust on every occasion that I rose in this House to speak on Government policy.  Even on the last occasion, when I spoke for two hours and 40 minutes, he raised his nostrils in disgust that Deputy Flanagan should not have been the first to wreck and bring to destruction the <Col N="63" /> inter-Party Government, as he did with the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>But, now I am the proudest man in this House to-day because of the fact that I have sat behind Deputy John A. Costello, for whom I am going to record my vote.  I am proud to echo every single word of James Dillon's, and, in his company, will be proud to be defeated.  It is defeat in honour, defeat in glory.  I am going down with men who are the richest men in this country, or in Europe, because they have principles still, and no power and no money can buy principles at any price.  I want to go on the records of this House as saying that I know quite well that, on the Fianna Fáil Benches, there are decent men. There are men there that I like.  There is nothing I like better than to sit in the library and have a chat with, for example, Deputy Michael Sheridan or with Deputy Patrick Boland from my own constituency, or, in a not unimportant part of this House, with Deputy Cormac Breathnach.  I love particularly to have a chat with a decent man like Deputy Seán MacCarthy who said, because he voted for Deputy de Valera on one occasion, that he felt like a fish swimming against the current, but he had to vote because Deputy de Valera had said so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The records of the House are there.  If Deputy MacCarthy desires me to do so, I shall quote from the volume later to-night.  It is a well-known fact that in every sense of the word I am an Independent Deputy.  I have been elected without Fianna Fáil votes, without Fine Gael votes and without Labour votes.  I was elected on my own in my own constituency at four general elections, and, recently, I was elected with a very great surplus of votes, despite the fact that, during a period of 18 months, I had to be absent from this House owing to illness. I want to express wonder and great concern at the fact that Deputy Seán Lemass, on his tour of the Independents in recent weeks, did not at least pay me the respect of a call and say.  &ldquo;I know you will not vote for <Col N="64" /> me, but I am making this courtesy call on you.&rdquo;  He did that in Kerry and elsewhere.  There was a courtesy call paid to Independents, but Deputy Flanagan was left out and was not called upon.  I am at sea to know why that courtesy call was not paid.</P>
      <P>I want to say that, when I was in opposition some years ago.  I was a very active Deputy.  I believe that I did my job.  I want now to give a warning to this House to-day and a warning particularly to a young man like our friend Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, who is a newly-elected member of this Parliament, and who has now decided to inflict this hell upon the Irish people.  But since Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll does not know the cunning, the craft and the treachery that are behind some of the men into whose hands he is now placing the destinies of this country, I hope that some day, when this young man has had the long experience I have had in this House, he can say: &ldquo;I have done a wrong and I have done a wrong from which many have suffered.&rdquo;  I warn Independent Deputies who are supporting Deputy de Valera that there is not a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who cast a vote for Fine Gael but will be victimised, and that there is not a supporter of Labour but will pay the penalty for depriving Deputy de Valera of his power for the past three years and which is now being restored to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope and trust that those who voted for Deputy Cogan, those who voted for Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll and, last but not least, the handful who voted for Deputy Cowan, will not be the subject of the cruel, vindictive, harsh and unjust treatment that was meted out to them during the last term Deputy de Valera was the Leader of the Government in this country.  I hope that will not happen.  I believe it will happen.  I believe it is my duty to defend Deputy J.A. Costello, to support him and vote for him and pay a tribute to his colleagues of the inter-Party Government who always met me with the greatest courtesy, kindness and sympathy.  I failed to get that from Fianna Fáil and I do not expect to receive it from Fianna Fáil in the years ahead.  Should Deputy de Valera be elected, I want to warn him that there <Col N="65" /> is one man he should keep a close and careful eye upon and that man is myself, for as sure as I brought destruction on his Government before, I will do it again.  I did it alone on the last occasion, but I have Deputy Peadar Cowan with me this time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan has brought destruction on more Parties than one and I am proud and glad, charmed and delighted that Deputy de Valera and Deputy Peadar Cowan are at last on terms of the closest possible friendship.  That is the company I would expect Deputy de Valera to be in.  That is the company that one would expect one to be in who is anxious for power.  I believe that as sure as Deputy Cowan records his vote for Deputy de Valera&mdash;I do not claim to be a prophet, but I have made prophecies in this House in recent years that were fulfilled&mdash;it will be the dearest, the most expensive and the most heart-breaking vote that Deputy de Valera ever got, because it will bring more trouble on him than the votes of all the Deputies of this House, even of those disgruntled backbenchers who were anxious to deprive Deputy de Valera of the leadership of his own Party and put in Deputy Lemass as the leader.</P>
    <P>We have to look at something more important than that.  Deputy Dr. Browne made a feeble speech and Deputy Cowan referred to the unfortunate matter of the mother and child scheme.  That was an unfortunate business, but it does not arise here to-day and should not be discussed. One of the reasons I stand behind John A. Costello and will record my vote for him is&mdash;I spoke in this House in favour of Dr. Browne; I like Dr. Browne; he is a decent man, young and easily led and he has been more easily led in the past three days than ever in his 36 years of existence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the stand he took in accepting no other advice but that of the Catholic Hierarchy of this country on a matter which concerns the lives of our people.  As I said on that occasion, any country that refuses to <Col N="66" /> give a sympathetic ear to the teachings of the Hierarchy is doomed to disaster. It has happened on the Continent. Since Deputy de Valera finds himself in the company of those people who are out to doom this country and bring destruction on it, I hope and trust that the line taken by Deputy J.A. Costello on that occasion will be taken to the distaste and dissatisfaction of the men who are left to give him back the power and the control for which he has longed.  Any country which disrespects the rulings of the Church will fail.  I admired the outgoing Taoiseach's stand on that occasion and that is the reason why I am prepared to vote for him.</P>
      <P>There is another reason why I am prepared to vote for Deputy J.A. Costello.  I believe he is straight.  I believe he is the straightest of the two candidates.  I remember one of the candidates nominated for the high position of Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, saying that he was prepared to break stones if he were defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>What did you say about breaking stones?  Deputy de Valera always finds trouble in defining the difference between an untruth, a lie and a falsehood.  Why, I do not know, nor do I know what the difference is.  I read the statement about the breaking of the stones.  We all read it and it is common knowledge. Did Deputy de Valera raise a stone hammer in the past three years?  Did he sit on a sack of straw and wear the goggles that were being prepared for him if he were to leave office?  He did not.  Does not Deputy Cowan remember; does not Deputy Cogan remember and does not Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll remember?  It is only right to refresh Deputy Dr. ffrenchO'Carroll's memory lest he might not have been politically minded on the occasion when one of the nominees suggested that 45/- a week was an adequate wage for the workers of this country.  How does Deputy Cowan intend to tell the workers in his constituency that he has voted for a man who believes that 45/- a week is a proper and adequate wage for the worker? <Col N="67" /> How is Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll going to explain to those workers who may have voted for him that he is now voting for a man who, as the public records will prove, stood by 45/- a week for the workers?</P>
      <P>There is another reason why Deputy Cowan is supporting Deputy de Valera, and that is because Deputy Cowan is a smart man.  Let no one think that Deputy Cowan is a fool&mdash;far from it. I give Deputy Cowan that certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>I give Deputy Cowan that certificate.  I give it in the spirit in which I would like to get such a certificate from one who has the understanding of Deputy Cowan were it of any use to me.</P>
      <P>There is another reason why Deputy Cowan is anxious that Deputy de Valera be Taoiseach.  Because he foresees the establishment once more of Deputy de Valera's miltary tribunals and special Criminal Courts which will result in a flow of benefits to the Deputy in another direction which I do not propose to mention here.  He foresees that with Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach the supporters of Deputy MacBride will be rounded up and sent again to the Curragh out of which we released them.  That will prove an advantage to a man in the position of Deputy Captain Cowan.</P>

      <P>That will be an asset to Deputy Captain Cowan.  I believe that the most disastrous day in the history of our country will be to-day, because when we re-assemble here this evening Deputy Captain Cowan will be occupying the Government Benches in company with Fianna Fáil.  They are welcome to the benches.  In the event of the election of Deputy de Valera&mdash; and there can be little doubt about it now&mdash;I trust he will not break any more promises.  I hope he will repent sincerely the manner in which he made promises to the Irish people in the past and then forgot those promises.  He cannot fail to remember that his Party <Col N="68" /> has promised that there will be no compulsory tillage.  I hope that the small farmers living on the slopes of the Wicklow mountains will not find themselves compelled to erect offices, instead of stables and barns, in order to provide accommodation for the ten fields full of inspectors that Deputy Smith threatened to inflict upon them.</P>
      <P>He also stated that he would make these old clods till.  That is the way in which Deputy de Valera's Party has referred to our farmers.  Now these old clods will be made till, thanks to Deputy Cogan.  It is Deputy Cogan who will compel them to do it.  There will be ten fields full of inspectors, thanks to Deputy Cogan.  At least he is ensuring that the farmers on the slopes of the Wicklow hills will not be lonely because they will have daily calls from inspectors from Merrion Street, armed to the teeth with pens and pencils to see that the farmers plough and sow.</P>
      <P>In the past three years I have spoken on various occasions from these benches.  I have on occasion criticised the inter-Party Government.  On no occasion did I vote against it because this inter-Party Government performed not a single act which warranted my recording a vote against it. The work it did was appreciated by the people and the people intended to return the inter-Party Government. Because of craft that Government will not now return.  I wonder will we have a Supplementary Budget at an early date, introduced by that Minister appointed by Deputy de Valera, should he be elected.  I wonder will there be a Supplementary Estimate of any kind to provide funds to compensate for those spent on returning Fianna Fáil to power.  I ask that deliberately.  I ask it with a full sense of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of the present Taoiseach being defeated and the inter-Party Government, I assure the House that to-day will be a day the country will regret.  Since I left school I have believed in real democracy.  I believe that the farmers, the workers and the businessmen should have a say in the making of our laws.  I believe that legislation should not be left to one particular section.  We have a democratic <Col N="69" /> country and the people have freedom to vote.  As has been said before, if a dud is sent to Parliament the people have a right to send such a dud to Parliament.  The people have a perfect right to send a collection of duds to Parliament if they wish.  Deputies are perfectly free to vote for a Taoiseach who will do good or a Taoiseach who will do harm.  If they vote for the latter they do so with their eyes wide open because they know the records of the two candidates now before the House.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Costello is defeated, I appeal to Labour, the loyal Independents and those others who believe that all sections of our people should have a say in the making of our laws, to stand together.  If we go down, let us go down together with a smile in defeat just as we can smile in victory. Let us take our places on the other side of the House and carry on as a solid team, as we have done over the past three years.  There is one thing certain : we will make Fianna Fáil fulfil their promises this time.  We will make them do what they said they would do.  If they fail to carry out their promises, even with the able assistance of Deputy Captain Cowan, I believe that not many months will pass before we will again find ourselves going to the country to ask the people to decide whether they want one-Party Government or inter-Party Government. I believe within the next few months the people will have reason to regret that they were not more determined and clearer in returning to office that Government which has given such good results over the past three years.</P>
    <P>I propose to vote for Deputy John A. Costello as Taoiseach.  If he is defeated, I shall still stand behind him through thick and thin.  Those of us who have done our part can say that we are leaving office with good foundations behind us.  I hope that those foundations will be built upon and not wrecked.  Even at this late hour I hope and trust that this House will save the country from the ruin and disaster which lie ahead if a one-Party Government is returned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the <Col N="70" /> nomination of Deputy de Valera.  I feel that he is in a position to form a Government in the public interest. In reference to the challenge held out to me by Deputy Flanagan as to my answer on the occasion of Deputy de Valera's visit to Kerry, may I say that in 1948 I voted for Deputy de Valera on principle without my support being either asked for or canvassed? To-day I will do the same on principle.  I feel that Deputy de Valera will always safeguard the national ideal, apart altogether from economic or administrative considerations. I am confident that he will initiate a balanced agricultural policy under which the farmers will receive an increased price for milk and other agricultural produce.  I am confident that that policy will be so arranged that it will be reflected in an improvement of the condition and general economy of the small farmers throughout the country, that it will be operated not for one section of big men or of wealthy people, but for the farmers as a whole.  I am referring now to the small tillage farmers I represent.</P>
      <P>I made a statement the other night in County Kerry and I said with all earnestness and truthfulness that over a long period of years the best Minister we had here, so far as County Kerry was concerned, was Deputy Paddy Smith, that he came from a small farming stock, that he was the nearest approach to the ideal Minister, that he would have the general interest of those people at heart, that he would understand them and arrange an economy that would suit them.  I have had some experience of the administration of the inter-Party Government and I pay tribute to the Taoiseach who was easily approached, a big man, not influenced by bitterness or minor considerations and who was always prepared to do his utmost for the people.  I appreciate that and I also appreciate the consideration extended to me by other Minister with whom I had contact.  I supported that Government in various matters in order to be able to do my utmost for the people I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall do the same thing under <Col N="71" /> Deputy de Valera's Government.  I shall co-operate with him and assist him in every way possible, provided always that his policy and his schemes will be directed towards the interests of the people I represent.  I believe that will be so, but should any difficulty arise I shall always hold myself free to vote against any measures I find detrimental to these people.  In regard to my own county, I have been struggling with the inter-Party Government for the last three years and I failed to get them to do anything big for us.  I have asked a number of questions in regard to the establishment of generating stations in County Kerry by the inter-Party Government and sought their assistance in that regard.  I shall do everything I can again in that regard under Deputy de Valera's Government.  I place my trust in him and I feel that good will come from it.  In conclusion, I wish to say that I am voting for Deputy de Valera for two reasons, (1) that in my opinion he is the embodiment of the national ideal for which our people have fought and died and that he will pursue his policy to the end, and (2) that as the leader of a large Party he is in a position to govern this country and, as such, is in a better position to carry out a policy that will be acceptable to the people than Deputy Costello who would have to negotiate with a number of smaller Parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With a deep sense of responsibility, I rise to speak to the motion before the House.  This, in many ways, is one of the most momentous meetings this House has ever had.  Two candidates are now before us for nomination as Taoiseach and Leader of the new Government. The fate of the Government is being decided by the caprice of certain Independents.  Deliberately and calculatedly I use the word &ldquo;caprice&rdquo; and, deliberately and with responsibility I make the charge, as a young man in this House representing, and proud to represent, an honoured constituency, of irresponsibility against certain Independent Deputies.  We, all of us on all sides of the House, should have reached the stage where bitterness and <Col N="72" /> acrimony can be left behind.  I, as a young man, would be glad to see, rather than the acrimony and the unnatural bitterness that have invaded this House, people who have served loyally and well throughout the years step out of the way and make room for the generation that is coming and will come, despite all of them.  Listening to the hypocrisy of Deputy Cogan coming from Wicklow with his platitudes and lip service to democracy, I deliberately ask where was the bargaining this time and what was the price paid?  Let me sound the warning that if I go into opposition, the opposition of Deputy Oliver Flanagan is going to be nothing compared to that which will come from West Cork from Deputies Pat Murphy and Seán Collins.  Let me warn Deputy Cogan that the wires he got from the decent people, who were misguided into supporting him, are going to have such reverberations that he will be looking for the support of more than one majorgeneral when the rout does come.  It now seems, because of the irresponsibility of certain Deputies who got no mandate for their action, as if we are to have another Taoiseach.  Some of them scraped in and the most vocal of them sneaked in, and indeed may now help to put into office many more people who sneaked in.  I solemnly warn this fourteenth Dáil that, when breaches were being healed, wounds were disappearing and a sense of unity was on its way, they have, by their irresponsibility and by their complete disregard of obligations, cast back this country from the progress we have valiantly and decently made.  Back into this Dáil is going to come again&mdash; and I stand here as a young man to warn you of it&mdash;all that is fruitful of the seeds of dissension.  But I stand here four-square to issue this warning &mdash;try to victimise West Cork if you will and we will fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come here to-day to issue this solemn warning&mdash;that opposition such as was never conceived before is about to come, because it is going to be honest, constructive, intelligent opposition that will even invade the stupid portals of Deputy Cogan's mind.  I stand here as a young man who might, in other circumstances, have earnestly <Col N="73" /> appealed to men who have had an honourable past, many of them an honourable present, to clear off because the finding in this election was clear and succinct&mdash;that the people in this country want new blood.  They want a continuation of the courage and the honesty that were brought into public life under the leadership&mdash; thanks be to God we had it to give the people a taste of what good government could be&mdash;of the man that I proudly and fearlessly support to-day, Deputy John Costello.</P>
    <P>I am going to put on the records of this House this challenge.  There has been talk of no bargaining.  I ask the Leader of the Opposition, if he is nominated as Taoiseach, will he nominate again Deputy Boland as Minister for Justice?  Will he include in his nominations to the Seanad, if he is Taoiseach, a certain well-known prominent supporter of Independent Deputies who have pledged their support to him to-day?  I am making that challenge now because, if it happens, then we will have Cain and Abel. (<i>Interruptions.</i>) Deputy Cogan need not worry.  He and his colleagues are about to leave the arena of Irish public life.  I am issuing the warning that there is a reawakening spirit of liberty, a reawakening urge to real democracy, and I defy all the efforts of any bought or borrowed Independents to keep back that onward march. Ireland is on the move and, though some people deliberately chose in this House to misinterpret the decision of the electorate, their honour and glory will be mighty short.  Grab all you can, but you may find the bowl pretty empty because you do not know how many hungry hands are already reaching out to get something.</P>
    <P>Let me say this as a young man.  I have high hopes that some day when <Col N="74" /> certain personalities have left Irish public life, have gone to their eternal reward after most meritorious service, into this House will come with renewed vigour, coming from the wealth of tradition that is proudly ours, on both sides of this House, youth with sufficient self-sacrifice and honesty to forget personalities and power-lust so that Ireland may be saved.  Let me issue a solemn warning as a young man whom you tried to get out, did your damnedest to get out but could not, that the day of your miserable midnight ride, your intimidation and your threats has gone, because we in Fine Gael have the youth and the energy to break your hearts, and break them we will.  Let my last solemn warning be this&mdash;do not count too much on your office boys; their support is very transient.</P>

      <P>I want to express my thanks to the Dáil for my nomination as Taoiseach. It is, indeed, a very high honour, which I appreciate.  I can only say that I will endeavour to perform the duties of the office as they should be performed, with God's help.  I would also ask the assistance of every Deputy in the House.  I appreciate the difficulty of the work, as I am sure those who are now leaving office appreciate how difficult the tasks of government are.  I can only say that I will do everything I can to co-operate with members of the House and I hope they will do their part and co-operate with me.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there be an interval until 9 o'clock to enable me to go to the President and inform him that I have been duly nominated by the Dáil as Taoiseach and to receive my appointment from him.  When I come back, it will be my duty to announce the names of the Teachtaí whom I propose to have as members of the Government.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of the following Deputies for appointment by the President to be members of the Government:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Pádraig Mac Gabhann,</P>
      <P>Erskine Childers, agus</P>
      <P>Tomás Breathnach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary that I should indicate the portfolios.  I have had very little time to decide on these finally, but for the moment, with certain provision which I have mentioned, we have the following: Seán F. Lemass to be Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I propose also to nominate him as Tánaiste; Seán MacEntee to be Minister for Finance; Séamas Ó Riain, to hold provisionally the two portfolios of <Col N="81" /> Social Welfare and Health; Prionsias Mac Aogáin to be Minister for External Affairs; Tomás Ó Deirg to be Minister for Lands; Gearóid Ó Beoláin to be Minister for Justice; Oscar Traynor to be Minister for Defence; Seán Ó Maoláin to be Minister for Education; Pádraig Mac Gabhann to be Minister for Local Government; Erskine Childers to be Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and Tomás Breathnach to be Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Lest what I have said about reservations would be misunderstood, I wish to say that I had not an opportunity of doing this with the care that I should exercise ordinarily if I had time and therefore these appointments are to be regarded as not finally fixed.  I expect that they will in fact be fixed and that there will be very little change, probably no change at all.</P>
    <P>In regard to Social Welfare and Health, I think these two portfolios are too heavy for one individual to carry for any length of time, but it is desirable in regard to these Departments that the Minister who had been in touch with them should hold the joint office just for a short while, until we understand what the situation in those Departments is.  I want to point out to the Dáil that these are not fixed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is: &ldquo;That the Dáil approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of the persons named, for appointment by the President to be members of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil has approved of the appointment of a Deputy as Taoiseach, it would be normal and natural that it would be left within his discretion to appoint the members of his Government and to allocate to those members so appointed their different portfolios.  I appreciate the difficulty which the Taoiseach has in finally announcing the allocation of his portfolios amongst the various members of the Government to-night. Accordingly, I do not wish to criticise or in any way comment upon that allocation. I feel bound, however, in view of the peculiar circumstances in which <Col N="82" /> this Government was formed, to register a protest against it.</P>
      <P>During the course of the discussion to-day on the nomination of Taoiseach, various Deputies took the opportunity in their speeches to give their interpretations of the results of the General Election.  So far as I was personally concerned, I interpreted the result of that election as a direction to me, so far as it was possible, to form a Government on the basis of an inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>In offering myself, or allowing myself to be nominated, I felt that I was doing what the majority of the electors desired me to do.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of the electors desired an inter-Party Government.  I have equally no doubt that some of the Independent Deputies who voted against the inter-Party Government were voting against the very people who elected them to this Dáil even as Independent Deputies.  It is, therefore, because of the action of these Independents rather than anything to do with the Taoiseach or the members of his proposed Government of his Party that I am to-night registering a protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, if I may, a Chinn Chomhairle, with your permission, to refer just briefly in passing to a very outrageous suggestion that was made by Deputy Peadar Cowan this afternoon against me.  At the time, I intervened very hurriedly but I hope emphatically to state that there was no truth whatever in that suggestion.  I want to repeat here in public to-night that it was a false, shameless and foundless suggestion, giving a real impression of the type of Deputy who was capable of making that charge.  I was personally thanked and my colleagues were thanked by the particular individual concerned for giving him merely information which he asked for last night at a late hour from me and which I gave him.  I made no offer whatever to direct his choice.  I gave him facts for which he asked; I gave him information for which he asked, and I was personally thanked this morning by him on the telephone for what I had done.  That Deputy Cowan should have made such a charge against me. I repeat, is outrageous, false and <Col N="83" /> utterly without foundation and I want to have that repudiation both of the charge and of Deputy Cowan's action in making the charge on the records of this House.</P>
    <P>We as an Opposition approach our task and duty as an Opposition in the same spirit as we approached the task of forming and carrying out the inter-Party Government of this country three and a quarter years ago.  We joined together as a group and my colleagues did me the profound and lasting honour of asking me to lead them with the sole purpose and desire of doing what was proper and good for the people of this country and for the Irish nation.  There was not one single one of us that wanted any office for ourselves.  We wanted to give whatever contribution we had to give in the circumstances existing three and a quarter years ago.  I believe that we gave a notable contribution to the history of this country, to the economics of this country and to the prosperity of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>When I found myself in the position that I did find myself in as a result of this General Election, I made no bargain with anybody.  In so far as I was concerned, there was nobody on offer for me.  It was perfectly plain from the manner in which I had conducted the Government of this country for three and a quarter years that I was available for anyone that wished to consult with me, to confer with me or to have any information from me.  That was the attitude I adopted in connection with the formation, or possible formation, of a Government for anyone who wanted to see me.  Nobody got any offer or any guarantee from me.  There was no Independent, so far as I was concerned, that was on offer to me or was capable of being sold to me.  I was prepared to do what I believe the Irish people wanted me to do, if it was possible, to form an inter-Party Government in accordance with the mandate they had given.  I make no suggestions as to the motives which affected any Independent Deputy in what he did.  That is a matter between him and his constituents and his own conscience but I do register the protest here against the action of these <Col N="84" /> people who, I believe, have acted contrary to the mandate of their electorates.  They have put the Government in a very difficult position, a position in which the Taoiseach was elected by the slenderest majority in the history of this House, a majority which probably would not have been secured had we not felt it our duty to do what perhaps we might not have done, to nominate a Ceann Comhairle. We felt that even by doing that we had lost what might be regarded as a valuable vote in the subsequent voting that had to take place.  We felt that we were bound to carry out our public duty and to see that the business of the country was carried on.</P>
    <P>Now, just as we approached the task of forming a Government three and a quarter years ago in that spirit of giving our services to the Irish nation and the Irish people, with that same spirit we approach the task of carrying on the Opposition to the present Government.  I think it is a good thing in a democratic country that there should be an Opposition.  To this present Government, formed as it is, with the tail that it has, it is a very great safeguard to the Irish people that we have a strong and united Opposition.  As we were in a Party Government, so I believe we will be in opposition and we will not, I believe, do what the Fianna Fáil Party did, when they were in opposition, oppose for opposition's sake.</P>
    <P>So far as we are able to give any contribution in assisting the Government in tasks that are necessary and proper and for the benefit of the people, they will get every assistance and co-operation from us.  But we will, I believe, be a vigilant and a very watchful Opposition.  We will take care that the liberties of the people are safeguarded so far as we can secure it, and I believe it will require the utmost vigilance on our part to see there is no victimisation and no encroachment upon the liberties either of free speech or free expression of opinion or freedom of association in whatever period this Government may retain office.  That assurance I wish to give to the Taoiseach and his proposed Government, <Col N="85" /> that we will not oppose merely for opposition's sake, that we will give them co-operation so far as they are carrying on the policies of which we approve and which we believe are in the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>We have ended to-day, or rather, I should say, put a period to an unfinished chapter of Irish history.  It is a bright chapter in Irish history, I can say, for myself and my colleagues.  It is an unfinished chapter, because I believe the Irish people will again at the next election, be it sooner or later, in no uncertain way, emphasise what they wanted at this election, an inter-Party Government of the type that had carried on this country for three and a quarter years with such beneficial results.  Therefore, the record that we leave behind us is a record of unfinished work.  We have had a very short time within which to carry on the work we set out to do.  Short as it was, we did beneficial work.  We hope to see that the present Government will continue that work and we will be watchful to see that it is continued properly, efficiently and well.</P>
    <P>In particular, one of the outstanding features of the work of the last Government was the work of a capital nature, capital projects financed on the basis on which they were, by means of capital repaid by an annual repayment which appears in the Book of Estimates each year.  We will see as far as we can that those capital projects shall be continued and brought to fruition and we will be vigilant and watchful about the course of the works which we have started to see that they are well and truly carried through.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I would like to finish what I have to say &mdash; I believe it to be relevant in the context of the unfinished work which the last Government left behind them &mdash; by paying a tribute to my colleagues in that Government, to each of those colleagues, to each of the Parties which are unbroken here to-day, who worked so hard and gave such loyal service in spite of certain people who acted in their own selfish interests for the purpose of keeping <Col N="86" /> their own seats in the Dáil.  We are here to-day as an Opposition with those Parties united; we were never beaten as an inter-Party Government; our Parties never broke away from one another; we faced the country as an inter-Party group and we abide by the result of to-day's decision in the Dáil as an Opposition united and stronger by reason of the association and interchange of ideas we have had during the past three and a quarter years.</P>
    <P>I think that we can make a valuable contribution to the welfare of the State in the years that may be before the present Government whether they be long or whether they be short. From all my colleagues, with the exception of one, I got profound loyalty and the hardest work which I believe has ever been put in by a set of people in the interests of this country.  We got loyal, faithful service and they spared themselves neither effort, work, time nor energy.  No words of mine could express the feelings I have for those people: for William Norton, of the Labour Party, for my colleagues of my own Party, for Joseph Blowick and his colleagues in Clann na Talmhan and for my old friend and loyal colleague, Seán MacBride.  For the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I have a special esteem and regard.  He was slandered and defamed by people and by Press unjustifiably in connection with a particular incident; his constituents have given the answer to those slanders and those libels.  I have left to the very last perhaps the outstanding person in my former Cabinet, James Dillon, the former Minister for Agriculture.  The work which he has done will prove to be of lasting value to the farmers and to the general prosperity of the country, not for decades but for centuries to come.  He has left a beneficial mark on the land of Ireland and has pointed the way to the future prosperity of the agricultural community.  He, too, has received what may possibly be regarded as a tribute from the defamers and slanderers; he has been defamed and slandered and that is the best tribute which anybody can get as a politician in this country. He has left the mark of his genius, his constructive imagination and fertile brain on the agriculture of this <Col N="87" /> country, but we who have sat with him day after day know that he gave a far more valuable contribution than his contribution to agriculture because his mind, his experience and his integrity were always at our disposal in the very difficult problems we had to face during the last three and a quarter years.</P>
    <P>I cannot end without expressing the profound gratification and satisfaction which I have, and which will last with me until the end of my days, that I was associated with the Labour Party in an inter-Party Government for the first time in the history of this State. It was to me a matter of profound satisfaction that I worked and worked in the closest harmony, with a unified policy, with no dissensions, no divisions, and no bargaining with the members of the Labour Party, that we in Fine Gael, who were supposed to be conservative, the close-fisted Party, the representatives of the rich if you please, were able to work and find ourselves in close sympathy with the representatives of the working people of this country.  That is to me personally a matter of profound satisfaction which will be to me a memory for the rest of my life.</P>

Thanks to the work of the past three years we have brought to this nation of ours a domestic peace that it has never known before; we have brought stability to the nation, and we have given our people a standard of living incomparably better than they had in 1947 under the administration of the Government now in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of our first acts on taking office was to repeal the penal taxes which the present Government imposed in 1947 on cigarettes, on tobacco, on beer and on cinema seats.  We gave back to the people £6,000,000 per annum by the repeal of these taxes.  If the present Government had been in office during the past three and a quarter years they would have siphoned out <Col N="88" /> of the pockets of the people no less than £20,000,000 in taxes on these commodities. We remitted these taxes; the people, therefore, are £20,000,000 better off than they would have been if the Fianna Fáil Government had continued in office since 1948.  I want to know now from this Government whether on the minority which they got in the recent election they will reimpose these taxes on the people because they managed to manoeuvre themselves into office to-night.  The country is entitled to an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>During the past three years the last Government's record in respect to housing has completely eclipsed anything which was done in the realm of housing in this country during the past 30 years.  Not only did we gear up the housing machine which we found rusty and creaking in 1948, but we have built during the last three years no less than 24,000 houses which are to be seen in every part of the country. The new Minister for Local Government, on going to the Custom House to-morrow, will find abundant documentary evidence of the fact that the outgoing Government built 24,000 houses for the people during the past three years.  Remember that the new Minister for Local Government has good reason to thank Deputy Keyes for the fact that there are 12,000 houses in course of erection and that there is no reason in the world, if that machine is not interfered with by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government, why we should not continue to produce houses at the rate of not less than 12,000 houses per year for the years to come.  We have now reached the situation that, given competent government and no niggardly approach to housing, we can solve for all time the housing problem in the large town, in the smaller town, in the village and in the rural area within three years from this date.  We can now so organise our housing activity, thanks to the housing machine which Deputy Keyes and his predecessor, the late Tim Murphy, built up, as to ensure that housing will not be an issue in any general election held three years from this date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Look at this Government's record in respect of employment.  We have, during the past three years, put 37,000 additional people into insurable employment. The records are there and they can be examined.  Deputy Dr. Ryan can go into the Department of Social Welfare and he will get there to-morrow statistics that will convince him that during the past three years we put 37,000 additional people into employment.  There are more people to-day in industrial employment in this country than at any time in the past 30 years.  So far as unemployment is concerned, we have reached now an all-time low record.  There are less people unemployed in this country to-day than at any time in the past 100 years, and that fact cannot be gainsaid either.  Therefore, in the realm of employment or in the realm of unemployment, not only have we put more and more people into work but we have succeeded in keeping our unemployment figures down to a level that we never attained in this country in the past 100 years.  That is a record of which we are entitled to feel proud.</P>
    <P>Take this Government's record in the field of social services.  While our predecessors could not afford a miserable £500,000 for a modification of the means test for old age pension purposes in 1947, we in 1948 introduced the Social Welfare Bill which not only modified the means test but increased old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions.  On that measure alone we spent not the £500,000 we asked Fianna Fáil for in 1947, but an additional £2,500,000 which has gone into the pockets of old age pensioners, blind pensioners and windows and orphans during the past three years and for each of these years. We increased workmen's compensation during our period of office by no less than 33 per cent., bringing the rate of benefit to a higher level than it had ever reached before.</P>
    <P>We have given to this Government a cut and dried Bill on social security. It passed through this House on the Second Reading.  It is the best Bill this country has ever seen in the sphere of social security.  For the first time it gives our people a comprehensive scheme of social security.  It gives <Col N="90" /> them benefits they never had in the past 30 years &mdash; benefits they did not get under Fianna Fáil's 16 years of office.  I want now to ask Deputy Cowan if he has got a guarantee from the Fianna Fáil Government that that scheme will be proceeded with.  Has he got a guarantee that that Bill will not be dropped?  Has he got a guarantee that the opposition to that Bill, manifested by Fianna Fáil when they were in opposition, will not be pursued by the same Party when it is functioning as a Government?  That Bill assured the working people of greater sickness benefits, greater maternity benefits, greater widows' and orphans' pensions, increased unemployment benefits, new death benefits, new retirement pensions, old age pensions of £1 a week, blind pensions of £1 a week, a further modification of the means test and the conditions so modified as to permit thousands of additional persons to qualify for old age pensions who do not qualify under the existing code.  That Bill is there.  It may be reintroduced into the Dáil next week and it will have the support of the Labour Party and, I hope, of ever other Party concerned with giving a charter of social security to the toiling masses of our people.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Lemass in 1948 that Fianna Fáil had a cut and dried scheme on social security in the Department of Social Welfare.  We were told that, when Deputy Dr. Ryan was leaving office.  I searched the Department's records from top to bottom and I got officials to search the records from top to bottom and the only thing I could find in the Department was a document the size of a quarter of a foolscap sheet of paper on which Deputy Dr. Ryan had written about 20 words not connected with social security at all.  The Department is there now.  Find your scheme when you go back.  You will not.  Only one single document of the size of a quarter of a foolscap sheet, with 20 words about social security, in fact, about statistics, could be found in the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; showing the abiding care and the deep thought which our predecessors had given to the problem of social security.  Produce in this House next week your 1948 scheme.  I <Col N="91" /> defy and challenge you to do it now. Not a single thing had been decided. You left us the job of deciding about 500 issues which had to be decided before a scheme of social security could be introduced.  Produce the scheme you are supposed to have left there &mdash; or apologise for the misrepresentation of 1948.  I bet you will do neither.</P>
    <P>Look at our health services.  In 1947 we were spending £615,000 per annum on our health services.  Look at the 1951 Estimates &mdash; £4,225,000 made available by the outgoing Government for its health services.  Never before was there such a substantial increase for health services as during the period 1947-51.</P>
    <P>Look at the national income.  In 1947 it was £318,000,000.  In 1950 it was £363,000,000 &mdash; all denoting the progress and the courageous approach to problems which characterised the Government with which the Labour Party was associated during the last three years.</P>
    <P>Turn to our exports.  In 1947 our exports were £39,000,000.  In 1950 they were £72,000,000 &mdash; nearly twice what they were in 1947.</P>
    <P>If we turn to economic matters and look at wages, what do we see?  We remember in 1947 statements made in this House and statements made on the platform by spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party that if the trade unions or workers demanded further compensation than the inadequate compensation which, up to then, they had received for the rise in prices during the emergency, the Fianna Fáil Government would introduce legislation for the purpose of freezing wages.  That was the intention in 1947.  You even left behind you the draft proposals which you intended to bring before the Dáil to freeze the wages and to prevent the trade unions from exercising the constitutional rights which they have exercised in this country for 75 years, if they dared to try to get compensation for the workers for the depreciation in their standard of living due to the wage freezing policy practised by Fianna Fáil during the emergency.  Wage freezing was no part of our policy.  Not only did we kill, and I hope kill forever, the wage freezing <Col N="92" /> mentality of our predecessors but, in addition, we dealt liberally, broadly and generously with demands for increased wages wherever these wage increases necessitated Government approval or Government sanction or Government regulation in one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is that every class of worker in this country has a wage level immeasurably better than he had in 1947.  We killed wage freezing, and we killed the mentality behind wage freezing.  Our people can now negotiate freely and conclude collective agreements with employers.  While we were in office there was never any danger of the Government with which we were associated lending itself to making the trade unions impotent, while the employers were free to fight with both hands, as the last Government planned to do.  We have given to our people to-day, and it is acknowledged by everybody who has any contact with the workers, a standard of living immeasurably better than they had in 1947.  Organised bodies like the teachers had striven for arbitration for 30 years and civil servants had striven for arbitration for a like period.</P>
    <P>We have given arbitration boards so that disputes between them, on the one hand, and the executive Government on the other hand, may be arbitrated upon, free from the element of coercion and free from any suggestion of injustice &mdash; arbitrated upon and pronounced upon by an independent chairman mutually acceptable to both sides.  By that we have brought into the teaching profession and into the Civil Service a measure of contentment that never previously existed.  They know now that the last word does not rest with the Minister.  They know now that an independment mind will be brought to bear on their problems, on the injustices under which they may suffer, and that, subject to the overriding authority of the people's Parliament, this Assembly, they can now get a verdict implemented once they secure that verdict from an independent arbitrator.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the field of agriculture. We have brought to agriculture a prosperity that it never previously <Col N="93" /> experienced.  You can get as much to-day for a rabbit as you could get for a calf when Fianna Fáil were in office.  We have brought to the farmer a prosperity that he has never previously enjoyed.  We have given to the agricultural worker increased wages, and, if we were in office for another week or two, he would have got a further increase in wages.  We had given him holidays with pay, and we have given him a weekly half-holiday. These three things have been done in three years, and not a single one of them was done during the 16 years that the Fianna Fáil Government was in office.</P>
    <P>Yes, and we have done more than that.  We repealed the External Relations Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the greatest fraud and make-believe that was ever inflicted on this country.  The Labour Party can claim this pride and this privilege that when that Bill was going through the House we voted against it then because it was a deception.  It was a make-believe, and we have had the privilege of seeing it off the Statute Book of this country, maintaining all the time the same consistent line in 1949 that we had adopted in 1938, when we tried to persuade that Government not to proceed with such an odious Act of Parliament.</P>
      <P>We now, at all events, have made our constitutional position clear before the world.  The murkiness and the muddiness of our constitutional position is gone, and gone for ever.  We no longer have to explain to a foreigner the kind of Republic we are because they could never understand the kind of Republic which kept the President in residence in the Park and in the background, while we used a British King to accredit our representatives to foreign countries. That type of magpie republic is gone. The bird is now one colour.  This Republic is one colour.  It has got a President.  He is the domestic head here, and he is the external head who accredits our representatives to foreign countries, and we have dispensed with the services of his Britannic Majesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I listened over the last three years to speeches made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party regretting the repeal of the External Relations Act. I challenge them now to reintroduce it and stop the lamentations about it having been repealed.  Let them reintroduce it, and let those opposite who dearly love a king have something to play with for their short period in office.</P>
    <P>We cleared up that mess.  We put the President in his rightful place in this country.  He is our domestic head and he is our external head, and nobody now doubts his authority.  We have ceased to have to explain the unusual kind of Republic which, as I say, kept the President in the background and which found a British King as the organ of our external relations with other Powers.  That make-believe is over.  There is no further need to worry about our constitutional status here.  The world knows it, and if you leave the situation as it is to-day you will never get yourself into the same mess that you were in from 1938 until 1949.</P>
    <P>Yes, and we have done more even than that.  There is not a single political prisoner in an Irish jail to-day. This was the first Government for 30 years that never passed a coercion Bill through this Dáil, and our Government was the first Government which had no executions.  We had no military tribunals, and because of that we brought to the country the peace which it knows to-day.  Leave that position so.  Do not get lonely, and do not go hankering after the strife, the bitterness and the acrimony which had disgraced public life here for too many years.</P>
    <P>I want to put this to the House, that nowhere in the long and chequered career of our people has more progress been made than was made during the past three years and made under difficult circumstances, under circumstances which were not conducive to large-scale spectacular programmes. Will Deputy Lemass look up the speech which he made in Letterkenny in October, 1947?  He said that, surveying the international and national scene, in his view, the four years &mdash;<Col N="95" /> 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951 &mdash; were, in his own words, &ldquo;to be the hardest and the grimmest years in Irish life&rdquo;.  It was against that background that we took office.  It was against that background that we managed to make these near-miracle achievements.  It was against that background of promised hardships and grimness that we were able to do the things which we have done during the past three years.</P>

I, speaking for the Labour Party in this matter, am proud of our record over the past three years, proud especially of the part which the Labour Party played in the outgoing Government and proud of the things they succeeded in getting done under the auspices of that Government.  I want to say to the new Taoiseach if you intend to continue that good work, if you intend to introduce in this House measures which will make for the betterment and well-being of our people the full support of the Labour Party may be assumed.  I have to say at the same time that wage freezing or repression will not be tolerated by the Labour Party and governmental indifference and indolence will not be tolerated.  We will give support to every good measure, to every progressive measure and everything aimed at improving the standard of life of our people but we will be no party either to an activity or to the enactment of measures which are not calculated to improve the lot of our people.  This Government has a hard task to live up to our record.</P>

      <P>I bet you that within a month's time you will be anchored to the hair shirt economics of the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, we can watch the efforts of this Government with more than usual interest because it is a rare and strange combination.</P>
      <P>Away back in 1948 Deputy Cogan gave utterance to these views when the Government of that day was being elected.  At column 33 of the Official Dáil Debates, dated 18th February, 1948, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are two logical courses before us.  We must adopt either this idea of representation of all Parties or abolish the system of proportional representation.  The two things do not fit; the system by which the people elected the Dáil, the system of proportional representation, does not fit in with the idea of Party Government.  We must either abolish one or the other and I am hoping that to-day we will, for all time, abolish the idea of Party Government in this country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan, whatever his other deficiencies may be, cannot say that somersaulting is one of them.  In the same speech he described the present Taoiseach as King Herod who sought to annihilate small Parties just as Herod was anxious to annihilate small children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And he prayed then that Deputy de Valera would not again be given the power to wreak possible vengeance on the Deputy Cogans who are merely managing to live a rather hazardous existence.  He said more than that.  He selected Deputy MacEntee for special mention.  The other Deputies and the Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party ought not to get unduly jealous of this, especially when I read the tribute to Deputy MacEntee.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;When I tried to instil into the mind of that senile delinquent, the Minister for Local Government, some sense of responsibility and when I reminded him of the danger of midwinter election which would inflict a grave injustice on a large section of the rural population by depriving them of their right to vote I was told by that gentleman that I was suffering from cold feet.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on this. Let Deputy Cogan's constituents be clear on this.  He has voted to-day for the Taoiseach who thought so little of Deputy Cogan's views that he has come back here this evening with, as Minister for Finance, a person who Deputy Cogan said was a senile delinquent in 1948 and God knows what deterioration has set in in the meantime.  Is that what Deputy Cogan's electors authorised him to do?  Did they give him authority to vote for a person certified to be a senile delinquent by the said Deputy Cogan.  I certainly would love to see the rather touching and tearful reconciliation between Deputy Cogan and Deputy MacEntee.  One can imagine what that reconciliation would <Col N="98" /> be like.  I would like to know from Deputy Cogan to-night whether he is going into the lobby to vote for the person he described in such rude and vulgar terms in 1948 and to elect him as Minister for Finance now.  Deputy Cogan owes it to the House and to his constituents to say whether he asked them for votes to vote for a person who is so deficient in qualifications for a post as Deputy MacEntee is in the eyes of Deputy Cogan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan told the Taoiseach yesterday that the reason he was voting for Fianna Fáil was as a protest against the Irish Bishops' interference in politics.</P>

      <P>I can go to my constituents and get a renewal of confidence every time because they know me.  Deputy Cowan a few years ago was frequently criticised and, indeed, on many occasions, blackguarded by Deputy MacEntee for being the Czarlike chief of the Vanguard organisation which Deputy MacEntee wrote down as the wildest and most irresponsible Communistic organisation in Europe. Deputy Cowan knows how he was abused by Deputy MacEntee about the Vanguard organisation, and Deputy Boland, the present Minister for Justice, took a hand in lambasting Deputy Cowan as well about the Vanguard organisation.  We all know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has Deputy Cowan so many defenders on the Fianna Fáil Benches to-night?  Does not everybody know that Deputy Cowan was lambasted by this House because of his associations with the Vanguard organisations. He is now engaged in propping up the Government composed of the people who did the lambasting, and <Col N="99" /> he has demoted himself from being the Vanguard of the people to being the mudguard of Fianna Fáil.  There will be another touching reconciliation when Deputy Cowan meets his lambasters.</P>
      <P>I remember on one occasion, I think it was in 1948, when the present Taoiseach spent a substantial amount of his time and energy in a denunciation of what he described as mixum gatherum Governments.  Is this the kind of Government you had in mind? He has got a collection of every kind now, political flotsam and jetsam to try to keep Fianna Fáil in office, and I am telling you that I wish him the best of luck with some of them.  I would not have the support of some of the gentlemen at any price.  <i>(Interruptions.)</i> You are now going into office. Conduct yourselves.  Now that you are a Government Party you cannot go round doing the rowdy.</P>
      <P>This Government will take office now.  Deputy Cogan and Deputy Captain Cowan both hope that they will last for five years because elections are perilous things for them and they will do their best to hang on to the Fianna Fáil lifeboat and keep it up, no matter how tempestuous the seas may be.</P>

      <P>A dirty campaign was carried out against those Independents who had the courage to do what they thought right.  I was never asked by any body, Fianna Fáil or inter-Party, to vote for them until to-day.  I was asked definitely&mdash;and I must say this&mdash;would I vote for the inter-Party if a Labour man was nominated as Taoiseach.  I said I had my mind made up and I would not.</P>

      <P>That was at 3 o'clock.  At 3 o'clock I was fawned on by everybody.  At 4 o'clock I was a dirty scoundrel.  Now here is the official record of what I said to-day after Deputy Dillon spoke:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Captain Cowan: In case some of Deputy Dillon's speech might be misinterpreted, I think that if we were to have a discussion with three of his colleagues&mdash;the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins &mdash;we would find how difficult they found it in the early hours of this morning to persuade a young Independent Deputy to act against his conscience and his convictions.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach: A Chinn Chomhairle, I wish here and now to repudiate the suggestion made by Deputy Cowan.  There is no truth whatever in it.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: The Deputy knows that it is not true.</P>
      <P>Captain Cowan: No interviews with an Independent Deputy this morning?</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: Did I not say we interviewed you and everyone else and were proud to do it, but scorned to say we would buy them.</P>
      <P>Captain Cowan: No one is talking about buying, but to persuade a young Independent Deputy to act against his conscience.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> That is the Official Report.  I ask Deputy John A. Costello and Deputy William Norton, who has just left the House, and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins did they this morning see a young Independent Deputy and spend hours with him.  If they did, for what purpose? In the early hours of this morning when all decent Deputies were asleep in their beds getting ready for to-day were the inter-Party interviewing this young Independent Deputy? For what purpose?  Was it to get him to vote for the inter-Party set-up or was it not?  And then Deputy John A. Costello has the temerity to stand up here and make the offensive and bitter speech he made against me here a few moments ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>The Deputy heard part of it.  Then the Deputy comes in here to make a bitter, nasty speech against me.  I do not mind that.  I am used to bitterness in public life.  I am used to being maliciously and slanderously attacked.  I have survived it so far and I will survive it in the future. It is shocking to think that in this inter-Party set up there are types such as some of the types that appeared here to-day with their dirty muck and mud slinging just because I did what I thought was right.  Had I voted for Deputy John A. Costello and kept him in Government I would now be a very fine fellow and anyone that would dare <Col N="102" /> to attack me would get their answer from my colleagues.  Colleagues!  I am only learning something now about the dirtiness of political life and the alleged friendliness and loyalty of colleagues.</P>
      <P>For the reasons I stated to-day I made up my mind that I would vote against the inter-Party Government.  I made no promise to my constituents that I would support the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>If my constituents understood anything at all they understood that I had brought about the general election and I had caused the inter-Party Government to go to the country.  I was completely astonished at that Government's attitude in the Dr. Browne crisis.  I thought that a Government that acted as they did in that crisis was not fit to be a Government in this or any other country.  I gave due and solemn warning here when the Estimate for the Minister for Agriculture was being debated that I would vote against it.  Had I and some of my colleagues voted against it we would have defeated the Government. In order to avoid defeat the Government postponed the Vote and then went to the country.  No one can say that I went before the electorate to support the inter-Party Government. Had any one of my constituents asked me the question during the election I would have told them that I would have to think twice before I would vote for an inter-Party Government.</P>

If the Fianna Fáil Government bring in a measure, which I think is not right, I shall say so and I shall vote against it.  I do not think anyone need have any doubt about that.  If, on the other hand, I think it is a good measure and that it should be supported, I shall support it.  In doing that I shall be carrying out my rôle as an Independent Deputy who is tied neither to Fianna Fáil, to Fine Gael nor to anybody else in this House. Deputy Norton refers to the flotsam and jetsam.  That would have been very welcome to Deputy Norton to-day. He would have clutched at it, and held on to it to-day if he could, but he did not.  I am sorry about one thing.  Here we had an inter-Party Government. They seemed to be very fine fellows, very nice, very courteous and gentlemanly while they were over here but now that they are over there what are they?  Cornered rats.</P>

      <P>Statements have been made and insinuations and implications put forward by Deputy Cowan with regard to a young Deputy who has entered this House for the first time to-day.  I do not know that young gentleman personally.  I met him last night for the first time.  I believe him to be an honourable gentleman and I would be prepared to leave it to that Deputy to ram these untruths down Deputy Cowan's neck.  The circumstances are these.  A representation was made to the then Taoiseach that there was one young Deputy who had to cast an important vote to-day, the first he had ever cast in the nation's Parliament and that he wanted to know as clearly as he could what steps were being taken with regard to the mother and child scheme and to what extent it had progressed.  The Taoiseach, as I think his successor would do, agreed to meet that young Deputy and to give him all the information that he possibly could.  He asked me to be present as a medical Deputy and as the person who had been in touch with the Medical Union and our late colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne.  We met that young gentleman together with a businessman of repute and standing in this city who, I expect, will answer Deputy Cowan in the public Press.  We gave that young gentleman, who is a member of this House and can speak for himself, all the information that we could with regard to the health scheme and the Taoiseach refused to attempt to prophesy the developments of the future.</P>
      <P>The Deputy understood his position and we understood ours.  In the whole of that interview, he was not asked for his vote by any one of us. He said he wanted to know the facts and the circumstances, get the maximum amount of knowledge and then make up his mind for himself as to what he should do.  One remark I did make.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;You are a young Deputy, a professional colleague of mine.  You have just come into the Dáil.  You have got as much information as we can give.  Do not make the mistake of lying &lsquo;doggo.&rsquo; I shall have respect for you if you go into the other Division Lobby and vote for <Col N="107" /> Deputy de Valera.

I regret very much that the gallant Captain, who was so free with his charges 20 minutes ago, has beaten a retreat in face of a challenge and I ask that that should go on the records of this House. When he asked me as one Deputy to answer certain points and give a certain account and that was in process of being given he skedaddled.  But, as I said earlier, I am prepared, in the main, to listen to the Deputy who voted against this Party to-day&mdash;<Col N="109" /> Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll.  At no time during that interview, which was not sought by the then Taoiseach or any member of the then Government, was there any attempt whatsoever made to influence that young Deputy to vote in our favour or against his conscience, as stated.  What we were determined was to give him the fullest information as to the progress of the mother and child scheme in the belief, and in view of the propaganda that was used during the election, that if there was full knowledge of the progress made and the rapidity with which the work was being dealt with he, in his own judgment, and one colleague of his at least who campaigned on the ground that there would be no mother and child scheme, if he were honest, would change his attitude with regard to the continuation of the life of the Government.</P>
      <P>Moreover, as evidence that there was no attempt to influence that young Deputy or his vote, he asked, on leaving the room, was he free to give to Deputy Dr. Browne all the information we had given him last night. The answer he got was that he was not only free to give all that information to Deputy Dr. Browne but that he was free to give it to anybody or everybody else; that there was no prohibition, that he could publish it in the public Press.  He thanked the then Taoiseach profusely for his kindness and courtesy, in view of the very heavy strain on him at that time, for having given so much of his time to explaining the position.  He rang up this morning again to thank the then Taoiseach, Deputy Norton and myself for what he referred to as our great kindness and patience in dealing with him.  That is the answer to Deputy Cowan.  I do not believe there is a Deputy that doubts the truth of what Deputy John A. Costello stated and what I am stating now.  When you read the name of the outsider that was there with Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll and when you read his statement as against that statement, you can measure the worth or the worthlessness of Deputy Captain Peadar Cowan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said to Deputy <Col N="110" /> Cowan, when he was speaking, that, consciously or unconsciously, he was disgracing himself.  I am certain that, when he has perused all that falls to be said of the incident to which he referred, he will be ashamed that he so far amazed those who knew him from afar only, and who heretofore have felt that, though he might often be misguided, he was straight and honest in speaking of things as he saw them.  I do not mind confessing he took me in, but that is the way he seemed to me.  He can never seem so again, and I do not think he can blame me for amending my evaluation of him by his disreputable performance this evening.</P>
      <P>I want to intervene, Sir, in respect of something which is very precious to me.  When I entered the Department of Agriculture I found installed there Deputy Patrick Smith's ten fields of inspectors.  They were scheduled for the annual axe which was to throw them into temporary unemployment in June to be remustered in October for the chastening of recalcitrant farmers throughout the country.  I abolished their functions but was happy to get Government sanction for their permanent employment, not in the role of bailiffs and emergency men, but in the role of land project officers who considered it a privilege to call on farmers at their invitation and in the proud capacity of public servants.  Deputy Smith nailed his agricultural policy colours to the mast in eloquent, incisive and picturesque language.  I would remind the Taoiseach, when he asks in such moving accents for co-operation from the Opposition to-day, of the six blessed hours that I sat in front of his new Minister for Local Government while he regaled me with variations on a theme of ten fields of inspectors for recalcitrant farmers when my Estimate came up for discussion in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most significant things that happened since Deputy Lemass was sent to Tipperary a month ago to announce that Fianna Fáil had abandoned compulsory tillage is the announcement to-night by the Taoiseach that he has abandoned Deputy Smith and that Deputy Smith is now in the dog house on the quay &mdash; the agricultural prophet, Deputy Smith, whose <Col N="111" /> prospective occupation of the Department of Agriculture moved Deputy Jack Flynn, the champion of the small farmer, to see in Upper Merrion Street a little farmer instead of a 50-acre rancher like Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Flynn must feel distressed to discover that the little farmer from Cavan has been thrown overboard with his ten fields of inspectors and his policy.  But, appropriately enough, if one can envisage him with an anchor tied around his neck, he has been relegated to the quays as Minister for Local Government. What humiliation, what degredation will prove excess for the faithful servants of Fianna Fáil?  Will they be required to lie down in public to have boots wiped on them before they revolt against the dismal discipline of the solid Party?</P>
    <P>I felt that when my wretched predecessor was repudiated contemptuously by Deputy Lemass at Tipperary he would have approached his leader and asked him to redress the situation in the country.  But he did not; he took it like a man, or the Fianna Fáil notion of a man.  The man who was going to break down the farmers' fences, burst in their gates and bring them to the subjection of his illuminated will spoke prophetically because he bowed his neck for the yoke; when political expediency directed Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera to hold on to the two sides he bowed his neck to have the yoke locked about him.  I do not mind his disappearance&mdash;his grotesque disappearance to the quays; he was ludicrous as Minister for Agriculture; he will be a harmless joke in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I note that he was replaced by a Deputy who, when he was named, caused the whisper to run around the benches: &ldquo;Who is this fellow?  Where did he come from?&rdquo; because Deputy Tom Walsh had suddenly developed into &ldquo;An Teachta Tomás Breathnach&rdquo;. Now Deputy Thomas Walsh could not bid the cat good morning in Irish.  His knowledge of Irish begins with &ldquo;A chara&rdquo; and ends with &ldquo;Mise le meas mór,&rdquo; and I doubt if he knows the &ldquo;mór.&rdquo;  But he is now an Teachta Tomás Breathnach.  Having identified <Col N="112" /> the Gael as Deputy Tom Walsh of Kilkenny, I discover that he is Minister for Agriculture.  Now, contemptible as has been the prostration of Deputy Smith and his chastisement by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Childers, what shall we say of Deputy Walsh who was brought crawling to Castlecomer in his own constituency, bidden to attend before Deputy de Valera and in his presence to say that he had never advocated compulsory tillage, that all he had done was, when rebuking Deputy Dillon for his lack of foresight and prudence, to say across the floor of the House: &ldquo;Should you continue in this reckless way, you may create a situation in which no tillage will be done save under compulsion.&rdquo;  I challenge Deputy Thomas Walsh to deny that he said that in Castlecomer.  I have the report of it and I will produce it on request.</P>
    <P>That is the man who on the night before the last Dáil adjourned said that he was proud to say that he had always believed and then believed in compulsory tillage as the right agricultural policy of this country, and who when the House re-assembled on the following day &mdash; it was Deputy Tom Walsh who moved the adjournment &mdash; and when he was called upon by the Chair to resume the debate &mdash; this is all in the Official Record of this House &mdash; said that since the previous night he had been jibed for that somebody in the heat of debate had goaded him into espousing compulsory tillage, and he wanted to say now, after a night's reflection, in cold and calm deliberation, that whoever else in the Fianna Fáil Party might have views on that subject, he wanted to say what his view was, and that was that compulsory tillage should be a permanent feature of the agricultural policy of this country in fair weather and in foul.</P>
    <P>That is a legitimate view, and I do not condemn him for staunchly standing for his view.  I disagree with him, but where are we going if a Deputy, who on the eve of a general election makes such a statement, goes before his own constituents with these words on his lips and in the knowledge that, as was the annual custom of the <Col N="113" /> Department of Agriculture, the Official Report of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture would be sent to every county committee of agriculture for their perusal, and in the knowledge that these statements are on record, submits to the grotesque humiliation of being dragged down to Castlecomer in the middle of his own county, and not being allowed to say: &ldquo;I am sorry for what I said in Dáil Éireann.  I withdraw it.  I have changed my mind,&rdquo; but being compelled to say: &ldquo;I never said it.&rdquo;  The reward for perfidy of that kind is that this country is told that that unstable, undependable, wretched servant of a tyrannical taskmaster is to occupy what, in my judgment, is the most important office in an Irish Government after that of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Fianna Fáil Party again have they no shame?  Surely to God they are not going to start out on this their period of office, be it short or long, setting the standards of the gutter.  Surely they are not going to start out by demonstrating before the country that their own members are required to perform like dancing poodles in a circus.  Surely they are not going to publish before the country that one of their own members should stand where I am standing and pledge his faith that this is his belief and that, popular or unpopular, he proclaims it, born of his experience as a farmer, and, as the price of office, to get up in the presence of his own neighbours not to recant his folly but to deny he ever uttered it.  I am asking the Taoiseach now &mdash; he was present at Castlecomer and he heard Deputy Walsh speak there in the presence of his constituents and he knows that the report of Deputy Walsh's speech on the last day this House sat is substantially true &mdash; to answer for presenting that man to this House as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I impute no blame against him or Deputy Smith for reneging on their policy of compulsory tillage under the pressure of an election campaign.  They had a right to do that.  They had a right to get up before the people and say: &ldquo;We have changed our minds; we <Col N="114" /> have been educated and we stand the political tempest of admitting the mistake in the presence of the electorate and, admitting it, we withdraw from our position hitherto held and now for ever reject compulsory tillage as a permanent feature of Fianna Fáil policy.&rdquo; That is a legitimate honourable procedure and it tells the people all they are entitled to know; but I am asking the Taoiseach, who protests his desire to maintain decent standards in the public life of this country, how he justifies recommending to this Dáil as. Minister for Agriculture a man whose only recommendation for the post is that he was prepared to prostitute himself politically on Deputy de Valera's platform in the midst of his own neighbours.</P>
    <P>I think I have a right to ask for a guarantee from the Fianna Fáil Party that, when they have sought the suffrages of our people on the representation that compulsory tillage is no part of their policy, they will require an Teachta Tomás Breathnach &mdash; preferably in Irish and, if he does not know it, then in English &mdash; to get up in this House and withdraw the opinions which he is on record as holding on the last day on which the 13th Dáil sat.</P>
    <P>Until he does, I cannot understand how a Party which has jettisoned compulsory tillage can recommend him to Dáil Éireann.  This is not the occasion to cover a wide field: I limited myself to two topics on which I have said all I desire to say.  One is that I think Deputy Cowan has disgraced himself to-night and the other is that if there is any decency in public life the Taoiseach will do something about the outrage of presenting Deputy Tom Walsh to this House as a Minister for Agriculture even under the disguise of An Teachta Tomás Breathnach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help feeling a deep sense of regret that the Taoiseach who has been elected to this House to-night did not choose to do the biggest act of his life, even if it was to be the final big act of his life by responding to the appeals which I made to him some days ago and to-day again, to cast aside the bitterness <Col N="115" /> and the hatreds of the past and to provide a nationally representative Government &mdash; which is what the people want.  I challenge the Taoiseach to dissolve this House to-morrow on that issue and to go to the country.  I guarantee that 80 per cent. of the people of this country would vote in favour of a nationally representative Government if they were given the opportunity.</P>
      <P>I have respect for the Taoiseach.  I have known him and worked with him; I have followed his leadership during the civil war and before the civil war; I have probably from this side of the House a greater degree of respect for his political attitude in the course of the last 30 years than any other member on this side of the House.  I think I have been able to divest myself of any particular prejudice concerning these past events.  I think that the people want to forget those past events.  I do not think that any useful purpose can be served now by seeking to apportion blame on one side or another.  Probably, in 50 years' time, some historian will pass judgment and in that way blame will be apportioned.  We are far too close to the situation to be able to write the pages of history now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say this&mdash;even if it sounds cruel, it is not intended to be cruel. The Taoiseach has had a long active life, he has done many things for this nation with which I agree; he has done many things with which I profoundly disagree.  He has been the bone of contention in the public life of this country for the last 30 years. A great many people have respect for him.  He is not getting young.  If this Dáil were to last its full term, I think I would not be doing anything but facing realities if I said that he was not likely to be desirous of being reelected Taoiseach in five years' time. Why not, therefore, do the big thing, the generous thing, and help, once and for all, to bury this bitterness?  Why not do what he knows, as I know, the people want done &mdash; form a nationally representative Government composed of representatives of the four leading Parties in this House, pledged, above <Col N="116" /> all, to bring about the unification of the country, and, secondly, pledged to the economic development of the country and its economic reconstruction?</P>
    <P>It has been said in criticism of me on a number of occasions that I had raised too much optimism, while I was Minister for External Affairs, on the issue of Partition.  I now say this, with a full sense of responsibility, with a full knowledge of the position as it is and as it has been for the last year, that I am satisfied that if the Taoiseach were prepared to get together with the other Parties in this House and form a nationally representative Government, on that basis Partition could be ended within two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is like the other thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Like what other thing?  Like the repeal of the External Relations Act &mdash; which could not be done, he told us, and which has been done?  Why not try it, at least?  Is it not obvious?  We are a small nation, we have a tremendous national objective to achieve; is it not obvious that the united effort of the different parties will make the task easier to achieve? Is it to be cast aside because of prejudice? Or because of pride?  Or because, possibly, a few Party members want jobs?  Are they the consideration? Surely Eamon de Valera of 1916, of 1921, of the civil war, should be able to rise above that?  He knows that the Irish people want him to do that.  He knows that he would get the co-operation of the people in doing it. As I said earlier to-day, a lot of this is artificial.  In social contacts, people who took different sides in the civil war, who belong to different Parties, can mix together, can dine together, can play bridge or golf together.  They can go to the same churches.  They can take part in charitable works. They can belong to the Gaelic League together and work together in that. They can belong to the G.A.A. and work together there.  Why is it not possible to do it when it comes to running the affairs of the country?  Why maintain these divisions which in most cases are devoid of reality?  We heard <Col N="117" /> to-day from Deputy Lemass reference to a statement which was issued after the election by the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, a statement of policy which, word for word, had been taken from our policy, mainly from the policy of Clann na Poblachta.  It was done advisedly, as a result of some bargaining that was going on behind the scenes.  That we know.  But, it illustrates the lack of reality of political differences that it should be possible, after an election campaign, for a main political Party to produce a programme of 17 points taken practically word for word from an outgoing Party. Yet, when it comes to placing the national interest before the interest of Party we are told &ldquo;No, it cannot be done.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Are we not entitled to know why it cannot be done?  Are the people not entitled to be told why Deputy de Valera will not sit around a table with the leaders of the other Parties and run the affairs of the country?  Is there any secret about it?  Why not tell the people what the answer is?</P>
      <P>I am sorry if I am speaking with some heat on this.  I did not intend to introduce heat.  I am earnestly anxious to see this done.  I believe it is essential for the national welfare.  I believe it is essential for the purpose of bringing about re-unification of our country. I believe it can be done.  I have faith in it.  I feel the people have faith in it.  I had hoped that Deputy de Valera might have availed of this opportunity. I had broken the ice to a certain extent by participating in the inter-Party Government during the course of the last three years.  I know that there are some people in his Party who are opposed to it, more opposed to it than he is, but surely he should be big enough to rise above those differences. Surely, he should be big enough to tell his Party or to tell whatever members of his Party are opposed to it that every political leader must be prepared to place the interests of the country above the interests of a Party.  I have urged it strongly in the hope that possibly still Deputy de Valera may revise the attitude he has adopted in relation to this matter either now or within a short space of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> As to the Government which the Taoiseach proposes to us, I would like him to consider this point of view: I agree entirely with what Deputy Norton said earlier when he pointed out that the country had never been in a stronger position economically, politically and socially than it is to-day, that from every single aspect of our political, economic or social life the country is better off to-day than at any other stage in its history.  I agree entirely with that but, while I agree that no Government since this State was founded has ever been handed over a better national position than is being handed over now to the care of the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, I would say this, that no Government probably has undertaken a more dangerous task than the task which Deputy de Valera is undertaking now because he is undertaking to try to run this country with a minority support and with the majority of the people definitely opposed to his Government.</P>
    <P>This is a minority Government.  A majority of the people clearly expressed at the poll their opposition to a Fianna Fáil Government.  By a decisive majority they reflected their view by the T.D.s which they elected and sent here belonging to the different Parties, even allowing for probably one of the most dishonest hoaxes that was ever played upon the Irish people by a number of Independent Deputies who sought their votes on the pretence that they were independent of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The first thing we find is that even in this House it is only by using a subterfuge &mdash; quite a legal subterfuge, quite a constitutional one &mdash; that you avoid the position of having a tie.  It may be correct legally, it may be correct constitutionally, for the Ceann Comhairle to avail of his legal right to vacate the Chair in order to provide a vote and to take part in the division.  It does not rectify the position that this Government will be a minority Government.  That is going to create many, many difficulties.  It is the Government of the country and as such is entitled to the support of the people, to the support of this House. It will get my support in any constructive measure that it takes but I think <Col N="119" /> it is well that the Taoiseach and this House should appreciate the delicate and dangerous situation on which this Government will tread as a minority Government.  I was glad when I heard Deputy de Valera say this evening that the names which he had submitted were only provisional.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything which may sound like a personal attack on any Deputy in this House but I must say &mdash; I think it is my duty and my responsibility to say it, as I have considerable experience of this particular matter &mdash; that the Deputy whom the Taoiseach proposes as Minister for Justice, in my view, is constitutionally incapable of being a responsible Minister for Justice.  I have had in the law courts of this country experience of that Deputy as a witness and I have had experience of his activities as Minister for Justice.  I cannot forget that it was under his ministry that a young man was allowed to lie naked in solitary confinement for months until he was driven practically insane and on hunger strike under conditions that were described by the prison doctor as conditions under which the doctor would not allow his dog to live.  I do think that it would be a fatal error for the Taoiseach to place that particular Deputy again in charge of the Department of Justice even if he were a reformed character.  I know that when that announcement will be read in to-morrow's papers it will have reactions throughout the country and the Taoiseach must bear in mind throughout the lifetime of this particular Government that he has not got the support of the majority of the people and is treading dangerous ground.  I am prepared to give him all the support I can in order to ensure that we will have peace in this country, that we will not revert to the position which was originally created by this particular Deputy, that we will not have military courts, executions and a new cycle of repression, but I do think that it is an act of provocation to restore that Deputy to the Ministry of Justice because I think that Deputy constitutionally unfit for that post and that he will be so regarded by the Irish <Col N="120" /> people.  As the Taoiseach has indicated that these nominations are purely provisional I hope that he will consider what I have said and consider it seriously and take it as a sincere expression of my view in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Taoiseach has decided to appoint a Minister for External Affairs and I am glad that that Minister is Deputy Aiken.  I was afraid that no separate Minister might have been appointed.</P>
    <P>I think it was a wise step to take and I can assure the Taoiseach and Deputy Aiken that they will have my full co-operation in anything I can do to be of assistance, and I hope that my criticism will be of a constructive nature in dealing with our external affairs.</P>
    <P>I doubt whether the appointment of Deputy MacEntee to the Department of Finance is a wise one.  I say that not because of any objections to Deputy MacEntee &mdash; his bark is usually worse than his bite I think and certainly worse than the effects of his bite &mdash; but I do think that Deputy MacEntee's concept of finance belongs to the last century, that is if one is to judge his financial views from various articles written by him from time to time.  Go right back to the middle of the Victorian era; sterling assets &mdash; build them up; starve this country of investments; have plenty of unemployment and emigration &mdash; that is the policy that he has been advocating so far.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy MacEntee has possibly reconsidered his financial views since he wrote in the <i>Sunday Press</i> some time ago.  Certainly if that is his policy it is one which will be disastrous for the country.  Deputy MacEntee might be quite a good Minister in another Department, but I do not think that Deputy MacEntee will be a good Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I do not want to add anything about Deputy Smith.  I do not know Deputy Smith well enough.  I have seen Deputy Smith's behaviour in this House; certainly it is not the type of behaviour which I would expect from any responsible person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> I do not know whether the omission of Deputy Little from the Government has any significance.</P>

I would prefer to see Deputy Little in control of our radio station than Deputy Childers.  Frankly I would not be very happy to see Deputy Childers in charge of our radio station.  I think it is a pity.  I hope, therefore, that it may be possible to include Deputy Little in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I am not saying these things by way of being provocative; I am saying what I know a great many people will think when they open their morning papers to-morrow.  As far as I can I shall try to ensure that any criticism I may have to offer from time to time in this House will be constructive criticism and in so far as it is the policy of the new Government to work for the economic development of the country, to work for the re-unification of this country, to pursue broadly the policies which we have been advocating, this Government will receive my co-operation and I will not indulge in destructive criticism.  I would again ask the Taoiseach to bear in mind that while he is receiving the country in better condition, his Government has taken over a very difficult job because of the fact that he undoubtedly has not got the support of the majority of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I should probably give a word of warning to the Taoiseach as to some of his new supporters.  Many things have been said in the course of the election campaign, and many things have been said in this House to-day with which I have not dealt publicly and with which I do not propose to deal publicly to-night because it is too late.  Some day I shall deal with them.  I ask the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, to take this from me for his own protection. In the course of my life I have lived through a couple of bad national splits <Col N="122" /> and I have seen a great many different types of people.  I was in jail and I was on the run with many different types of people, and I have seen many political difficulties of one kind or another.  I have never met a more cynically, maliciously disposed person than the leading Independent, who is now supporting the new Government. I do not in any way blame the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, for having obtained his support.  He is entitled, I take it, to accept support from wherever he may get it.  However, I think that, in fairness to himself, he will take that assurance from me until he finds out the fuller facts for himself.  The controversy and crisis which occurred in connection with the mother and child health service proposals were only side issues in a treacherous conspiracy which had been afoot for some very considerable time before but had little or no relation to the mother and child health service proposals.  These proposals were used merely as a convenient weapon in a given situation.</P>
    <P>I am not quite certain but I think that the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, said that the appointment of Deputy Dr. Ryan as Minister for Health and as Minister for Social Welfare is only a temporary measure.  I hope that the Taoiseach will find it possible at the earliest opportunity to separate these two ministries again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had expected that the people who were so anxious to-day for all Parties to come together and to help out in the difficult position in which we found ourselves would have adopted a different attitude in this House.  They did not.  Attacks have been made here to-night on a number of Independent Deputies.  Why?  What is an Independent Deputy?  To my mind an Independent Deputy is a Deputy who gets up on his own two legs in a constituency and, independent of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Poblachta and of every other fellow, says: &ldquo;I am the man you should elect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the circumstances under which this Government left office.  This Government left office because Deputies Dr. Browne, <Col N="123" /> McQuillan, Cowan, Finucane and Lehane had definitely refused to support them any longer.  It was, therefore, a case of get out or be kicked out&mdash; and they left just because they could not take it.  Each one of these Deputies went back to his own constituents to give an account of his action in connection with the putting out of the Government &mdash; and each one of them got the decision of his constituents that he had done right and he was sent back again.</P>
    <P>I am not going to dwell now on the campaign of calumny and lies which operated up and down the country &mdash; barefaced lies in many instances.  I have here just one instance to put before the House.  In a report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 22nd May, 1951, the ex-Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Referring to the new House of Parliament which at one time Fianna Fáil proposed to build at a cost of £11,000,000; Mr. Blowick said: &lsquo;The House we have at present is all right; its the boyos and the buckos who are going into it who are all wrong.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good description of the elected representatives of a National Parliament.  I was wondering who was the lunatic who was mad enough to dream of spending £11,000,000 on new Houses of Parliament. I cast my mind back and I searched.  After a bit of searching I discovered it.  I knew at the outset that only one man would be guilty of that kind of a game.  Remember that these are the Houses of Parliament that Fianna Fáil were going to build. Here is the quotation from the Official Report of the 25th May, 1945, Volume 97, column 1027:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now, in connection with building, I have a few brief remarks to make.  There is plenty of work to be done in regard to building, and I think it is a terrible mistake for us to shy away from undertaking great enterprises in the immediate future because they appear to cost a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> This is a time when we should mobilise credit and use it boldly and resolve, if necessary, to repay it over the next 100 years.  The extension of credit should not deter us from embarking on bold schemes at the present time, always provided that they are good schemes.  As a start in that direction, one good thing would be to build a new Oireachtas, and it would prove to be an economy in the long run.  We are eternally patching and tinkering with these buildings in order to make them adequate to fulfil the functions of an efficient Parliament.  It is common knowledge that half the Deputies cannot find accommodation in which to write a letter.  Even the Ministers' rooms are inadequate and they have not proper facilities.  We are trying to get our meals in a restaurant which is built on top of the boiler house and in which no person could sit in the months of August and September. The permanent officials are obliged to sit in cramped quarters up at the top and their teeth are made to chatter with the noise of the machinery in the basement because we are trying to dislodge a beetle through the medium of a vacuum cleaner in the roof.  I understand that the roof is now infested with beetles and that it shall have to be rebuilt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder was it beetles in the roof or bats in the belfry James was suffering from.</P>
    <P>That statement was made quite solemnly in the Dáil on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works on the 25th May, 1945.  I need not tell any member of the House who was the lunatic who was mad enough to make it.  It was Deputy James M. Dillon. That was Deputy James Dillon's statement on a new Dáil building in respect of which we were to borrow boldly and repay in a 100 years, not, mark you, to build houses for workers, but to build new Houses of Parliament for the boyos and the buckos alluded to by the late Minister for Lands.  Now, these were the kind of lies and frauds by means of which these Deputies succeeded in crawling back here.  Fancy any responsible Minister of State getting up at a public meeting and referring <Col N="125" /> to the new Houses of Parliament which at one time Fianna Fáil proposed to build at a cost of £11,000,000, and stating, as Deputy Blowick did: &ldquo;The House we have at present is all right; it is the boyos and the buckos in it who are all wrong.&rdquo;  Now, there is one of the lies nailed.  I made a search.  I am a fairly good hand at poking out things.  I said to myself: &ldquo;I wonder is there any fellow now who would be bad enough to make a statement like that,&rdquo; and I hit immediately on James.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hit immediately on Deputy James Dillon, the ex-Minister for Agriculture.  That is number one. I could speak here for three or four hours dealing with all the lies.  I heard Deputy Norton speak about Labour and the number of people that had been put into employment.  My mind goes back a bit.  I will be bringing pressure to bear on some of my own gentlemen some of these days.  I make no bones about it.</P>
      <P>I have a memory of what the position was in my own constituency when the Fianna Fáil Party came in as a Government.  It is a pretty long memory and a pretty sad memory.  We had flocks of crows roosting in the flour mills in Clondulane.  We had the machinery in the Midleton flour mills measured for removal.  We had a scrap heap on the island of Haulbowline giving employment to 20 persons.  We had a caretaker in Rushbrook dockyard.  We had to change all that.  It took time and hard work on the part of the greatest Minister for Industry and Commerce that we have ever had in this country, Deputy Seán Lemass.  I went to work on that, and the day on which we handed over there were 400 persons employed in Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had 220 in constant employment in Rushbrook dockyard, and an oil refinery at Haulbowline.  There was also, on the wall of the general manager's office in Irish Steel, a plan for converting the furnaces into oil-burning ones which would mean an enormous reduction in the cost of the production of <Col N="126" /> steel in this country, with a guarantee by Deputy Seán Lemass for an extension of sheet steel there.  I have spent the past three years in this House begging and craving those friends of the workers who came in here to endeavour to get something done and to get the guarantees given by Deputy Lemass carried out.  But what did I find?  I was told that the matter was being investigated, that this was a serious matter and was under very close investigation.  I was told that it was handed over &mdash; the Lord between us and all harm &mdash; to the Industrial Development Authority.  These were the answers that were given to me here over the past three years.</P>
    <P>What is the position to-day?  We have seen in Henry Ford's, in Cork, men being sacked in tens and twenties because there is no sheet-steel. I should say that three-quarters of the machinery required for the sheet-steel mill was purchased by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1939 and was placed there ready for erection. The balance of it was to be purchased by Deputy Seán Lemass in 1948 as soon as the machinery became available. This is 1951.  Where is the employment for the 420 men?  Deputy Norton told us of the increased employment which they had given.  We saw none of it in my constituency.  This is what we saw. We again saw attempts to create a scrap-heap, and to have what was going on in Haulbowline from 1927 to 1932 &mdash; an auction of essential machinery every six months for scrap, while the oil refinery was being removed.  I raised the matter in the Dáil early in April.  I was then told by the late Minister for Industry and Commerce that he was not going to interfere in preventing the removal of the oil refinery. After the election was announced we had belated statements being made.  When the Clann na Poblachta chairman of the Cobh Urban Council made a public statement that the staff and the workers for the taking down of that machinery for removal were in the town of Cobh, we had belated statements being made by two Deputies that that was not going to be so for the present&mdash;until after the 13th June.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> That is the kind of game that was being played in my constituency as far as employment and industry are concerned. It took me and the Fianna Fáil Government nine months before I could get the Clondulane mills reopened in 1933.  It took me only one interview, thank God, with the owners of the Midleton flour mills to stop the removal of machinery from it.</P>
    <P>That is a tough history.  I see that Deputy Hickey is troubled.  Let him consult the general manager in Henry Ford's to-morrow when he goes back and he will tell him that the sheet-steel that could be produced for the past two years out of the sheet-steel mills in Haulbowline is now impossible to get for any money.  It cannot be got.  If Deputy Hickey had bestirred himself for the past three years he might have got the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pay some heed to my appeal in that matter.</P>

To use a simile of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; Deputy Dunne and a few more of the boys opposite should have found the same thing &mdash; I often met an old farmer in my country who had a sow and a litter of bonhams.  He went out in the evening and the sow had a litter of 15 bonhams, but when he came out after the tea he had only ten.  That is the most apt description of the Fine <Col N="128" /> Gael boys opposite.  They are like the sow and the bonhams.  Five are gone.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with the question of beet just as we found it.  In 1948 we had an interview with the general manager of the sugar company, who agreed that beet growers were entitled to an increase of 4/6 a ton on beet.  That had to get Government sanction, and Government sanction was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was for the 1949 season.  The result was a reduction in acreage of 6,600 acres of beet.  In February or March, 1950, the Minister darted out on the world market to provide sugar instead.  He purchased that sugar from the Chinaman in Formosa for £12 a ton more than he paid the Irish farmer or the Irish labourer for producing it at home in the field and in the factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey can tell us who did it.  As a matter of fact I will go further and say that there was a complaint that the sugar was costing too much and one cargo was sold at an enormous profit on the high seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>By whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>By the general manager of the sugar company on the Government complaint that it was costing too much ; £12 a ton on 36,000 tons of sugar of the Irish people's money was grabbed out of the pockets of the working farmers of this country, out of <Col N="130" /> the pockets of the labourers, Córas Iompair Éireann, and out of the pockets of the workers in the four beet factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In March, 1950, I put up an appeal to Deputy Morrissey&mdash;it will be found in the Official Report&mdash;to call a conference of the beet growers and the sugar company to see if we could not succeed in discovering some means by which we could increase the acreage of wheat and get the sugar produced by our own people in our own country. He refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I refused to be blackmailed by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Three months ago this gentleman who refused to be blackmailed by the Irish farmers went out and purchased in Cuba this time 74,000 tons of sugar and paid for that £1,387,000 more than the Irish farmer or the Irish labourer or the Irish factory worker got for producing the sugar at home.  Let us examine this to its logical conclusion and let us see the so-called prosperity of agriculture. This past Government was prepared to pay to the Chinaman £12 per ton more and to the Cuban nearly £1,500,000 more for producing sugar than it paid to the Irish labourer, the Irish farmer and the Irish factory worker for producing it at home.  That Government paid for that sugar with the Irish people's money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item I will deal with is milk.  I happen to be a member of a milk producers' association in Cork. That association went to the trouble in the Fianna Fáil Government's time of getting the costs of production. Deputy Smith, then Minister for Agriculture, increased the price of milk on those costs of production.  He was neither afraid nor ashamed to meet the milk producers' association.  It was not the creamery suppliers he was meeting. He was even prepared to meet a small little milk proprietors' association from County Cork.  He increased the price of milk in March, 1947.  Since then appeal after appeal has been made <Col N="131" /> here in connection with the price of milk.  Deputy Cogan tabled a motion asking to have the price brought up to an economic level.  A vote was taken here on that motion and we had these friends of the workers, plus the friends of the farmers&mdash;the Lord between us and all harm&mdash;trotting into the Lobby. For what?  To vote against the farmer getting an economic price for his milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us follow this again to its logical conclusion.  What happened? In order to show that the farmers were quite satisfied and were producing plenty of milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to show that the farmers were producing plenty of milk Deputy Dillon, Minister for Agriculture, went looking for a market for butter.  He went to his dearly beloved friends across the water and they offered him 271/- per cwt.  The Minister came back and he issued an ultimatum to all the creameries.  In the meantime the cost of production had gone up by 2d. per gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister came back and issued his ultimatum.  For five long years you will get 1/- per gallon as against Deputy Smith's 1/2.  What was the result?  In order to prove that there was a surplus of butter and that the farmers were producing more than the people could eat he went and sold butter on the Continent.  Then, lo and behold, he went looking for butter.  He could only get &ldquo;Brian Boru&rdquo; stuff and he bought &ldquo;Brian Boru&rdquo; stuff and paid a pretty hefty price for it.  He paid more for it than he got for his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first six months of 1950 the Danish Government sold on the Continent of Europe 288,000 cwts. of butter <Col N="132" /> at an average price of 436/- per cwt.  If any Deputy is interested I will give him the exact particulars as to where it was sold.  It was sold, for instance, in France at 463/- a cwt. while our butter was sold by the then Minister for Agriculture at 365/- a cwt.  The Danish people sold their &ldquo;Brian Boru&rdquo; butter about which our people complained so bitterly at 463/- a cwt. while our butter was sold at 365/- a cwt. Let us examine this coolly and quietly and let us see why Deputies like Deputy Cogan and others thought it was high time to put an end to the high jinks.  What is the position to-day? If I state here publicly that we will have to go abroad immediately and purchase more butter on the Continent and pay anything from 430/- to 500/-per cwt.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He says bring back the ration of two ounces. The ex-Minister for Agriculture, in order to prove that the farmers were producing plenty of milk and were not badly off, sold a share of our butter at 98/- a cwt. less than the Danes got for their butter on the Continent of Europe.  I can guarantee this much to Deputy Hickey: it is very hard to establish decent dairy herds here.  It takes a very long time for a man to get a decent dairy herd.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputies that it would take me a month to expose all the sins committed by the people opposite while they were sitting here.  I am not going to take up the time of the House to-night, but I hope to have the pleasure on later occasions of dealing with them again.  I was explaining to the House the position in regard to butter and milk supplies in the country.  I stated that it takes a long time to build up a dairy herd.  I never yet knew a farmer who got rid of his cows and left dairy farming, to go back to it.  I say that as one who has been a dairy farmer all my life.  We have a difficulty to contend with <Col N="135" /> that did not exist three years ago.  You have also the difficulty of Sunday milking. The people engaged in production are entitled to be recompensed for all these additional difficulties.  I am one who is convinced that the ordinary agricultural labourer is not half paid, and I state that here above board.  I say also that the jokers who got 20, 30, 40 to 60 per cent. increases in their salaries should at least be prepared to allow somebody else to get some increased income.  You cannot come along and hold a fixed price &mdash; a freeze price, as Deputy Norton called it &mdash; over the farmer who has to produce these commodities, while at the same time his costs and expenses are increasing. These expenses were raised enormously while the farmer was held at the 1947 price, until he got the insult of 1d. per gallon last month on the eve of the election.</P>

I was dealing with the reasons why Independent Deputies made up their minds to get rid of that Government.  I say here and above board that an Independent Deputy is an Independent Deputy.  He is an individual Deputy.  He is not tied to Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour or Clann na Poblachta.  He is here purely as an Independent Deputy elected by the people to voice independent views and, therefore, is not, and cannot be, tied to any particular Party.</P>

Judging by the number of interruptions that I have got and the anxiety of ex-Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to curtail my time, I am getting a little bit under their hide.  That always gives me a certain amount of amusement. I do not think I am making an effective speech until I hear the boys over there grousing; then I know that I am getting under their skin a little bit.  I believe that this Government will run their full term of five years; I see no reason why they should not. I can say, as a kind of half-independent fellow, as an individual who got more for my constituents out of any Government that sat here than any five Deputies over there, even from the last crowd&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have given good reasons why I went all out here three months ago to get rid of that Government.  I spared no effort night or day and I make no bones about it.  I was determined that their time had come. I was determined that the unfortunate agricultural community would get some measure of justice, fair play and fair economic prices.  I was also determined that, in any emergency, we would have growing on the soil of Ireland food enough for our people. As workers in my constituency had been deprived of employment through this policy of abeyance, through the policy that left the steel mills lying idle, through the policy that allowed ships to be repaired in the Dublin dockyard that should be repaired in Cobh and ships repaired in Germany that should be repaired in this country, I was determined to do my part to get rid of that Government and I did so.</P>

      <P>It is very appropriate that the Deputy should have opened his speech by making accusations of lying against Deputies on this side of the House and finish up himself on a <Col N="139" /> lie.  We have got from Deputy Corry what we usually get from him in this House &mdash; a speech which was a mixture of hypocrisy, vulgarity and falsehoods. The Deputy is running away as he always does.  The Deputy has not the &ldquo;guts&rdquo; to sit down and take his medicine. The Deputy is now running away.  After &ldquo;handing it out&rdquo; for the last three-quarters of an hour, the Deputy is afraid to remain here because he knows very well that I can expose him in five minutes.  The Deputy's exit from the House makes it unnecessary for me to continue any further.  I have succeeded in showing not merely to the people on this side of the House but to the people on the other side of the House that Deputy Corry is just a craven little coward who gets up under the protection of this House and makes abusive and dirty attacks on people inside and outside the House and then runs away.  I challenged the Deputy to stay here but he would not.  I have been listening to Deputy Corry in this House for well over 20 years.  He has never changed his spots.  Deputy Corry, in the interests of the farmers, talked about the Government that was in office and that is in office up to the present moment.  As a farmer, Deputy Corry knows &mdash; and if he were an honest man he would admit it &mdash; that there was more money put into agriculture in the last three years than in the previous 16. Deputy Corry's bank balance is far bigger to-day than it was three years ago.  I could deal with the points raised by Deputy Corry and his misrepresentations about Haulbowline and about the position in Ford's, but I am not going to delay the House as there are other people who wish to speak.  I have exposed Deputy Corry very effectively and I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>Now that there is already evidence that the tumult and the shouting is dying, I think it is time that we got back to the fact that the people of this country have still to live even with a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the announcement of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet.  I propose to address myself as briefly as possible to the constitution <Col N="140" /> of the Cabinet in some respects.  I want some enlightenment upon what is in store for the workers of this country in so far as some of the members of this Cabinet are concerned.  I was elected to this House with a mandate from a certain section of the people.  I did not crawl in as Deputy Corry says. I was not like some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who managed to get in on other people's preferences. I was elected by the workers of County Dublin in no uncertain fashion.  I want to ask some questions on their behalf at this critical juncture in the history of our nation.</P>
    <P>As we all know very well, the most important position in any Government is that of Minister for Finance.  Who have we in charge of finance?  A gentleman, Deputy Seán MacEntee.  I do not know what the opinion of the more well-to-do sections of the people of this country is regarding the attitude of Deputy MacEntee in matters of wages of workers.  I know what my experience has been during the progress of Fianna Fáil rule.  I know what the experience of thousands of county council employees throughout the country was when Deputy MacEntee had some modicum of power as Minister for Local Government.  Not so very many years ago&mdash;not in 1921 or 1922 as some people were so fond of harping back to during the election time but in my own lifetime&mdash;I recall very well when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Local Government, the late Tim Murphy, God be good to him, one of the best Ministers and one of the best Deputies who ever stood in this House&mdash;and members of all Parties in the House will acknowledge that&mdash; as a member of Cork County Council represented that the road workers, who were paid something like 45/-, should get an increase of 10/- a week.  That proposal was approved by all Parties, and even by that stage Irishman, Deputy Corry, who was present at that meeting.</P>
    <P>When that proposal went before Deputy MacEntee for an increase of 10/- a week for road workers&mdash;men who are paid a miserable wage&mdash;he sanctioned an increase of 1/- per week for these men and for their families.  We <Col N="141" /> used to call him &ldquo;Shilling a week MacEntee.&rdquo;  What will his policy be as Minister for Finance in the present Government?  Are we going to have the the same attitude of complete contempt working people?  Are we going to have the same attitude of complete contempt for the needs of the working class families throughout this nation?  We have had nothing but contempt from Deputy MacEntee in the past and now he is in the position &mdash; the most important position&mdash;of Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The events of to-day have amazed many people, but nobody more than me. We had supporting the nomination of a Minister for Finance, whose name is a by-word in this country, particularly in rural areas, for repression, for low wage standards, for disregard of the working conditions and for indifference as to whether the working people live or die, none other than the revolutionary leader of Irish labour&mdash;Deputy Captain Peadar Cowan.  It is not so long ago since Deputy MacEntee spent several hours endeavouring to prove beyond yea or nay that Deputy Cowan was a paid agent of the Comintern.  Do we remember that?  Of course we do. Deputy Cowan has taken unto himself the right to criticise the Labour Party. Some of us did not come to the Labour Party through other channels, through the media of other Parties: some of us were bred in the Labour Party tradition, were reared during adolescence with a Labour Party background; some of us have learned Labour policy and principles from some of the greatest men who ever stood in this country.  I myself had the honour to learn labour principles from the late James Larkin, God be good to him, and I will take no monitoring, no instruction from Deputy Cowan or from anybody else as to how I should act in the interests of my constituents. I do not claim to be on both sides of the fence at the same time as others do.  I am not all things to all men.  I claim to represent only the working people of my constituency and I take no dictation or instruction from Deputy Cowan who invoked the sacred name of the late James Connolly during the course of this debate and dragged it down to what I consider to be a very low level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> I am not in agreement with the selection of certain gentlemen who were nominated to act in this incoming Government.  Many of them, of course, are honourable men, and I do not wish to make any personal attacks on any of them.  However, I do think that some of them should not have their names mentioned in the same breath as that of James Connolly.  If anybody in this House who cares about the problems of workers, anybody who is conversant with what happened during the last three years, wants justification to vote against the Fianna Fáil Party in this Vote all he has to do is to watch Deputy Patrick Cogan&mdash;the symbol of reaction.  The Fianna Fáil Party ought to be proud to have him in their ranks.  We are proud and glad to give him to them.</P>
    <P>Everything that was suggested, during my short term of office here, that was of benefit to the people, everything that might give the lowly agricultural worker a better standard of living&mdash;for example the half-holiday, which we fought through this House almost to a successful conclusion, and the Social Security Bill&mdash;was opposed by Deputy Cogan.  He raised his mournful voice and tried to prevent the implementation of any proposal for the benefit of workers.  The Fianna Fáil Party knows that all this is quite true.  You should be proud to have him, and Deputy Cowan must feel happy in his company.</P>
    <P>I want to ask, as we are discussing the composition of the incoming Cabinet, what will happen now in relation to the underpaid workers employed by county councils, when we have so illustrious and progressive a gentleman as Deputy Patrick Smith in charge of Local Government.  Like the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride, I have not had very much experience of Deputy Smith other than what I have gained from observation of his activities and acrobatics when on these benches, but it gives one to think that, if the fate of the road workers, many of whom voted for Fianna Fail, many of whom voted for the slogans and catch cries during the <Col N="143" /> recent election, is to be placed at the tender mercies of Deputy Patrick Smith, it will be many a long day before they get any kind of a deal in the same way as they got a fair deal from Tim Murphy or Michael Keyes in the matter of wages.</P>
    <P>We have an able man appointed as Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; possibly one of the most able men in the House&mdash;a man whose speeches here have at all times been remarkable for the absence from them of personal animus or malevolence which is a rare thing to find in the Fianna Fáil Party in Dáil Éireann, Deputy Seán Lemass. He was responsible during certain recent periods of Fianna Fáil rule for the introduction of standstill wages Orders.  When challenged at election meetings during the recent campaign on these issues, he said that Fianna Fáil did not propose to introduce any more standstill wages Orders, unless they were necessary.  The much-publicised 17 points upon which some of the so-called Independents have based their reasons, or alleged reasons, for lining up with a single Party in this House made no mention of the abolition of standstill wages Orders and gave no guarantee that we would not again see such standstill Orders. Do we not all know that, whatever may have been said of Fianna Fáil in the first years of their existence, in the latter and last years of their existence they became a Party which was closer to the industrialists and the moneyed classes of the country than to the people.</P>
    <P>One Independent to-day, Deputy McQuillan, made a very courageous speech.  He took a very courageous stand and made a very constructive speech on the issue which confronted him&mdash;whether or not to vote for Deputy Costello as Taoiseach.  He said that, so far as he was concerned, there was no essential difference between the larger Parties in this country, that the only difference was a difference of personality in relation to what happened 30 years ago.  Is that not true?  Is there anybody who can deny it?  Is it not a fact that the only difference is the clash of personality <Col N="144" /> which occurred over a split which I do not remember and which many new members of this House do not remember, but which still dominates the political life of this country and which has no more reality than what happened during the famine years?  I believe that, to all intents and purposes, the major political forces might well merge.  I have never made any secret of my political credo in this House or outside it, nor do I propose to do so in future.  I believe that the future of this country lies with the Party to which I belong, but I should like to make some inquiries of the new Administration as to what their intentions are.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan waxed eloquent and drove away many of us from the House on many a night in despair and boredom on the question of the price of farmers' milk.  Are we going to have 1/6 per gallon, paid now by the Fianna Fáil Administration for creamery milk?  That is a question I should like to have answered.  It is a question which Deputy Cogan's constituents in Wicklow and the creamery suppliers throughout the country would like to have answered.  I want to know whether the constructive work accomplished by the Labour Party in the recent Administration, the implementation of the policy of the Labour Party with regard to holidays for agricultural workers, is going to be undone by Fianna Fáil.  I want to know whether the proposal which has passed through the Agricultural Wages Board, which has been pushed through by the organised body of the agricultural workers for an increase of 7/6 per week for agricultural labourers is going to be sanctioned by the incoming Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh.</P>
    <P>These are important matters.  These are matters which vitally affect the daily lives of thousands of our people and thousands of my constituents.  I want to know whether the housing drive which we inaugurated, and the like of which was not seen in this country before, is to be continued and geared up still further to get a solution of the terrible problem we have here, particularly in Dublin City and County.  The only effective answers we <Col N="145" /> can get to these questions are facts and not talk.  We want houses built for the people on the same scale as that on which they have been built in the past three years under a Labour Minister. We want them built quickly.  We do not want the type of house built in the coming years that was built during some of the years of the Fianna Fáil Administration.  If anybody wants to see what type of house I refer to, I will take him to my constituency where he will see labourers' cottages built 14 years ago which are only fit to be condemned and knocked down because they were built with sea-sand and mud.</P>
    <P>The attitude and the mentality of those who were responsible was that anything was good enough for the working people.  We built houses, thank God&mdash;Michael Keyes and Tim Murphy can claim credit, and the Labour Party can claim credit, for building the best class of houses ever built for the working people of this country.  We want that continued; we will watch to see that it is, and every member of local authorities belonging to the Labour Party, whether inside or outside the Dáil, will keep a brief on that and we will see that nothing is left undone and that anything which needs to be exposed will be exposed.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, this battle is only beginning.  I never subscribed to the idea that the be-all and end-all of political effort in this country was all-Party or inter-Party Government. I am an unrepentant believer in the future of my own Party.  I was brought up in that tradition; I live in it and I will die in it.  At times it may be necessary to make alliances to improve the position of the working people.  James Connolly was one who laid it down that were it possible to gain Irish freedom by means other than the use of the gun he would have used those means, that were it possible to gain it by the ballot box in his day he would have done that.  He was a believer in realities, a believer in using every tactic that would improve the masses of the people.  That was what has governed every act of mine in public life and I believe every act of the Labour Party.  I think there has been quite a lot of <i>cainnt in aisce</i> or useless talk during the course of this <Col N="146" /> long day.  It is essential that the incoming Government bends its mind to the problems that beset the ordinary people, that it does not give undue consideration to the needs of those who are well enough fixed, that it pursues a policy in the future of trying to help the most helpless section.  I hope that the incoming Government will change from the attitude it had some two, three or four years ago when it was asked here in this House by members of the Labour Party to increase old age pensions from 10/- to 12/6d. and it went a unit into the Lobby to say: &ldquo;We cannot do it; we will not do it.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with their problems and I know them.  I want to know from this incoming Minister for Social Welfare what the policy will be in regard to old age pensions.  Deputy <Col N="149" /> Norton made it clear that, in conjunction with the passing of the Social Welfare Bill, it was proposed to increase old age pensions to £1 a week and to modify the means test so as to ensure that persons could be earning or in receipt of a pension of £1 without it being counted in regard to pension. That may not be very much, or seem of very great importance, to Deputies not in touch with realities, but to those of us who are, it is of supreme importance to the old people of the country. I want to know if that guarantee made by the previous Administration will be implemented, and how soon, by the incoming Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I did not intend to take up so much time, as the hour draws late and I feel there are others who want to intervene. I believe there are certain political elements within the walls of this House who will reckon it a sorry day that they cast their vote in favour of a single, all-powerful, omnipotent Party.  I am quite certain that the Fianna Fáil Party which has now become the Government has every reason to compliment itself on the manner in which it has manoeuvred politically the diverse elements which have been brought together and upon whom the responsibility of deciding the fate of this nation was placed.  It has often been said that it is a sorry pass that it should happen that the political fate of the nation should be placed in the hands of a handful of people.  It is a bad thing in any democracy, but it happened.  I believe, as I have said at the outset, that the policy of Fianna Fáil in years to come&mdash;that is, if it lasts years; possibly it may only last months; it is immaterial to some of us how long or how short it lasts, but it is not immaterial to some of the Independents&mdash;will prove to be the same as it was in the past, a policy whereby working people were made pawns of as voting blocks and forgotten about to a large extent except for an odd sop here and there through the years when it came to practical politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the time will come when all these animosities and personal differences to which I have referred will disappear.  Irish politics seem to have <Col N="150" /> been based upon personal differences and little else.  For the best part of my lifetime, as long as I can remember and for as long as I have heard about, Irish politics were based upon personal differences between leaders.  I noticed during the recent campaign, and other Deputies also noticed it, that whereas the electorate were described as being apathetic, they were not apathetic but were listening and thinking of what the candidates were saying.  The time when a shout as to what happened 30 years ago was effective is dying fast. The people are beginning to think and are applying intelligence to politics. That is a very good sign.  It is a sign that Labour is on the advance because Labour appeals to the logical people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. A.P. Byrne Mr. A.P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against what Deputy Dunne said when he referred to Independent members of this House and against the words used by the editor of the <i>Evening Mail</i> and by our newspapers generally in the last couple of weeks when they said that the Independent members of the Dáil, above all, should be the last to want an early election, or used words to that effect.  It has always been known, and the events of to-day have proved, although proof was not necessary, that any man who was returned to this House as an Independent, as was his duty, voted on all and every occasion' according to his conscience, according to what he thought his constituents felt was best, whether it was in connection with a small matter such as an amendment to a Bill or a big matter such as the election of the Taoiseach.  I do not know of any occasion in the last 29 years when an Independent member of the House voted otherwise than according as he thought his constituents wanted him to vote.  As an Independent member, I want to protest most emphatically against the rotten dirty campaign that has been carried on by the newspapers of this country in the last few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I want to ask the new Government to take a little lesson, if <Col N="151" /> they can, from the fate which befell the last Government.  The main criticism which I have heard against the last Government in the last three and a quarter years is the same as I heard for the previous ten and a half years against the Fianna Fáil Government. It was Dublin City to a large extent and the larger towns of this country which brought about the defeat of the Fianna Fáil Government which had lasted for 16 years.  The main reason for the defeat of Fianna Fáil in February, 1948, was that they had failed to keep the cost of living for the people of the City of Dublin and the larger towns within reasonable bounds. The same fate has befallen the inter-Party Government of which we have had experience in the last three and a half years.  They failed to keep the cost of living within reasonable bounds.</P>

Let the new Government take a lesson.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to detain the House at this early hour of the morning.  The subject of the debate that is in progress is of the very greatest possible importance for the future of this country.  The motion which the Taoiseach has moved concerns the appointment of a number of Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party and the House has been asked to approve their appointment as Ministers.  It is our duty now to consider whether those men are capable and efficient or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want first to express my keen disappointment at the non-appearance of <Col N="152" /> the name of Deputy Peadar Cowan on this list.  I am at sea as to why the name of Deputy Cowan is not on this list.  I cannot understand why the names of some of those who were responsible for the rebirth of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach are not on this list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has presented us with a number of Deputies and has asked this House to approve of their appointment as Ministers.</P>
      <P>Now let us take them.  The name of Deputy Seán Lemass appears on this list and we are asked to approve of his appointment as a Minister of State. Let us be fair in our criticism and let us keep exactly to the motion before us.  Deputy Lemass is one of the brainiest men in this House.  If there is such a thing as efficiency, Deputy Seán Lemass is its embodiment, and no one can deny that.  He must be given credit where credit is due.  In all his speeches in this House as Minister or in Opposition I have seldom heard him indulge in personalities and in my opinion he qualifies to be a Minister of State.  No matter what else may be said about him he is capable, he is efficient and he has plenty of brains.  Deputy Lemass would be a wonderful Minister and would do wonderful work if he had a policy, if he had something to go on, but we find that a good man with common sense, brains and intelligence will be elected by this House as Minister to pursue a policy which does not exist and that will be a difficult task for Deputy Lemass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next appears the name of Deputy Seán MacEntee.  I have known him for a long time.  Deputy MacEntee is a pleasing, smiling, pleasant-looking little man, but there is no knowing the low depths of indecency to which he can stoop.  In my opinion, not alone is he unsuitable and unfit to be a Minister but even to be in the company of decent people.  He has brought more disgrace upon himself, upon his Party if such were possible, and upon this country, than any other human being who has ever existed.  I am greatly <Col N="153" /> surprised that the Taoiseach, who has the name of being straight and honest among those who do not know him and never saw him, has included in his list of nominees such an indecent creature as Deputy MacEntee to occupy the post of a Minister of State.</P>

Deputy MacEntee has the name of being decent among his friends.  Who his friends are or how many they are is something I do not know and could never find out, but it will not be many weeks before we find out whether Deputy MacEntee will be decent with the various Departments, with Deputy Walsh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I believe that Deputy MacEntee will not be an easy Minister for Finance for any of his Government colleagues to get on with, nor do I believe that the Minister for Local Government to be, Deputy Smith, will have the co-operation of Deputy MacEntee in providing the funds necessary for the upkeep of his Department.  Deputy Aiken is mentioned. I do not propose to say anything more about Deputy MacEntee except that I think he is an unfortunate person to be Minister and I am voting against him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan is on this list.  Is there anyone in this House who can stand up and say that Deputy Dr. Ryan is anything but a decent, harmless man?  That is my experience of him and I know him since the first moment I walked into this House.  Is there a more inoffensive man in this House than Deputy Dr. Ryan? I do not think there is.  Could you speak to a nicer man even when he was Minister for Agriculture, for Health or for Social Welfare?  He was always helpful. I never approached Deputy Dr. Ryan in years past when he was Minister but I was received with courtesy and with open arms.  I believe that he is better as a medical doctor than he will be as Minister of State, decent and all as he is.  Remember that Deputy Dr. Ryan is a man who does not indulge in the personalities so frequently indulged in by his colleague, Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig is mentioned.  If there is one &ldquo;thick&rdquo; in this House it is he. He is as thick as could possibly be.  I have never heard him speak but he murmured or groaned a few words in Irish which even the best and most fluent Irish speakers ever in this House could not understand.  Deputy Mongan, God rest him, and the former Deputy <Col N="155" /> MacFadden could make neither head nor tail of him when he spoke in the native language and no one could understand him in English.  The right and proper place for Deputy Derrig would be the seat beside Deputy Eugene Gilbride, as far away as possible from the front benches.  Now, however, he is being put in charge of the Department of Lands, no less.  I wonder will he now stop the division of lands because, during the last few years of the Fianna Fáil Government, land division was completely at a standstill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan was responsible for that.  But it is all the same who the Minister is.  It is &ldquo;the Chief,&rdquo; as he is called, who dictates the policy.  I wonder if &ldquo;the Chief&rdquo; is going to close down the Land Commission and say that no more land is to be divided; that it is the policy of Fianna Fáil not to divide land&mdash;as it was their policy for the last four years during which they were in office.  I have got a lot to say to Deputy Derrig on this matter, but I shall reserve it until his Estimate comes up.  I shall then have a fuller opportunity of discussing it.</P>
    <P>I regret that the next name which appears on the list is that of Deputy Gerald Boland, who has been allotted the portfolio of Justice, no less.  I think that of all the calamities that could befall the Fianna Fáil Party, this is the greatest.  Deputy Gerald Boland is a misfit.  Some call him a decent man.  He seems to be very popular in his own Party, and he seems to be popular with Deputies who are now in opposition.  You would hear them saying from time to time: &ldquo;He is not a bad old skin.  He is a decent fellow.&rdquo; I think that I have more brains in my heel than Deputy Gerald Boland has in his head.  I think that he is unfit to be a Minister and I will vote against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a nice thing to have.  It is nice to be a little proud. I think that any Fianna Fáil Government would be mighty healthier without <Col N="156" /> the inclusion of Deputy Gerald Boland.  The proof of that statement is the manner in which Deputy Gerald Boland was elected in the recent elections for Roscommon.  I have seen him in this House, when he was a Minister, with the perspiration falling from his forehead when he had men under his control and dying from hunger strike in Portlaoighise prison, and when he was awaiting the arrival of a British hangman to hang Irishmen during the Fianna Fáil régime.</P>
      <P>I saw the perspiration on his brows at such times, but the perspiration on his brows on those occasions faded into pale insignificance in comparison with the perspiration which was on his brows in Roscommon courthouse at the counting of the votes in the last general election.  I think that, if the election were fought again in Roscommon, Deputy Gerald Boland would not be returned as a member of this House because I think that the people of Roscommon, whom he has had the honour to represent for some years past, have at last discovered that he is an unfit person to represent them and that his election on the last occasion was a mere fluke.  I have the greatest pleasure in opposing in the strongest possible manner the appointment of Deputy Gerald Boland as a Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Oscar Traynor appears next on the list.  Deputy Traynor is, like Deputy Dr. Ryan, a decent, harmless man.  I have never heard Deputy Traynor indulge in personalities.  If he is elected, I wish him luck.  To give credit where it is due, he is another decent man, whatever else may be said about him.  But Deputy Traynor is going to have a very difficult job, and not from these benches here, to satisfy Deputy Major de Valera.  How he is going to do that, I do not know.  It is between them; if Deputy Oscar Traynor is going to comply with all the defence requirements of Deputy Major de Valera, he is going to have a very difficult job.  The best place he can go to is Inchcore where he will be as near as possible to the Aspro factory, because he will require them.  It is possible that Deputy Major de Valera was not serious in his defence <Col N="157" /> agitations but, if he was, I do not envy Deputy Traynor the difficult task which is before him.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Traynor, if he is elected, is going to have the tramp and the clank of heels on the barrack parade grounds.  I wonder if he is going to contemplate conscription.  I wonder what he is going to do about the allowances which Deputy Major de Valera has been agitating for, even at an increased rate, for Army officers and members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Traynor is elected as Minister for Defence, I hope he will give the Old I.R.A. pensions to the men whom we have arranged to be called up before the service boards or before the referee and the pensions board, and I hope that, now that he is in a position to do so, he will answer the question which he asked while in Opposition, namely: what is the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; in accordance with the Military Service Pensions Act?  Now that he will be Minister for Defence, will he define the term &ldquo;active service&rdquo; and will he tell us who will qualify for pensions and whether the Old I.R.A., for whom Fianna Fáil have wept so bitterly in the past three years, will get the treatment which Fianna Fáil said they would get if Fianna Fáil were returned to office.</P>
    <P>I shall not be disappointed with Deputy Traynor.  Whatever else may be said about him, I think that he is sincere.  However, he cannot give the pensions without approaching Deputy MacEntee, and if Deputy MacEntee is Minister for Finance he will say: &ldquo;There can be no consideration for the I.R.A. because we cannot afford it unless we put another penny on the stout and the cigarettes.&rdquo;  That, in my opinion, is going to provide Deputy MacEntee with a series of headaches. I wish him a recovery from all these headaches.  Bad and all as he is, and he is bad enough, I do not wish him any hard luck in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Moylan appears next on the list.  Deputy Seán Moylan is a man who has a national record.  Like Deputy Seán Dunne, I feel that the less I hear and know of national records the better.  It would be a good <Col N="158" /> job if the term &ldquo;national record&rdquo; were forgotten completely in this House and never again mentioned.  I cannot understand how Deputy de Valera, as Taoiseach, chose a man to be a Minister of State who could not be elected to the Cork County Council. Deputy Moylan could not become a county councillor.  The Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, does strange things. I know by the frown on Deputy de Valera's face that he is the most disgusted man in Leinster House to-day because he has to ask himself the question: &ldquo;How am I going to keep Deputy Cowan, Deputy Cogan, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy John Flynn in step?  What sort of tune must I strike up in order to keep them in step?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I know by the Taoiseach that he has given some sort of a guarantee to those people that he will not go to the country for a general election.  But, despite the fact that he has said to these Independent Deputies: &ldquo;Come in with us: keep us there and vote for us,&rdquo; one of these days he will say to five or six of his own men: &ldquo;Stay at home next week. You are not well&rdquo;&mdash;and poor, poor Deputy Cowan and his three or four Independent colleagues will walk into the division lobbies and find that Fianna Fáil have been defeated.  The Taoiseach will then say: &ldquo;It is not my fault.  We are beaten now and we are for the country.&rdquo;  I see that Deputy Seán Moylan is allotted the portfolio of Education, the Lord be praised. Surely that is not true.  Deputy Seán Moylan, Minister for Education.  That is a greater shock than to hear of Deputy MacEntee being Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Patrick Smith is to be the Minister for Local Government.  That man is daft.  I shall say no more about him.  His performances in this House during the past three years have been disgusting and disgraceful.  His conduct and his manners will have to improve if he is again to occupy a ministerial post.  I think he is as crazy as any crazy being to-day. Instead of the Deputy being sent to <Col N="159" /> the Custom House it is to Grange-gorman that he should be sent.  Deputy Childers also appears on the list.  I think so little about him that I will not mention his name.  He is unworthy of any comment.  His accent is evidence of where he was educated.  I will say no more about Deputy Childers, but I will vote against him if it is possible.</P>

      <P>The next on the list is Deputy Thomas Walsh.  I know Deputy Tommy Walsh very well, and I can classify him with Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Traynor as being a decent man.  Whatever else can be said about him, no one can dispute the fact that if there is a gentleman on the Fianna Fáil Party it is Deputy Tommy Walsh.  It is quite true that he is a decent man.  I honestly believe that he has a difficult job if he is going to be Minister for Agriculture.  It is only a few weeks since, when speaking on these benches, he said there should be compulsory tillage, while we have Deputy Lemass saying that there will be no compulsory tillage.  Deputy Smith says there should be compulsory tillage.  This is where I find that Deputy John Flynn has been disappointed. In the course of his speech to-day, he said that one of the finest Ministers for Agriculture we ever had was Deputy Smith.  Now, in his first hour of office the Taoiseach has let down Deputy John Flynn.  That is a cause of grave disappointment and distress to Deputy Flynn, that the champion Minister for Agriculture is not Minister for Agriculture any more. Deputy Flynn must be disillusioned, wherever he has gone to.  He has disappeared. If there is a rat-hole in Leinster House he is there in despair because Deputy Smith is not Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I can see that Deputy Walsh, as Minister for Agriculture, is going to be met with serious opposition from Deputy Paddy Cogan if he inflicts compulsory tillage on the small-holders on the slopes of the Wicklow mountains.  I can see a falling out if Deputy Walsh does not provide loans for the broken-down farmers in the Wicklow mountains for whom Deputy Cogan has been pleading for some time past.  I can see these things coming.  I wish Deputy Walsh every success, but he has a difficult job.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan made a speech in this House to-day that I did not think it possible could be made.  I spoke about two months ago and I made certain references to the ex-Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride.  I am now beginning to think of examining my conscience.</P>

      <P>When I heard Deputy Cowan's speech to-day and saw Deputy Dr. Browne voting for Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach, I wondered how, in the name of God, did Deputy MacBride tolerate those men.  Deputy <Col N="161" /> MacBride has been very bitterly criticised. I am beginning seriously to think whether all the criticism which has fallen on his shoulders should have fallen on them when he had to put up with men who only came out in their true colours to-day.  It has been my first experience of what I call real treachery to see the manner in which Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Peadar Cowan conducted themselves in this House to-day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan made a speech in the course of which he referred to an interview he had with the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Costello.  I want this House to listen carefully, and I want the new Taoiseach to listen carefully to this of the man that put him into office and that made him Taoiseach.  Deputy Cowan met me in the precincts of this House yesterday evening and said: &ldquo;Is it not a wonder that Costello has not sent for me to talk things over and ask me what I was going to do?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear Deputy Costello on this.  I said, in the presence of another member of this House, to Deputy Cowan that there was nothing to prevent him from walking in to the Taoiseach.  He said: &ldquo;No, I would like the Taoiseach to send for me.&rdquo;  I immediately spoke to the Taoiseach, and said that Deputy Cowan would like to see him.  The Taoiseach immediately 'phoned up. Deputy Cowan and myself walked into Government Buildings.  We met the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach said these words: &ldquo;Peadar, you would like to discuss something with me?&rdquo;&ldquo;Well, Taoiseach,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought you might at least have sent for me as an Independent and asked me what I was going to do.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;If that was the case I would have to send for every individual Independent, and whether I win or lose I will have no bargaining.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a little more.  Deputy Cowan sat down and I sat at the table.  We chatted and Deputy Cowan said: &ldquo;Oh, I do not think I will vote for you.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I am going to vote <Col N="162" /> for Fianna Fáil as a protest against the Bishops dictating to your Government.&rdquo; These are the words he used in my presence, that &ldquo;As a protest against the Bishops ruling the Government, I will vote for Deputy Éamon de Valera&rdquo;.  It is because of that Government's stand to comply with the Bishops of Ireland that Deputy Cowan has chosen to vote for Deputy Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach.  I was listening to-day and I heard the then Taoiseach use these words in this House which Deputy Cowan attempted to withdraw or deny.  Let there be no confusion.  To the Taoiseach he said: &ldquo;My real reason is as a protest because the Bishops of Ireland are ruling your Government.&rdquo;  That is how Deputy Éamon de Valera captured Deputy Cowan's vote.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party that his Government is not in office to-day because of good policy.  It is in office because of jealousy, bitterness and hatred.  That is why it is there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why you are making this speech to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Government is in office to-night because we were envied the good work we were doing and because Deputy Cogan was jealous of the progress and was jealous of the success of Deputy Dillon in his capacity as Minister for Agriculture.  He could not stand it.  The jealousy overflowed and he had to get Deputy Dillon out. Believe me&mdash;the Taoiseach must agree with me&mdash;that a Government which is built on the foundations of jealousy or hatred cannot have the blessing of God, success or good luck.  It is because of hatred, jealousy and spite that Fianna Fáil are in office to-day.  This Government takes over office in the morning and when the Ministers go into their offices, there is nothing surer than that they will not find there any schemes or plans.  When our Ministers took over office the shelves were packed to the fullest capacity with files and plans. The files were weighed down with dust. They were surrounded and covered with cobwebs, but we removed the cobwebs, blew off the dust and disposed of <Col N="163" /> the files and schemes.  The schemes were not left to be a resting place for cobwebs.  They were put into operation and few schemes were left.  Action is what took place.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Taoiseach in his wisdom will not again embark on the crazy, daft schemes that Fianna Fáil had in those offices, to pull down all the buildings in Merrion Street and build new Government buildings.  Are they now going to remove the Children's Hospital and put a Garden of Remembrance so that the Last Post can be sounded and all the Fianna Fáil warriors can say: &ldquo;God rest the dead&rdquo; while the children are left without a hospital.  I would like a statement as to whether those crazy, daft schemes are again to be the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>I have heard speeches&mdash;good ones and bad ones&mdash;but the most sincere speech I ever heard came from the lips of Deputy McQuillan.  Deputy McQuillan could not be bought.  Whatever else may be said about Deputy McQuillan, he has a principle.  He is straight.  Nothing could buy him. Every possible attempt was made to get Deputy Jack McQuillan to do a certain thing but, unlike Deputy MacEntee and like Deputy Flanagan, he has a conscience.  For that reason he acted in accordance with that conscience. He has a principle and he is a millionaire because of that.  The reason he is a millionaire is that no money could buy his principles.  I hope that the people of Roscommon will bear in mind that, whatever representatives they have, Deputy McQuillan is at least honest, straight, decent, dependable and cannot be bought.  I hope and trust that the people of Roscommon will bear in mind the fact that Deputy McQuillan is an honest man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before sitting down, I would like to know whether we are now going to have a mother and child welfare scheme with no means test to satisfy Deputy Dr. Browne.  Is the Taoiseach now going to sneer and jeer in the face of the Irish Hierarchy?  Is the Taoiseach now going to accept the rulings of the Bishops of Ireland or is he going to tell them to take a running jump at themselves and to keep their <Col N="164" /> noses out of Government affairs because he wants to keep Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne as the two principal feathers in his tail?  The Taoiseach is a Catholic and a good Catholic.  Whatever else may be said about him, that is true.  I wonder whether he is now going to give this House the mother and child welfare scheme without a means test?  That is what I would like to know and that is what many Deputies on this side of the House would like to know.</P>
    <P>I am wondering, whether, in order to capture the imagination of Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Cowan and, I believe, to some extent of Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, who is a young man&mdash;I met him only once; he is a decent man; he has an honest appearance and it is only as times goes on we will be able to see whether it is his appearance is honest or whether it is real honesty&mdash; this understanding has been given to them: &ldquo;If you vote for us we will give you the mother and child scheme without any means test.&rdquo;  How on earth can the Taoiseach say to-night that he is in office, thank God, if it is on the vote of a man who condemned the Bishops of Ireland?  I am glad we did not get his vote because we would have neither luck nor grace with it. Will the Taoiseach now tell the Irish people that he has with him the two men who defied the Hierarchy of Ireland?  It is those two men who flouted the Bishops of Ireland and put Deputy de Valera, the Taoiseach, into office.  The Taoiseach would have been straighter and would have had more public confidence behind him if he had said to Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan: &ldquo;Keep as far away from me as you can.  I do not want to get into office on insults offered to the Irish Hierarchy.&rdquo;  If there is one man who has played a big part in insulting the Church and Bishops of Ireland to the disgrace of any Catholic, that man is Deputy Cowan, whose vote has Fianna Fáil in office.  Did I ever think that a Catholic Irishman like the Taoiseach would ever get office on the vote of a man who publicly renounced the Bishops of Ireland in no uncertain way on more than one occasion?  Office that has been secured on that score is <Col N="165" /> one that can be neither healthy nor lucky, and cannot be crowned with that success, good luck and blessing of God which any Irish Government needs to progress and keep with the times.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that this has happened. I am sorry that any Government should be elected by the vote of Deputy Captain Cowan since I believe that, now that Deputy Captain Cowan is behind the Fianna Fáil Party, that Party agrees fully with the manner in which he has insulted our Bishops, denounced their views and refused to accept their guidance and their help. The Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, must be a party to that.  All his Ministers must be a party to it since they have in their company now no less a person than Deputy Captain Cowan.</P>
    <P>I will vote against the nominees of the Taoiseach for the reasons I have given.  I think that Deputy John A. Costello should be a proud and happy man to-night since he can now say to himself: &ldquo;I have left office.  I have gone and thank God, Deputy Captain Cowan, with his anti-Catholic doctrine, has not been responsible for putting me back.&rdquo;  We are proud to be defeated by the vote of Deputy Captain Cowan. Certainly I am proud to be defeated.</P>
    <P>If there is one man in Fianna Fáil who must be unhappy at this moment it is the Taoiseach because his present company is bad, unsound and unwholesome. There are very decent men and women in the Taoiseach's Party but, as sure as I am standing here to-night, the man who will wreck the Taoiseach and his Government is the man who put him and his Government into power here, Deputy Captain Cowan.</P>

      <P>Then I hope to have an opportunity of raising this matter on another occasion.  As I said, I will vote against the Taoiseach's nominees. I think the set-up is unsound.  When Deputy de Valera was in opposition he said, in reference to the inter-Party Government: &ldquo;They were not elected to office but found themselves in office.&rdquo;  How true that is to-day about his own Government: &ldquo;They were not elected to office but found themselves in office.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, is it the intention of the Taoiseach to make a statement on policy or are we to take it that the policy of the Government is that published in the newspapers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three or four points to which I would like to refer, but I am afraid that time will not permit me to do so.  The first point I would like to deal with is with reference to the former Ceann Comhairle. It has been suggested that there was something improper in his voting to-day on the motion for the election of the Taoiseach.  The suggestion was that he did not have to go forward for re-election to the Dáil, and that therefore, for some reason or other, it was not proper that he should vote.  Everybody knows that the reason why the Ceann Comhairle is automatically returned to the Dáil is because during the period he occupies the Chair he cannot take part in debates and cannot represent his constituents.  The procedure has reference to the time that has passed; it has no reference to the future.  The moment the Ceann Comhairle relinquishes office, as has been pointed out by the Chair, he becomes an ordinary member of the House and is entitled to exercise all the rights of such a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point in connection with this matter.  The former Ceann Comhairle wished to retire for health <Col N="168" /> reasons some months ago.  He informed me of that fact, and I asked him not to retire.  I think he also informed the then Taoiseach that it was his intention to retire.  There is, therefore, no question of his leaving the Chair on this occasion in order to have a vote. There would be nothing improper in his doing so, but the fact of the matter is that notice of his pending retirement was given a considerable time ago.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned the former Ceann Comhairle, I think it is my duty &mdash;indeed I regard it is a privilege&mdash;as Taoiseach to-night and as Taoiseach for most of the period during which the former Ceann Comhairle served the House to pay tribute to the manner in which he occupied the Chair and conducted the business of the House.  I think he gave satisfaction to everybody, and I deeply regret that at the end of his period in office any reflection should be cast upon him such as was cast upon him here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it is an important occasion to have a Ceann Comhairle retiring after such a long period in office it might be desirable to have a formal expression of appreciation when we next meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not change my view that this was a mean political trick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It had occurred to me, too, that we should pay formal tribute and we will be able to take the opportunity of doing that in the near future.  But I feel I must avail of the first opportunity offered to repudiate the suggestion made.</P>
      <P>There are two or three other points. There was a suggestion made about a minority Government and a suggestion of an all-Party Government.  I cannot deal with these point to-night but I shall take an early opportunity of doing so.</P>
