      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that the Minister for Social Welfare is reported in the Press of 9th April, 1951, to have stated at a political meeting that, in conjunction with the Department of Local Government and Bord na Móna, he was working on a scheme for the production of turf by county councils by semi-automatic machines as a permanent arrangement; and if he will state (1) which Department of State is primarily responsible for the Government's turf production programme; (2) the special functions, if any, of the Minister for Social Welfare in relation thereto, and (3) when the Government's plans for increasing turf production will be officially announced to the Dáil, and by whom.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Tánaiste made the statement referred to by the Deputy.  The replies to the second part of the question are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible for the supervision of the production of turf by Bord na Móna and for the encouragement of private turf production through the board's turf-marketing and publicity schemes.  The Department of Local Government is responsible for the supervision of turf-production operations by local authorities.</P>
      <P>(2)  The special function of the Tánaiste in relation to fuel supplies is the co-ordination of the efforts of both Departments to ensure the maximum supply of fuel.  The Minister for Social Welfare, as such, has no functions at all in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> (3)  The House will be given full details of the plans for increasing turf production, during the forthcoming debates on the Estimates, by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a certain amount of genuine confusion in the country, more especially amongst local authorities, as to which Minister is definitely responsible?  In the event of a serious fuel shortage, what Minister in the Government will be prepared to accept responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as local authorities are concerned, it is the Minister for Local Government.  So far as the rest of production is concerned, it is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Tánaiste came in, merely at my request, so as to co-ordinate the effort to ensure that there will be no confusion and that the maximum supply of turf will be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will explain the circumstances which resulted in the total of the advances from the Local Loans Fund for county homes and mental hospitals, in the financial year 1950-51 being only 25 per cent. of the amount which the Minister for Finance estimated, in his 1950 financial statement, to be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first of all explain that the figure of £417,000 referred to by the Minister for Finance in his 1950 financial statement related to the estimated advances from the Local Loans Fund not only for county homes and mental hospitals but also for general hospitals, tuberculosis works, county clinics, dispensaries and dispensary residences and miscellaneous works.  The advances from the fund for the year 1950-51 under those headings amounted to £109,131.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In arriving at an estimate of probable advances from the Local Loans Fund for these purposes, account must be taken, in relation to a large number of projects, of the time required to complete the remaining stages of planning, the placing of contracts, the securing of approval of loans, and the advance of actual building work to a stage at which advances from the fund would be necessary, taking account, where appropriate, of grants payable from the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  Close estimating of advances is therefore very difficult, and the explanation for the smaller amount of the advances than was estimated is that the local <Col N="808" /> authorities did not proceed as quickly with the works in question as was anticipated.</P>
    <P>I should add, however, that the estimate of expenditure of £2,000,000 from the Hospitals' Trust Fund for these purposes during the year 1950-51 proved very close to being correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state whether a letter was issued from his Department in February, 1951, informing Galway County Council that the amount of grant for the school meals (Gaeltacht) scheme is fixed by statute and cannot be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter referred to was sent by my Department to the Galway County Manager on the 6th February, 1951.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware a total grant of £10,000 a year is provided for in the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930.  The grant is allocated amongst five county councils in proportion to the school attendances in specified Gaeltacht areas in each county and is limited to 50 per cent. of their expenditure on food for the school meals.  I might mention that moneys available by reason of the recoupment of 50 per cent. of the expenditure of individual local authorities being less than the proportion of the grant allocated to them may be used to supplement the payments to other local authorites in cases where 50 per cent. of their expenditure exceeds their allocation.  Under this arrangement Galway County Council has received extra payments during the past three years as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if agents for national health insurance are now temporary civil servants since his Department assumed control of national health insurance; and, if so, whether these agents can participate in political activities and offer criticism of the Minister for Social Welfare and be members of political parties and local authorities; and, further, if this is in accordance with Civil Service practice and if it is proposed to request national health insurance agents to refrain from political activities.</P>

      <P>A number of national health insurance agents assimilated into the Department of Social Welfare on 1st August, 1950, were on that date serving members of certain local authorities.  With the exception of those who were members of old age pensions committees, these agents were permitted, as an exceptional measure, to retain membership of their respective local authorities and to continue to be free to seek re-election, but only to the local authorities of which they were members at the date of transfer.  While continuing to serve <Col N="811" /> as members of local authorities, they are, however, subject to the regulations governing the conduct of civil servants in political matters, which involve, <i>inter alia</i>, that they shall not identify themselves with matters of political interest, or comment on actions of the Government, or of any member or groups of members of the Oireachtas.

      <P>That is going into another matter.  Perhaps if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would allow me to read the report&mdash;it is a short one&mdash;it would satisfy the House that the report is not an objectionable one:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Irish Government to-night took action to avert fuel crisis on Aran Islands, off Galway coast, where 1,700 inhabitants have been reduced to burning briars and even fertilisers to keep their homes warm, reports Irish News Agency.</P>
      <P>Islanders, many of whom appeared in film production of <i>Man of Aran,</i> have been sharing fires in one another's homes and relays of men, women and children have been gathering cow dung from fields to use as fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the islanders said that small boats from Connemara braved high seas to bring peat from mainland, <Col N="813" /> but this was of such poor quality, due to the very wet summer, that it would not burn.</P>
    <P>Government has now ordered immediate delivery of 300 tons peat from emergency stocks in Cork to three islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inishere.  When this news was received to-night via telephone in police station on Inishmore, which is the only direct communication with the mainland, it was relayed by light signal to inhabitants of two adjoining islands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is hardly open to any serious objection.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the report displays an ignorance of the custom in the Aran Islands?  Is he not aware that this particular fuel, called bualtrach, has always been used, because of the absence of wood on the islands, as a kindler, and that that practice is not unknown in other parts of the world where fuel is also scarce?  Where was the point in holding up to the American people any section of the people living in these islands as people who have got only cow dung as a fuel?  That is not true, not even in this particular emergency to which this report refers.</P>

      <P>The estimate of advances during 1950-51 from the Local Loans Fund for authority housing given by the Minister for Finance in his 1950 Financial Statement was based on the aggregate of individual estimates of capital requirements made by local housing authorities for this purpose in the year in question.  There is often an unavoidable disparity between the actual loan issues, as distinct from estimated commitments, in respect of any particular contract the execution of which extends into two or more financial years.  In successive years, however, the totals of the estimates and issues tend to equate.  For example, the total estimate of draws from the Local Loans Fund for housing purposes between 1st April, 1949, and 31st March, 1951, was £11,547,500 while actual issues were £11,066,000.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,387,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the <Col N="834" /> Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, it would be appropriate in inaugurating this discussion if I permit myself to say: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, spring has apparently at last made up its mind to come.&rdquo;  We have so long lamented with Shelley that the winter wind continues to be a precursor, with the promised relief not showing on the horizon, that I think we might now fall back on Browning and, adapting his lines, say: &ldquo;O!  to be in Ireland, now that April is here.&rdquo;  It is right, therefore, having expressed gratitude to Providence for the arrival of spring, to advert briefly to the fact that we have passed through an anxious and challenging autumn, winter and early spring, which period is unique in the meteorological history of this country, for that we have passed through the longest recorded period in history without more than 48 hours consecutive dry weather.  It is true that, in certain months in previous years, there was a greater precipitation, but there is no previous record of a period extending from the 30th June to April which had in it no longer period than 48 hours without rain.</P>
    <P>That, of course, has created great difficulties for the farming community and should evoke both sympathy and admiration for the exertions which the agricultural community have made, and are making, in an effort to catch up on the harvest which must unquestionably be three weeks late in the sowing.  There is no use in blinding our eyes to the fact that we must anticipate repercussions of that in the autumn that lies ahead.  Out of evil, however, one is legitimately entitled to seek some good.  I think this good may, perhaps, be salvaged from the trying experience through which we have passed.  One is, that the attention of farmers everywhere will be directed to the unique advantage of the use of silage in lieu of, or in addition <Col N="835" /> to, the traditional practice of making hay.</P>
    <P>In a country with an annual mean precipitation of 42 inches, it is clear that the foundation of our winter supplies of live-stock products should be of a character which can be made and saved without reference to the quality of the weather.  It is now possible to make excellent silage from a variety of crops, amongst which one of the best is grass, good grass.  It is now clear that we can make first-class silage, without the erection of extensive silos. by simply digging a pit and correctly ensiling the material available to it in such a pit, providing the compression of the contents is adequate, and providing it is covered suitably to protect it from the weather. Every acre of land so employed will provide the live-stock farmer with a larger yield of winter fodder than he could hope to get from it with any form of hay.</P>
    <P>The second lesson that we may learn, with advantage, from our trying experience is the folly of pretending that, in a climate such as ours, we can with any degree of certainty depend on our domestic production of wheat for our essential bread supplies. With the best will in the world, it was not possible for the farmers of this country to sow the acreage of wheat for this year in spring that they would have wished to sow, because it simply was not possible to get the seed into the soil.  There is still time, and there will be time until the end of April, safely to sow certain varieties of spring wheat.  I know that very considerable acreages are at this moment being sown, but we should not lose sight of the fact that our circumstances make it a dangerous thing to pretend that our domestic resources can effectively provide for the bread requirements of our people under modern conditions.  The wheat we elect to grow here in our rotations cannot ever be more than a part, more or less substantial, of our total wheat requirements, much of which will continue to be drawn from Canada, the United States, Australia and the <Col N="836" /> Argentine, as circumstances and finance permit.</P>
    <P>Now, as I adhere to my view that results are the best tests of policy, and that facts are the best arguments, I have taken the opportunity of offering to Deputies the paper which is on every Deputy's desk to-day setting out certain statistics and recording certain facts.  It will be no harm, briefly, to recapitulate certain of the more striking changes which have taken place during the last 12 months.  If we look, first, at the acreage of crops, and bear in mind the serious inclemency of the weather, it is not discouraging to find that out of 366,012 acres of wheat in 1950, we have collected into the mills as at to-day&mdash;these records speak only up to the 24th March&mdash;2,000,000 barrels of wheat, while an acreage of 579,646 of wheat in 1947 yielded us no more than 1,463,200 barrels.</P>
    <P>The yield of oats and barley shows no striking variation, though it is interesting to see that in 1950 from 123,241 acres of barley, we had 119,000 tons of barley, whereas in 1947 from 145,983 acres of barley we had a return of no more than 88,300 tons.  When we come, however, to the live-stock enumeration of the January census, the figures must be accepted with a certain reserve because they are not of the same exhaustive nature as the June census, but if there be any discrepancy in it we may assume that the discrepancy is approximately of the same dimensions in every year.  It is interesting to note that, when this Government came into office in January, 1948, the total number of our cattle was 3,531,500 head which to-day is 3,910,600 head.  Our sheep population in January, 1948, was 1,626,400 and is to-day 1,949,100, and is rising.  Our total pig population in January, 1948, was 369,700, and is now 530,700.  These figures include breeding sows the number of which was 39,700 in 1948, and is now 59,400.</P>
    <P>I should like also to direct the special attention of the House to certain figures relating to our exports Our exports of cattle in 1947 were valued at £15,629,000, correct to the nearest £1,000, and in 1950 they were valued at £22,277,000.  Our exports of <Col N="837" /> poultry in 1947 were valued at £1,926,000 and in 1950, £3,916,000.  Egg exports in 1947 were valued at £1,574,000 and in 1950, £5,146,000.  Raw wool exports in 1947 were valued at £894,000 and in 1950, £3,516,000. Exports of bacon, hams, and other pig products in 1947 were nil and in 1950 were valued at £994,431.  Exports of tinned beef in 1947 were valued at £753,000 and in 1950 at £1,541,000 Exports of chocolate crumb in 1947 were valued at £472,000 and in 1950, £2,785,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to be informed of the present state of our stocks in connection with wheat for our bread supply and maize for our animal fodder supply.  It is comforting to know that on 31st March, 1951, the wheat in stock, floated, loading and waiting to be loaded was 2,100,000 odd barrels and in respect of maize coming within the same categories we have 121,000 tons. This satisfactory situation would not be a source of equanimity unless we were satisfied as to the available storage waiting to keep it.  In that connection, a careful survey of the storage has been proceeding and, in round figures, we count on having available in September, 1951, in silos at ports and mills and in storage at mills, merchants' and maltsters' emergency storage up and down the country approximately 421,000 tons of storage which represents approximately one year's wheat supply, were it all employed to that end.</P>
    <P>In regard to the uneconomic fraction of that storage, I should tell the House that one of the principal difficulties is that, annexed to it, we have not got adequate drying facilities.  To provide adequate fixed drying facilities at all points would not be feasible between now and harvest time.  To surmount that, we are in process of acquiring four mobile drying plants which can be used to dry and fill one storage unit and then be transferred to another until all are filled with grain in a condition which we may depend on to keep.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of this Government since it took office primarily to seek for security for the farmers over a long term.  Before dwelling on <Col N="838" /> that in detail, the House may be intrigued to have one rather startling statistic about our exports of rabbits, because in the last six months it appears that we have shipped to Great Britain no less than 6,750,000 rabbits which have yielded the astonishing return of over £1,000,000.  I cannot regard this as a very important contribution to the agricultural exports of this country and, if we could eliminate the rabbit altogether, it is an export which I would gladly see vanish.  But, as between gassing them and burying their carcases and trapping them while their carcases furnish prime meat when we can collect £1,000,000 for them, on the whole I suppose it is as well to trap them while in prime condition, and to sell them, rather than engage in intensive destruction.  I want, however, to make this quite clear to the House, that, if at any time the rabbit should expand to the dimensions of a pest on the agricultural industry of the country, despite the value that at present attaches to them, I would not hesitate to recommend to Oireachtas Éireann that an intensive destruction policy should be initiated with a view to wiping them clean off the face of the land.</P>
    <P>I do not give that export statistic from the point of view of the income, but merely as an interesting thing to show what an extraordinary power of supply is inherent in an urgent demand accompanied by an adequate price.  If there is a demand and a readiness to pay a reasonable price for a food of any kind, it can almost always be filled.  But, if there is a demand from outside one's own domestic circle of the nation, despite the best endeavour, unless the price is commensurate with the effort required to produce foodstuffs, it cannot be made to come forth.  From the rabbit shipment a lesson is to be learned; that if the consignee were prepared to pay for a very much more normal agricultural produce a price in any way comparable to the uncontrolled price which has been paid for the last six months for rabbits, the consequential exports of a normal agricultural produce to that destination would be proportionately <Col N="839" /> growing.  But instead of that I have to report with profound regret that they are rapidly declining in so far as eggs are concerned.  Why it should be deemed expedient to pay 4/6 apiece for rabbits and 2d. apiece for eggs must be for ever a mystery to me.  So long as that continues, those who desire to pay such a price will get rabbits and no eggs, and that is a result which affords me profound regret.  I would prefer to ship eggs and rabbits to that consignee, but, if I were constrained to choose between the two, I would certainly prefer to consign expanding quantities of eggs rather than multitudes of trapped rabbits.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of this Government to secure for the farmers stability and a decent standard of living for those who own the land and those who work upon it.  To secure that, it was necessary to get not only a good price but the assurance that over a long term, if they kept up the production of agricultural output, they had no reason to apprehend that there would be a consequential assault on price levels.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that in respect of cattle, sheep and milk we have secured for the farmers over a long term guaranteed minimum prices which should enable them to know with certainty what the product of their labour will be worth when they bring it to market.  I have every reason to hope that in the next two or three weeks we shall be able to provide a similar long-term guaranteed market for all the pigs that our people can produce at a price in or about 220/- per cwt. deadweight for bacon.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that the market available for fowl, chickens, hens and turkeys will be highly remunerative taking the long-term view; but I am obliged to state that in my considered judgment, unless the price available for eggs is of a character to attract the average countrywoman to increase the number of her flock and the output of eggs generally, there is very little prospect of any great expansion in our fowl exports.  If the price of eggs were <Col N="840" /> satisfactory and if the price of fowl continues satisfactory, as I believe it will, the potentialities of expansion are vast.  But in the absence of a satisfactory price for eggs, I cannot see the supplies of fowl from this country being as great as we would wish to make them.</P>
    <P>The purpose of circulating the White Paper which has been sent to Deputies is mainly to abbreviate the length of my observations in introducing this Estimate.  I mean no discourtesy to the House if I do not follow the sub-heads closely, as I believe substantially all we want to know is furnished here. However, I am at their disposal to give them any further information they may require in the course of the debate. There are a few special matters to which I would like to draw the attention of Deputies before I conclude.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that the co-operative scheme for the growing, storing and marketing of apples based on Dungarvan is now under way and we have horticultural instructors operating in that area.  The farmers seem to be enthusiastically joined in the enterprise and I am not without hope that with the new planting this year and next year, we shall pass the 500-acre mark and continue to expand. I think I have good reason for being sure that the class of apples produced under the supervision available there will equal the best that is to be had from any orchard in the world and will command for those who grow and market them a highly remunerative price.  It is a particular source of satisfaction to me that the project is being carried out by the co-operative effort of the farmers so that my contribution requires to be no more than facilitating them in getting under way, and, my having done so, they will carry on themselves.  That, of course, is the best way for an enterprise of that kind to be administered.</P>
    <P>The scheme adumbrated by the Department last year, and since proceeding, for the suppression of contagious abortion in cattle is an unmeasured success, a greater success in this country than in any other country in the world.  I am happy to report to the House that the results <Col N="841" /> of last year's inoculation have been most satisfactory in suppressing contagious abortion in herds where heretofore it had been endemic.  The demand for the services of inoculation is a striking tribute by the farmers to their own confidence in the plan.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House now of an interesting experience we had in running to earth a veterinary problem which afflicted the West of Ireland for many generations.  In the Gaeltacht a condition of &ldquo;Brios Bruan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Galra Trua&rdquo; had been long known as a scourge.  Brios bruan resulted in a debility in cattle on the mainland for which the traditional remedy was to send them out to a neighbour on an island; strangely enough, on the islands the Galra Trua presented a somewhat analogous picture of debility in cattle, the traditional remedy for which was to send the cattle so afflicted to a neighbour on the mainland.  The interesting thing was that both these venerable remedies were signally successful.  If one has been reared and lived in the province of Connacht, as I have, one has a healthy respect for the traditional knowledge of the old people and, though it does not seem sometimes to be either logical or comprehensible, one comes to know that the old people do not do things just for fun.  It seemed to me, however, with the resources we now have at our disposal, to be a somewhat inadequate procedure simply to bow our heads in deference to the old people and leave things as they were. It was an inconvenient arrangement for the people on the mainland to send their cattle to the island and it was often equally inconvenient for the people on the island to send their cattle to the mainland.  Accordingly, I despatched a team of veterinary surgeons to the west to investigate these two conditions in an effort to find out if more convenient remedies could be devised.</P>
    <P>After a careful search conducted by one of the most distinguished officers of my Department, we established that brios bruan was aphosphorosis plus copper deficiency; and Galra Trua was parasitic worms.  I make no apology for delaying the House a <Col N="842" /> moment to show how the extraordinary devices employed by the old people had precisely met these two difficulties. If the mainland beast was suffering from aphosphorosis the trouble was due to the fact that he had no access to phosphorus.  A period of convalescence on the island meant that when the island neighbour received the cattle he allowed them to stray on the shore.  The moment the cattle had access to the shore, they hastened to the seaweed beds and extracted from them such of the seaweed as was phosphorescent and ate it, thus restoring the phosphorus balance in their diet.  The affected cattle from the island, who were suffering from Galra Trua, were suffering from parasitic stomach worms and, being on restricted grazing, every time they shook off the infestation they reinfested themselves because the droppings of cattle contain the stomach worm.  While the cattle remained closely concentrated on infected land, no matter how often they threw off the infection they subsequently reinfested themselves by picking up the worm again in their grazing.  But when the island cattle came ashore for their convalescence, they were turned out on the mountain and, as the range on the mountain was much too large ever to become densely infected as the smaller island pasturages did, the beasts threw off the infection on the mountain and did not become reinfected.  After a short convalescence therefore on the mainland the beast was restored to health.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of lack of knowledge of the source of these troubles the island people used to bring their cattle back to the island following their cure and the mainland people brought their cattle back to the mainland whereupon they not infrequently developed the same symptoms all over again.  Now that we have discovered the source of Galra Trua it has been possible for us to provide the people with hexachloroethane and phenothiazine and spray the land with sulphate of copper, thus destroying infestation of the land and curing chemically the condition of the beast. And we have been able on the mainland to provide the people with <Col N="843" /> dicalcium phosphate which provides the necessary phosphate in the cattle's diet by giving them an occasional drink, and the trace of cobalt in their diet without which cattle suffer and sheep develop pine.</P>
    <P>Nor is this the end of an interesting story, because those of us who were born west of the Shannon are familiar with the chronic affliction of the small farmer who brings his yearling calf to the fair and there is told that 10/- or £1 must be deducted because it is a &ldquo;yalla-looking&rdquo; calf.  I was often troubled to know why the poor man had to suffer that deduction because his calf was &ldquo;yalla&rdquo;.  It is not really yellow but a rather poor orange red colour which is much disliked by those who deal in yearling cattle.  The man who is relatively prosperous rarely has a &ldquo;yalla&rdquo; beast but the poor man frequently has.  I thought that was a condition, seeing that it is an affliction of many of our poor neighbours, to which the veterinary research institution might appropriately turn their mind.  With their customary skill and versatility, they did so and, by consultation with colleagues abroad and by their own exertions, they established that the quality of a &ldquo;yalla&rdquo; beast is cobalt deficiency and if anybody has a &ldquo;yalla&rdquo; calf and will consult the veterinary surgeon or the leaflet of the Department of Agriculture, he will find that, by administering cobalt in suitable quantities over the appropriate term, his &ldquo;yalla&rdquo; calf will turn into a dazzling mahogany yearling, with material financial advantage to himself and to his neighbour, and with the utterly gratifying result that, when he brings the beast to the fair, his blushes will be spared because there is nothing more embarrassing than to stand in the market place or fair green with a &ldquo;yalla&rdquo; calf and to have every helpful neighbour in the countryside saying: &ldquo;That is a nice calf, but he is very &lsquo;yalla&rsquo;.&rdquo;  I do not know if the House shares my satisfaction in the isolation of these simple problems which most people consider to be beneath the attention of the great, but I think these things matter much more <Col N="844" /> to our people in their everyday life than the wider policies which perhaps may sound more becoming on the lips of the political head of one of our largest Departments of State.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word, too, about the marketing of fowl and turkeys.  Last autumn, the welkin was made to ring by every fowl buyer and turkey dealer in Ireland that a most cruel and savage outrage was being perpetrated on this disinterested body of men because we were canalising fowl exports through Eggsports, Limited. They pointed out that freedom, Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights and all the foundations of human liberties were being struck at by our failure to give them a free field.  I thought they were wrong.  To tell the truth, my primary interest was to see that the producer got a suitable and remunerative price. If the fowl dealers could get a living handling the stuff, they were very welcome to it, so far as I was concerned, but the first and all-essential aim with me was to see that those who reared the birds got paid for them. I fixed the price at 4/- per lb. for turkeys. In the early part of the autumn, there was no doubt that turkeys were making up to 6/- and 6/6 per lb. and there was loud lamentation, but, about a fortnight before Christmas, the market broke in London and turkeys fell to 2/6.</P>
    <P>If we had not canalised exports, what would have been the position? The dealers would have paid up to 6/- for turkeys in the first two weeks in December, and, when the market broke, they would have had on their hands thousands of pounds weight of turkeys at 6/6, and they would have had two weeks between then and Christmas to recover their losses. Those whose turkeys had to be marketed between 14th and 24th December would have had not only to take the lower price obtained on the British market, but would have had to suffer a levy as well to recover the mistakenly high price paid in the early part of the season and the people in the latter two weeks in December would have got, perhaps, 1/9 per lb. for their turkeys.  In the process, many fowl dealers would have been wiped out.  By canalising exports, <Col N="845" /> everybody got 4/- per lb.; every fowl buyer and dealer in Ireland got a modest but reasonable margin of profit; and nobody suffered any loss. I think that, having stood all the abuse in October, November, and December, I am entitled to that moment of recrimination, now that April is here.</P>
    <P>The ground limestone problem, I think, is now reaching a solution through the scheme at present in operation whereby any farmer anywhere in Ireland can have as much ground limestone as his land requires delivered to his farm or to the nearest point thereto on a hard road at 16/- per ton in bulk in six-ton lots.  But I am conscious that we have become so well accustomed to amenity in rural Ireland that the absence of spreading facilities has caused uneasiness.  Fortunately, we have been able to solve that problem as well.  Ground limestone, unlike burned lime, is storable in the open and does not deteriorate if rain should fall upon it.  In fact, for spreading, some people will say that it is better to allow it to weather in the open for some time.  We propose, and the appropriate advertisement will appear in the newspapers in the course of the next ten days, to make available, on the basis of one-third grant and one-third loan, the purchaser putting up the remaining one-third from his own money, suitable lime-spreading machinery to cost £250 per unit, which I hope country boys will get their fathers to buy for them, so that they may provide for their neighbours the service of spreading the lime which the limestone grinding company has deposited in their yard.  It is a good way to do it, to decentralise it.  It provides a good living for the chap who wants to engage in the contract business, spreading lime at one time of the year, ploughing at another, and reaping at a third time of the year for reward, for his neighbours, and it brings within the reach of the smallest farmer amenities which could not possibly be provided on the basis of the small farmer buying the machinery for his own use.  I should much prefer&mdash;<i>pace</i> Deputy Hickey&mdash;to see a man being his own boss and working for himself rather than being employed by the State or by anybody else.  This <Col N="846" /> device is designed to multiply the number of young persons in rural Ireland who will develop into independent contractors, working for themselves, in one sense of the word and for their neighbours, in another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put no limits, but my primary concern is to persuade young people to set up in rural Ireland working for themselves, in one sense of the word, and for their neighbours, in another.  I trust that Deputies will spare my blushes when they come to comment on my foresight in having secured 100,000 tons of superphosphate at the lowest price at which super was sold in Europe during the past few months for our farmers.  If we had not secured that additional 100,000 tons of superphosphate, the resources of our fertiliser industry being extended to their full capacity would have fallen far short of our minimum requirements.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention the feeding of live stock in this country, a matter which has been indissolubly associated in the minds of our people with dependence on outside sources of supply, but every obstacle to securing adequate supplies of suitable feeding stuffs from our domestic resources has now at last been successfully surmounted. We can now grow on our own land the Ymer barley, the potatoes, the oats, the raw material of the white pollard and skimmed milk which provides for any class of live stock in this country not only an adequate but a dietetically complete ration.  There are areas in which skimmed milk is not universally available, and, unless an alternative source for protein were available, I could not make the boast which I have just made.  It gives me satisfaction to inform the House that one meat-meal factory is in operation in Cahir, County Tipperary, and in the West of Ireland, a meat-meal factory is in course of construction which will be adequate in capacity and source of supply to cater for all the protein requirements of the live stock in this country in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an interesting development in beet, because if it proves to be what <Col N="847" /> I believe it will be an adequate substitute for the diet of the pig.  It will mean that the day when it was necessary for women to cook for pigs is done. We will be able to provide pigs with a full and balanced diet, fodder beet taking the place of potatoes, Ymer barley taking the place of maize and skimmed milk providing the protein. If, on top of all this, we can eliminate on our small holdings the traditional necessity for sitting up for three or four nights after a sow has farrowed by making available to all on reasonable terms farrowing boxes, we will have removed from the business of pig breeding two of the most difficult problems with which we have hitherto been faced.</P>
    <P>So long as we have 220/- per cwt. guaranteed minimum price, there is available to the smallest farmer in Ireland a form of production to which there do not seem to be any absolute or necessary limits, because when the pig on the farm has consumed all the pollard, beet and barley, oats and potatoes that he produces, there is no difficulty about his buying additional supplies of domestic or foreign products.  We should never consent to the folly of assuming that our livestock production must be limited by the capacity of our own lands to produce fodder.  When our domestic produce is extended to the full we should supplement it by the importation of raw material for conversion, just as the manufacturer imports cotton for spinning and the brewer imports hops to brew into beer.</P>
    <P>I want to say a special word about butter.  The capacity of our people to consume butter is frankly taxing our resources.  The last time we produced over 700,000 cwt. of butter, we exported 400,000 cwt. of butter to Great Britain; they paid us 53/- per cwt. and we paid them 83/- per cwt to eat it. We are now producing over 700,000 cwt. of butter but our own people are eating it, more power to their elbow. I have reached a point where I have done my level best to ensure that the domestic ration will be maintained, but until our own full supply of butter <Col N="848" /> comes along, people will have to take whatever butter we can give them for the next six weeks.  I have gone to the limit of effort to give everybody Irish butter on their ration.  The fact of the matter is that Irish butter is not there, and they will have to be satisfied to get a mixture of Irish butter and imported butter, until Irish production catches up on the demand.  It is a fantastic situation on which we have every reason to congratulate ourselves that our own people are so well off that they are eating us out of house and home.  I am going to give them the best butter that money can buy.  I did say, and substantially performed up to recently, that the distribution of Irish butter would be on the basis of fifty-fifty.  I want to explain to the people that if, from now until the middle of May, they cannot get a fiftyfifty proportion of Irish butter, they should blame me and, if they want to blame me, my only answer is that if they do not like it they can lump it.</P>
    <P>Another feature to which I have to refer is a scheme for water supplies to farms.  I hope that a growing number of farmers will avail of this service.  It is there open and available to everybody who has not running water in his kitchen.  We want them to provide for it.  The scheme provides 50 per cent. grant of the total expenses of bringing the water into the kitchen.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too long on the land rehabilitation project, but I think the House will be interested to know that I have decided to call in, after kind consultation with the Government of Holland, a Dutch engineer to give us an expert opinion on the estuarine marsh problem as a pilot experiment. I wish I could tell Deputy O'Grady that it was in Clare, but the first pilot scheme we propose to embark upon is the reclamation of the flooded land at Tramore.</P>
    <P>That falls into two degrees, so to speak.  When we have carefully surveyed and investigated it, we shall be able to make up our minds as to whether we shall confine ourselves to reclamation of that racecourse or go further afield and aim at the reclamation of the whole area of the back strand.  That involves a certain agricultural <Col N="849" /> survey, to see whether we can make of that larger area land which it would be reasonably economic to reclaim.  In so far as the racecourse area itself is concerned, it is rather more of an urban than a rural amenity factor that is to be considered and we are satisfied that it would be prudent and reasonable to carry out the lesser enterprise of keeping back the sea from it.  While we aim&mdash;and I hope we may be able to do that&mdash;at reclaiming the whole of the back strand, we must bear in mind the question&mdash;we are getting the very best technical advice on it&mdash;as to whether the sea barrier would be of sufficient substance to hold out the sea from frontal encroachment.  All these matters arise in one form or another in every estuarine marsh problem on which we propose to embark.  We shall seek in this pilot case to familiarise ourselves with the best technical advice we can command on all of these points, agricultural and engineering, attendant on such problems, so that we may turn with confidence to similar problems in other parts of the country when we have the trained personnel, the experienced engineers and agriculturists, to guide us.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Board of Works has afforded the Department of Agriculture its invaluable co-operation in dealing with a number of rivers which stand half-way between the main drains and the arterial river.  One river is the Blackwater in Monaghan, the Rye in Kildare and the Boyle River in Roscommon.  Having disposed of these three, we intend to go on to deal, one after another, with such field drainage as may be required.  In that work we have, by arrangement with the Board of Works, provided three survey parties, over and above the survey parties associated with the arterial drainage division of the Board of Works.  Deputies know that the Board of Works are themselves at present engaged in arterial drainage of the Corrib, the Glyde and Dee&mdash; the plans for which were made under our predecessors' supervision&mdash;and the Brosna.  We now propose to put survey teams on the Boyne and, I hope, on the Moy in Mayo; and, I think, on <Col N="850" /> a river in Kerry.  About the Moy, I wish to speak a word.  I have been giving the Moy very careful attention myself and the engineers of the Board of Works have been there, examining every aspect of the problem there pertaining. There is no solution of the Moy flooding by removing the rock or by plugging or picking at it.  The Moy must be dealt with as a unitary.  It may involve the building of locks on Lough Cullin and Lough Conn.  It certainly constitutes a unitary drainage problem and that is the way it is going to be done.  The survey authority will start on it this year. Living as close to the Moy as anyone, and closer than Deputy Commons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know that it would evoke a certain amount of enthusiasm amongst the neighbours if I went ahead with the dissipation of public money in making new and handsome gestures.  I am concerned to relieve my neighbours from the perennial inundation of land by the Moy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was making a speech on arterial drainage, although I was not aware of any item in this Estimate for that purpose. However, I have no objection to that, provided the Minister can say <Col N="851" /> something about the area in which he and I have a special interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not quite followed me.  The Chair, I presume, will see that I keep strictly to the terms of relevance.  I am trying to explain that, quite apart from the arterial drainage works proceeding under the Board of Works, under a system of drainage in which the Board of Works is entitled to act on an agency basis for the Department of Agriculture, they are carrying out medium drainage projects and actually undertaking arterial surveys at our expense, which will be available for them when their arterial drainage machinery is available to embark on it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asks me about the Erne and what I have to say about it.  The answer is nothing, as I am not briefed to deal with that problem here and now.  I take it he is referring to the Erne catchment area, where the electricity works are, at Ballyshannon, that he refers to those rivers, the head waters of which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Dromore is a matter of continual interest for the people of Ballybay and along down the catchment.  I am not directly concerned with the work undertaken there, except in consultation with the electrical authority.  As I understand it, some difficulty arises in respect of some points in that catchment area with the authorities north of the Border, but if the Deputy should, in the course of his observations, require any information, I would be happy to tell him and will provide it when the time comes to close the debate, or sooner, if he wants it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I would mention is something which has been dear to my heart for a long time, that is, the parish plan.  I do not want to dwell unduly on certain unfortunate incidents which transpired, but suffice it to say that my effort to inaugurate the parish plan last year was frustrated.  I now propose to close that chapter and <Col N="852" /> I have published a new advertisement asking for applications for positions as parish agents.  If my plans are not again frustrated, I hope to inaugurate the parish plan this year, albeit 12 months too late.  The House will want to know what I have done in respect of the parish plan designed specially for the congested areas.  The answer is that an examination is now in course of preparation, as it was felt that we ought to make the established posts of parish agents available for competition not only to the agricultural overseers and assistant overseers in the congested areas but also to the farm buildings supervisors within and without the congested areas.  For that reason, it was necessary to hold up the examination to prepare a rather more comprehensive one than that at first envisaged.  That will take some little time to prepare.  I think the position now is that applications for admission to the examination are in course of being received and as soon as they are received the examination will be held. If my memory serves me aright, there will be posts for 100 parish agents. Most of the other candidates will have the option of securing unestablished employment under the land rehabilitation project where they failed to meet all the special requirements of parish agents, whose work applies primarily in the congested areas.  I want to say that there are excellent men who will not qualify for the position of parish agent in congested areas, not for want of proficiency in their general knowledge and capacity but because they have no knowledge of the peculiar conditions obtaining in the congested areas and those who have such knowledge would naturally take precedence in a competition, the primary purpose of which would be to get agents in congested areas.</P>
    <P>If there is any information which I have inadvertently overlooked communicating to the members of the House, they have only to ask for it and I shall be glad to provide it to the best of my ability.</P>

I do not think we have any serious problem in regard to seed potatoes. The seed potato crop&mdash;Arran Banner and Arran Pilot&mdash;has been satisfactorily sold.  The Kerr's Pink variety is more for the domestic trade.</P>

      <P>The seed potato problem in Donegal was raised in this House last week.  I am particularly interested in the ware potato.  We have exported only 6,000 tons and the British do not seem to be prepared to take any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The seed potato position at present causes me no anxiety.  I think the bulk of it has been absorbed. Always, towards the end of the year, people begin to get apprehensive lest the particular quantity they have will not be taken.  I have no reason to apprehend that we will have any serious surplus of seed potatoes.</P>
      <P>I shall deal now with the question of ware potatoes and I shall take the House frankly into my confidence though I should prefer not to at this stage&mdash;but maybe the Deputy is as wise as I am.  Originally, we agreed with the British Ministry of Food to sell them 50,000 tons of ware potatoes. Last autumn, the House will remember, the strongest representations were made here &mdash; particularly by Deputy Cogan and Deputy O'Reilly of Cavan&mdash;that there was a danger of a famine in the spring and that all the live stock would die of starvation.  I could not foresee that that would take place but I thought it better to be prudent and accordingly I cancelled 20,000 tons of the British contract. That left us in the position that we had to deliver 30,000 tons to the British. The British trade is largely a fish and chip trade and for that they like a large round potato or indeed a medium-sized round potato.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>By mutual consent.  If the Deputy will have patience and hear me out, he will see that Providence was on my side.  I was now down to 30,000 tons.  I wanted to keep the other 20,000 here at home lest there should be a shortage for the live stock in the spring.  I promised the House that there would be enough foodstuffs in the country to feed the live stock.  Accordingly, there was no question of a difference with the Ministry of Food.  I have always found the British Ministry of Food most reasonable and fair to deal with in regard to any matters of that kind and there was no difficulty at all in adjusting the quantity.  The time came to deliver the 30,000 tons.  We sent a few shipments to Great Britain.  Then the Ministry of Food notified us that there was a cargo at Cardiff which they would not accept.  We asked them why they would not accept it and they contended that it was not fit for human consumption because the percentage of boast potatoes in the consignment was too high.  &ldquo;Boast&rdquo; is a condition which we used always associate with exceptionally large round varieties of potatoes as opposed to kidney-shaped potatoes. The Arran Banner variety is peculiarly suitable for the fish and chip trade because it is round, and in that variety you sometimes get a boast condition. No agricultural scientist knows the reason for that condition.</P>

    <P>The older people&mdash;and again, may I direct the attention of the House to the wisdom of the old people&mdash;incline to the view that if you get a dry period in the early part of the growing season and very wet weather for the remainder of the season you are liable to get a high percentage of boast potatoes. That may be true but nobody quite knows why it seems to be certain that the tendency of the structure of the centre of the potato to break down and leave a hole in the middle is associated <Col N="855" /> with certain varieties more than with others&mdash;and Arran Banners seem to be peculiarly susceptible to it.  Our problem was that, though we knew of this condition and had experience of it, it was always associated with exceptionally large potatoes.  I am obliged at this stage to say that this year there seems to be a higher incidence of this defect in the 2¾ inch and 3 inch potatoes than we have ever known before.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Cardiff consignment, it was agreed that the British Ministry of Food should dispose of the potatoes and that the matter should go to arbitration.  We maintained that the potatoes were fit for human consumption whereas the British said that they were not fit for human consumption. We maintained that the defect, which no human skill could ascertain before the potatoes were packed and despatched, was not a defect within the meaning of the contract, which envisaged a defect due to injury or careless handling or something of that kind, or possibly disease which would render the potatoes unfit for human consumption.  That issue is at arbitration on a perfectly friendly basis between us and the British Ministry of Food.</P>
    <P>But there remains a large amount of the potatoes.  I turned my mind to the question of what I was going to do with them.  Suppose I sent them to Great Britain and staked my chance on arbitration, and it went against me, they would then be liable to be disposed of to alcohol factories and the difference charged to me.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to say that in certain districts the incidence may appear to be higher than in other districts, but, in respect of that variety, the incidence of boast this year is much higher than is was in any previous year in our experience.  I fully appreciate that Deputy Aiken is not anxious to make my task in connection with the arbitration more difficult. <Col N="856" /> Accordingly, I suggest that it would be more advantageous if we allowed this matter to rest until we have arrived at the appropriate adjustment. However, now that it is opened it is as well to open the whole thing.  I propose, therefore, to grapple with the situation as best I can and to take such steps as I can best devise to protect the growers as far as I can from the consequences from any defect in their ware potatoes which nothing Deputy Aiken would have done would have averted, but which they on their side must recognise as a serious defect.</P>
      <P>Whether it is a defect within the meaning of the contract is another thing and I intend to the best of my ability to show that it is not a defect referred to in the contract.  I propose to hold my ground as long as I can in saying that there is nothing wrong with the potatoes.  That is my attitude <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Ministry of Food but I cannot keep up that attitude for ever. I will hold that it is not a defect within the meaning of the contract but the matter will go to the arbitrator.  If I had held my front sufficiently on that perhaps we would have made a deal but, perhaps, it is all for the best, on the whole.  The arbitrator will decide whether to allow the Cardiff lot or to stop the Cardiff lot.  I am not in a position at the moment to say what will be the best means to protect the grower but I hope in so far as the 30,000 tons are concerned for which the contract was entered into to protect the growers and the dealers against the greater part of any loss they would have suffered if they had to suffer unsupported the consequences of their ware being rejected on the contract requirements and if they had to dispose of it through some other channel. I do not know if that covers the matter as fully as the Deputy wishes?</P>

I have exactly the same representation from Donegal, Mayo and Galway to all of which I reply that in so far as the potatoes were potatoes grown under the Ministry of Food contract measures are being devised which I hope will substantially relieve the growers and dealers from the greater part of any loss which they might reasonably anticipate if they were required to dispose of their ware through whatever channel they could find.  I cannot go beyond that at the present time but I hope that the plans which I will operate will in fact effectively meet the legitimate expectations of the people of Cooley, Donegal, Galway and Mayo.</P>

      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with a few aspects of agriculture, I should like to say a few words of encouragement to farmers who, as the Minister states, find themselves this spring in a very backward condition because of the weather we have been experiencing.  Listening to what the Minister had to say on the subject, I could not help thinking of the years 1946 and 1947, which were very difficult years, too.  In 1947, we had a special discussion on the subject because, as Deputies will remember, most of our land had been covered with snow for a period of seven or eight weeks which, I think, extended into the mouth of the month of April.  When the Minister attributes all sorts of dire results to this Party's activities, he sometimes conveniently forgets the attitude of the members of the Opposition during those years.  No purpose will be served by our going into these matters now, but one might point out that 1946-47 and 1950-51 are in some respects comparable.  It is noticeable <Col N="858" /> that in his approach to this Estimate and in dealing with agricultural matters with county committees of agriculture and otherwise, the Minister always selects 1947 as the year on which to base comparisons with 1948, 1949 and 1950.  Deputies supporting the Government do the same.</P>
    <P>To-day the Minister has warned us that this year and in the future we must not expect the sort of effort from our farmers which they made in years gone by.  There is one test to apply to these two years, 1946-7 and 1950-1; late and all as the spring of 1947 was, when you look at the figures showing the acreage under wheat, oats, potatoes and other crops circulated by the Minister you naturally say to yourself: &ldquo;There must have been a tremendous amount of enthusiasm somewhere during that year; there must have been a tremendous amount of energy on the part of the farmers; a tremendous amount of encouragement must have been given to them when they were able to achieve such an acreage as the Minister has given in this White Paper.&rdquo; We will, at a later stage, be able to see where that energy has gone to; we will be able to ask ourselves if, as a result of the Minister's own policy, that energy has increased amongst the agricultural community, or if it has decreased.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter that, I think, should be examined, too.  For some years past the Minister has been very prone to recommend to farmers the advisability of mechanising their farms.  I remember here&mdash;I do not know exactly in which year of his period of office it was&mdash;saying to the Minister that the worst of arguing with him on this question is that he is so full of enthusiasm for mechanisation that he drives those who are doubtful to the other end, and he succeeds, perhaps, in misrepresenting them before the community at large as men who have no vision and as men who do not want to lift farmers out of the sort of rut in which they have been living, and in which many of them still find themselves, in so far as work on the land is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> I think, from what we have seen of the last three or four months&mdash;I am not speaking, I suppose, with a knowledge of what is taking place in any wide area in the country, but I am speaking for the area I know best, and this is something on which I have been thinking since we were previously discussing the advisability of mechanisation&mdash; those farmers, where the land is wet and heavy, who have been depending upon tractors and other forms of mechanisation, have been, in the main, unable to get on with their work. While I agree, having regard to the difficulties of securing labour, having regard to labour costs and a number of other factors, that mechanisation would be a very desirable thing, I believe that, in my district anyhow, it has been established that as regards farmers who are the owners of heavy land&mdash;in this part of the world where we get such a volume of rain&mdash;it is very doubtful if the use we would like to see made of tractors can, in fact, be made with any certainty, and I believe that farmers who depend entirely upon mechanisation will find themselves, as do many farmers that I know, with very little land broken up at this stage.</P>
    <P>I agree that while that is an argument against the use of tractors and all the rest, you have to admit when the weather does take up that there is an enormous amount of work that you can do quickly with them.  We must remember, however, seasons such as the one we have just gone through, 1950-51, and when we think, as I have pointed out, how we were faced with the same sort of situation only three years back, it makes us wonder if we can do as apparently they have succeeded in doing in other countries&mdash;if we can develop along the mechanised lines that have been spoken of here with such wonderful enthusiasm by the Minister on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>When we try to speak words of encouragement to people engaged on the land, especially because of these circumstances over which neither the Minister nor any of us has any control, I cannot help expressing the hope that the Minister will bring his influence to <Col N="860" /> bear upon members of this House who are supporting the Government and who have seen fit to select this opportunity to call a strike of agricultural workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I worry about the whole country.  When talking about the circumstances of the present season, I suppose I may as well say just a few words now in connection with this whole question of tillage and the Minister's policy in regard to it.  In his opening remarks he made some reference to the difficulties farmers will experience in laying down wheat.  In that regard did it not occur to the Minister that, if he was seriously thinking of wheat as a crop this year, any announcement he thought fit to make in regard to it should be postponed until the month of April?  If the Minister was serious in trying to induce our farmers, bad and all as the season was, to lay down a reasonable area under that crop, surely to goodness the time to make an announcement as to the conditions under which that crop would, when harvested, be marketed, should be somewhere around September, October or November of last year?  I am at a loss to <Col N="861" /> know what purpose could be served by telling farmers on the 1st April that they were going to get an increased price for the wheat they would produce in 1951, and how it could have been difficult for the Minister to see the need for a revision of the wheat price, having regard to the price at which oats and barley were sold.</P>
      <P>In any part of the world oats was making from £3 to £4 a barrel of 14 stone.  That being the case, if we wanted to have an increased area under wheat, it would beat the ordinary man's understanding to see why farmers were asked to grow wheat at a price of 62/6 per 20-stone barrel.  If there is one thing more than another, one subject more than another, on which the present Minister can be attacked and in respect of which he has no defence whatever, it is the whole question of tillage.  We, here, who know the Minister well, realise that when he came into office he took a devilish delight&mdash;I do not believe that he had the slightest suspicion as to the consequences that would follow from the course he was pursuing at the time&mdash; in preaching a certain gospel to farmers, because he thought he was speaking to and cultivating the support of, a certain section of farmers who, undoubtedly, were hostile to the policy that this House and the Government were obliged to pursue during the war years.  Deputies remember the dramatic way in which that policy was departed from in 1948.  I have always contended, and I am convinced, that no greater disservice was ever done to our people than was done by that abrupt change in agricultural policy which was effected by the present Minister on his coming into office.  The peculiar point about it is that he had announced&mdash;I believe it was in this House the announcement was made&mdash; that a new Minister for Agriculture should not behave like a bull in a china shop.  That seemed all right but his performance was certainly not in keeping with that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying this in order to excuse myself for the extent to which the Government had to go during those difficult years in order to secure our <Col N="862" /> food supply but I maintained at that time and I still maintain that, whether we had gone too far or far enough, having regard to the amount of money that farmers were induced to invest, the amount of effort and organisation they had put into the tillage drive during all those years, the wise policy for the Minister who is now responsible for agriculture to follow, if he thought he should depart from that policy, was to taper it off gradually so that those who had invested money would have an opportunity of securing a reasonable return and so as to ensure, in a difficult world supply situation, as even then existed, we would be in a position to look after ourselves and our live stock in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>I shall not cite or produce here all the arguments advanced by the Minister for his policy, which has left us in the position in which we now find ourselves.  One speech that I can always remember as having the most damaging effect on tillage farmers was the speech made by the Minister in his constituency in July, 1948, when he told the farmers, who were awaiting the harvest of 1948, that he would import unlimited quantities of maize at £1 a cwt.  I know hundreds of farmers who, taking the Minister seriously and accepting his word, naturally and, I would say, very wisely, determined that, if foreign feeding stuff could be imported at that price, there was no point whatever in their continuing with the tillage policy. Instead of making what I would regard as a sensible approach, the Minister set out by all the eloquence at his command to cultivate the impression that we were a Party composed of men who wanted to meddle in the farmers' affairs, who wanted to tell the farmers what to do and, not only to tell them, but to compel them.  With all the ballyhoo that went on, farmers who, in the normal way, were accustomed to tillage, became sick of it and there is growing evidence from the Minister's own figures year after year, of a decline in tillage.</P>
    <P>I saw an advertisement&mdash;maybe it was not an advertisement&mdash;but I read an assurance given within the last few weeks by the Minister to farmers that <Col N="863" /> unlimited supplies of seed wheat were available to those who wanted to sow spring varieties.  I confess that I am speaking for an area in which very little wheat is commercially grown, but I could mention to the Minister half a dozen towns in which a farmer would not get a single stone of seed wheat. Not a single stone of seed wheat was available this year in half a dozen important towns that I know and I can tell the Minister also that I met farmers who were looking for seed wheat who could not find it.</P>
    <P>I am not contending that there was not, taking the country as a whole, seed wheat available sufficient to meet perhaps all our requirements and more, but it was because of the lateness&mdash; the lateness of the Minister's interest in the wheat crop&mdash;that merchants in these areas naturally thought it a waste of effort, a waste of time and a waste of money to put in even the smallest stocks of seed wheat.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot really expect results suddenly to accrue from some announcement made from Merrion Street as to what the farmer should do and what crop he should grow, having regard to the interest of the community.  There has to be, as there was in 1947, a certain preparation such as produced in 1947 an acreage of 579,000 odd acres even though, as I say, the lands of the country were sealed over with snow and frost <Col N="864" /> for eight weeks and it was only in the month of April that farmers had an opportunity of breaking land to enable them to lay down their crops.  I think myself that it is not fair to blame the Minister for Agriculture alone because of his failure in this regard.  After all, he was only one of 13, and I would have expected that the Government as a whole would have taken an interest in these matters, but on whomsoever the responsibility rests, be it the Minister himself or the Government as a whole, there is no line in which their failure has been so crushing, so expensive and so dangerous from the community point of view, as their policy in this regard.</P>
      <P>There are two or three matters with which I am anxious to deal, and in respect of which the Minister has also made some observations.  One is eggs. I shall, if I can in the few words I have to say on the subject, endeavour to clear up the position as I honestly and truthfully know it.  My reason for referring to this subject at all is because of the efforts of the Minister, not during his speech on this Estimate but efforts in this House and outside it for some time past, to create the impression that I was responsible, by negotiating the agreement in 1947 with the British, for leaving him as my successor with a certain legacy with which he found it impossible to deal effectively.  It is true that an agreement was made with the British in 1947; it is true that following the making of that agreement in 1947, and because of its provisions, the present Minister for Agriculture who was then a member of the Opposition, was critical of it.  It is also true that the Leader of Fine Gael expressed himself as being hostile to that agreement. I believe I am justified in saying that both Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy, as they then were, expressed the view in 1947, following the making of that agreement, that the poultry industry was being placed on home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going, before I conclude my case in regard to the agreement of 1947 dealing with eggs, to place on record.  I hope, facts that cannot be refuted.  It was only a short time <Col N="865" /> afterwards&mdash;the exact period was from October, 1947 until February, 1948&mdash; that Deputy Dillon became Minister for Agriculture.  It was understandable and I am not making any complaint against the Minister, on that account, that he should have expressed criticism in 1947 of the agreement on eggs.  I know that, being a private Deputy at that time, he could not be in possession of all the facts to which one would have to have regard, before one could really express a balanced judgment on the terms of the agreement.  As I say I have no fault to find with the criticism expressed by Deputy Dillon up to the point that he himself became Minister for Agriculture.  Having become Minister for Agriculture he was then in a position to have a look at the whole background of the making of that agreement&mdash;how it came about and how it came to contain all its provisions.  Apparently, he had a look at it, and he must have had discussions with the officials who were largely responsible for negotiating it because, speaking in this House on his first Estimate in 1948, on the 9th July, at column 2065, he said what I am going to quote for the House in a moment. He had just given us a long speech telling us of the advantages of a trade agreement which the House had not had an opportunity of discussing, and he came to eggs and to the egg agreement negotiated in my time.  This is what he had to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think it is necessary to dwell at length on the necessity for expanding our fowl industry.  My predecessor in office negotiated in London an agreement relating to the price for eggs and the development of the fowl and egg industry.  There was some misunderstanding about the terms of that agreement which, I think, should be made more clear, particularly as I myself was perhaps responsible for a part of that misunderstanding. It was stated at the time that the British Government were giving us a grant to use in this country for the development of the Irish fowl industry and the production of fowl and eggs.  I cannot deny that, during the election campaign, I myself demurred to that, and said: &lsquo;This is a very peculiar <Col N="866" /> procedure; why should the British Government give us a grant to develop our own fowl industry; what business have they in coming in here to bestow benefices on this country any more than any other country in the world&rsquo;?  I would make it clear that it was necessary for the Government at the time to announce the price agreed with the British Government in that form for certain reasons associated with other trade agreements that Government was at that time negotiating with other parties.  Substantially, what happened was that 5/- more on the published price was, in fact, secured from the purchaser for our egg production. In so far as the Minister succeeded in doing that, he is deserving of our congratulations and those of the egg producers of this country for the bargain he struck. We are doing our best to develop and, possibly, in the later stages of the bargain to improve the terms which, in the circumstances, I feel sure it was impossible for him to grapple with in respect of the more remote years of the agreement's currency.</P>
    <P>The agreement itself is one on foot of which, I think, we ought to be able to expand very largely indeed our egg industry.  I want to say this, Sir, in public.  I had occasion to use a form of words during the recent London negotiations that made some pressmen say that it was our intention under the existing agreement to &lsquo;Drown the English in eggs&rsquo;.  One of the remarkable consequences of that was that everyone keeping a hen in England was thrown into hysteria and represented to the British Minister of Agriculture that they were going to be swept away when the flood of eggs came.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My point in raising this matter, and in giving that extract, is to place on the records of this House the facts in regard to it, and to end for all time, in so far as I can, this habit and this policy of the Minister in going before county committees of agriculture on which there is no one who is equipped with these facts and able to challenge him upon some of the statements he <Col N="867" /> makes.  But, out of the Minister's own mouth, I have shown that he was critical of the agreement until, as Minister, he came to see the reason for the making of it, and until, at a later stage, it became his responsibility as Minister to talk to the British in regard to egg prices when, as a result of the agreement to which I have been referring, the industry rapidly expanded and production increased.  The Minister himself was the one who claimed credit in 1948 for the rapid increase in the quantity of eggs produced.  It was only when, in negotiations following with the British, he found himself unable to repeat what his predecessor had done, that he then started off by attributing a certain legacy, which flowed from his predecessor, to himself.  My challenge is this: that in 1947 we secured from the British a price for our eggs greater than that paid to the Danes. The Minister himself, in the passage which I have quoted, has admitted that we secured from the British a price greater than that paid to the Danes who were then negotiating with the British Government on matters relating to the price of eggs and other agricultural produce.  My challenge to the Minister and to Deputies supporting him is this: why is it that they have been unable to secure from the British Government the same advantages which we secured in the agreement of 1947?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether or not it is, as Deputy Keane says, because of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture decided, because of the struggle in which he had been engaged all his life to secure a republic for Ireland, because of the efforts he made in that direction&mdash;perhaps Deputy Keane is right and it was the declaration of that Republic&mdash;no one has given us that as an explanation, no one holding a ministerial and responsible post has stated that that was the cause of the failure of the Minister for Agriculture and this Government to secure an agreement that I thought it was possible to secure with the British.  From my experience in dealing with British Ministers, I would not expect they would be just falling over themselves to give high prices for our agricultural produce, but, as I say, I found they were decent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself, after he came into office, gave us something to guide us, something that I had often heard myself but which had slipped my memory until I read his words of encouragement to the poultry producers <Col N="869" /> in a paper published at that time called <i>Pep.</i>  In his message to the producers, the Minister said it was always accepted that while the producer can get for ten dozen of eggs the price of 1 cwt. of maize meal he could profitably engage in egg production. The Minister went on to say then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The price of maize meal is now 28/- a cwt. and the price of a great hundred of eggs is 30/-; therefore, I can wholeheartedly recommend farmers and producers to engage in egg production and be assured of a profit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We did not at the time regard the agreement made with the British in 1947 as an attractive agreement.  We were so unimpressed by its provisions that there was a general understanding that, should costs increase from the producers' point of view, we could at any time seek to have a revision of prices.  Having established how unjustifiable was the campaign engaged in mainly by the Minister and some of his henchmen to prove that some legacy was handed on to him of which he was not aware, I can only say that after the agreement was arrived at in 1947 there was an understanding that should the cost of production increase we could again approach the British with a view to having the price of eggs reviewed in the hope of getting a compensatory advantage to meet the increased cost of feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am issuing a challenge to the Minister.  I will go before any tribunal, I will go before any committee of agriculture, I will meet the Minister in any part of this country he likes, and I will prove by the production of documentary evidence that that agreement of 1947 was negotiated in the form in which it was negotiated in order to save the British from embarrassment because of the fact that they were giving us preferential treatment over those with whom they were then engaged in discussions with regard to food prices.  I will prove that the Minister, after coming into office, although he was a critic of the agreement, having studied the agreement, having seen the reasons why it was negotiated in that form, admitted <Col N="870" /> in the words I have cited the wisdom of the course which was taken.  I will meet him before anybody and establish the truth of that.  I invite him now to tell the unfortunate egg producers why it is that something we were able to do in 1947 he has not been able to repeat.  We may talk about the cattle population and its importance and appreciate it as much as we like, but the Minister will have to realise how important are the egg industry, the bacon industry and the production of milk.</P>

      <P>I am going now to deal with pigs and bacon.  I find that in regard to this important branch of the agricultural industry the whole question is shrouded in mystery.  No number of parliamentary questions will apparently induce the Minister to give us any clear idea of where we stand with regard to that matter.  Deputy Dillon, when speaking as a Deputy on October 15th, 1947, at column 474 of the Official Report, made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I could restore the pig population in 12 months.  I could provide every farmer and every consumer with all the bacon they would want, and leave a substantial surplus for export to Great Britain.  If you set out now to plant feeding barley and potatoes on the land at present being wasted in the cultivation of beet and some of the rubbish called wheat&mdash; but leave wheat out for the moment &mdash;we could restore the pig population in 18 months at the longest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a little more than twice 18 months now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;make a profit on every pig, provide the bacon for every table in this country and have an export for <Col N="871" /> Great Britain wherewith to purchase goods we want, because we would have an export which they particularly want.  Of the total of their consumption, our production would fill an appreciable percentage. Instead of that, we are to subsidise to the tune of £400,000 the increased acreage under beet, every acre of which will complicate the world situation created by a sugar surplus and every acre of which represents a serious loss to the national income.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was Deputy James Dillon speaking in October, 1947.  What had Deputy James Dillon, now Minister for Agriculture, to say when speaking of pigs and bacon to-day?  What had the Minister to say in 1948 when recommending the agreement he and his colleagues made with Great Britain about the unprecedented advantages that would flow to the agricultural community as a result of it?  That is three years ago?  Three years afterwards, all we could get from the Minister to-day was that he was endeavouring to negotiate and complete an agreement with the British Government. An agreement on the price of what?  Is it bacon?  What is the Minister negotiating about now?  Is it the price of bacon that is involved in these discussions?  Or, is it, as the British Minister of Food once put it, the price of pigs on the trotter?  If it is the price of pigs on the trotter, why must the pig be supplied on the trotter?  These are questions to which the Minister should give to the House, and, through the House, to the country, an answer.  I know that the Minister was in opposition when he made that speech in October, 1947. That was only a few short months before he became Minister.  I will make all the allowances anyone likes for all his extravagance of language and everything else, but, in order to clear up this mystery surrounding the pig and bacon industry to-day, will the Minister say why it was necessary to pay a subsidy on whatever little quantity of bacon we have to dispose of to Great Britain?  Will the Minister say why it is necessary for the producer to subsidise the sale of that bacon in the <Col N="872" /> British market?  Will the Minister say, either when he is concluding or at some stage, what is the meaning of these negotiations that are now taking place between the British and himself and his Department?  Will he say why it is necessary to have an agreement dealing only with the pigs on the trotter?  Will the Minister say why it is, if there is a possibility of our having pigs or bacon for export in the future, that 26, 27, 28 or 30 bacon factories studded all over the country, some of which are now closed down for want of supplies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important question because there are now Deputies supporting the present Government who, over a long period, have complained because of the way in which our live-stock trade with Britain developed and because of the desirability of selling our surplus cattle other than on the hoof since there are many advantages that would accrue <Col N="873" /> out of a tinned meat or dressed meat trade.  Such a trade would mean that we would retain the hides for ourselves. Such a trade would mean that we would have certain employment resulting from that because of the industries that would grow up subsidiary to such a development.  It has been a cause for grievous complaint amongst our people that we allowed the cattle trade to Britain to establish itself in a particular form to our ultimate detriment. I do not know what the arguments are in favour of selling pigs on the trotter &mdash;there may be some substantial reason for it&mdash;but there has not been a word said by the Minister to-day as to why this practice will be established.  My confusion of mind on the present position of the pig and bacon industry does not end there.</P>
      <P>On the 11th May, 1950, as given in Volume 120, column 2226, Deputy Dr. Maguire asked the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will arrange to facilitate the export of pigs to Northern Ireland in view of the high prices prevailing there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture replied as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The British Ministry of Food, which is the purchaser of all fat pigs exported from this country, accepts such pigs only at designated centres in England, namely, Liverpool and Birmingham.  There is no approved purchasing centre for our fat pigs in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>The future position as regards exports of pigs as well as bacon is at present under discussion with the Ministry of Food and pending the outcome of these negotiations it is not considered desirable that there should be a departure from the present arrangements in regard to the export of any classes of pigs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On June 6th, I asked the Minister a question, given in Volume 121, column 1179:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether, in view of the necessity of subsidising the sale of surplus bacon in Great Britain, he will amend the instructions on which our customs officers are at present acting on the Border in preventing the <Col N="874" /> movement of pigs to the Six Counties, where a profitable market is at hand to pig producers in the Republic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would refer the Deputy to my reply to the question asked by Deputy P.J. Maguire on this subject on 11th May.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the Minister not agree that it is absurd to be paying out of taxation the salaries of men to act as customs officers to prevent our farmers disposing of their pigs in the sundered part of Ireland, while, at the same time, if the pigs are not disposed of in that fashion, they have to be sent to Great Britain where they can only be sold profitably by the payment of a subsidy which comes directly from the producers themselves?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Deputy will look at the answer to the question to which I have referred him, he will find an explanation for the present situation fully set out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were some other supplementary questions along that line.  One would naturally take it from the Minister's attitude in replying to those two questions that there were only two centres, Liverpool and Birmingham, at which we could dispose of pigs.  Here is where the mystery lies for me.  Shortly after this, the Minister attended a meeting of his supporters.  I do not know whether they were his supporters or members of a secret organisation of which he is the national vice-president, the Molly Maguires.  He attended that meeting in Ballybay, one of the towns in his constituency, and suddenly, without consultation with anybody, and in spite of the fact that he had assured us here in the House that pigs could not be disposed of except in Birmingham and Liverpool on the trotter, he removed the ban on the export of pigs and the trek across the Six-County Border started.  I want the Minister to explain to this House what the factors were, what the arguments <Col N="875" /> were, on whose advice he made that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for information about what is locally known, these facts whispered around the Minister's own constituency.  He knows that the facts as stated now are commonly spoken of in the county which he represents.  The people know that on the 25th October he removed a ban which he told me in <Col N="876" /> this House could not be removed.  The people know that he removed a ban which a short time before he had informed another Deputy from Monaghan could not be removed.  They know that the removal of the ban followed the meetings to which I have referred and especially one meeting of what is known to be a secret organisation in Monaghan of which the Minister is national vice-president. Surely the House and the country are entitled to know something about this shady sort of business.</P>
      <P>If it is possible, then, for the Minister at will to remove this ban, why is it necessary to go through all this painful procedure, apparently, of trying to negotiate with the British a price of 220/- for our pigs on the trotter &mdash;the deadweight value being 220/- &mdash; when by removing the ban one can immediately secure 285/-?  I want the Minister to deal with this matter, as it is important.  Here we have a Minister who for one month, only recently, allowed our producers access to a market for their produce in the Six Counties in which they were able to get attractive prices.  He closed down on that market and now he tells us in moving this Estimate that he is busily engaged for the last three years in trying to get the British to give us 220/- for what we can get 285/- if he only removed the ban.  That is surely one point of mystery which the Minister should endeavour to clear up.</P>
      <P>Milk prices have been increased recently.  The way in which that business has been handled reflects no credit on the Minister.  We cannot get from him at any time any indication of what he is likely to do in the near future in relation not only to milk but to any other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make this statement in regard to milk prices, that while the Minister is and has been for the last three years a member of a Government from which the organised sections of our people were able to get concession after concession&mdash;there is even the case of one paid official who was allowed to secure an increase in his salary of £1,000 per annum, and whose salary had been revised only in 1947&mdash;not a solitary effort would appear to have been made <Col N="877" /> by him on behalf of the milk producers of the country, the price for whose milk up to a week or so ago was that fixed by the then Government in 1947 on my recommendation.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago, if you do not mind, a proposal came from the Minister that the price then prevailing should be reduced to 1/- per gallon all the year round because of certain fears he had, which apparently did not last longer than a couple of months, as to our capacity to more than produce what we could consume at home.  Now we have heard, 12 months after, of our incapacity to produce what we want to feed ourselves.  The price which has been fixed recently, on the recommendation, I take it, of the Minister, of an increase of 1d. per gallon on milk supplied during the summer months is an insult and a disgrace.  It is an admission and a complete proof of the lack of real interest the Minister has shown on behalf of these people while he was a member of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy suggest the price should be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister what I think his behaviour has been.  The comparison I am drawing in regard to his behaviour will be approved by every milk supplier in the country.  By the way, for the last couple of months, the Minister has seen fit, when requested to meet representatives of the milk producers, to refer to this organisation as a Fianna Fáil ramp.  There is no doubt about it, the majority of the people in that organisation must be Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the majority of the milk suppliers of the country are Fianna Fáil.  Where does the Minister expect our support would come from? Is it the Minister's contention that because they are supporters of Fianna Fáil they have not a right to make themselves heard?  Is it the Minister's contention that because some of them are Unionists and some of them Fine Gael and because they are not in the majority, they must be Fianna Fáil, they must be supporting us, they must <Col N="878" /> believe in us?  Any time the Minister wants to have that tested, there is a simple way of having it done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no hesitation in saying what the price should be in 1947, when I was Minister.  I had no hesitation in going to my colleagues and to the Minister for Finance and seeing to it that they got what I thought was fair.  They got it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were again responsible for the post of Minister for Agriculture I would see to it that if these smash-and-grab raids were to be carried out by every section of the community, the farmers would get their grab, too.  But the Minister has lain low.  He has allowed them all to have their pluck and their rake-off, but when this organisation and its representatives endeavoured to have an interview with him, it was termed a Fianna Fáil ramp, a Fianna Fáil racket.  He would not say then that he was not going to help the political fortunes of the chairman, who is a Unionist, and who, as he contended, was after a certain parliamentary seat in the constituency in which he lives, and so on.  What right has a Minister for Agriculture, even if he intended to refuse the request that he knew in advance they would make, to refuse to meet such people, in order to hear, at least, what they had to say and in order to give them an opportunity of advancing the arguments which they had satisfied themselves were sound and necessary to advance to the Minister because of his&mdash;in their view&mdash;inactivity in coming to their rescue?  Suppose that this organisation had been a branch of the Molly Maguires in County Monaghan and had sought an interview&mdash;it is a corrupt and secret organisation&mdash;I wonder would the Minister have refused them?  If the Minister had received a request from that organisation, would he have turned it down? Yet, when the milk producers wanted <Col N="879" /> to have a talk with him, it was a different matter.  They were not to be seen; they could not be heard. Instead of meeting them, the Minister chose to meet the representatives of an organisation which, although all right in its own way, is not an organisation in which the producer would have the same degree of confidence that his case would be made in the same effective way.  I have no hesitation whatever in saying that the treatment by the present Minister of the milk producers of this country has been indefensible.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies have raised this question from time to time, but never with any satisfactory result.  It would have been far better if the Minister had withheld this paltry increase in the price of milk, because those who produce milk know that wages, rates and other costs have increased and that many other things have happened to make the cost of milk production soar enormously since the date on which the previous price was fixed in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the milk producers asking for?  They are asking for arbitration. They are asking for an opportunity to go before an impartial body of men or women so that they can state their case for an adequate increase in the price of milk.  Am I not entitled, then, to charge the Minister responsible for their industry with being negligent in not securing for them that right when he sits, as Minister for Agriculture, with 12, or now, 11, colleagues and when arbitration can be conceded in the case of other organised sections, such as teachers, civil servants and so on?  Is it any wonder that there should be a tendency on the part of farmers and people who are obliged to live on the land, who are obliged to live in rural conditions, to move away from these conditions, from the hardships and the slavery associated with working on the land, when they see that, no matter how much they talk, or crave or demand it, they are denied even the simple concession&mdash;it is not a question of giving 2d. or 1d. per gallon&mdash;of being heard.  They merely say: &ldquo;You are a member of a <Col N="880" /> Government which has made arbitration available to a number of classes in the community who are not half as important as we are,&rdquo; and we are asking, on behalf of these people, that arbitration facilities should be extended to them.  That is a just demand, but not only has that demand been refused, but we have had the performance to which I have referred of the Minister refusing to meet representatives of that association.</P>
    <P>There are many other phases of this subject with which other speakers will deal.  I stated, when opening my remarks, that I had three matters which were most important to the greatest number of farmers.  One was eggs and the others were pigs and bacon and milk prices.  I have invited the Minister to make the position clear with regard to the first two, with regard to the mystery surrounding his inability to secure something in the way of a reasonable price for eggs and the mystery associated with the pigs and bacon situation.  I do not know if we can hope to get any clarification from the Minister, because my experience of him is that, when one tries to get to the bottom of things, when one tries to unravel questions of this nature, he will use all the skill he possesses not for the purpose of assisting but for the purpose of thwarting us.  He has succeeded on many occasions in that effort here, but that would be a small matter indeed if his achievements had stopped at that.  He has thwarted more than that.</P>
    <P>Deputies who support the Government blame us for keeping in office the present Minister.  They say: &ldquo;You have been so critical of the man that we could not afford to remove him, could not run the risk of exposing ourselves by removing him.  If you were not as critical of this man, we could have changed him from one Department to another, but in view of the way you have conducted yourselves and the campaign you have carried on, we could not take the risk.&rdquo; There are others, Deputies and Senators, who through the country make the excuse that the Minister has a way of saying things that nobody else has, and a particular Deputy will say to some <Col N="881" /> of his supporters who are critical of the Minister: &ldquo;I would not say the things the way he says them, but he means well.&rdquo;  These are the defences being made for the Minister, and I am revealing no secret when I say that there is no confidence in him amongst any section of the community who will speak their mind, and, worst of all, there is no confidence in him on the part of those employed by the State to implement his policy.  Servants of the State in all Departments, as I have known them for a long time, are faithful. They will serve any Minister or any Government, but when they have to engage in the operation of a policy with a Minister who is so fickle, so extravagant and so impossible to estimate in any way they, too, will lose that confidence in him which is necessary if a policy of any kind is to be successfully put over.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is in the nature of things that Deputies supporting this Government should behave so.  Undoubtedly, they will stand up and defend his actions as best they can, but lurking behind that defence is the firm belief and conviction which is shared by the community at large and by the very outdoor officials through the country, from the lowest to the highest, who have no political views, so far as I know, that the Minister is a man in whom they can have absolutely no confidence, and, so long as that situation exists, there can be no progress in the agricultural sphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I wish to discuss is the rather contemptible insult offered by this Minister to the agricultural community &mdash; and by &ldquo;agricultural community&rdquo; I mean the working agricultural community.  He insulted the ordinary dairy farmer of this country and I may say that the dairy farm is the foundation of agriculture and the foundation of any agricultural policy in this country. Last week this Minister for Agriculture insulted the dairy farmers by fixing an increase of half a farthing per pint on their milk.  If ever a more flagrant and contemptible insult has been offered to the agricultural community I should like to hear of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to bring the minds of Deputies back to the last time the price for milk was fixed in this country: it was in March, 1947.  Deputy Smith, the then Minister for Agriculture, fixed the price at 1/2 per gallon for the summer months and 1/4 per <Col N="884" /> gallon for the winter months.  There was a general complaint from the Deputies who are now over on the Government side of the House, but who were on this side of the House at that time, that the prices should have been higher.  As a matter of fact, when this present Government came into office there was a notice of motion, signed by Deputy Halliden, Deputy Cogan and some other Deputies&mdash;I think there were five in all&mdash;complaining about the uneconomic price of milk.  In November, 1947, the price was regarded as uneconomic.  It was wrong then.  Yet the very Deputies whose names were attached to that motion afterwards trotted into the lobby&mdash;with the notable exception of Deputy Cogan&mdash;and voted against any increase in the price of milk.  The Minister then admitted in a public statement here that the cost of agricultural produce had been put up by him by something over 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got from me personally and from Professor Murphy of University College, Cork, certain costings which he has used here periodically whenever it suited him.  We look on our industry as an industry.  Those costings omit interest on capital and farm management but the Minister has used those costings without those two items and says: &ldquo;Here is the cost of the production of milk.&rdquo; If those two items were included it would increase the cost of milk by about 3d. a gallon.  Professor Murphy himself has stated publicly that production costs have gone up since Deputy Smith fixed the price of milk by about 3½d. a gallon.  The Minister has plenty of opportunity of finding out what is the cost of the production of milk.  In this Estimate we are discussing he pays for seven or nine farms of land, most of which keep dairy cows.  If the Minister is correct in his attitude or in his figures why does he not produce in this House costings from the university farm in Cork, for instance, Clonakilty farm or Glasnevin and have them examined by us and let the farming community know what is the cost of the production of milk?</P>
    <P>For the past three years he has definitely refused the appeals of the agricultural <Col N="885" /> community and has continued to refuse until this year we have the result which is the same as we had for the oats, the barley, the wheat, the sugar&mdash;we rush abroad to the Continent and endeavour to buy for the Irish people, of all things in the world, butter.  In this agricultural dairying country why had we to send for butter to the Continent?  Because in a brazen bluff to endeavour to prove the truth of what he knew absolutely was not true, namely, that there was a surplus of butter, the Minister went abroad and endeavoured to sell our butter.  To whom?  To a country that could get nothing from anybody in the world to-day because she cannot pay for it and will not pay for it, the country that is living on the rabbits and the horses because she is not prepared to pay for food.</P>
    <P>The Argentine refused them meat and everywhere they go is closed to them, but the Minister went there with our butter and was offered 271/- a cwt. for it.  He came back to our farmers who, if the Deputies over there are to be believed, were getting an uneconomic price for butter in 1947, and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have a guaranteed price for your milk for the next five years at 1/- a gallon instead of 1/2&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 20 per cent. increase in costings and a reduction of 2d. a gallon, and this was to increase production!</P>
    <P>Last August I had published in the public Press the figures from January to June, 1950, showing what the Danish Minister for Agriculture had received for butter on the Continent.  He sold a large quantity of butter to France at 463/- a cwt.; he sold it to the American forces in occupation in Germany at 498/- a cwt.; he sold it to the German people at 414/- a cwt.; he sold it to Italy; he sold practically as much butter as we produce.  He sold 228,000 cwt. of butter between January and June, 1950, and he got for that an average price of 438/- a cwt.  Our Minister went over to Britain and was told: &ldquo;I will give you 271/- a cwt.&rdquo; He came back to the Irish farmers and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You have got to eat dry bread&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" />&mdash;and, mind you, he says that yet&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;you are too well fed, you are consuming too much butter.  You have got to pare down and do with less and give me your butter.  I will sell it on the Continent at a price that will give you 1/- a gallon for your milk.  You will not even get 1/- a gallon for milk; you will only get it with £2,800,000 from the taxpayer to help you out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister was such a wretched salesman as all that, why the dickens did he not go to the Danish Minister for Agriculture and say: &ldquo;Look, here is our butter and there is 10 per cent. commission; you go and sell it.&rdquo; Would that not be a decent thing for him to do instead of endeavouring to grind down the agricultural community? He grinds them down and then he sells butter on the Continent. He sold it to France; at what price? This great Minister, who extracts the last farthing, sold it at 98/- per cwt. less than the Danish Minister got for his.  Would it not pay us well to give a commission of 10 per cent. or even 20 per cent. to the Danish Minister and tell him to go and sell our butter? The Danish Minister got 463/- and our Minister got 365/- in France.  He sold that butter on the Continent and he knew the day he was selling it that there was not sufficient butter here to meet the ration.  I have not the figures with me; I am speaking here without my notes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy full liberty to speak in a few minutes. That is the manner in which this Minister carried on.  There were two questions asked here last year by Deputy P.D. Lehane at the time when this Minister was pretending there was a surplus of butter.  One question was addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, asking for information as to the quantity of butter produced; the other was to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, asking about the quantity required for the ration. <Col N="887" /> The position was that we were short 20,000 odd cwt. of butter to meet the ration.  That represented the condition of affairs when this Minister went to the Continent and sold butter.</P>
      <P>He found he could not carry on the bluff any longer and he went over and bought butter from the Danes.  He brought back some butter, the history of which I gave here some time ago. It was the butter that was whipped out of Brian Boru's tent the day he was killed at Clontarf.  It was taken over and held by the Danes in cold storage ever since.  It was brought back here and now, when the ice is melting out of it, the water content is rising and some of our unfortunate shopkeepers are being lugged into court and prosecuted because the ice has melted in the butter.  James now finds 20 to 25 per cent. of water in the butter.  What did he pay for it?  He paid 376/- for 20 to 25 per cent. of water.</P>
      <P>The position is that, in the worst winter that has been experienced in this country for a generation, this Minister has stood by callous and sneering, with his &ldquo;do not give a hang&rdquo; attitude.  He comes along in the month of April and says: &ldquo;I will give you half a farthing per pint of an increase, and I hope you will fatten on it&rdquo;.  That is the Minister whom this Government put in charge of the destinies of this nation in the matter of agriculture.  I am not going to enter into the long history of all the things this gentleman did.  I would like to say a few words about the unfortunate farmer's wife.  I got this parcel when I came into the Dáil; it was sent to me by post.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I and many other poultry breeders have gone to trouble and expense to produce more, only to discover that feeding stuffs went up by leaps and bounds, while the price of eggs went down much faster.  You can see by the eggs enclosed in this that the hens have gone on strike and refused to produce a normal egg any more, at the low price offered for eggs.  I would be glad if you would present them to Mr. Dillon and ask him on our behalf to do his best to get a much better price for them or they will soon be as scarce as gold sovereigns in Eire.&rdquo;</P>

However, there they are, and that letter comes from one of those people who have been bluffed by this cry of the Minister for Agriculture, when he told the people that the more eggs they could produce the better would be the price.  When the eggs got plentiful the price fell.  That will not happen again.  The more eggs you produce, he told the farmers' wives, the higher the price will be.  The present price, he said, is 3/- a dozen, and that was signed, &ldquo;James M. Dillon.&rdquo; The people had it off by heart.  It was headed, &ldquo;A message to the Irish people.&rdquo;  That was the message, and what happened?  I believe that whereever you went you could see a farmer's wife having a hold of her husband by the arm, saying: &ldquo;You will have to buy an incubator for me,&rdquo; and every house you went into and every outoffice had its nice little lamp burning and nice little chickens gathered around it for the heat.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the Minister tell the English people?  He said to them: &ldquo;I will drown you with eggs.&rdquo; To our people he said: &ldquo;The more you produce the higher the price will be&rdquo;, but, with the increase in the number of eggs, down came the price.  Last week he was telling us about the number of cwts. of old hens that were being sent to feed the British people. Old hens he is sending over now.  Anyway, that was his attitude towards the eggs.</P>
      <P>He then issued another statement. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am your Minister for maize. The price of maize at present is £20 a ton.  I cannot see, within conceivable time, that price increasing; it will not increase while I am Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Twenty pounds a ton for maize and 3/- a dozen for eggs.  It looked all right, and no wonder the farmers were persuaded to buy hoovers and produce chickens&mdash;one - day chicks.  When everything was ready, the maize started climbing up in price.  Now he has a kind of mongrel maize, 25 per cent. maize and 75 per cent. sorghums, or 75 per cent. sorghums and 25 per cent. maize, at £30 a ton.  I will give you my views on sorghums later on. It is well worth hearing.  That is the position as regards poultry.</P>
      <P>The first inkling we got of the new move was when another Deputy stood up here and told us about a dual-purpose hen that the Minister would produce, with beef on her back and eggs behind.  It was Deputy Rooney that thought of that.  Deputy Rooney spent several days here telling us about this dual-purpose hen that the Minister would have for us but the dual-purpose hen, unfortunately, seems to have disappeared like the dual-purpose cow that the Department of Agriculture has been dreaming of for the last 23 years.</P>

      <P>I will give them all their turn in time.  That is the position of this Minister for Agriculture as regards poultry&mdash;2/- per doz. for eggs; £30 per ton for a mixture of mongrel maize. The first adventure we had with this Minister was immediately after his coming into office, when he issued a new dictum: &ldquo;Grow more oats, grow more potatoes; assured market for both.  Any surplus you have the Department of Agriculture will take it off your hands.&rdquo;  The people, getting a new Minister, were anxious to please him and they produced the oats and the potatoes.  Lo and behold, the Minister quite forgot to produce the market.  I happened to be one of a deputation that was requested to interview the Minister in connection with that matter.  I interviewed him.  There were other Deputies with me&mdash;Deputy Lehane, Deputy Lahiffe&mdash;and members of all Parties.  The Minister told us:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have no intention of putting a floor under Rank.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was his reply as far as oats was concerned.  He wound up by telling us that he did not give a fiddle-de-dee if they never got £1 for it.  That was the Minister for Agriculture who had advised the farmers to grow oats that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another Deputy questioned him about the price of potatoes and said the price was very low, that he had got only £7 a ton for them.  He said: &ldquo;You got £7 a ton for your potatoes. You are one lucky man, Deputy.&rdquo; That is the Minister for Agriculture and that was his attitude towards the people who went to appeal to him to carry out his pledge to the farmers, <Col N="891" /> the pledge he gave when they were setting the crop.  He did not do it. He left them there.  &ldquo;Walk it off the land,&rdquo; he said, and it walked off the land that year, for there were the biggest and the fattest rats that were ever seen around the country after they had been fattened on the oats that Mr. James Dillon, Minister for Agriculture, advised the Irish farmers to grow.</P>
    <P>What was the result?  A burnt child dreads the fire.  Very little oats were grown in the following year, and this Minister for Agriculture of ours went out to the Argentine and paid £26 10s. 0d. a ton there for oats and brought them in here.  I happened to see a sample of it and I was frightened. I inquired where they were getting that stuff and I was told that it was the oats that the Minister for Agriculture brought from the Argentine. I brought a sample of it here and if I had blown on it, it would have floated across to the opposite side of the House, it was so light&mdash;chaff.  It was just like the light dust or chaff that comes out in the blast when oats are threshed.  That is the kind of oats he bought.  It was a beauty.  This Minister, who refused to find a market for the Irish farmers' oats the year before, who has driven the farmer away from producing oats, went over to the foreigner with £26 10s. 0d. a ton of the Irish people's money to buy that muck and to bring it in here.</P>
    <P>He followed that up by going out to Iraq and there he purchased barley, if you please.  I showed it to Deputies in this House who said that I had mixed it.  In their presence I phoned the company who had brought it in and told them kindly to send over a couple of samples.  I was speaking to Deputy Hickey about it.  I brought Deputy Hickey along with me and collected the samples from the office, brought them into the Library and put them on the table.  &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; said Deputy Hickey, &ldquo;where did that stuff come from?&rdquo;  I told him: &ldquo;That is the stuff that you told me I had mixed.&rdquo;  The Minister takes that stuff and the Argentine oats out to the Irish farmer to feed the poor hen&mdash;no wonder she <Col N="892" /> lay dead after it&mdash;and to fatten the pig and the more the pig ate of it the more the hair stood on his back.  That was paid for by the Irish people's money. When he found that the cheapest stuff he could buy abroad would cost £30 a ton here, he followed that up with a rather contemptible pretence that he wanted the Irish farmer to grow feeding barley.</P>
    <P>Remember, he paid £26 10s. 0d. a ton for the mixture of rotten black oats, bad white oats and barley that must have been there since the day of the flood, and he came along this year, a couple of months ago, and told the Irish farmer:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Oh yes, I want 300,000 acres of feeding barley.  I shall pay you £10 10s. 0d. a ton less than I paid to Iraq for barley.  I want 300,000 acres of feeding barley at £16 a ton.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I happened to be one of a deputation who was sent to the Minister on that particular job also.  He paid me the tribute here the following day, together with a load of abuse, that owing to the argument I put up, he was increasing the price by £4 a ton.  It was a pretty good tribute.  I am prepared to give him a rattle and spend half an hour in his lovely company any time if I can get £4 a ton extra for the people I represent.  I shall put up with anything in that line.  There is no farmer growing barley to-day who does not know that the minimum price he will get for that barley will be £25 per ton.  Would the Minister be honest or be at least straight?  Will he not come along to the farmers and say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Look, you are not going to have any feeding stuffs next year.  That maize I promised you is all gone. You cannot get it.  It is not there and it will not be there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any man who knows the different belts in this country, knows that in one portion of a constituency or of a particular area, you have a body of small farmers who have no grain and in another side of the area you have a number of big farmers who are grain growers and who grow grain for sale. Knowing that position, and knowing that unless these farmers with the big <Col N="893" /> acreages grow barley, he will not have it anyway, will the Minister not come along and say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am paying £30 to the foreigner and it will probably be £35 next harvest, if I can get it at all and I am prepared to give you at least as much as I gave the foreigner last year, £26 a ton.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he would have some hope of getting the farmers to grow it.</P>
    <P>The next item that we put on the Minister's books is the position as regards wheat.  The price of wheat was fixed by the late Minister for Agriculture at 62/6 per barrel.</P>

That is the position which the Irish farmers are facing now and these are the inducements offered to them to grow crops&mdash; £28 15s. 0d. for malting barley&mdash;not fixed by the Minister, but fixed by the committee that frequently had to call on the Minister.</P>

I am giving that as an instance of the position of agricultural produce, the price of which is controlled by the Minister, namely, the price of wheat, the price of feeding barley, the price of milk and the price of eggs.  Those prices are fixed by the Minister for, as he will tell you, a profitable market.  The result is that last year you had an enormous reduction in the wheat acreage.  To-day you stand to lose further on the acreage of wheat, and the Minister and the Government stand coolly by and make no effort whatever to meet that situation, a situation in which we do not know the month when we shall be told by the countries from which we are importing grain: &ldquo;There is a grave danger that you will get no further grain.  We cannot give you any further supply.  It is your duty to produce it yourself.  Why do you not do it?&rdquo; That is the position as regards grain, and particularly wheat.  Deputy Keane was anxious to know the situation regarding malting barley.  I shall give it to him.</P>

      <P>The Chair will endeavour to give an opportunity to other Deputies to speak.  I am calling on Deputy Cowan because he was speaking when the House adjourned last Thursday.  He has already made a contribution of some 30 minutes or so to the debate, and I am hoping he will consider the rights of every other Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking in the debate on the Adjournment on Thursday last, I was arguing that the Minister for External Affairs was the nigger in the woodpile and that he had engaged in a conspiracy to destroy his Party colleague and fellow Minister, Deputy Dr. Browne.  I was arguing that the efforts which were being made to settle the difficulty that had arisen, and to preserve Deputy Dr. Browne's services, invaluable services, for the nation had been sabotaged by the action of the Minister for External Affairs in demanding the resignation of Deputy Dr. Browne from the Government before the Deputies forming and supporting the Government had an opportunity to settle the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that argument of mine that the Minister for External Affairs was engaged in a conspiracy against Deputy Dr. Browne has been established by the statement issued by the Standing Committee of Clann na Poblachta and published in the newspapers yesterday. That statement is signed by the Minister for External Affairs and 12 others. <Col N="896" /> I must, for the information of the House, read one paragraph from that statement.  I am quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the Deputy should read the statement in full if he purports to quote at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The events of the recent week have come as a severe shock to the rank and file of Clann na Poblachta and to the public.  To us, who are members of the Coiste Seasmhach of Clann, many of us since the foundation of the Party, and closely associated with developments, these events are only a step in a determined effort to wreck the Clann without regard to the effect on the national position.  Week by week, we have watched the development of these efforts and have striven to protect the Clann and the ideals for which it stands.  We merely succeeded in postponing the crisis which it was planned to create.  In our considered view, the issues selected were only incidental to the real objective, and were selected in order to seek public sympathy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement shows that there were personal differences between the leaders in Clann na Poblachta, and it is clear, from what has been said already elsewhere, that the Minister for External Affairs was violently opposed to Deputy Dr. Browne for personal reasons.  In the executive of Clann na Poblachta, Deputy Dr. Browne stood for honesty and the Minister for External Affairs stood for compromise, for surrender and for expediency.  In to-day's <i>Irish Times</i> there is a telegram handed in by Clann na Poblachta which bears out my argument and my contention.  The telegram is from the North Mayo Comhairle Ceanntair of Clann na Poblachta to the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. I have no desire to prevent the Deputy quoting this document.  I am glad that he is giving publicity to it, but I do suggest that it is hardly relevant <Col N="897" /> to this discussion and, therefore, not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that is really relevant is the statement that was made by Deputy Dr. Browne.  As to whether these matters arise from the statement that was made is one which the Chair will have to consider.  As far as the Chair can gather, some of the matters that are being quoted do not arise from the statement of Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway the telegram has a bearing on it.  It is very brief.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Special convened North Mayo Comhairle Ceanntair of Ballina unanimously affirm complete and unquestionable belief in Seán MacBride's leadership of Clann na Poblachta and repudiates wholeheartedly Dr. Browne's futile attempt at dictatorship.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Week by week the MacBride group in Clann na Poblachta had been preparing Deputy Dr. Browne's destruction, and the Minister for External Affairs conceived the idea of harnessing to his own side the opposition of the Irish Hierarchy to the mother and child scheme.  I am prepared to accept it that the Taoiseach and other Ministers were misled into the position of becoming active participators in that conspiracy against the popular, efficient and successful former Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me, from a perusal of the documents, that the letter of the 10th October, 1950, from the Irish Hierarchy did not come before the Government formally, or at all, although it was addressed to the Taoiseach as Head of the Government. It was given by the Taoiseach to Deputy Dr. Browne, and Deputy Dr. Browne, admittedly without delay, prepared a draft reply to be sent by the Taoiseach to His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin.  That reply or any reply was not sent by the Taoiseach to the Archbishop, and the draft reply was never before the Government or considered by the Government.  There is <Col N="898" /> a whole story of conflicting views as to whether Deputy Dr. Browne knew, or did not know, that the reply he drafted was not sent by the Taoiseach.  But these are minor matters, and depend on recollection which is notoriously unreliable.  It would be important, however, to know what reply Deputy Dr. Browne did draft.  This might have been given by the Taoiseach and placed on the records of the House.  One paragraph has been quoted by the Taoiseach and has been described by him as dodging the entire issue.  The House should have the draft so that it would know whether that description is a fair description of the reply which Deputy Dr. Browne drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not read the <i>Irish Times.</i>  It was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> and was handed to them by the former Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The documents made available suggest that Deputy Dr. Browne was of opinion that he had resolved the doubts of the Hierarchy, and the Government apparently were of the same opinion. Otherwise, how could financial provision be made for this scheme in the Estimate?  How, otherwise, could Deputy Dr. Browne have launched his extensive scheme of publicity? How, otherwise, could Deputy Dr. Browne have delivered his radio address on the scheme to the nation? Our Constitution provides for collective responsibility by the Government for the actions or inactions of Ministers.  In the matters that gave rise to this debate it would have been better if the Government, accepting responsibility for the situation that had arisen, had prevailed on the Minister for External Affairs to forget his hostility to Deputy Dr. Browne and to cease to harry their colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne, whose achievements as Minister for Health had contributed so much to the success of the Government and to the security of the Government and its Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disquieting feature of this sorry business is the revelation that the real government of the country may not, in fact, be exercised by the <Col N="899" /> elected representatives of the people as we believed it was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but by the Bishops, meeting secretly and enforcing their rule by means of private interviews with Ministers and by documents of a secret and confidential nature sent by them to Ministers and to the Head of the alleged Government of the State.  As a Catholic, I object to this usurpation of authority of the Government by the Bishops. As a Catholic, I protest against this secretive, occult and objectionable practice.  As a Dáil Deputy, I am entitled to know all the factors that enter into the consideration of legislation, the enactment of which is part of my duty.  The people I represent, the majority of them Catholics, are entitled to be similarly informed.  It is wrong, morally wrong, for the Bishops to keep them and me in the dark and to exercise control in civil affairs behind their and my back in regard to matters to which they as citizens and I as their representative have express authority under the Constitution of this country to deal with.  That control was exercised by the Bishops over the Government, and that control was accepted and tolerated by the Government without the knowledge of Dáil Éireann or of the people, and the public has been shocked by the revelation that that has been the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of the people in this State are Catholics; the majority of the elected representatives of the people are Catholics.  The Catholic Hierarchy are entitled to express their views on all matters of public welfare, as are the clergy of all denominations. Such views do and must commend respect, but they ought to be and they must be expressed in public so that they may be known to every citizen of the State.  As a Parliament, we would be failing in our duty if we did not insist on this.  If we do not, our democracy is a fraud, our Constitution a sham, and our general elections humbug, <Col N="900" /> pretence and swindle.  I may be the only Deputy who will speak thus openly but, let no one deceive himself, the sentiments I express are shared by the majority of intelligent Deputies. They are shared, too, by the majority of citizens of every religious denomination. They convey a warning that cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>We are aware from the correspondence of the following facts.  The question of the mother and child scheme was specially placed on a heavy agenda for the Bishops' meeting at short notice.  It was considered by the Standing Committee of the Bishops on the 3rd of this month and by a general meeting of the Archbishops and Bishops on the 4th of this month.  On the 5th of this month, His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin handed the Taoiseach the declaration that the mother and child scheme was opposed or contrary to Catholic social teaching. It will be noted from the correspondence that Deputy Dr. Browne specifically asked the Taoiseach to say whether his scheme was opposed to Catholic moral teaching; he did not ask whether it was opposed to Catholic social teaching.  But the decision of the Bishops was stated to be based on social teaching and not on moral teaching.</P>

    <P>I have carefully read the letter sent by the Hierarchy to the Taoiseach on the 10th October, 1950, and also the letter sent by the Hierarchy to the Taoiseach on the 5th April, 1951.  The outstanding objections of the Hierarchy may be taken as an objection to the provision of a free for all mother and child scheme.  In setting down their objections, the Bishops trespass on the domain and seek to usurp the powers <Col N="901" /> of the legitimate civil authority.  In so doing, they act contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of this country.</P>

      <P>The Bishops deal with State taxation, which is a matter for this House and this House alone. They give views on facts, express prophetic opinions and seek to determine the meaning of, or the inferences to be drawn from, a statute.  These are matters, as any student of moral theology knows, that are not within the definition of Catholic doctrine on which the Bishops may speak with authority to Catholics.  The views and opinions of the Bishops also conflict with the opinions promulgated by distinguished Catholic priests who are acknowledged authorities on Catholic social teaching.  On this particular subject, &ldquo;Social Security in Relation to Health&rdquo;, a most informative lecture was delivered by Father Augustino Gemelli, O.F.M., President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and Rector of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Milan.  It was delivered before the National Conference on Social Security organised at Bologna by the Italian Catholic Action in September, 1949.  Father Gemelli is a distinguished man of science; he enjoys the closest confidence of the Holy See.  He is founder of and Rector of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Milan, and Professor of Applied Psychology there.  He was an intimate friend of the late Holy Father, Pius XI, who appointed him President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Vatican City.  Any pronouncement by this high authority may be safely regarded as expressing the mind of the Vatican.</P>
      <P>Father Gemelli deals with the relation of public medical services to the systems of social security which have developed in various countries since World War II.  He particularly examines the British national health service which he praises as &ldquo;the closest approach yet made to the ideal system&rdquo;.  Answering the charge that the English system amounts to nationalisation or statism, he replies:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" />&ldquo;The charge cannot be sustained inasmuch as liberty for voluntary medical assistance is guaranteed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And liberty for voluntary medical assistance is guaranteed in the scheme which Deputy Dr. Noel Browne formulated. In reply to the contention of some elements of private enterprise in medicine that the provision of free medical services by the State is contrary to ethics, he says that in his opinion &ldquo;these persons derive their views from the individualistic tradition of the nineteenth century&rdquo;.  In fact, he affirms that orthodoxy is on the side of State medicine.  He describes the medical profession as one organ in the Mystical Body, having as its moral duty to give its best services to the whole Body.  That eminent authority takes a line entirely opposed to the line taken by the Hierarchy of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As a Catholic, I am entitled to accept that authority on social teaching and I do accept him.  I think we ought to be clear in our minds on the issues that arise chiefly because of the statements that have been made here by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for External Affairs in regard to their position as Ministers of the Government when they receive a direction from the Irish Hierarchy on a matter which is not one of Catholic doctrine.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to quote at length from this lecture.  I do not propose to quote, in fact, more than a couple of lines.  A substantial part of this lecture was published in the Catholic Herald on October 14th, 1949.  According to that report, Father Gemelli says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the face of disease all members of the community have equal rights because health is not only an individual good but a common good.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He concludes his address by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Catholic Italy should emulate and improve upon the British system of health service.  Catholic Italy in this field of social reform has a duty to do at least as much as Protestant and Labour Britain has already done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He deals with the duty of doctors.  I shall leave that to the doctors.  They <Col N="903" /> can study the lecture given by this authority for themselves.  He does say: &ldquo;A severe judgment must be passed on the tendency which developed in the medical profession in the 19th century and later days&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, the tendency of making fortunes out of the disease of members of the community. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we recognise that the sick person has a soul and a body, we are logically led to see in him one of our brethren, a member of the same Mystical Body, a man towards whom we extend the hand of help in the name of the rest of the brethren of the same family.  Rich and poor must be convinced that in the face of sickness and disease all men are equal, all have the same rights.  On entering hospital every patient ought to receive that which he requires, irrespective of social or economic condition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He indicates that as the basic lines of reform in order to give every man social security in the field of health. &ldquo;All men are equal in face of illness&rdquo; and &ldquo;all have the same right to necessary means to protect health; all men have the same right to measures of prevention&rdquo; and again &ldquo;the function of the doctor must become a function of the service of the entire social community.&rdquo;  I do not think I need read any more extracts from that lecture.  I would wish that that lecture would be read by every Deputy and by many people outside the House since it lays down specifically the principles which the President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences believes should be considered in determining a matter such as we have before us to-day.</P>
    <P>Realising that, despite the provisions of the Constitution, the Government feels bound, as a Government, on the declaration of the Irish Hierarchy to introduce a means test, the Minister for External Affairs has suggested that by providing for the free treatment of persons whose means might not&mdash;and this was the example he gave&mdash;exceed £700 a year, that would be in accordance with the decision of the Bishops as communicated to the <Col N="904" /> Taoiseach.  I would ask the Government and the Minister for External Affairs, in particular, to read very carefully the declaration which they received from the Bishops because, within that declaration, the Government is not entitled to provide a limit of £700 a year, or £600 or £500 as the limit of income below which a free mother and child scheme will be available.  That is perfectly clear from what the Bishops say. Therefore, the Government has not settled the issue by throwing out Deputy Dr. Browne and saying they were going to adopt a line of £500, £600 or £700 income below which they can give this mother and child scheme free.  The Bishops say that they cannot do it, if the person is able to pay for the service.  If the Government follows the declarations of the Bishops, they must continue the disgusting means test, to which they as well as I and everybody in this House take exception.</P>
    <P>It is a singular fact that when the Act which gave rise to this scheme was being piloted through this House, Deputy Dr. Ryan, who was the Minister piloting it through, said on a number of occasions that this was to be a free scheme.  That was the clear declaration made by him here in 1947, four years ago, that it was to be a free scheme.  Deputy Dr. Noel Browne, as Minister for Health, must have studied the debates of that time and must have been satisfied that it was the general intention of the House that the scheme would be free and without a means test.  The only Deputy that I can find who suggested that it should not be free, that it should be on a contributory basis, is Deputy Davin.  Apart from that, everybody accepted the principle that it was a free scheme, to apply to all. That was the decision of the House in 1947, and it is in the legislation in the Health Act of 1947.</P>
    <P>I think the Ministers are stirring up a tremendous lot of trouble for themselves if they say they intend to have a means test, and the declaration of the Minister for External Affairs the other day, that no person would be deprived of skilled medical attention <Col N="905" /> under the mother and child welfare scheme through lack of means, envisages a means test of some kind. It is something contrary to the declared, in fact the unanimous, decision of this House in 1947.  Are we, with a progressive Government, to go back to the reactionary ideas of the old means test, when no Party in this House supports the means test?  No Party that I know of outside the House approves of the means test, but still apparently we are to be driven into it because the Bishops say that we must have a means test.</P>
    <P>Let me take the argument of the Bishops on its highest level.  If it is contrary to Catholic social teaching to provide a free mother and child health scheme for people whose income is below £500, apparently, on the interpretation of the Minister for External Affairs, do you offend Catholic social teaching if you give the benefits of a free mother and child scheme to a person who has an income of £501?  That is the issue.  Stop where you like.  I assert categorically that there is no conflict with Catholic social teaching in the provision of a free for all mother and child scheme and I say that, if the Government accept the dictation of the Bishops in this matter, then they are flaunting the Constitution of this country and they are acting contrary to their duty as representatives of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had little intention of intervening in this question last week, except as a result of statements made by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for External Affairs, and an odd interruption by Deputy Con Lehane.  I view this whole situation with disgust.  People of all classes and creeds, of all political affiliations, for and against the Government, view this situation with disgust.  Something has happened here in this country and in this Parliament that should never have happened, that could have been avoided by calm, cool senses, by a little more recourse to the table conference and by a little more give and take.  In the hearts of Irishmen, and even in the hearts and minds of members of our Government and members of this House, there is still the old fight and <Col N="906" /> the old inclination to grab and to look for Party power, to say: &ldquo;Who is the big man of this Party and who is the big man of the other Party; who is the white-haired boy of this group and who is the white-haired boy of the other?&rdquo; If one is advancing in leaps and bounds, through jealousy every attempt is made to drag him down.  Until that jealousy leaves the hearts of public representatives, you will have men making strenuous efforts, genuine and sincere efforts, to advance the interests of the sections and classes whom they may have the honour to represent in this House, but because of petty jealousies they will be dragged down and trampled on by their own colleagues.</P>
      <P>It is not many years since I found myself held up to public ridicule in this State, and there still remain doubts in the minds of certain people as to who was right and who was wrong on that occasion.  I can understand how Deputy Dr. Noel Browne feels.  I can understand the manner in which he must have felt when he saw that he was reneged by his colleagues.  He probably felt exactly the same way I felt when I read the report of a certain tribunal which held me up to public exhibition in this State only three or four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a man is up, he has many friends and great friends; when he is down his friends are few and far between; and when Deputy Dr. Browne was, if he was, guilty of an alleged offence, every effort was made by his colleagues to throw cold water on it.  When I was listening to the Minister for External Affairs, his near and dear friend and his Party colleague, numbering his bones on Thursday night last, I was wondering, and I have been wondering since, whether there is any decency left in public life, even at this late stage. Listening to the Minister for External Affairs and to the Taoiseach, I have asked myself did Deputy Dr. Browne, as Minister for Health, do any good act in his three years as Minister for Health.  To listen to the statements and the speeches that were made against him he was termed, as I have often been and others in this House have been termed, as being young and <Col N="907" /> irresponsible.  Is that a crime?  Is that a charge?  He was young and irresponsible, unfit to occupy a ministerial post.  He should have never been in the Cabinet.  We have heard all this.  There was no one like Deputy Dr. Browne.  He was the white-haired boy of the present Government for the first, second and third year of office.  For the last three weeks or a month he has been styled and termed as a criminal as far as public life in this country is concerned. Unfit to occupy a ministerial post. Reasons, irresponsible, young, no experience. Surely it cannot be forgotten that every Minister of the Government and every Deputy who stands by the Government took great pride and delight and were charmed at every available opportunity in making it known to their constituents that the one, real, live-wire Minister we had in the Government was Deputy Dr. Browne.  The Clann na Poblachta Party, on every occasion, boasted of their contribution to the Government, and rightly so, that Deputy Dr. Browne had the good wishes and the prayers of the many of those who were unfortunate to have to lie for weeks, months and years on their backs suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I know something about tuberculosis, probably a little more than many more fortunate members of this House know. I know and realise, from my own experience and from my contact with the various tuberculosis institutions and with some of the greatest medical authorities on tuberculosis, that not alone was Deputy Dr. Browne the best Minister for Health this country had, but the best Minister for Health in any Government in Europe.  No Minister ever did more for the unfortunate people suffering from tuberculosis, a disease the treatment for which involves lying in bed months and probably years.  Whoever cared, thought, worked, slaved and sacrificed his own health for them but Deputy Dr. Browne?  What thanks did he get?  He was irresponsible.  He was no use.  He did nothing right.  He could not be handled.  He could not be managed. Kick him out and when he is down kick him down and blacken him with <Col N="908" /> the general public.  That is what we have experience of.</P>
    <P>I have often said&mdash;I have often said it in my constituency&mdash;that if there is one life the people should avoid it is public life.  Every Deputy knows and realises that those for whom they work the hardest will be the first to show ingratitude.  The people of this country never showed ingratitude to Deputy Dr. Browne because they never got an opportunity of expressing appreciation of the work that he did but they will get that opportunity and as clearly as they showed it with my attempts three years ago, they will show it with Deputy Dr. Browne's attempts at the first available opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Government did great work and magnificent work.  It was a Government with which I was mighty proud to be associated.  From evidence of the past week the odour is getting stronger in my nostrils every day I walk into this House.  Deputy Dr. Browne could not be blacker in the eyes of the men who up to recently were praising and defending him than he has been branded.  Is there any Deputy in this House who can honestly stand up and tell us that while he was Minister for Health Deputy Dr. Browne ever displayed discourtesy or that he ever displayed any act of refusal to co-operate or to entertain the views of any Deputy that ever approached him?  Could anybody imagine that Deputy Dr. Browne could be the impudent, insulting, offensive being that we are told he is?  Did any Deputy ever approach him that he slapped the door in his teeth or that he refused to listen to him?  Is there any local authority that he refused at least to consider the representations that were put up to him? Is there any Minister who was as little criticised by the Opposition as Deputy Dr. Browne?  Members of the Opposition knew that he was a decent man; that he had no Party politics whatever; and that he was out in the interests of the health of this country and doing a good job, a job he could leave behind him completed in the form of a healthy nation.  Deputy Dr. Browne was anxious that he should leave a healthy nation behind him when he was leaving his high office as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> Had we a Minister for Health before who ever went to the trouble of visiting practically every county home in the country and shaking the hand of and interviewing every person whom he styled as a pauper in this country?  Did any Minister for Health ever take up the cudgels and say: &ldquo;Take off the paper's uniform and the pauper's dress.  Dress like the ordinary rank and file&rdquo;?  Deputy Dr. Browne did. Is there any Minister for Health that we ever had who condemned county homes as unfit dives for the old people and aged and those who are homeless to end their last days before they should go to their eternal reward? Deputy Dr. Browne did more than a man's part in that direction and a good display of gratitude by his colleagues was given to him.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that, when he was Minister for Health, his first and his one and only interest was in preserving the health of everyone in this country who was fortunate enough to have his health.  For those who were deprived of the great gift of health Deputy Dr. Browne did everything he could do to have it restored.  How many are now cured of tuberculosis because they got beds and proper treatment as a result of Deputy Dr. Browne's sanatorium policy and of the manner in which he brought in every suspect of tuberculosis and saw to it that treatment was given?  His successor will never stand five minutes in his shoes, because Deputy Dr. Browne never can have a successor.  There was only one Dr. Browne as Minister for Health and there will never be another.  The Minister for External Affairs has killed the goose that laid the golden egg.  He knows that now.  The Government realise it and Deputy Dr. Browne's colleagues in the Cabinet know that he was a good man.</P>
    <P>But there were more reasons for his removal than the mother and child scheme.  There was something else. He was too powerful; he was too popular; he was achieving results.  I claim one-seventy-sixth part of the responsibility for Dr. Browne becoming Minister for Health and I stand over that fraction of responsibility.  If I had my choice-not interfering in what we <Col N="910" /> know is a family dispute within the ranks of Clann na Poblachta&mdash;I should feel a happier man, having had a hand in the manufacture of this Government, if I saw the Minister for External Affairs gone and Deputy Dr. Browne there, because the Minister for External Affairs has his heart in Paris, his notebook in Strasbourg, his ambitions in Washington and his intentions in the United States, but Deputy Dr. Browne's body and soul and ambitions lie in the sick beds of the poor of this country, and that cannot be forgotten.  What loss would the Minister for External Affairs be, if he were gone in the morning from this Cabinet?  Would it not be a saving for the taxpayers of the country?  Let him forget Partition and let us all forget Partition as a result of this unfortunate incident, because reading the <i>Northern Whig</i> we know the propaganda that has been made in the north out of this tragic episode.</P>
    <P>With regard to the mother and child scheme, Dr. Browne has made his case.  We are told by Deputy Cowan that it was to be a scheme without any means test.  I stand in this House to-day and will stand here in the years to come, without the slightest shadow of doubt, and I favour a scheme without a means test, because the Labour Party in this House, under the able leadership of the Tánaiste, has for years advocated, and rightly so, that the means test should be abolished in respect of old age pensions.  Fianna Fail saw fit to give no consideration to a means test when introducing the children's allowances.  Did anything extraordinary happen as a result of having no means test in the case of children's allowances?  The then Government pleased some and displeased others, but no matter what you do in this country, you cannot please everyone.  You are foolish to think of it or to try it on, and any Government which tries to please all the people is doomed to disaster.  It cannot be done and it never will be done.</P>
    <P>As I say, I favour a mother and child scheme without a means test.  I do not care who is for it or against it. As I say that there should be no means test in respect of old age pensions and <Col N="911" /> agree that there should be no means test in respect of children's allowances, I say now that there should be no means test associated with any mother and child scheme which the Taoiseach or the Government may have in mind.  I will vote against any such scheme which will have attached to it a means test.  Did you ever think of the fact that, if there is such a means test, a person like a sergeant in the Guards would be deprived of the benefits of the scheme, that probably a member of this House would be deprived of its benefits, and that there are large sections of the people who are paying big doctors' bills, or, I should say, doctors' big bills, who can ill afford to pay them?  I listened to the Taoiseach praising the doctors and the doctors' association.  They did good work, but they are not all angels and far from being all angels.  There is no section that will fleece you as quickly as the medical profession if they get the chance, and they get that chance where the money is.  I am sorry to say that the same care and attention is not always given where the money is not.  I suppose there are black sheep in every flock.  There are good men in that profession, but they are not all what the Taoiseach or the Minister for External Affairs said.</P>

      <P>And there was not enough hot air for the playing of any more instruments in the band.  We have seen and read that in any European country, where there was a conflict between Church and State, it was doomed to disaster, and as surely as any Government disrespects the wishes of the Hierarchy be it here or in any other country, it will be doomed. There is always the conference table however, and what grander conference table could there be than one around which the representatives of Church and State will sit to arrive at decisions satisfactory to both Church and State and in the best interests of the community as a whole?  I say, without any fear of contradiction, that this disastrous state of affairs could have been settled up and cleaned up.  I say that there was no need whatever for the publicity which this matter has got in every paper that could hold print &mdash;and for the misrepresentation which it has received from sources unfavourable to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I want cleared up.  There is one point that this country wants cleared up.  There is one point that the House would be very pleased to see cleared up and one point that in particular I should like to see cleared up if I am going to remain a supporter of the present Government.  A letter which was written by Deputy Dr. Browne to the Minister for External Affairs has been given very great publicity&mdash;and similar publicity has been given to the rest of the correspondence which has been released in this unfortunate connection. <Col N="913" /> In that letter which was written by Deputy Dr. Browne to the Minister for External Affairs there are extraordinary disclosures.  Whom are we to believe&mdash;the Minister for External Affairs, if he has an explanation, or Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;because for the past three years they have been close colleagues, members of the one Government, working under the one leader and sitting around the same conference table?  Each Minister shares the responsibility of his colleagues' troubles.  We were told that the Cabinet was a happy family. We were told that the Taoiseach, as the father of that happy family, was always proud to defend all his colleagues.  We were told that the Taoiseach never worked with a greater team, that he had never seen such teamwork as that of the past three years.  I wonder if the teamwork was similar to that of tug-of-war &mdash;one bunch pulling this way and another bunch pulling the other way. When friends are friends they are great friends, but when friends become enemies they become bitter enemies. Great publication and publicity and discussion have resulted from the publication of the letter from Deputy Dr. Browne to the Minister for External Affairs.  May I say, at this stage, that the Minister for External Affairs is as good a friend of mine as is Deputy Dr. Browne, or the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach.  They all appear in the same light to me.  I am not under a compliment to any one of them, either collectively or individually.  That is the very reason why I can stand up now in this House and ask questions and endeavour to clear up a statement that has been made by Deputy Dr. Browne as a Minister.  When the letter in question was written Deputy Dr. Browne was a Minister, and in that letter he referred to another colleague who is a Minister.  In his letter he refers to the letter which he has received from the Minister for External Affairs and he states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your letter is a model of the two-faced hypocrisy and humbug so characteristic of you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Am I to believe that the Minister for External Affairs is a hypocrite and that humbug is the principal plan of <Col N="914" /> his policy in his Department?  That, however, is not the most serious part of the letter.  Deputy Dr. Browne goes on to refer to the charges that were made against him by the Minister for External Affairs.  Probably one of the charges which has resulted in his not being Minister for Health to-day is the charge which I quote here, the charge that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... amongst other charges of my political inexperience, I had allowed myself to be photographed with the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a serious charge, in the opinion of the Minister for External Affairs, that his colleague should have allowed himself to be photographed with the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin&mdash;and it was no charge at all for the Minister for External Affairs to be photographed with Mrs. Attlee's dog.  It was a serious crime.  It was an unpardonable offence.  It spelt disaster for Deputy Dr. Browne, as Minister, to be photographed with one of the heads of the Protestant Church in this country.</P>
    <P>On more than one occasion the Minister for External Affairs has condemned religious bigotry in this country and elsewhere.  Publicly and openly, religious bigotry is condemned by the Minister for External Affairs&mdash; but woe to the member of his Party who sits at the table with a Protestant or who is photographed with the Protestant Archbishop.  Deputy Dr. Browne's bones were torn asunder because he was photographed with the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin. Well that is worth very little comment because the statesman or the narrowminded creature who would even pass the least comment on a matter of that kind does not deserve to have his name mentioned.  Do we not represent the minority in this House as well as the majority?  Is it a crime to be a Protestant in this country?  Great men are Protestants.  Wolfe Tone was a Protestant. Why should this ever have arisen?  What concern was it of the Minister for External Affairs who Deputy Dr. Browne was photographed with, either in the discharge of his own duties or in the discharge of his duties as Minister for Health?  Deputy Dr. Browne further continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" />&ldquo;It is my fervent hope that the destiny of this country will never be fully placed in your hands because it would, in my view, mean the destruction of all those ideals which are part and parcel of Christian democracy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When a colleague of the Minister for External Affairs wrote that of him, what would we expect to be written by opponents?</P>
    <P>All those sections of that letter, however, fade into pale insignificance compared with the following paragraph. Deputy Dr. Browne writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Again may I comment on your reference to that high standard of conduct which is required in Government? Inside the Cabinet and outside, in conversations with you I have protested against the making of appointments on a corrupt basis and against other irregularities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does Dáil Éireann realise the seriousness and importance of this statement written publicly by a Minister concerning another Minister&mdash;and he was Minister when Deputy Dr. Browne wrote this?  Am I to understand that, in the third year and third month of the present Government, the saviour of this country from corruption and bribery, the man who was going to plant the seeds of political honour and decency in this country has allowed those seeds to fall among thistles or upon the rocks and that appointments have been made in the Government in a manner other than the correct one?</P>
    <P>I spoke with the Taoiseach in Mullingar, Cork and two or three other places.  One of the lines I went on was that we could give thanks to God that the days of corrupt appointments were over, that we had a Government where merit and merit alone came first, where no consideration was given to political affiliations or political outlook, where a man got a job because he was worth a job not because he knew Deputy so and so or because he was a personal friend of this Minister, that Minister or the other Minister.  Have we now learned to our regret that this was the humbug and hypocrisy about which Deputy Dr. Browne writes and that appointments <Col N="916" /> have been made irregularly and through corrupt practices?</P>
    <P>May I ask the Tánaiste&mdash;and the Tánaiste is the most honourable, straightforward and decent man in that Government to-day&mdash;may I ask him to ask the Taoiseach to give us an inquiry into this allegation that appointments have not been made according to merit?</P>
    <P>I view with grave alarm this section of Deputy Dr. Browne's letter.  If that letter came from a Deputy I would probably view it with suspicion or a small shadow of doubt, but a letter coming from a Party colleague and a Cabinet colleague of the Minister for External Affairs is something which I am prepared to view with horror, disgust and grave suspicion.  I am prepared to keep that horror, disgust and suspicion in my mind until someone states that no appointments were made by the Cabinet or by the Minister for External Affairs except in accordance with the proper practice of appointment on merit.</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne writes further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have to-day sent to the General Secretary my resignation from the Clann na Poblachta Party&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is nothing to do with us, but he goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have bidden farewell to your unwholesome brand of politics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He has bidden farewell to the Minister for External Affairs' unwholesome brand of politics.  I wonder what he really means by that?  I wonder is it what I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Within the closed doors of Clann na Poblachta Deputy Dr. Browne must have had a horrid experience, a sad experience and a dangerous experience.  To-day he should be expressing his thanks to the Almighty at finding himself free from those experiences he has had to endure within that Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope and trust in all sincerity that the Minister for External Affairs will <Col N="917" /> find it possible at least to endeavour to clear the suspicions and doubts that are disturbing the mind of the whole country to-night.  I do not say that he will banish the doubts from my mind, because I may know the Minister better than the general public.</P>

      <P>The magnificent work done by the present Government has been undermined by this unfortunate incident and the real good has been taken out of the Tánaiste's Social Welfare Bill.  I am sorry that this unfortunate state of affairs has come about.  Although the Fianna Fáil element may sit silent, although they may listen, learn and smile, I am of the opinion that we will have inter-Party Government for many a long day.  This is only the first obstacle to the inter-Party Government and we will probably have more because we are going to have more inter-Party Governments.  I think that the Taoiseach should give serious consideration to testing the feelings of the people on the whole issue.  What have the Government to be afraid of?  Why should they be afraid of a general election?</P>

      <P>I believe that on an occasion such as this, where we have such a difference of opinion, where we have Deputy Dr. Browne making such alarming disclosures, the Taoiseach should go to the country with the least possible delay.  If there is nothing to be afraid of, why not go and chance it?  What have we to lose, if we are going to win?  What have we to lose? I recommend that course, and I ask the Minister for External Affairs and his colleagues in the Cabinet, as I have been pressing them for the past three months, to go to the country. They do not seem inclined to go.</P>
      <P>Is there anything that warrants a call to the country more than this issue does?  I am not afraid to face my constituents on the mother and child welfare scheme, free for all and no means test, and I will come back to this House on that&mdash;there is not the least shadow of doubt in the wide world in that respect.  Why do the Government not do likewise?  They probably have a reason, they probably have a motive, in not going to the country.  I say as a Deputy who supports them as one who was present at the birth of the inter-Party Government, as one of its sponsors, that there should be no further time lost discussing the Dr. Browne&mdash;Minister for External Affairs crux in this House.  I say that the Taoiseach should go to Arus an Uachtaráin with the same speed as his predecessor, Deputy de Valera, went a few years ago, and he should ask that Parliament be dissolved and that we be given an opportunity to consult the people on the whole policy of the Government.  Now, when the election would be over, I would again be prepared to support an inter-Party Government, and no other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> Why not give the people an opportunity of saying: &ldquo;Get out&rdquo; or &ldquo;You brave boys, carry on the good work; you are doing it magnificently.&rdquo;  But, consult the people at any rate.  They are the masters.  They have sent us here to do a job and if there are any doubts in our minds as to whether we are doing that job rightly or wrongly, we should consult our masters, the people, and let them decide.  I make that appeal, not certainly out of love of Fianna Fáil&mdash;and everyone knows that.  I make that appeal sincerely because I believe it is high time that we should consult the people and get a proper mandate to continue the work we have been doing and get their approval for the schemes we have introduced and their approval, also, for the many beneficial schemes that are to come.</P>
    <P>We will be faced with appeals and calls and catch-cries from the Opposition every day to go to the people whenever we introduce a measure that we consider is of importance.  Let us face it and get it over.  If the people do not want us, good and well.  If the people sow nettles they cannot expect roses to grow.  Give them the type of Government they want.  For that reason, I think the people should be consulted with every possible speed.</P>
    <P>Before I resume my seat, might I warn the Taoiseach that when he undertakes the difficult task of appointing a Minister for Health, he will have some funny people to please?  If he is wise, he will hold on to that Department, because the moment he starts to appoint a Minister for Health I, as one Independent Deputy, will vote against the appointment of any emergency man, if I may style him as such.  We who are so much associated with land division are aware that there is a citizen who steps in to fill a gap and he is called an emergency man.  I will vote against any emergency man who makes an attempt to step into Deputy Dr. Browne's shoes, because I am not satisfied that Deputy Dr. Browne got a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>Again, if the Taoiseach is of opinion that he can carry on as Minister for <Col N="920" /> Health and have no critical division on the appointment of a new Minister, he will have a further obstacle in three weeks' time or a month when the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs comes up.  I am one Independent Deputy who will vote against it with all my might, because I think that the Department of External Affairs has gone wild, mad, crazy, sending the Minister to the four corners of the world when he should be in Dublin doing a job for his constituents and for the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Government are not beaten to-day they will be beaten to-morrow and they might as well face the music now as later on.  I am speaking as one of those who will be with them in the election and with them when they return.  I have always been a believer in real democracy and I am in favour of consulting the people when I believe the people should be consulted.  For that reason, I make that appeal.  I further believe that when the Minister for External Affairs presents his Estimate to this House, Fianna Fáil will, according to nature, oppose the Minister's Estimate, and voting on his Estimate will be several Independent Deputies who will likewise oppose it, and I am now prophesying that that Estimate will not pass this House.  For that reason, before it comes, let us be prepared.  Let us know where we stand.</P>
    <P>We are displeased and disgusted with the manner in which this whole affair has been handled.  I do not profess to be a very influential Deputy in this House.  Far from it.  But, I do say that there is not the slightest shadow of doubt in my mind that two other Deputies and myself would have settled the whole unfortunate Dr. Browne dispute in 24 hours around a conference table, if the Minister for External Affairs had kept his nose out of it.  I am satisfied and quite satisfied of that.  I am making that statement in the knowledge of the other Independent Deputies who were endeavouring to bridge that serious gap.  I believe that, if we had got time&mdash;and all we wanted was time&mdash;the whole country <Col N="921" /> would have been saved and both Church and State would have been saved severe criticism from opponents both of Church and State throughout the 32 Counties.  It was a hasty decision. It was a mistake.  It was a tragedy.  It was a disaster.  It was a huge blunder.  I am sorry that, because of the blunder of one man, the prestige of his other eleven friends in the Cabinet must go down along with him.  I am sorry for that.  I am sorry, because there are fine men in the Government and a fine leader.  I am sorry that should happen because of the attempt to grab Party power and to oust the white-haired boy who was getting too popular, doing too fine work, that was a credit to the whole nation, who was of European fame in his attempts to improve the health of the nation.  It was going too well and too good and the Minister for External Affairs' achievements at the end would have faded out completely in comparison with the wonderful achievements of his bright and brilliant young colleague, the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Remember, the best judges are the people and I have no doubt whatever that, when an election takes place, Deputy Dr. Browne will get a vote in his constituency that will stun this country, and it will be from the plain ordinary people, the people who are anxious to benefit, the people who have benefited by his work and his schemes and by the good work he was doing and the achievements that were a credit to him for the past three years.</P>
    <P>It has happened now and there is nothing we can do about it.  It was a sad and unfortunate incident, an incident that never should have taken place, an incident which I and my other colleagues could have settled and fixed to the satisfaction of Church and State but we did not get the chance because, at all costs, the Minister for Health must go.</P>
    <P>There is only one way, in my opinion, that the whole thing can be properly adjusted.  Test the people and I will guarantee that there are a few on the front bench of the present Government who will go more quickly and more speedily than Deputy Dr. Nöel Browne. His work will live on.  After his three years, he is leaving behind a glorious <Col N="922" /> monument.  He is leaving behind him a monument of live men who, but for him, would be dead and in their graves and in their coffins and under their tombstones to-day, as a result of tuberculosis. They are well and hardy to-day because of his attempts and because he gave them beds when they needed beds and the attention that they needed.  Now they are well and strong. What other Deputy, what other Minister, can safely say that he was a life-saver? There was never such a life-saver in this country as Dr. Browne. Thank God, he is now left the happy mind and the happy memory that, while his friends may renege him and while people may believe in him or may doubt him&mdash;and there will always be doubt in the minds of people, because everyone is not of the same opinion&mdash;he has left a great volume of useful work done, that he has served Ireland, that he has served the country, that he has served nobly the people of Dublin who sent him to this House.  Above all, he can proudly say that, as a result of his efforts, there are hundreds walking around to-day in their health who would be dead and gone only for his administration in the Department of Health and the hundreds who are at present lying in the various sanatoria can safely say: &ldquo;Dr. Browne has provided us with this accommodation.  We thank him for it and we ask God that the years that are ahead of him in public life may be crowned with success and the good luck which he rightly and richly deserves.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is not surprising that, in a situation such as that in which the Clann na Poblachta Party and Seán MacBride, their leader, find themselves, that situation would be availed of, and availed of to the fullest possible extent, by Deputies in the House, who have, for real or imaginary reasons, feelings of the bitterest and most vindictive malice against the Minister for External Affairs and against this Party.  I want to charge, as unequivocally as I can, against Deputy Peadar Cowan and against Deputy Oliver Flanagan that, with a complete disregard for the truth, in a most <Col N="923" /> irresponsible and vindictive manner, they utilised this House and the time of this House for giving vent to their unnatural and envenomed spleen.</P>
      <P>I enjoy Deputy Flanagan.  I always enjoy a good actor, a good mountebank. I enjoyed his performance this evening.  As a display of histrionics, it was a remarkable effort but, as a serious contribution to the situation which this House is discussing, it was worse than valueless.  Of what was the rodomontade composed, to which this irresponsible Deputy&mdash;and known nationally to be irresponsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Of what was this rodomontade composed?  It was composed, in the first place, of a denial that Dr. Browne was a scoundrel and a defence of Dr. Browne in respect of charges which had never been made against him.  It was a denial that Dr. Browne was a number of things which he had never been alleged to be.  If I am wrong on that, I ask any Deputy &mdash;I particularly invite Deputy Flanagan&mdash;to consult the shorthand note of the speech made by him and then to consult the shorthand note of the speeches made by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for External Affairs, and I invite him to show me, or to show this House, the language or the references in those speeches which he purported to reject, which he purported to repudiate and in respect of which he treated this House to a display of feigned indignation, malice&mdash; obvious bitter, personal malice&mdash; directed against the Minister for External Affairs and directed against this Party.  I am not even aware of the reasons for it, but what I do know is that it has been obvious for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably any Deputy in this House, or any Minister who is not prepared to accept Deputy Oliver Flanagan as a paragon of all the virtues and as a respository of all the wisdom, intelligence and reason in this House and who may be audacious enough to have the view that sometimes Deputy Flanagan is a cheeky little boy, must <Col N="924" /> apparently prepare himself for a similar flow of envenomed bitterness such as that to which we were treated this evening.  I am sorry, and I regret that I have had to speak in such terms of Deputy Oliver Flanagan's contribution to this debate but, listening to him, I felt he was so transparently dishonest and so obviously actuated by base, mean motives that this contribution must evoke from me condemnation in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

      <P>Deputy Flanagan was cuter and less honest than Deputy Cowan.  Deputy Peadar Cowan, whether one agrees with him or not, is a man of considerable moral courage. That is more than I can say for Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  Deputy Peadar Cowan, I am sorry to say, allowed personal bitterness against this Party and against the Minister for External Affairs to influence the whole of his speech.  I think in Deputy Cowan's case it was a pity that happened because Deputy Cowan can make, and frequently does make, useful contributions to debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the relevance of ninetenths of the display of histrionics to which we have just been treated?  I do not wish to cast, and I am not to be taken as casting, any reflection on the Chair, but I do suggest that while it may have been strictly within the rules of order&mdash;I am sorry that Deputy Flanagan is leaving the House because I am not quite finished with him&mdash;his remarks bore no relevance to the question which we are discussing in this debate.  Stripped of its unessentials, what is the matter we are considering? We are considering the resignation of Deputy Dr. Noel Browne as Minister for Health and the reasons given by the former Minister for Health for the step which he took.  As I understand it, Deputy Dr. Browne made the case to this House that he was resigning because he had pledged himself to introduce a mother and child welfare scheme, free for all and without a means test, that the Hierarchy had expressed the view that such a scheme <Col N="925" /> was contrary to Catholic teaching and that he, as a Catholic, was not prepared to introduce a scheme of which the Hierarchy could not morally approve. If I am unfair to Deputy Dr. Browne in that, if I am not correctly summarising Deputy Dr. Browne's reasons, I am open to correction and will very readily correct any misstatement.</P>
    <P>Superimposed on these three reasons, or rather hung on these three reasons, was an attack on the Government as a whole and on the Minister for External Affairs.  The case made by Deputy Dr. Browne in this House, if I can understand plain English, was that vital knowledge was withheld from him and that because that vital knowledge was withheld he was so impeded and embarrassed in his discussions with the Hierarchy that he was unable to secure their assent to the type of scheme which he wished to introduce. On that question of whether or not that knowledge was so withheld from him, in my submission the whole case made by Deputy Dr. Browne must rest.  If Deputy Dr. Browne is correct in that statement, then I concede that to a large extent Deputy Dr. Browne has established his case against the Government.  I concede that and I concede it freely, but if it can be shown that what Deputy Dr. Browne stated with regard to the withholding of knowledge from him is demonstrably untrue, then the whole case made by Deputy Dr. Browne must fall to the ground.  Then this House must face the situation that the case made was made merely to give an opportunity to Deputies like the last Deputy who spoke, to Deputy Cowan and to Deputy Dr. Browne himself to make these bitter personal attacks on the leader of Clann na Poblachta, the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is in this correspondence evidence that the case made by Deputy Dr. Browne was not a correct and truthful case.  I might here, perhaps, refer to the correspondence, but not strictly in the chronological order in which it was issued.  I would ask Deputies to examine the terms of the letter written by Deputy Dr. <Col N="926" /> Browne on the 19th of last month and addressed to the Taoiseach.  I would suggest to every fair-minded Deputy that that letter of the 19th March is the most important letter in the whole of this correspondence.  That letter starts off:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Taoiseach,</P>
    <P>Am I correct in thinking, from the terms of your letter of March 15th, that you are under the impression that the Hierarchy are opposed to the mother and child health protection scheme?  May I point out that this impression, if held by you, is certainly not borne out by the following facts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter was written on the 19th March.  11 days after the time when, according to Deputy Dr. Browne's own admission. he had received an express and definite indication that such Hierarchical opposition did, in fact, exist.  I do not want to weary Deputies by reading the whole of that letter, but I would refer them to the third paragraph of it in the course of which a statement is made of a remarkable nature in view of all the circumstances. I am still quoting from the letter of the 19th March:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to add, in addition, that, since sending this brochure concerning the mother and child scheme to all the members of the Hierarchy, I have received acknowledgments from a number of the Bishops, including incidentally His Lordship of Galway, who was present at the meeting of 11th October last. In none of these acknowledgments is there any suggestion of an objection to the scheme except in the letter from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the really important point:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the receipt of your letter I have been in communication with a member of the Hierarchy, who further assures me that, so far as he is aware, the Hierarchy as such have expressed no objection to the mother and child scheme whatsoever on the grounds of faith and morals.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We have there the definite statement from Deputy Dr. Browne that, sometime between the 15th March and the 19th March, he was in communication with a member of the Hierarchy who further assured him that, so far as he was aware, there was no objection from the Hierarchy to the mother and child scheme.  Now, I am not concerned at this stage with the validity, or otherwise, of the objections. I am concerned with testing the truthfulness of Deputy Dr. Browne in his attitude on this matter, and I suggest to the House that here is a clear and definite way of testing his truthfulness. We have his statement, telling the Taoiseach and, subsequently, telling the public and this House, that sometime between the 15th and the 19th March he has been assured by a member of the Hierarchy that there is no objection to the mother and child scheme.</P>

I am dealing with this purely on the basis of fact, purely on the basis of the truthfulness, or otherwise, of the case made by Deputy Dr. Noel Browne, and I would direct the attention of <Col N="928" /> Deputies to this fact from the mouths of the Hierarchy-we have it revealed in the letter to the Taoiseach written on behalf of the Hierarchy&mdash;that the decision of the Hierarchy on the 3rd or 4th April was unanimous.</P>
      <P>I am not discussing the question of that decision at the moment.  I am discussing this matter purely in the light of viewing it as a test of the veracity, or otherwise, of the statement made by Deputy Dr. Noel Browne.

      <P>I think that this is a matter on which, perhaps, Deputy Dr. Browne could enlighten us.  I am putting to Deputies two positions: one, a statement that between the 15th and the 19th March he received certain assurances that there was no objection from the Hierarchy, and, on the 5th April, the definite statement from the Hierarchy that there was a unanimous condemnation.  Perhaps somebody can explain it, I cannot.  There is only one explanation that I can see for it. I am open to accept any other, any more charitable one, but there is only one explanation I can see and that is, that the statement that he had received this assurance between the 15th and the 19th March is not in accordance with the facts.  I now pass from that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole of the case made by Deputy Dr. Browne against the Minister for External Affairs, against the Taoiseach and against his Government colleagues as a whole was that they had knowledge that he was having these difficulties but that that knowledge was withheld from him.  I put it to Deputies in a simple way, without embellishment, that if Deputy Dr. Browne can be demonstrated to have made a statement not in accordance <Col N="929" /> with facts in that respect, if his case in that respect is not based on facts, then the whole gravamen of his charge against his colleagues must fall to the ground.  That is the keystone of the case.  Take that away and there is no case.  If that is there and can be established, then perhaps there is a case. Deputy Dr. Browne says that this knowledge was withheld from him.  I cannot accept that from Deputy Dr. Browne because, no later than last Sunday-week, in the presence of Deputy Timoney, in the presence of Deputy McQuillan, who now supports Deputy Dr. Browne, in the presence of, I think, two or three other members of this House, in the presence of a member of Seanad Éireann and in the presence of 38 other people, Deputy Dr. Browne admitted, when challenged, that he had been warned on numerous occasions by the Minister for External Affairs that it was desirable that he should get over the difficulties that existed between himself and the Hierarchy in connection with the mother and child scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was surprised to hear Deputy Dr. Browne say in this House in categorical fashion that knowledge was withheld from him when I heard, and other members of this House and other reputable, decent citizens heard, that admission from Deputy Dr. Browne. Were it not for that single fact, I might find considerable difficulty as to how I should approach this whole question.  But, having heard that admission from Deputy Dr. Browne, my statement concerning which can be substantiated and will be substantiated in this House, how can I regard his truthfulness when I heard him make the case in this House that he did, basing it on a wilful withholding of knowledge from him by the Minister for External Affairs and by other members of the Government?</P>

      <P>I hope we will hear from Deputy Flanagan, when he is finally convinced, as I believe he will be, of the truth of the statement I am making, a withdrawal of the filthy type of attack he made on the Minister for External Affairs.  I appeal to Deputies to judge this matter purely on the basis of who is telling the truth. That is the issue involved here.  If half of what Deputy Dr. Browne alleged against the Minister for External Affairs and other members of the Government were true, if half of the statements made by him had a basis in fact, these members of the Government would not be fit to remain in public life.  I narrow down this whole issue to the truthfulness or otherwise of the man who is making the charges.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Deputy Flanagan to wait and listen to this.  Deputy Cowan and Deputy Flanagan attempted to make great capital out of a reference in Deputy Dr. Browne's letter to the Minister for External Affairs.  I do not propose to quote the whole of this letter.  It is vituperative in tone; it was probably written in a great hurry or else dictated to Deputy Dr. Browne by some pastmaster in Billingsgate. There is, however, a portion of it which I must quote:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Your letter is a model of the twofaced hypocrisy and humbug so characteristic of you.  Your references to a conflict between the spiritual and temporal authorities will occasion a smile...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> He goes on to make a further attack and then says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;because, among other charges of my political inexperience, I had allowed myself to be photographed with the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin.  This puerile bigotry is scarcely calculated to assist the cause of national reunification...&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Puerile bigotry.&rdquo; What are the facts?  The facts are as follows: In an attempt to point out to Deputy Dr. Browne certain respects, and there were many, in which his handling of these many difficult problems had been inept, the Minister for External Affairs dealt with certain matters.  In its correct context, the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs was one to which no one could take exception.  I was present when it was made.  It was made at that executive meeting to which I have already referred.  He pointed out to Deputy Dr. Browne that in negotiations with members of the Hierarchy tact and discretion were necessary.  He further pointed out to him that when engaged in difficult and delicate negotiations with the Hierarchy and when they had expressed fears as to the implementation of the suggested scheme and had instanced their apprehensions concerning its administration by doctors educated in medical schools in which they declared they had no confidence, that in these circumstances it was, in the opinion of the Minister for External Affairs, both unwise and tactless for Deputy Dr. Browne, then Minister for Health, to have as his principal sponsors&mdash;this is with reference to what Deputy Dr. Browne now describes as his last-minute efforts to save the scheme-persons of a faith other than that held by the majority of the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The advice given on that occasion by the Minister for External Affairs was advice given not in the nature of a charge; it was a pointing-out to Deputy Dr. Browne that tact and discretion were necessary and that any action of his, while perfectly correct and proper in itself, might be so timed as to be capable of misconstruction. To suggest that there was a bigoted attack made then on Deputy Dr. Browne is completely incorrect and is not in accordance with the facts.  It is to my mind ludicrous to attempt to level a charge of religious bigotry against the Minister for External Affairs.  I know of no man here who has fought religious bigotry more often than he has and who has laid himself open to the cheap sneers and gibes of people who had not his moral courage.</P>

      <P>That took place, as I have told the House, on last Sunday week at the executive meeting to which reference has so frequently been made. That executive meeting was one specially summoned by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Noel Browne&mdash;specially summoned, he gave us to understand, in connection with the difficulties he was having over the mother and child scheme.  It was summoned <Col N="933" /> by him although there had been an executive meeting held in the previous week from which he had walked out because one single word of criticism concerning his conduct was voiced.</P>
      <P>May I say that my experience of the ex-Minister for Health has been that he is constitutionally incapable of listening to criticism.  Perhaps that is not anything for which he should be particularly blamed; but I have had the experience of seeing him walk out over a fairly long period, a period of a year or more, from five, if not six, different committee meetings.  But at the executive meeting at which this envenomed and bitter attack, according to himself, was made upon him by the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;and that meeting lasted until 3 o'clock in the morning&mdash;the last business done was to pass a vote of confidence in Seán MacBride, Minister for External Affairs, as Leader of the Party.  I do not know what happened between 3 o'clock on that Monday morning and some 48 hours later when Deputy Dr. Browne dictated this vituperative letter.  With all the knowledge that he had at 3 o'clock on last Monday morning week of the unwholesome political atmosphere of which he now tells us he was glad to leave, with all his knowledge of the unsavoury attitude of the Minister for External Affairs, with all his knowledge of the cowardice and corruption and treachery now charged against us, his former colleagues, with all his knowledge at 3 o'clock on last Monday morning week when all these matters had been thrashed out, Deputy Dr. Browne subscribed to a vote of confidence in the Minister for External Affairs as Leader of Clann na Poblachta.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with issues raised here by Deputy Flanagan in the course of his speech.  I have no wish to widen the scope of this debate. I am dealing with matters specifically referred to by Deputy Flanagan.  He referred to Deputy Dr. Browne's release from the corrupt and unwholesome political atmosphere in which he had <Col N="934" /> been cribbed, cabin'd and confined for the past three years.  In addition to that, the last words of Deputy Dr. Browne at that executive meeting were an undertaking to his colleagues that he would deny and publish the following day a denial of the truth of newspaper statements suggesting that he was dissatisfied with the leadership of the Party to which he then belonged, and that he was completely loyal to it and accepted the consequences of that loyalty.</P>

      <P>I agree, but it is difficult when one has sat and listened here to the unbridled and unlicensed attack made on the Minister for External Affairs by Deputy Flanagan, by Deputy Captain Cowan and by Deputy Dr. Noel Browne the other day not to refer to these matters if only for the purpose of putting in issue his credibility and his truthfulness.  At the risk of incurring censure from the Chair for repetition, let me say that the issue is as to who is telling the truth, that and nothing else.  If the case made by Deputy Dr. Browne against his colleagues is true, then they are not worthy of support, not worthy of my defence or the defence of any Deputy; but if it is not the true case, if it is based on falsehood, what must one think of the person making it?  Perhaps the circumstances surrounding Deputy Dr. Browne's position are overworked and there may be an explanation, but I take my stand and I am prepared to stand or fall on this issue, as to whether in fact Deputy Dr. Browne in his correspondence and in his statement to the House is telling the truth or not.  He denies that he had knowledge of the difficulties being raised by the Hierarchy.  On that alone I must condemn him, because in my presence&mdash;I do not think he was in the House when I mentioned this before and I now repeat it as he is here&mdash;Deputy Dr. Browne admitted that on several occasions he had been warned and reminded by the Minister for External Affairs that it was essential that the <Col N="935" /> existing differences with the Hierarchy should be surmounted, resolved or settled.</P>
      <P>I turn now to two paragraphs in the statement made here by the Deputy on the 12th of this month.  I think they have a bearing on the matters to which I have just referred.  In the course of his references to his interview which he had with the Archbishop of Dublin on the 10th October, he says&mdash;I quote from Volume 125, column 669:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; At the conclusion of this interview, I was under the impression, erroneously as it now appears, that His Grace and their Lordships were satisfied with my explanation of the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Erroneously as it now appears &rdquo;&mdash; he is prepared to admit in so far as the Hierarchy are concerned that his interpretation of what took place was erroneous.  He is not prepared to extend that charity to his former colleagues. But at column 670 he again touches on this question of knowledge. He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I heard nothing further about the matter from either the Hierarchy or the Taoiseach until a couple of weeks ago, I had no reason to believe that the Hierarchy were not fully satisfied, and the work of preparing for the introduction of the mother and child scheme continued.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Until a couple of weeks ago&rdquo;&mdash;I do not want to comment on the discrepancy, but there is even a discrepancy there.  On the correspondence which he himself discloses, it was five weeks prior to the 12th April that he received the letter dated 8th March from the Archbishop of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That speech was not an extempore one.  It was not a speech in which a Deputy, speaking in the House as I am speaking now, has to search around for the appropriate word as he progresses; but that phrase, that sentence, &ldquo;As I heard nothing further about the matter from either the Hierarchy or the Taoiseach until a couple of weeks ago, I had no reason to believe that the Hierarchy were not fully <Col N="936" /> satisfied&rdquo;, was read by the Deputy from a typewritten document&mdash;which, I presume, was carefully prepared.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning these matters, not with reference to the issues involved in the objections, not with reference to the Deputy's attitude to the Hierarchy or the Hierarchy's attitude to him; I am mentioning them purely so that the House might examine them and from that examination arrive at a judgment as to Deputy Dr. Browne's credibility.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made by Deputies Flanagan and Cowan, and great comment has been made outside, with considerable truth, of the harm that has been done to the whole national position with regard to the removal of the Border and the ending of Partition by this whole question.  I concur in the view that grave and tragic harm has been done, but I ask Deputies to consider at whose door must the responsibility for that be laid.  I suggest that it can be laid only at the door of Deputy Dr. Noel Browne.  I would have tremendous respect for him, though I might disagree with him, knowing all the background, as I knew it from the meeting on Sunday week last, if he had resigned from Clann na Poblachta, made as aggressive an attack as he wished on the Minister for External Affairs and the rest of us, but at the same time had kept that correspondence and those documents from the public Press. If he had done that, I might have been unable to agree with him but I would have had to go to him and say: &ldquo;You have earned my undying respect because of your willingness to allow yourself to be placed, perhaps, in a false position rather than jeopardise the whole national position.&rdquo;  But he did not see fit to take that line, he published that correspondence, he delighted the heart of Westmoreland Street in the person of the Editor of the <i>Irish Times,</i> he delighted the bigoted junta in Stormont who act there as Britain's &ldquo;emergency men&rdquo;, he left it possible for the Midgleys and the others to quote, with approval, Deputy Dr. Browne, former Minister for Health in the Government of the Republic of Ireland, and to adduce his words as proof of the correctness of <Col N="937" /> their attitude in opposing the reunification of the country.</P>
    <P>Boiling it all down, I think that there is more reality and more depth in that complaint against the former Minister for Health than, perhaps, there is in many of the others.  That is something for which, I am afraid, I and many others like me can never forgive him.  Admittedly, it might have been a hard thing, it might have been a difficult thing to endure, perhaps, what he might consider misrepresentation, that is, if he had the case which he makes.  It might have been a difficult thing to suffer on and be misrepresented, but I think that the former Minister for Health is intelligent and able enough and, in spite of what has been said about his inexperience, experienced enough to have known, when he handed that correspondence to the newspapers, that he handed a weapon to those who wished to perpetuate the Partition of this country.</P>
    <P>May I make this parenthetical comment also, that between the time that he was subscribing to votes of loyalty to the leadership of his Party, and the time when that voluminous correspondence was handed to the Press, so short a period elapsed that, in my view, it would have been impossible to prepare it for the Press and I am forced to conclude&mdash;I am reinforced in this by another piece of evidence&mdash;that at the very time he sat at our councils discussing this situation, that correspondence, that treacherous correspondence, that harmful correspondence, was in the course of preparation for handing out to the newspapers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the mother and child scheme itself, let me say this.  I would have infinitely preferred, had it been possible, to see introduced a mother and child scheme which was free for all and without a means test, but Deputy Dr. Browne, by the three reasons which he gave for his resignation, puts me in the position that I must pose to him this question: what alternative course did he want us to pursue?  If he is critical of the course pursued by us, then it can only be that he suggests that we should have gone ahead and that the Government <Col N="938" /> should have gone ahead with the mother and child scheme free for all without a means test, irrespective of the Hierarchical pronouncements against it.  That is the only alternative. If he is critical of us, he must be critical of us on that basis.  I am no moral theologian, like Deputy Captain Peadar Cowan, who is an expert in all the sciences and an adornment of all the arts.  I am no theologian. All I know is this.  I am sorry that the position has arisen that we cannot have such a scheme.</P>
    <P>As an ordinary commonsense Deputy, I realise that in the existing situation and circumstances&mdash;circumstances created largely by the handling of the situation by the former Minister for Health&mdash;it would have been a practical impossibility for us as a Party or for the Government as a Government to implement that scheme.  I believe that once there was a condemnation by the Hierarchy of the mother and child scheme as proposed by Dr. Noel Browne we were bound to submit some alternative scheme.  I charge against Deputy Dr. Browne not with any vindictiveness&mdash;certainly without any malice&mdash;that it was his manner of handling the situation that allowed a position to develop, where this inevitable head on collision between the civil Government and the Catholic Hierarchy developed.  Had he looked at the matter in this wise that it were better that some mother and child scheme should be introduced rather than none at all, I think that he and we would be happier men to-day than we are.  He did not choose to take that view.  He chose, in my opinion, to make a fetish out of a phrase with the result that that medical attention and care, which all of us desire for mothers and children, is not now available.</P>
    <P>I have very little more to add beyond saying that the references made to the Minister for External Affairs and the comparison made between the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Health by Deputy Flanagan, will carry very little weight throughout this country.  The people know the service given to this country by the Minister for External Affairs as plain Seán <Col N="939" /> MacBride, as a volunteer in the I.R.A. against the Tans in defence of the Republic, during the Civil War and in the Republican movement ever since, Seán MacBride, son of a republican father and mother, a father who gave his life to found an Irish Republic, needs no defence from mountebanks nor does he suffer by comparison with the Dr. Noel Brownes.</P>

      <P>I will just say a word or two with regard to the matters which have been introduced into this discussion.  It does seem to me, from what we have heard to-night, that the real issue that is before this House and before the country is not an issue as to whether a statement contained in a letter of Deputy Dr. Browne or anybody else may be accurate or not, but as it was rather more clearly drawn by Deputy Cowan in his remarks to the House here to-night.</P>
      <P>He raised the issue of the right of the Catholic Hierarchy to express a view on a matter concerning faith and morals, which it is their duty to protect.  He denied them that right and that is the issue, surely, which is raised by the events which led to the resignation of Deputy Dr. Browne from his post as Minister for Health. On that issue, we have heard no remark, no comment and no contribution good, bad, or indifferent, from the Opposition in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;though it was they who introduced into this House and had enacted the Health Act of 1947 under which this entire deplorable situation arose.  It was the leader of the Opposition who first received the criticism of the Hierarchy with regard to the proposals for sex education contained in that Act.  That criticism, received by the former Government in the month of October, 1947, was not even acknowledged until 16th February, 1948, two days before they left office.  I charge them with this, that they knew well that this situation would face Deputy Dr. Browne in his enthusiasm and in his <Col N="940" /> energy to perfect the health services of the country, and I charge that they deliberately handed that situation over to the incoming Government when they knew that it need never have arisen if they had met the very real and practical objections of the Catholic Hierarchy to anything in the nature of radical medical notions being introduced here.</P>
      <P>They have had no comment and no contribution to make to this debate as to whether the Hierarchy have any right to express a view on a matter which will vitally affect the life of every individual in the country.  It is very easy in a matter of this kind to be intellectual, to play the intellectual rôle, and very easy to tilt at windmills and to say that the Bishops were wrong and that they have been wrong before.  I am a simple man and I have a simple faith, and I will express a simple view; where the faith and morals of 95 per cent. of our people are concerned, I do not care twopence if it offends to the core of his soul, Bertie Smyllie of the <i>Irish Times</i> or any of the rest of them, I will accept it as proper that the Bishops and members of the Hierarchy of this country are entitled to express their view at any time, and far more certain is it that they should express that view when asked to do so by the Minister in charge of the scheme under discussion.</P>
      <P>May I say that, in my view, this is not a matter confined purely to those of us in the House or in the country who are Catholics, because I should be appalled to think that, on a matter so important as this, there would be any difference whatever between the Christian churches of this country? I am quite certain and quite convinced that the Rev. Dr. Barton and any other member of the Protestant Hierarchy here would hold the same view and express the same opinion with regard to an important matter of Christian social teaching.  Those of us who are parents know that there is a duty on every one of us to see to the care and well-being of our wives and children, and, so far as we can, by our own resources, to ensure for them all the care we can afford and the best we can give them.  That is the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Surely when that is a clear duty imposed on all Christians and on all citizens, an authority like the Hierarchy of any Church, indeed, is entitled to say that, in the case of a man of unlimited means, a man whose resources are beyond the average or normal, if you provide a form of State medicine&mdash;and this was State medicine, no matter what it is called&mdash;you are going to put before him a temptation to neglect the duty cast upon him and fail to live up to his obligations.  That is a fundamental objection.  It may be an academic objection and it may be theoretical, so far as many of us are concerned, but the more academic and the more theoretical it may be, the easier surely it was to meet it.</P>
    <P>I say that the issue raised by the resignation of Deputy Dr. Browne is the right of the Irish Hierarchy to express a view on a matter which they regard as fundamental.  That being the issue and that view having been expressed, this House is asked to consider what should be the effect on those members of the Government or of the House who profess to be practising Catholics.  At least one newspaper circulating in this country has suggested, with venom, that in Ireland in 1951 it is criminal for the Taoiseach or member of this Government to practise his beliefs as a Catholic.  I wonder if that view would be shared by many more than the single individual who wrote these words of venom.  Many of my friends who are good Christians but who are not of my religion are men whose words and views I would accept anywhere, and I know from them that, no matter what the cost or the gain might be, they would never act in private or in public life contrary to the views and beliefs which they have held from the cradle.</P>
    <P>I know well that our Protestant fellow-citizens in this country, with regard to the many things they hold dear and in respect of which they express and hold a Christian faith, would never depart from those principles or act contrary to them no matter what the cost or the gain might be.  Are we to suggest in a Parliament of this country that two different standards of value should apply?  Are we to suggest that the <Col N="942" /> Catholic, in a matter of this kind, is to be bound to act contrary to his faith while the same rule and the same view is not to be held with regard to members of other religions?  Nobody, apart from the editor of the <i>Irish Times,</i> would hold that view&mdash;and he knows very well that his views are not shared by any of his co-religionists and that they regard him as the &ldquo;nigger in the wood-pile&rdquo; who is causing irreparable damage to them and to this nation.</P>
    <P>As so much has been said about the issue which is before this House and the country, and as views have been expressed as to whether the scheme should be free for all, or otherwise, may I say that I do not see why this Parliament should sanction any legislation or implement any scheme which will tax the poor in order to provide free medical services for the rich.  I do not see why the rich readers of select newspapers in this country should have conferred on them, as a result of taxes imposed on the old age pensioners and the less well off, the benefits of a free medical service.  I can only challenge the motives of anyone who would suggest that any such scheme should commend itself to this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to know, from any person who supports a free for all scheme, what it would mean here in this city.  What would happen to the beds and the other services at present provided for the poor people in Holles Street Hospital and in the Rotunda Hospital?  Are they to be made available to the richer sections of our population? Surely, before anyone would suggest a scheme of that nature, his first concern should be to ensure that the interests of the poor will not suffer. His first concern should be to provide beds for all.  If, in this month, as was suggested, this scheme had been put into operation, then I say that the interests of the poorer people in this city would have been immediately affected.  Instead of Mrs. Jones, from Deputy MacEntee's constituency, sharing a bed with Lady Diana, Lady Diana would have the bed.</P>

      <P>I do.  I am happy to be a man who knows all people and I am glad to say that both of them say &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; to me. That is the issue with regard to the practical effect of a scheme of this nature.  It would impose unfair and immoral taxes on a poorer section of the community in order to provide a facility for the better off and the rich &mdash;a facility which they can well afford to pay for themselves.  In addition, the scheme would bring immediate hardship to the poorer sections because it would deprive them of a service which they enjoy at present.</P>
      <P>One of my colleagues from my constituency said that he was prepared to advocate everywhere in his constituency a free for all mother and child welfare scheme.  These are easy words.  I should like to know from him whether he would make that speech in the town of Abbeyleix or in any other town where certain services are at present provided for the less well off sections of his constituents.  It is easy to advocate schemes of this kind, but it is rather a pity that those who express these sentiments do not devote more time and energy to the provision, first of all, of machinery whereby such a scheme could operate. Much as we can respect Deputy Dr. Browne's work and all that he has done&mdash;and his enthusiasm and energy as Minister for Health always has had and always will have my admiration and respect&mdash;and much as we can praise him for all that has gone before, we must, nevertheless, regard the issue involved here as being far greater than any individual, be he Deputy Dr. Browne or anyone else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief for the simple reason that there is very little that I need add to the statement which I gave to the House on this whole matter.  A few points were made by the Taoiseach during the course of his first speech which might have left, either consciously or unconsciously, an impression which would give rise to certain misapprehensions and I should like to deal with these points very briefly because I think it only fair that, in relation to them, I should clear my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach states that he helped me on a previous occasion on which I had got into trouble with the Hierarchy. Now, this previous occasion to which the Taoiseach refers arose as a result of a policy which I was pursuing and there are absolutely no unsavoury implications whatsoever despite, I am afraid, the Taoiseach's intention to convey that impression.  As part of my policy in relation to the staffing of hospitals arose the problem as to whether they should be staffed completely by nuns or completely by nurses.  I had taken the view that a local authority when considering <Col N="945" /> the staff who would run a hospital ought to give the maximum opportunity to the staff to reach the top, to reach the most senior posts, and that the hospital should be staffed either completely by nuns or completely by nurses.</P>
    <P>At that time representations were made and the Taoiseach forwarded to me that letter.  I believe that it is to this incident and to this letter he is now referring.  I am completely unashamed of the contents of that letter as I saw it and I feel that it is the Taoiseach's duty to publish that letter in order that there may be no misapprehensions in anybody's mind that I had got into trouble with any group, with any responsible or influential section of the community arising out of my policy in relation to the staffing of hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach ridiculed me when I suggested that £30,000 might be made available without a Cabinet decision. Some ten days or a fortnight ago the Minister for Finance admitted in the Seanad that the mother and child health protection scheme would cost £1,800,000 when it would be in full operation.  Without Government consideration of the details of the scheme but on his own consideration of the details put forward by my Department, the Minister for Finance&mdash;after the usual long tussle which goes on in these matters in Government circles&mdash; on his own authority, realising that on its basic principles the scheme would be free to all anxious to use it and would have no means test, gave me authority to go ahead with the drawing up, introduction and implementation of a scheme to cost £1,800,000 when it would be in full operation.</P>
    <P>That was the action of this experienced Minister&mdash;they accused me of inexperience.  He did not consider it necessary at that time to go to the Government for its consideration of this very considerable sum.  A little while ago he changed his mind, as my statement showed, and suggested that this serious fundamental matter of principle, this £30,000 which I recently asked for, should be considered by the Government, this in spite of the fact that a year and a half earlier he had <Col N="946" /> given me authority to draw up, introduce and implement a scheme which would when in full operation cost £1,800,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach suggests that nobody knew of the scheme and said (column 738):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first time I personally heard of it was when a copy of the scheme was given to me by a person outside the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then says later on (column 753):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That was the way in which we got the document&mdash;the alleged scheme, a booklet which the then Minister for Health &lsquo;is about to introduce&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also said in another place that each member of the Government for his information was given a copy of the draft proposals of the scheme&mdash;three different places, three different ways in which he first heard of the scheme. He said he knew nothing of the scheme; he criticises its merits.  His right as a barrister to do this might be questioned.  If he knew nothing of the scheme, if his colleagues knew nothing of the scheme, then could he explain how he authorised me, as I have said, to go ahead with the preparation of the draft proposals, to negotiate on those proposals and to submit them to the Medical Association the best part of a year ago?  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins negotiated on those proposals; the Tánaiste negotiated on those proposals; the Taoiseach negotiated on those proposals himself.  Deputy Dillon very kindly wrote to me some time in September last and said in his own inimitable script:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Noel,</P>
    <P>I am 100 per cent. for the mother and child scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then asked me if I could reassure him about certain points&mdash;unimportant points of detail.  All these Ministers were at different times pressing on the Medical Association a scheme which the Taoiseach now says he knew so little about.</P>
    <P>There has been no attempt whatsoever to disapprove a number of points. One is that under the 1947 Act passed by the then Government authority was <Col N="947" /> given to introduce a free scheme for which there would be no means test, and the only way in which it would be possible to introduce a scheme by which local authorities could collect fees and impose a means test would be by the amendment of the 1947 Act.  I put that proposal before the Government in 1948 and pointed out to them that if they wanted a scheme which would not be free to all and which would have a means test they must amend that Act.  The section containing that suggestion headed my draft to the Government.  They directed me as a Government decision to exclude from my proposed draft Bill the section which would have enabled them now to charge for this scheme if they so wished.  It was a Government direction to strike out that enabling clause. I was asked in the Cabinet if I wanted to charge for the scheme I said: &ldquo;No, but if you want powers to do so you must take them now.&rdquo;  I said that they must take powers in the next few weeks if they wanted to charge for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach makes a point that I, following the decision of the Hierarchy, asked were they proposing to go ahead with this scheme.  The fact, of course, is that the decision of 1948 was never rescinded.  It was a Government decision, solemnly taken in Cabinet and, although inexperienced in these matters, I am aware that once a Government decision is taken it must, or it should be in proper procedure, rescinded.  It was rescinded only last Friday week, following the receipt of the letter from the Hierarchy.  That was the mechanics of that operation.  In accordance with that, I might say that my question to their Lordships was: Is this contrary to Catholic moral teaching? The reply, as you all know, was that it is contrary to Catholic social teaching.  I was not aware&mdash;the Taoiseach can verify this-until I had asked each member of the Cabinet separately what he proposed to do, what he had been given to understand by Dr. McQuaid when that decision was taken.  He then told us that that morning he had been informed by Dr. <Col N="948" /> McQuaid that Catholic social teaching and Catholic moral teaching were one and the same thing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, number two, does not deny that he withheld or suppressed the document sent to him by me on November 11th or 12th.  He makes no attempt, in spite of all the legalistic verbiage with which he wants to surround that incident.  The fact remains that he put it in his drawer, on his desk, in his pocket, but he did not send it to their Lordships the Hierarchy, and that was one of my charges.</P>
    <P>His recollection of the meeting of the 12th October was that he could not corroborate what I had felt myself, that a satisfactory conclusion had been arrived at.  I have said that he denies corroborating that impression now, but he does not assert, even now, that following that meeting with His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, he told me they were dissatisfied with my scheme, or the Government scheme at that time.  He makes no such assertion even now.  He merely states that he could not corroborate the impressions I had received.</P>
    <P>In relation to the publication of all these documents, the matter arose at the final Cabinet meeting at which the Tánaiste asked if he could convey all these matters to his own Party.  The Taoiseach said he could; it was now, so far as he was aware, at the point where everybody had to know the facts.  He then turned to me and he said : &ldquo;You may publish what you like, Dr. Browne,&rdquo; and left it at that. I accepted that decision as a decision that I could go ahead and publish all the documents in the case, so that the facts might be available to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach makes a small point that I have not pursued&mdash;the question of eliminating compulsory clauses in the 1947 Act.  I felt these were as important to me as to the Taoiseach and Deputy Dillon.  The fact is that proposals for the repeal of these compulsory clauses are at present on the Paper and the Taoiseach may bring them forward for discussion at his convenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to import <Col N="949" /> any heat or anger into this debate.  I want merely to set the situation in the perspective in which I see it.</P>
      <P>Let me, before I proceed, say at once that the Taoiseach never gave me permission to publish the documents.  I merely asked was it at that stage permissible to show the letter of the Bishops of the 5th April to members of my Party.  I never sought permission to publish the letter; I did not get permission to publish it and, so far as Deputy Dr. Browne is concerned, he got permission to show the letter; he did not get permission to publish that letter and all the other documents which he also released for public consumption. Permission was given only to show the letter, not to publish it.  It was never published by me and Deputy Dr. Browne exceeded by far any authority he got from the Taoiseach by his publication, indiscriminately, of the entire correspondence on this matter. I mention that to clear up that inaccuracy.</P>
      <P>I think this position has to be put in its proper setting.  Deputy Cowan touched off the situation to-day. Deputy Cowan took the line that this was dictation from the Bishops. That is the issue which has been raised in this matter so far.  That is the issue which is being raised so far by Deputy Cowan.  Deputy Cowan says this is dictation by the Bishops.  Deputy Dr. Browne was very close to that attitude as well and, if he has changed, he has changed because of a realistic approach by him to the fact that that is an unsustainable line of action in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me tell you the facts, of which apparently you are not aware.  Then I will let the House and the country judge the situation.  On Wednesday of last week I was sitting here in these benches during the Second Stage of the Social Welfare <Col N="950" /> Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Corish, was beside me. Deputy Dr. Browne, Minister for Health, as he then was, came in and said to me: &ldquo;Did you hear the decision of the Bishops?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;No; I have been here since three o'clock, I have not been outside at all.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Bishops have not turned down my scheme on the basis of faith and morals, but they have turned it down on the basis of Catholic social teaching.&rdquo;  It seemed to me, from that, that that was a condemnation of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion Deputy Dr. Browne said he still felt, notwithstanding the letter of 5th April which he got from the Bishops, that he could go ahead with the scheme&mdash;he still felt it.  He told it to me, sitting here, and Deputy Corish was a witness.  So that, on the Wednesday night of last week, notwithstanding the Bishops' letter, Dr. Browne said he could still go ahead with his scheme, in spite of the strictures which had been passed on the scheme by the Bishops.  I warned him not to do it, that he was heading straight for disaster, and that he was unwise to pursue that matter.  Two days afterwards, at the Government meeting, as if it was still permissible <Col N="951" /> to do so, he asked were the members of the Government going ahead with this scheme, as if that was then discussable, as if that was then possible, as if the issue being raised by him was a question: &ldquo;Will you or will you not defy the Bishops?&rdquo; and he threw that question into the arena as something which could be decided by a decision on the part of the Government to flout the authority of the Bishops in the matter of Catholic social teaching.</P>
      <P>When you remember what he said to me and to Deputy Corish, sitting here on the Wednesday night, that he could still go ahead with the scheme and wanted to go ahead with the scheme in spite of the Bishops' condemnation of the scheme, when you remember the question which he put two days afterwards to the members of the Government: &ldquo;Are you going ahead with my scheme?&rdquo;, is it not clear that in the mind of Dr. Browne at that time he contemplated a situation which Deputy Cowan contemplated here this evening, that he regarded this as dictation by the Bishops and he was going to fight the Bishops? That was the attitude then.  I want to put that position of Dr. Browne's clearly and closely to his statement that he was misled on this whole business and I will come back to the &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; portion again.</P>
      <P>If this question is raised as one in which the Bishops are to be on one side and the Government on the other side, I say, on behalf of the Government, that issue is not going to arise in this country.  This Government will not, travel that road.  Deputy Cowan may regard that as an issue upon which he is going to fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You had an opportunity and will have an opportunity, perhaps, of participating in this debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it can be provided. Deputy Cowan has thrown up by his own questions here this evening the issue of the Bishops on one <Col N="952" /> side and the Government on the other side.  I say the Government will not allow that situation to arise, that there will be no flouting of the authority of the Bishops in the matter of Catholic social or Catholic moral teaching and if anybody imagines that defiance of the Bishops in this matter is to give liberty to the masses of the people then let him look at other countries where the moral law and Catholic social teaching has been defied and there he will find that the workers or the masses of the people have got very little liberty, very little of the liberty that was promised them when they abandoned adherence to, or recognition of, the moral law.</P>
      <P>If that issue of the Bishops versus the Government has been raised acutely in this controversy, it has been raised in a special way by the manner in which Dr. Browne has handled this whole question.  Let me say this: All along through these long and tortuous negotiations, I endeavoured to give to Dr. Browne every scrap of assistance that I could, in order to help him to overcome whatever difficulties were thrown in his path, whatever difficulties arose because of the approach to the problem by the doctors on the one hand and by the knowledge that before we came into office at all, in 1947, the Bishops of this country had written to the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera now, telling him that, in their view, the provisions of the 1947 Act gave offence to Catholic moral teachings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a problem which we inherited from 1947.  That was a problem which we found awaiting us when we went into office.  That problem was there.  Dr. Browne, as the Minister charged with the implementation of the Health Act, 1947, must have known, from the first day he took office, that he was already in difficulties with the Health Act because the Bishops had left no doubt as to their attitude in respect of that Act by the letter which they sent to the Taoiseach at that time.  So that from the time he took office, he was already fixed with notice that he was in difficulties with the 1947 Act, in particular in difficulties with the mother and child section of the Act, and that <Col N="953" /> all along he would have to be very careful to ensure that any scheme he produced was one which would not bring him into conflict with the Church on the question of Catholic moral teachings.</P>
    <P>In October last, the Bishops sent a letter to the Taoiseach, a copy of which was read by the Taoiseach when he spoke on the matter in this House. It was clear to anybody reading that letter that the Bishops were gravely perturbed at that time about the possible emergence of a mother and child scheme which, in their view, would be contrary to Catholic teaching.  From the date of the receipt of that letter, by negotiations with the doctors on the one hand and the Hierarchy on the other hand, we endeavoured to avoid the rocks which we saw were confronting the Minister for Health, and on which it looked at times as if he had made up his mind definitely to founder.</P>
    <P>In all that period, the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Higgins, the Taoiseach himself, the Minister for Agriculture and myself, in various ways, at various times, did everything we could to endeavour to induce Dr. Browne to handle this matter calmly, to handle this matter with sagacity, not to push matters to a crisis and, if he wanted to get the goodwill of the Hierarchy on the one hand, and the goodwill of the doctors who must be relied upon to implement a scheme of this kind, not to push matters to the crisis stage, to avoid having a head-on collision.  Time after time we came in to endeavour to avoid that head-on collision which at times I felt he was looking for.</P>
    <P>I had endless talks with Dr. Browne on this matter&mdash;endless talks.  Never once in the whole period was there a cross word between him and me on the matter.  I saw his difficulties and I warned him against those difficulties. Could Deputy MacEntee find a circus outside town, where his services would be badly needed?</P>

But let me say this, if this matter had been handled with tact, with understanding and with forbearance by the Minister responsible, I believe we would not have had the situation which has been brought about to-day.</P>
