      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that at present there are two daily passenger trains from Dublin to Westport and three buses from Westport to Achill Island but that, as the time schedule is such that there is no bus connection for the second train from Dublin, passengers are put to the expense of hiring a hackney vehicle or spending a night in Westport; that at this time of the year the relatively heavy inward traffic of migratory wage earners commences, and that it is a hardship on them to have to bear additional charges on an already costly journey; and, if so, if he will make representations to Córas Iompair Éireann to adjust the daily bus service so that the last bus will meet passengers arriving on the last train for the areas, Newport, Mulrany and Achill Island.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make early representations to Córas Iompair Éireann for an additional bus service to Achill Island on the route Achill Sound via Dugort to Dooagh, as there are five hotels and four guest houses on this route and as a large number of migratory workers return home for Christmas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a question put down by Deputy Ruttledge on 6th December, Córas Iompair Éireann have informed me that since 4th December the Westport-Dooagh bus service is <Col N="586" /> being diverted via Dugort once each way on three days weekly.  I am also informed that Córas Iompair Éireann have already announced an additional bus service between Westport and Achill for the Christmas period which will give a connection off the train from Dublin which arrives in Westport at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) what action he intends to take to compel the owners of the Irish woollen and hosiery mills to manufacture the full clothing requirements of the Irish people, and (b) if he will agree to establish a board comprising representatives of employers and the workers engaged in the industry, and a chairman appointed by him with the aim of achieving the necessary output, and thereby ensuring continuous employment for workers in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the problem of Irish woollen and hosiery mills is not one of increasing productive capacity, but of increasing sales of their goods, and thereby securing full utilisation of existing capacity.  In so far as there may be classes of woollen and hosiery goods not at present being produced here, the extension of the industries on an efficient and permanent basis is hardly likely to be achieved by methods of compulsion.  It is the Government's policy to secure such expansion by encouraging and facilitating it in the normal way.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of joint councils for these industries, consideration is being given to reviving, although perhaps in amended form, certain proposals which were contained in the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill, 1947.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the agitation which has arisen among the motoring community over the recent notification of increases in premiums for motor insurance, he will set up machinery for reinsurance envisaged <Col N="588" /> under the Insurance Act, 1936, and thus make available a national system of reinsurance to those who are contemplating the formation of mutual insurance co-operatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

I am not aware what type of organisation the Deputy has in mind in the last part of his question, but I have no reason to think that adequate reinsurance facilities are not available under the existing law.</P>

      <P>I wonder is the Minister aware at the moment that firms manufacturing for export are obliged to pay duty for this oil?  If they export the manufactured product they get drawback amounting to the same extent as the duty.  That involves very considerable book-keeping and so forth in licensing arrangements, whereas if duty-free facilities were allowed in the initial application, all this unnecessary work would not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is a bit uncertain at the moment.  Demands for facilities to import this oil at present are completely abnormal and look as if they might reach a stage at which we could not attempt to finance them. My feeling is in favour of keeping the situation under control by canalising imports of oil through the existing refinery company.  Whether it will be considered desirable or necessary to go beyond that and give import facilities to other firms is a matter that has not yet been decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you not consider granting free facilities to firms that had already applied before a certain date and who found, on application, that these facilities were not available?

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;capital imports&rdquo; is used in the article referred to by the Deputy as a convenient expression for foreign borrowing, especially in the form of foreign investment in new Canadian issues to finance productive development. It would be wrong to use such a term to refer to transactions such as short-term borrowing by Irish firms from the London discount market to finance imports of consumer goods or the transfer of control of existing capital assets in this country to externs.  These, however, are amongst the transactions which are recorded in the capital account of the Irish Balance of Payments Statements as &ldquo;Inward or Credit Movements (Exports)&rdquo;. The use of the term &ldquo;capital imports&rdquo; as a generalisation for the incurring of financial indebtedness to externs or the receipt of foreign funds in exchange for domestic capital assets would, moreover, be likely to lead to confusion with imports for capital purposes in the physical sense, e.g., of producers' capital goods ready for use.  I am satisfied as to the suitability of the phrase &ldquo;incurring of dollar or sterling debt&rdquo;, which was used in paragraph 31 of the White Paper on the Trend of External Trade and Payments, 1951, to indicate two of the ways in which deficits in the Irish Balance of Payments have been financed.</P>

She applied for an increase in April, 1951, and her circumstances were reinvestigated.  It was found that her yearly means, consisting of half her husband's earnings, exceeded the then statutory limit (£52 5s.) for entitlement to blind pension. A question as to her continued eligibility for pension had to be raised and, by decision given on the 10th August, 1951, the blind pension was revoked by the local pension committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether the portions of the report made by Sir Edmund Hall-Patch as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the O.E.E.C., which were reported in the Press on the 28th November, 1951, and quoted by the Tánaiste in the Dáil on the same date were in fact prepared on the basis of material and information supplied by the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was issued by the O.E.E.C. and is entitled &ldquo;Financial <Col N="601" /> Stability and the Fight Against Inflation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As is pointed out in the introduction:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This report analyses the problem of inflation, and the related problems in the broad field of internal economic and financial policy that face the countries of Western Europe and North America.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The authors of the report were members of a working party consisting of representatives from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</P>
      <P>The report is based upon the current statistical material of each country which all agreed to supply when the O.E.E.C. was set up for the purpose of securing co-operation in European economic recovery and development.  I take it that it was supplied by each of these countries as it was in our case by the Departments responsible for agriculture, industry, finance and statistics.  The collecting and presentation of this material in our case is done by the Department of External Affairs.</P>
      <P>The report is all the more valuable and authoritative in that, as it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The situation in each country was examined in turn, with the assistance of experts from the countries concerned, and the comments of the Governments concerned were considered by the working party before reaching final conclusions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Council of O.E.E.C. endorsed the findings of the working party and in the foreword the council commented:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present inflationary dangers are a serious impediment to the development of the productive resources of Western European countries; they hamper the solution of the economic problems raised by the maintenance and improvement of their well-being and ensuring the collective or individual security of member countries; they cause difficulties for the E.P.U. and for their trading relationships; in these and other ways, their consequences are international.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> I repudiate entirely the suggestion in the Deputy's question that the conclusions regarding inflation in the O.E.E.C. Report can be attributed or credited to the Department of Finance or any other Irish Department, official or agency.  It will be quite obvious to the informed reader that the O.E.E.C. Working Party are and have been for years alive to the requirements of scientific finance, namely, that the supply of money should be increased when there is a relative overproduction of consumer goods, but that when money is overplentiful in relation to national production, the deliberate inflation of the money supply by the increase of debt or otherwise in order to avoid increases in ordinary tax rates, is, in fact, a form of income taxation which reduces the value of each £ or franc or dollar of the low and middle incomes by as much as each £ or franc or dollar of the supertax payer.</P>
    <P>I have given instructions that a copy of the report in question is to be placed in the Dáil Library, together with copies of other valuable O.E.E.C. reports dealing with financial and economic problems which reached my Department in the past few years.</P>

      <P>Following discussions which were initiated some years previously, two double taxations conventions with the Government of the United States of America were signed on 13th September, 1949.  One of these conventions related to double estate tax, while the other was concerned with double income tax.  Somewhat prematurely perhaps in view of the powers of the United States Senate, both were scheduled to the Finance Act, 1950, and, because of that, I think it desirable to inform the Dáil of developments which have since taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States to ratification, the President of the United States transmitted the conventions to the Senate. The United States Senate has approved a resolution advising and consenting to the ratification of the convention with respect to estate tax without reservation.  As regards the double income-tax convention, however, the position is somewhat different.  The United States Senate has approved a resolution recommending the ratification <Col N="615" /> of that convention, subject to reservations and these reservations amount to the elimination of two articles, <i>videlicet</i>, Articles 14 and 16. Article 14 relates to the exemption of residents of Ireland from the United States tax on capital gains and Article 16 relates to the exemption of Irish corporations from the United States tax on accumulated or undistributed profits.</P>
    <P>The matter has been considered and we do not think the issues involved in the deletion of these articles which relate to the American tax law are of sufficient material importance to prevent us from ratifying the convention with the deletions and securing its benefits for our residents in this year. It is proposed accordingly to ratify the double income-tax convention, subject to the elimination of the articles to which I have referred, <i>videlicet</i> Articles 14 and 16, and I assume that there will be no objection to that course.</P>

      <P>The position is that I do not really require any statement or any resolution from the House.  I am merely informing the House of the position which has arisen because of the fact that the two agreements were scheduled to the Finance Act, 1950. That is why I feel it right that the House should be informed of the position. I am advised that we do not require any formal resolution from the House, but I thought it advisable to mention the matter to the House.</P>

The Minister is now advising the House of what the situation is and of his intention with regard to it, in view of the fact that there is nothing else he can do about it.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section under which the Minister asks for these powers up to the 31st December, 1952.  In certain circumstances, I might not be prepared to give the Minister these powers for as long as that and in order to put my arguments I start on that note.  Beginning with that qualification, I want to refer the Minister to a speech he made on electricity development when closing the Second Stage of the Supplies and Services Bill, 1951.  It is under this Bill that rationing and other electricity restrictions will come into effect.  Therefore, it will be in order to discuss the matter.  At columns 1817-1818 of the Official Report, dated 28th November, 1951, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There was no new electricity station sanctioned during that period except two new stations in Dublin and Cork designed to burn coal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister was then referring to the three years of the inter-Party Government. I want to put it to the Minister that that sentence is untrue.  It is not in accordance with the facts and the Minister should not have misled the House in that respect.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the 22nd Annual Report of the Electricity Supply Board for the year ended 31st March, 1949, a report which is available to the members of this House.  In particular, I want to refer to page 12 where it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was decided that the River Lee, County Cork, offered the most promising and economical return.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Towards the close of the year a scheme was prepared for submission to the Minister for approval under the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945; the preparatory designs for the stations were drawn up and the preparation of the specifications for the turbines and generators and other associated equipment was in progress.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to stress the fact that the Electricity Supply Board say it was decided but the Minister says that nothing was sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the report that was made <Col N="623" /> in respect of the year ending 31st March, 1950, again on page 12, dealing with the River Lee, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The execution of the scheme for the hydro-electric development of the River Lee was approved of by the Minister under Order dated the 1st December, 1949, made under Section 4 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the previous year it was decided and in this year it was approved.  Under whichever wording you take it, the Minister was not telling the House the truth when he said there was nothing sanctioned during that period.  That was not the only extent of the Minister's incorrectness in regard to electricity supplies.  In the same report of the Electricity Supply Board, that is, the 23rd Annual Report, 1950, it sets out on page 10:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In consequence of the continued and rapid increase in the demand for electricity it was decided to construct two further generating stations, one at Cork, having an initial capacity of 30,000 kilowatts and the other at Ferbane which will utilise the turf produced at Boora and the adjacent bogs, and will have a capacity of 40,000 kilowatts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later in the same report, it says the preliminary work on the design of Ferbane station, etc., was carried out and was going at the end of the year. The report of the Electricity Supply Board for the year ending 31st March, 1951, still further refers to the progress which has been made on the Lee and on the Ferbane stations.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the point that the Minister did mislead the House in his wording, but if the Minister makes the case that he was not intending to refer to technical approval, a technical decision or technical sanctions, I would not agree that it was true and he would still have been misleading the House because he did not tell the House of the preliminary directions given to the Electricity Supply Board during the period he was discussing, the period of the inter-Party Government, to proceed with the design, the computations and the preliminary <Col N="624" /> stages of other works, such as the Claddy River hydro-electric project in Donegal and, I think, a smaller one in Waterville, County Kerry.  Those were in the initial stages during the inter-Party Government period but had not yet come to the position of sanction, so whatever way the Minister has it, he was misleading the House when he was winding up the Second Stage of this Bill.  I think, therefore, that it would be no harm if, before making future statements covering a variety of matters such as he did on this occasion, the Minister took more care to ensure&mdash;because more items with which I will deal later were also incorrect&mdash;that the facts he puts before the House are facts and not reckless statements retailed to him, perhaps, by certain other members of his Party who may not have a great desire for accuracy or be accustomed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one matter and I suppose that this section is as good as any other on which to do it.  Within the past few days the Minister has made an Order imposing very substantial tariffs on imported clothing of various descriptions.  I am not quarrelling with the Minister's decision to do that.  I am strongly in favour of keeping out of this country any goods that can be manufactured here thereby providing employment for our own people and an expanding source of wealth for our own nation. If, however, the State and the community line up to protect industries against foreign competition which can be unfair to the extent that it may be induced by the dumping of goods or by the availability to the foreign undertaking of goods and raw materials at a lower price than they are available to home producers, we should at the same time take effective steps to see that the ordinary customer of this country is protected against the possibility of the manufacturer taking an undue advantage of this.  The Minister has power, through the Prices Tribunal and through the inspectorial staff, if it has not now been entirely disposed of, to ensure that goods made here will be produced with a reasonable margin of profit and not an unreasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> We have seen for many years past advertisements which appear in the newspapers indicating that the controlled price of certain commodities is a certain figure but that the firm in question had decided to sell the commodity at a figure less than that fixed by the Government.  If that did one thing more than another it created in the public mind the impression that there was such a wide margin of profit on the manufactured article that there was ground for a substantial cutting in price.</P>
    <P>I do not want to argue the mechanics of price fixing or the mechanics of trade.  What I want the Minister to do is, if the State and the community line up rightfully and properly to protect an industry, to assure the community that the home manufacturer will be required to sell to the Irish consumer at a reasonable price, and that the native manufacturer will not be allowed to use the tariff as a means of boosting his own price unreasonably, and on the other hand that he will not be allowed to lie down on the job by being satisfied with less than full production. If we are to impose tariffs to assist Irish industries&mdash;and I am in favour of doing that by tariffs, quotas, restrictions or any other means in our power&mdash;it should be conditional on two things: that the Irish consumer will be protected against extortionate demands from the producer on the one hand and on the other that the producer, having got this protection from the State, will be required to go all out to supply the needs of the home market.  I would like the Minister to give us that assurance as far as this or any other tariff is concerned.</P>

      <P>There is a rather important aspect of this matter.  The Minister has recently imposed substantial duties on goods coming into the country and naturally these duties have caught a large quantity of goods in transit.  These customs duties have fallen unexpectedly on a large number of consignments coming in.  Among his many powers the Minister has power to admit goods free of duty and under the Principal Act he has power to reduce or suspend customs duties <Col N="626" /> on certain articles.  In a matter of this kind the Minister naturally has very great power and in acquiescing to the Minister's retaining these powers, the Dáil has a certain amount of responsibility to see that injustices are not likely to occur.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister now, whether it is his intention to admit free of duty certain goods&mdash;certain classes of goods or goods distinguished by any other limitation&mdash;which have been caught under the present tariffs?  If so, does he intend that they will be admitted in such a way that discrimination will not take place as between one importer and another? Under Section 2 of the Principal Act, he has power to delegate to persons other than himself the making of an Order and I would like to ask him whether in the case of admitting goods free of duty, Orders, even Orders made in the administrative way relating to things like that, are made by himself and if not, to what class of officer he delegates that power.  I think it most desirable that there should be understanding on that point so that there may be uniformity and so that knowledge of what the Minister's intentions are may be widespread so that there will not be discrimination, and therefore uneasiness, discontent and injustice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman held out the appalling prospect of the speeches made in the Dáil being subject to the principles of legal interpretation. I shall not attempt to define the exact legal significance of the term I used.  The point I was making during the course of the controversial debate we had on Second Reading of the Bill was that the capital projects which had been referred to in that debate were in the main related to <Col N="627" /> programmes which were of long standing and that it was inaccurate to claim that they had been initiated during the period of the Coalition Government, that is, during the past three years. It is true that the reference I made to hydro-electric development went perhaps beyond that.  The fact is the development of the Lee for power purposes has been on the programme of the Electricity Supply Board for many years and the preliminary surveys necessary to ascertain the flow of water, and so forth, have been proceeding for many years.  There may have been, and I think there were, delays in executing the work.  The full reasons for these delays I do not know.  The contract has now been signed.  Perhaps I am wrong in that. The invitations to contractors to submit their tenders have been sent out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, the Ferbane scheme was announced by me in 1946, I think, on the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act of that year, but the precise design of the power station and associated works are only under discussion at the present time and it is likely to be some years yet before that station is in operation.</P>
      <P>I would, however, like to obviate the possibility of a false impression being created by references to the Claddy River.  The survey of the river has been completed only in the last couple of months and no scheme for its development for power purposes has yet been prepared, much less sanctioned. It may be assumed that the development of that river for power purposes will be in the ten-year programme now being prepared by the Electricity Supply Board but there are some reasons to think that the flow of water in the river will not be completely satisfactory in so far as it tends to dry up almost completely, I understand, in certain seasons.  It will be a small scheme, however, but will have its importance in relation to the supply of electricity in that part of County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> With regard to the clothing duties recently imposed, I should perhaps point out, first of all, that the action now taken restores these duties to what they were previously.  The duties now in force were in force at the same rates before the war but they were reduced during the war and have only now been brought back to pre-war levels.  That was done, not because there has been in recent months any abnormal imports of these goods, but in the knowledge which is common in the trade here that there is in the clothing business in Great Britain and in other European countries a recession even more pronounced than we have been experiencing.  There was a feeling amongst traders that substantial quantities of goods would be disposed of in this market by firms with unsaleable stocks in Britain and other continental countries and the restoration of the duties to the pre-war level was designed to prevent people withholding orders from the Irish factories, orders that ordinarily would be placed now for spring deliveries, in anticipation of these supplies being available at that time.</P>
    <P>We must recognise, however, that the expectation in the trade was that occasional lots would be available at dumped prices, that it was that expectation which was causing the contraction of orders to the Irish factories and that by imposing these duties we are in fact preventing Irish traders from getting these occasional lots at dumped prices.  If they had been allowed in free, then for a period they would be available here at perhaps prices lower than the prices at which they could be economically made in Irish factories, but only at the cost of widespread unemployment in these factories and considerable dislocation of trade.  I think we must be satisfied to strike a balance between maintaining employment in our own factories and securing their products at economic prices.  A small country like this could always get the advantage of occasional lots of goods sold cheaply from some country but if we want to develop our own industries, we have to forego that very doubtful advantage.</P>
    <P>The margins which wholesalers and <Col N="629" /> retailers may take upon clothing produced here are fixed by Order.  These margins are prescribed by Orders under the Supplies and Services Act and are enforced.  Against the suggestion that these margins are unduly liberal to traders, I would point out that they are considerably lower than the margins permitted under corresponding Orders in Great Britain and traders on many occasions in the past have represented that they were unduly narrow.  Until the present trade conditions have eased and existing stocks have been disposed of, I do not think that we will have much trouble in enforcing these margins, because the tendency is rather towards a liquidation of stocks at the present time and I think anybody familiar with the circumstances of the clothing trade knows that to be so.  Similarly, the profits of manufacturers are subject to control and in their case also I think that control will not be a difficult task until full production has been restored.</P>
    <P>I should, however, say that when approving of the recommendation to restore these duties to their pre-war levels, the Government also directed that the position should be reviewed towards the end of next year in the light of the circumstances then existing and, if these circumstances justify it, then the Order made recently will be revoked and the duties brought back to their previous level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say at this stage whether he has got any assurance from the Irish manufacturers, who will undoubtedly profit by the substantial tariff which is now being imposed, that they will not avail of the imposition of these tariffs to push up their own prices above their present level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly.  I mentioned that their profits are controlled but I should, perhaps, say that in the course of the discussions with the manufacturers it was a matter of getting them back into full production rather than considering what further protection would be needed for the public if and when that stage was reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> In the normal practice, when duties are imposed, duty-free licences are issued in respect of goods in transit. I put in the qualifying phrase &ldquo;normal practice&rdquo; because that might not be done if the quantity in a single instance was very excessive and likely to give a disproportionate advantage to one trader.  I do not think that will arise in this case.  As I mentioned, the quantities of clothing which have come in recently have not been very heavy and they are at their minimum at this period of the year.</P>
    <P>The licences are issued by the Revenue Commissioners on the recommendation of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They are not issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce itself.  In each case the application is made to the Department of Industry and Commerce, is examined there in accordance with the general direction given which is, normally, as I have said, to grant duty-free licences in respect of goods in transit, and then a recommendation to that effect is made to the Revenue Commissioners who actually issue the licences and permit the goods in.</P>
    <P>I think I can say that the normal practice will be followed in this case also.  Perhaps I should qualify that by saying that I am not yet aware of the extent to which applications for that facility will be received or whether there will be any abnormal circumstances associated with the applications.</P>

      <P>There is just a slight difference between what the Minister said and what Deputy Mulcahy said.  I take it that if a trader can satisfy the <Col N="631" /> Minister that he <i>bona fide</i> made a contract for certain importations out of which he cannot now escape the Minister agrees, if he made that contract at a time when the goods could be brought in at a certain level, that it would be unfair to penalise him in respect of the decision, that even though the goods may not actually have started to be in transit, where the Minister is satisfied there is a <i>bona fide</i>, inescapable contract, he will make the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  That will apply in respect to goods in transit, but in respect to goods which may not be manufactured, the merits of the individual case will have to be examined because the quantities of such goods might be so considerable as to nullify the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case there would not be an inescapable contract because it could be cancelled.  Manifestly, the type of case where it could not be cancelled is entirely different from the case the Minister suggests, where the goods had not been manufactured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been done, I admit, on occasions where evidence of the placing of the contract was forthcoming, but I would not commit myself to it.  Normally in all cases, with the one qualification about exceptional quantities, goods in transit will come in free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that in the ordinary course of business if somebody had placed a contract a long way ahead for an abnormal quantity that would not be a <i>bona fide</i> normal transaction.  As to electrical development, the Minister seems rather to have got bedevilled by legal interpretations. What I want to make clear is that when the Minister was making the case, as he did when winding up on the Second Stage, that the inter-Party Government had not gone ahead with electricity capital development, he was making an untrue statement.</P>

I was sitting here and I heard the Minister. The position is quite clear.  The formal steps were taken during those three and a half years.  If the Minister is taking the line that the Government during that period were carrying out plans prepared by Fianna Fáil prior to 1947, then, equally, for some years to come the Minister and his successor&mdash; because he will not be there all the time&mdash;will be carrying out plans laid during the last three years.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not responsible for the irresponsible utterances of his colleague which, apparently, have not yet ended, judging by his statements in Strasbourg.  I do not think the Minister has covered the point I raised on this Bill.  Everybody knows, certainly anybody who had to buy clothes, particularly with a woollen content, in the past 12 or 18 months that those who had got goods for sale got the last 1d. out of the pockets of the consumers.  If you tried to buy a suit of clothes or a pair of blankets or anything with wool in it within the last 12 months the last 1d. was taken out of your pocket for them.  Everybody <Col N="633" /> knows that. That is a very heavy burden on ordinary folk, who find it hard enough to replace these things in normal circumstances but find it extremely difficult to buy at the prevailing high prices for woollen goods. Within the past few days we have said to the manufacturers of all these woollen articles: &ldquo;We will protect you against the importation of foreign goods which are in competition with your production.  We will do that, not by imposing tariffs at the ordinary level, but by taking into consideration the possibility that you may be faced with abnormal dumping as well. Therefore, we will erect a tariff fence so high that we will probably catch any possible import into this country of the kind you manufacture, paying dearly for the experiment.&rdquo;  In effect, we say to the home manufacturer: &ldquo;The entire home market is yours; go and get after it. The whole nation will stand behind you by consenting not to purchase imported commodities because we are making these commodities virtually unpurchasable, notwithstanding the taste of the consumer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I make one request: that the manufacturers ought to be required to treat the public fairly and that the Minister should say at this stage, if there is any attempt to exploit the public, who have been exploited badly enough from the point of view of the prices they have had to pay and are paying for woollen goods, whether in the form of personal clothing or of blankets, that the manufacturers must now undertake to give the public a fair deal and that they must contract with the Minister, representing the community, not to push up their prices because they now have a monopoly of the home market.  I think the Minister should say, if he thought there was any move of that kind, that he would quickly reconsider the whole position with a view to seeing what steps he could take through the Prices Tribunal to ensure that the tribunal would compel those who tended to offend against the public, or who offended against the public, to conform to a reasonable standard of prices. I think that should be stated so that the public may have confidence.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that if there is any attempt to exploit the protection given by anybody who will benefit by it, whether they are manufacturers or traders or others, the position will be reconsidered. I am, however, confident that when most of the clothing factories and the textile mills are not working to full capacity, internal competition will be far more effective in getting prices down than any threat or any system of Government price regulation. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that I have a difficulty in this regard &mdash;that any attempt to forecast the trend of clothing prices might have undesirable results. I do not want to make a forecast, but I am fairly certain that an increase in prices is not likely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am personally anxious that the Irish manufacturer should get down to seeing that the home market reverts to him entirely.  I should like to see him get a fair return for his capital investment and giving regular employment.  I think that ought to be the aim and ambition of all of us.  At the same time, while you need not worry about the decent trader because his own conscience will probably guide him, I want to protect the consuming public from the possible rapacity of traders who may say to themselves: &ldquo;Here is an opportunity of getting higher prices from the public,&rdquo; because there is nowhere the public can get clothes except from the home manufacturers.  However, I am satisfied now with the Minister's assurance.</P>

      <P>On the Fifth Stage, may I say that I am sorry the amendment was not open for discussion on the appropriate stage but it is, I think, appropriate to state now that under this Bill the Minister will have the powers of fixing prices, quantities and so forth in relation to the raw materials in agriculture?  I think it is undesirable that the Minister should have that particular power because of the outlook he has portrayed during the last couple of weeks.  Since this Government took office it has been patent, and much more patent in the last couple of weeks that the Department of Agriculture and Deputy Walsh, as Minister for Agriculture, are being treated by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by the Minister of that Department as being small fry and given neither the prominence nor the importance which an industry like agriculture deserves.  I think it is a very bad thing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be guilty of an <Col N="636" /> attitude from which it is quite clear he does not regard agriculture as the mainstay of our economy.</P>
      <P>On the 5th December, I listened to the Minister speaking on the Adjournment Debate and I believe no one could go away from that debate without having it implanted firmly in his mind that the Minister believed, and that was the reason he mentioned the &ldquo;hooley,&rdquo; that the superphosphate that was brought in this year should not have been brought in.  If that is his outlook there is very little chance of adequate or proper development in relation to agricultural production.</P>
      <P>I want to utilise this opportunity, too, to try to get clear something that I failed to get clear in the discussion the other night.  We have had a great deal of discussion about these 48,000 tons of superphosphate.  Speaking the other night the Minister said that on the 13th June of this year there were 32,171 tons of superphosphate in the country under that date.  In his reply he referred to a discussion here on 14th July when a figure of 18,086 tons was mentioned.  But the House did not sit on 14th July and I have been unable to find any report in which that figure of 18,086 tons is mentioned.</P>

      <P>It is probably a clerical error.  I cannot find the question in which the figure is mentioned. I understood the Minister to say the other night there were 32,171 tons in stock on 13th June.  The previous day Deputy Smith, acting as Minister for Agriculture, at column 149 of 4th December, stated that on 1st June there were 23,035 tons. <Col N="637" /> According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, therefore, the supply went up by approximately 9,000 tons in the first 13 days of June.  That was in reply to a question asked by Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>On the same day I asked a question as to the amounts that were imported in each month and in the month of June of this year I found that the imports for the whole month were only 630 tons.  If there were only 630 tons imported during the whole month of June how did the 23,000 tons grow into 32,000?  The fact is that the more we go into these figures the more we are driven to the inescapable conclusion that different people occupying different seats over there tell different stories.</P>

Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, says that 13 days afterwards there were 32,000 tons. Now, even with the little bit of arithmetic of which some of us in this House are capable, that is a difference of 9,000 tons and unless that came in between 1st June and 13th June it could not have appeared.  But the statistics branch of the Taoiseach's Department says that only 630 tons came in for the whole month of June.  Talk about the miracle of the loaves and fishes.  It is nothing to the miraculous manner in which according as different members of the present Government go and look up files they find additional thousands of tons of fertilisers hiding under the files.</P>

    <P>I believe this has become a stock joke across in Merrion Street; people come in and inquire whether they have found any more of the superphosphates that came in from Holland.  The facts are quite clear.  All along one figure has been put on the records by Deputy Dillon.  There have been at least six different figures put on the record by different members of the Government. I would strongly urge on the Government and its Ministers that if they want the public to believe something they <Col N="638" /> should at least make certain that the fact they are asseverating are the same fact and not go about changing step as the occasion suits them.</P>
    <P>If they want us to believe, and want the public to believe, that the statement that has been made by Deputy Dillon is inaccurate, then they should put forward something themselves that is accurate.  It is not permissible, according to the rules of the House, to use the term &ldquo;lie&rdquo; in a specific instance, but I want to say this, which I think is in order, that there is an old saying, &ldquo;If you are going to tell a lie, mind you stick to it&rdquo;, and if members of this Government are going to be inaccurate, then I say &ldquo;mind that you stick to your inaccuracy or nobody will believe you&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I think that the point which Deputy Dillon wanted to stress when he put before the House the amendment that is not supposed to be in order, is very relevant to the situation in which we find ourselves. The Deputy's amendment was out of order only on the technical point that if it were inserted it would be outside the scope of the Bill as drafted.  The Bill was drafted as a continuing amendment Bill.  The Bill does refer to Section 2, sub-section (2) of the Principal Act.  Under that section when the Government made an order, the Minister, who is the Minister for Industry and Commerce, could pass on the power of making it to any other Minister or to any other person.</P>
      <P>What is sought by the amendment is the restoration of a general atmosphere of confidence, so that when the Minister is dealing with the raw materials of agriculture and Orders are being made in respect of them, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is the Minister under this Bill, would, in accordance with the powers in the Bill, see that the function of making the Orders is delegated to the Minister for Agriculture.  The point is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would administer the Act in accordance with the powers set out in Section 2, sub-section (2) of the Principal Act with this added:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Save in respect of Orders relating to the raw materials of the <Col N="639" /> agricultural industry when the power to make such Orders shall be delegated only to the Minister for Agriculture or to any other Minister subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture in respect of each such Order made by such Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has referred to the fertiliser situation.  The Minister cannot but be aware of the discontent that exists in the country with regard to the price of fertiliser at the present time.  I think that the County Committee of Agriculture in South Tipperary had a discussion recently in which suggestions were made, to be based on a formal resolution of the council, that the farmers should go on strike against the present price of fertiliser. A lot of that discontent is based on the knowledge that there was a substantial amount of fertiliser in the country in July last, imported at the figure that has been mentioned of round about £9 15s. a ton.  That price has since gone up very substantially. The Minister, I think, has indicated that the price that is being charged now is one which represents the old price as having been married to the new price.  In my opinion it would be desirable to have the whole situation cleared up, and to have an honest to goodness statement as to the basis on which fertiliser prices stand at the present moment.</P>
    <P>We see a notice from the Department of Agriculture to-day warning all and sundry that cattle and poultry should be fed indoors at the present time because a heavy outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has occurred in some European countries, devastating a lot of their stock.  In that notice there is an indication given that the disease has probably been brought to those countries by migratory birds.  This is a providential scheme, apparently.  Any such scheme as that devised by Providence may well make us shudder when we hear farmers in the Midlands declaring that they are going to turn their backs on their resources and responsibilities and cut down their milk supplies to half because the Government will not do <Col N="640" /> this or because the Government will not do that.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, as I say, under a kind of scheme that Providence has devised, that we might expect some kind of a curse to fall upon people who take up an attitude like that.  We cannot have very much sympathy with that kind of rebellion against responsibilities and rebellion against nature, but, nevertheless, the same would apply to farmers who would deliberately neglect to carry out the possibilities within their powers of looking after the fertility of their land.  While one may feel like that, the circumstances are such that, I think, the situation should be made more clear and should be explained by the Minister. One would hope that he would endeavour to exorcise that spirit.  It is primarily the responsibility of the Minister to see that that is done.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in view of the kind of irritation that is developing in that way, to see whether he would not meet that situation by delegating some of the work in connection with the signing of these Orders to the Minister for Agriculture.  It would be a gesture.  I know, of course, that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes an Order now the Minister for Agriculture has as much responsibility for the making of the Order as the Minister has, but in view of the special circumstances which have been referred to it would, I suggest, make matters easier for himself and for the agricultural community to do what we ask, especially if they could feel that the things which are being done were being done over the hand of the Minister who is responsible for the agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>I would like to disabuse Deputy Sweetman's mind of the idea that the present Minister for Agriculture is the type of person who would willingly take second place to anybody when he is convinced that right and justice are on his side.  I know that, in the course of time, Deputy Sweetman will find that the present Minister for Agriculture is not that type of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> I think that the suggestion which Deputy Sweetman made, and to some extent the suggestion which Deputy Mulcahy made, is based on a lack of knowledge of how a normal Government works.  If any issue arises in my Department which could have a bearing on the operations or policy of the Minister for Agriculture, there is consultation with a view to reaching agreement, and if we find that we have different views which we cannot reconcile by discussion between ourselves, then we go to our colleagues in the Cabinet and get a decision there.  It is no longer then a situation in which each Minister is a sovereign authority acting on his own without consultation with his colleagues, and in complete disregard of their wishes.  May I say that, if and when any question comes before the present Government bearing on the interests of agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a very poor chance of supporting a contrary opinion in view of the fact that there are so many farmers in the Government, with no less than two former Ministers for Agriculture to support the present occupant of that office?  In fact, as an illustration of how not to do things, may I mention, in connection with the fertiliser purchase, that Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, bought 100,000 tons of fertiliser without consulting anybody?</P>

      <P>Surely there should be some effort before a decision of that kind is made to relate the decision to the requirements of the situation and the consequential problems that may arise from it.  The decision to buy 100,000 tons of fertilisers for the land reclamation scheme, when the director of the project thought that 10,000 tons would be enough and when, in fact, <Col N="642" /> only 1,000 were used, was bound to create problems, and these came to a head only during the course of last month.  About a month ago I received a request from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union to meet them to discuss the unemployment of their members due to the fact that the fertiliser factory was closing down because there was no storage for their production. Deputy Mulcahy realises that at this time of the year fertilisers are being produced which will be sold and used next spring, and any shortage of storage at the present time necessarily upsets the normal routine of production. I held a conference between representatives of the union, representatives of the manufacturers and representatives of the sugar company.  We discussed this whole position, and I encountered for the first time the suggestion that this problem of maintaining the production from the Irish factories and the employment of workers in these factories was due to the existence of abnormal stocks of fertilisers in the country.  I set out to investigate this whole situation, and I must say that I am sorry I ever got into the argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The whole matter depended on whether Deputy Dillon's recollection was correct or not.  Everybody knows he just took a chance on his memory and that his memory was wrong.</P>

      <P>There are, and there were abnormal stocks.  It is difficult to make an estimate of what may be required next year.  There is no doubt that the sales of fertilisers are slower than normal due to the increase in price.  That undoubtedly is a factor in the situation.  The price of fertilisers <Col N="643" /> has gone up very considerably because of the higher cost of the imported material.  I may say that the Minister for Agriculture is importing fertilisers this year, the landed cost of which is £20 per ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Dillon placed the order, but it was the sugar company that financed and arranged the importation, even though a substantial part of it was held by it at the disposal of the Minister for Agriculture. The only interest I had in the matter was because of the revelations which I got at the conference which I held between the union, the manufacturers and the merchants, of the existence in the country of a belief that there was a substantial stock of cheap fertilisers which might ultimately have to be sold to the farmers, who could, therefore, postpone or avoid buying dearer fertilisers which are now being manufactured and of which the manufacturers are trying to dispose, and also of the belief that, as a result of representations made by county committees of agriculture, the Government might agree to subsidise fertilisers. <Col N="644" /> My concern in the matter was first of all to remove the idea that there was any intention on the part of the Government to subsidise fertilisers. The announcement which the Minister for Agriculture made in that regard did not get very much publicity in the newspapers.  I wanted to get rid of this idea that there were to be cheap fertilisers which would be available for ordinary sale.  The stock of fertilisers which has been held by the sugar company at the disposal of the Minister for Agriculture will, as I said, be related to the fertilisers now being imported at the much higher price and will be sold by the Irish Sugar Company at £15 10s. per ton for delivery to the beet growers under contract.</P>

      <P>We could have if we had somewhere to put it.  The problem of this country at all times in relation to stockpiling has been the inadequacy of our storage facilities.  Measures have been taken to remedy that situation for next year.  Superphosphate fertiliser offers storage problems.  This fertiliser contains sulphuric acid and rots the bags in which it is stored, so that there is substantial additional expenditure for rebagging.  About 30 per cent.  of the fertiliser held over from last season will have to be rebagged before it can be redistributed.</P>

Nobody knows what the trend of prices is going to be in the future.  All the indications are that so far as superphosphates are concerned, for the next season anyway, the price will be substantially higher than it has been in any recent year.  Arrangements have been made between the sugar company and Coras Iompair Éireann&mdash;and I hope the fertiliser manufacturers will come in on them&mdash;to handle the storage problem, and I hope that by this time next year that will be resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable loans to be advanced, up to a maximum of £2,500,000 for the erection and equipment of grain storage.  As the Bill is short and simple, a detailed comment on each section is hardly necessary.  It may, however, be of assistance to the Deputies if I give a general outline of the storage position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The storage problems with which we are confronted to-day are mainly wartime and post-war developments.  In <Col N="647" /> pre-war years grain imports and, in particular, wheat and maize imports, were arranged on a hand-to-mouth basis and millers and grain merchants in effect used ships' bottoms as storage.  As a result of these two factors it was not found necessary to provide storage capacity for more than five or six weeks' grain requirements.</P>
    <P>The position has changed materially since 1939.  We have now to cope with a very substantial harvest of Irish wheat, practically all of which is delivered to the flour mills within the first three months of the cereal year commencing on the 1st September.  In addition imported wheat and maize, purchased by a centralised buying organisation, are now carried in ships of up to 10,000 tons burden and coastwise trans-shipment from Liverpool and other large ports has ceased for all practical purposes.  During the war years and since we have had to grapple with recurring annual storage difficulties and the need for improving and extending our storage facilities has long been recognised.  My predecessor in office directed that steps should be taken to close the storage gap and I think it would be correct for me to say that the present Bill is on such lines as to commend it to all sections of the House.</P>
    <P>The Government would naturally prefer that the provision and equipment of grain storage should be undertaken entirely by the private enterprise of those firms which have an intimate knowledge of the trade.  It is recognised, however, that the very high level of building costs may render it difficult for some of the concerns to undertake this work.  As an instance of the present inflated level of storage costs, I might mention that a concrete silo which could be erected pre-war at a cost of approximately £6 a ton now costs upwards to £20 a ton, depending on location.  The cost of grain stores as distinct from silos has also increased proportionately and in some cases is in the neighbourhood of £10 per ton.  The Government has therefore decided to come to the assistance of private enterprises by granting loans for the erection, improvement and equipment of grain stores and silos.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> It is intended that the loans will cover a very substantial portion of the capital costs involved in each case, but generally business interests will be expected to contribute some portion of the cost from their own resources.  The loans will be granted on as favourable terms as possible both as regards the rate of interest and the length of the repayment period.</P>
    <P>What I have said above in regard to storage applies with equal force, in the case of Irish wheat, to drying facilities and loans will also be advanced for the installation of drying facilities both in old and in new stores.</P>
    <P>While our overall grain storage capacity falls short of requirements, the deficiency is particularly acute in the case of wheat storage.  It is intended, therefore, to concentrate, in the first instance, on the provision of additional wheat storage so as to enable us to handle without difficulty our current wheat requirements and if possible build up a substantial wheat reserve.  When this problem has been disposed of the question of storage for other grains will receive attention.</P>
    <P>During the course of the present year the milling inspectorate of my Department has carried out a comprehensive survey of grain storage as a result of which we have available up-to-date information on the subject.  The concerns surveyed included flour mills, wheat dealers, wheat agents, seed wheat assemblers, maltsters and general grain merchants.  Expressed in round figures, the total capacity surveyed amounted to 615,000 tons.  As far as could be estimated the amount available for the long-term storage of millable wheat amounted to 380,000 tons, but this figure is subject to qualification in so far as comparatively few grain stores are entirely reserved and available for wheat.  Grains other than wheat compete for the limited accommodation available at all stores except those located at flour mills.  At first sight it might appear that, even subject to this qualification, our storage accommodation available for wheat, viz., 380,000 tons, is ample, having regard to the fact that our annual requirements of millable wheat based <Col N="649" /> on current flour deliveries are in the region of 450,000 tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It may vary but 450,000 tons is the generally accepted figure. Any such conclusion would, however, be mistaken.  A substantial proportion of the storage in question is unsuitable and uneconomic and is only used for wheat storage because we have no alternative.  Broadly speaking, all storage which is not located either at the flour mills or at portal silos is either unsuitable or uneconomic for wheat storage.  This applies particularly in the case of Irish wheat because storage at outside stores usually involves the drying of Irish wheat at a place other than at the flour mill.  The drying of Irish wheat is a preliminary and a fundamental process in the manufacture of flour and it is essential that it should be under the control of the flour millers, who are responsible to the appropriate Department for the quality of the flour produced.  Outside stores are generally uneconomic because in many cases they are too small, lack proper intake and discharge facilities, involve double and, in some cases, even treble handling of wheat, etc.  The additional storage and handling charges incurred during the present enforced use of these premises inflate milling costs and thereby add to the present burden of the flour subsidy.  It is desirable, if not indeed necessary, that our present dependence on these stores should be terminated as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the total storage nominally available for wheat, viz., 380,000 tons, grade A storage amounts to 205,000 tons.  Grade A storage might be defined as storage which in the case of the flour mills is economically and mechanically linked with the milling plant, and in the case of portal silos, storage which is economically linked with ocean cargo discharge. This figure of 205,000 tons is <Col N="650" /> a maximum figure.  It includes some floor storage at mills which might properly be classified as sub-grade A storage, and furthermore, it assumes that the three silos at Dublin, Cork and Waterford, are fully available for wheat.  This latter assumption may not be correct at all times, but it is difficult to assess the extent to which these silos will be used for grains other than wheat.</P>
    <P>Our main efforts will be directed towards improving and expanding our grade A storage.  Many of the 36 flour mills already have adequate grade A storage, but 25 have storage capacity for less than 50 per cent. of their licensed wheat quotas.  The flour and bread inquiry which examined this matter recommended as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Steps should be taken to ensure that each licensed miller makes provision for the drying of native wheat and the storage of both imported and native wheat in the most efficient and economical manner, up to at least 50 per cent. of his licensed milling quota.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the changed conditions since milling licences were first issued in 1933, it is not unreasonable to expect the flour mills to make available storage accommodation equivalent to 50 per cent. of their quotas.  Some mills are already undertaking, on their own initiative, the extension of their storage facilities, and it is hoped that the offer of loans will induce others to follow their example.  Discussions have already taken place with representatives of the flour mills on this matter, and while it is recognised that there are difficulties, particularly in relation to the operation of the present profit control of the industry, it is hoped that all mills which are deficient in storage will take steps to increase their storage capacity.  If not, the Government may be compelled to consider other means of ensuring that the flour mills play their part in closing the storage gap.</P>
    <P>As regards portal silos, the new silos which are being erected in Cork and the recent installation of pneumatic discharge at that port represent a welcome easement of the position.  There is still, however, a very considerable <Col N="651" /> leeway to be made good, particularly in the Port of Dublin.  Our other ports are not equipped for the accommodation of the largest grain ships and it is necessary to divert an unduly large proportion of our total grain imports to Dublin, with the result that the silo in that port, with a capacity of 37,000 tons, is entirely inadequate to meet the demands on it.  In recent years we have had to resort to many expedients in order to overcome the difficulties occasioned by the bottleneck in the Dublin Port.  The need for additional portal accommodation is most evident in Dublin and we are at present in negotiation with the owners of the silo for the erection of a new silo with a capacity of 50,000 tons, to be built alongside the present silo.  This extension should enable us to handle without difficulty the grain imports at Dublin and at the same time should provide some much-needed holding storage.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, our deficiency in grain storage has prevented us from building up adequate wheat reserves.  Our objective is not alone the elimination of the many difficulties which confront us in the handling of our current wheat requirements, but also the provision of storage to accommodate a substantial reserve of imported wheat&mdash;if possible amounting to one year's requirements&mdash;which can be put at something less than 200,000 tons.  Our annual wheat user is now running at the rate of 450,000 tons.</P>
    <P>While the maximum amount in stock at any given moment depends on the amount of the native harvest, it has never exceeded 275,000 tons and might safely be put at 250,000 tons.  In order to cope fully with our current wheat stocks, we would, of course, require storage for more than 250,000 tons, as it is necessary for many reasons to have a margin for safety.  The storage required to accommodate current stocks, after allowing a margin for safety, together with one year's reserves of imported wheat, might be put at, approximately, 450,000 tons. Our grade A wheat storage amounts to 205,000 tons, and there is a further 40,000 tons in course of erection, so <Col N="652" /> that the prospective total amounts to 245,000 tons.  Our net requirements of new grade A storage can, therefore, be put at 200,000 tons.</P>
    <P>While a maximum of £2,500,000 has been placed on the loans which may be advanced under this Bill, it is not possible at this stage to indicate with any degree of certainty whether this amount will be sufficient to finance the provision of the additional storage needed.  The amount advanced will depend on the extent to which private enterprises avail themselves of the facilities offered, the particular types of storage erected and the proportion which the loans advanced will bear to the total costs.  If in the light of developments it appears that the limit now proposed, viz., £2,500,000, is too low it may be necessary to increase the provision in an amending Bill.</P>
    <P>In view of the purpose of the Bill I am confident that the House will readily accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, belated as it is.  It is the type of Bill, of course, that we should have got in this House at least 15 or 18 years ago. I want to say at the outset that in my opinion it is not going to solve the problem.  The Minister has given to the House a lot of figures none of which he is very sure of, none of which I think he can be very sure of.  I do not think he is prepared to be dog matic about them and say: &ldquo;This is X number tons of storage we require and this is X number we have,&rdquo; but it did emerge from the many figures that our requirements of grade A storage must be double what we have at the moment.  This Bill is not going to get us that and the Minister might as well make up his mind to it.  That in itself does not condemn the Bill; it is a start, belated as it is, and it is a start in the right direction.  If you like, it is a continuation of what the Minister's predecessor was working on and had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has very truly stated that the lack of storage, particularly the lack of economic storage, has had a substantial, I think a very substantial, effect on the price of the finished article.  What the Minister did not refer <Col N="653" /> to, although I am quite sure he was aware of it before he ever became Minister, was the dead loss of good native grown wheat because of the lack of accommodation in the way of drying and storage facilities.  I have very personal knowledge of cases&mdash;I have seen cases&mdash;where green wheat which could not be dried and stored, because drying and storing facilities were not available, became almost entirely useless. It was almost a dead loss.  You would want to get a fork to pick it out of some of the sacks.  Let me relate what happens.</P>
    <P>In recent years a practice has grown up, as Deputies know, whereby the farmer threshes his wheat into the sacks and very often at the same time the sacks are loaded on to the assemblers' lorries.  They reach the local assembler, and it is quite on the cards that his drying and storage facilities are completely filled.  At the same moment&mdash;this has happened over and over again; it happens every year &mdash;there is a message to the local assemblers from the millers to stop all further deliveries for three days, six days, or even a fortnight because their storage has been choked up.  That green wheat is then left lying there.</P>
    <P>Any practical farmer in this House knows quite well what is going to happen to green wheat which has been sacked and left there, particularly if you have bad weather, such as we had last year.  I would venture to say that the losses, apart altogether from the increase in the price of flour, as a result of the antiquated method we have of dealing with wheat here would run into considerably more than the sum which the Minister has mentioned in the Bill. The losses in most cases had to be borne by the farmer because very often when the wheat was taken and rebushelled he was paid on a lower bushelling than his original samples showed.</P>
    <P>Let me get on to another aspect. The mills have not sufficient storage or drying facilities to deal with the inflow in any normal year of native wheat.  Some assemblers have made very praiseworthy efforts and some of them have sunk considerable sums of money to increase their storage and to <Col N="654" /> acquire drying plants.  Look at the costly and wasteful way we have of dealing with it.  The lorry load&mdash;the 100 barrels of green wheat&mdash;is brought from the farm to the local assembly, where it is unloaded.  The following morning it is tipped out of the sacks, put on the elevator, and sent to the kilns for drying&mdash;or, if not for kiln-drying, for other drying.  Then it has all to be resacked and reloaded, taken by lorry to the local railway station, unloaded from the lorry and put on the train to be taken to the mill, where it must be unloaded again.  All that labour costs a considerable sum of money.</P>
    <P>I wish to be very brief and only to touch on the general points in connection with green wheat.  When the Minister talks about 615,000 tons, or about 380,000 tons or about 205,000 tons of grade A storage being in existence in this country, frankly, I do not believe it.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is trying to mislead the House.  I know he has the figures before him and that he is putting them before the House for what they are worth.  No other storage but grade A storage will be economic and we have got to aim at it.  It is obvious from the figures which the Minister has given us that we must get, as soon as we possibly can, another 200,000 tons of grade A storage.  I am afraid that this Bill will not get it.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with this matter in a more general way.  Wheat storage is the most important and the most vital. Next, in my opinion, comes storage for fertilisers Some people, perhaps, might even put fertilisers before wheat.  On the Fifth Stage of the Bill which has just been passed by the House, the Minister for Industry and Commerce talked about storage for fertilisers.  I do not want to dwell now on the acrimonious debate which has been going on for weeks and weeks on the question of fertilisers.  That Bill has been passed and I do not want it brought in now, by anybody who has the interests of this Bill at heart, to confuse the present issue.  Deputies on both sides of the House are anxious that the maximum amount of fertilisers will be available in this country at the <Col N="655" /> lowest possible price.  I am told that the reason why we have not more fertilisers available here at a lower price is that we had not adequate storage in the country to house them. I do not accept that.</P>

      <P>It is true of Cork City, of Dublin&mdash;perhaps of Waterford and perhaps of Limerick.

I have been in them during the past 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I did not wish to go into the controversy about fertilisers.  I am talking about storage. I take it that in this Bill we are talking about storage in general and that it is not confined to wheat storage.  I have something to say which may surprise Deputies.  A couple of years ago, when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, we tried to get additional stocks at least of essentials because the international situation at the time looked bad.  I was almost dumb-founded when I was informed that we could not bring in the quantity of tea I wanted brought in because there was nowhere to store it.  It is not a question of wheat storage or of fertiliser storage.  We are told that there is enough storage for only from a 12 months' to a two years' supply of tea in this country.  Is there a Deputy in this House from any town in rural Ireland who does not know that throughout this country we have very substantial buildings which would be ideal for this purpose?  It is true that they may require some reconstruction or repairs.  There are a fair number of old poorhouse buildings in this country. These buildings have big, long wards and good floors.  For years past a large number of them have been left there to decay.  I do not say for a moment that that sort of storage would <Col N="656" /> be the most economic sort of storage, but some storage is better than no storage at all.  I should like to see either wheat, tea or fertilisers&mdash;and preferably fertilisers&mdash;put into these stores.  It may cost more now to do so than it might have cost last year or the year before to put them into some of the nation's old buildings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I am glad to say that we have less use for the old gaols and for the new gaols to-day than we have had for perhaps a century. If, a few years ago, we could have availed of the storage in these buildings, the supplies would have been infinitely cheaper than what we have to pay for them now.</P>
      <P>I do not want to make any difficulties and I want to be as helpful as I can because this is a vital matter for the people of this country.  It is something that all of us in this House should desire to see resolved at the earliest possible moment.  It is possible that I have handled as much wheat as most members of this House&mdash;thousands or tens of thousands of barrels of it almost every year&mdash;and I know the tremendous losses that are liable to occur.  I know the additional costs placed on farmers&mdash;apart altogether from the additional costs on the flour and bread ultimately made from the wheat.  I know that we have not enough storage even for tea.  We had not enough storage for oils, petrol, and so forth, but that position has been improved considerably.  It is had enough to be vulnerable in respect of the storage of goods which we are importing but surely it is much worse not to have enough storage for the goods which we produce at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often wondered what our position during the past ten or 12 years would have been if we had been able to get our people to grow something approaching our full requirements of wheat.  The losses of wheat in this country would have been very serious because we are not in a proper position to handle even the present amount of wheat which is produced in the country.  I can only wish the Minister <Col N="657" /> well and I can only hope that advantage will be taken of the loans which will be made available when this Bill becomes law.  As far as I am concerned&mdash;and I think I can speak for all my colleagues on this side of the House&mdash;we are anxious to be helpful in this matter and will be as helpful as we can possibly be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, perhaps, one of the most important Bills that have been introduced recently and certainly one of the most useful.  Its utility cannot be denied when we consider the kind of climate which we enjoy or endure. Recently an American visitor who was being shown over this country said: &ldquo;You have a swell country here, if only you put a roof on it.&rdquo;  Everything we produce&mdash;whether grain or turf or anything else&mdash;is exposed to complete ruin and loss as a result of the climate. We have to provide against that.  I visited one farm last week and I happened to compliment the farmer on the extensive haggard which he possessed.  He had a very extensive rick of straw, which showed a very great effort during the year and a great amount of work.  He told me he had 80 barrels of wheat still lying on his hands a month after it was threshed.  That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs and it is to be hoped that this Bill will go some distance towards ending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should never be satisfied until we have sufficient storage accommodation for all the wheat we produce. Not only that, but we should have sufficient drying facilities to be able to ensure that all the wheat grown in this country will be dried within one week after its harvesting.  It is unknown what amount of loss has been suffered by farmers, grain merchants and the country generally as a result of damage to grain.  I suppose it is unknown to the general public what amount of damage has been done to wheat with, as a consequence, an inferior quality of flour and bread, as a result of the wheat not being dried sufficiently or dried quickly enough to be in first class condition.  There is not very much advantage in drying wheat after it has heated in sacks, <Col N="658" /> after it has fermented and is becoming mouldy.  That will make inferior flour and bread and the unfortunate consumer will have to suffer as a result. There is no doubt that wheat which has been damaged in the course of drying or before it is dried is gravely injurious to health.  If this Bill achieves its purpose, it will have gone a long way to solve a very grave national problem.</P>
    <P>If we had been as wise ten or 20 years ago as we are to-day, we would have solved it at far less cost in those days.  The cost of building and roofing materials is very high to-day but we have to face that problem.  There is no absolute security that building costs will go down in the near future, so we must face the problem, even though it involves considerable expenditure in trying to solve it.  I was impressed by the Minister's statement that he is relying on the millers, in the main, to provide this accommodation.  Another point was the advantage of having the wheat dried by the miller or in close proximity to the mill.  At the same time, there are large areas in the country where you have not got the flour mill convenient and where there are merchants who could undertake this work efficiently.  If they are prepared to do it efficiently, providing drying facilities and storage, I do not see any great reason why they should not be allowed to do so.  It may be said that taking the wheat in to the local merchant and retransferring it to the mill would involve additional loading, etc.  I suppose that is true, but the big problem is to get the wheat dried as quickly as possible after it has been harvested, and if there is a drying store in a district, centrally situated in a local town or village, there is no great reason why it should not be able to do this work efficiently. The wheat might have to be transferred again to the mill but there again the main additional labour involved would be the labour of filling it up.  We all know that considerable economies can be effected there by the use of mechanical means and the time needed can be shortened very much.  I think there is much in that point, that we should concentrate on the drying facilities that we attach to the mill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> There is another problem that does arise to a certain extent in regard to the whole question of drying wheat and storing it.  It is not always easy to know exactly in advance the exact amount of wheat that may be put into a certain mill or store in a particular week or month.  The harvesting operations are confined to one or two weeks, and it is a time of intense rush.  It would be an advantage if each merchant could know exactly the amount of wheat he was going to receive at his store.  Then he would be able to make all possible provision, and if space were short he could make provision elsewhere.  That is why I have suggested that wheat should be grown under contract in the same way as beet, so that preliminary arrangements could be made for its collection, drying and storage.  There is a lot to be said for that inasmuch as it would make for efficiency in the handling of the crop.  In addition&mdash;though it may not be relevant to this&mdash;in this Bill we are providing £2,000,000 with a view to securing better storage and drying facilities, and it would not be any harm if we provided by some other legislation a similar loan to ensure that farmers would have additional supplies of fertilisers for their wheat, so that they could obtain it on a credit scheme and thereby increase their yield per acre. That could be embodied in a system under which wheat would be grown by contract.</P>
    <P>We must organise this whole question of the production, collection and storage of wheat better than we have done in the past.  We must not continue wheat growing on the assumption that every year will be an exceptionally fine year.  As a matter of fact, I suppose we have a wet harvest almost every three or four years, and we have to make adequate provision for that wet and unfavourable harvest.  The suggestions I make would, I think, help us towards solving that problem.</P>
    <P>It is true that farmers, as a result of high labour costs and other difficulties, have been inclined in recent years to turn more and more to the combined harvester for the harvesting and threshing of wheat and that does add <Col N="660" /> to the problem of drying.  I do not think we can turn back the hands of the clock or prevent farmers from using it, because it is certainly far more economical, from a cost and labour point of view, and much more speedy for the farmer who has to deal with a substantial crop, than the old method; but following the combined harvester, we must have complete and adequate drying facilities within easy reach of the farm and sufficient to ensure that the wheat will be dried speedily and not allowed to remain in the sack or stored elsewhere in a damp condition.</P>
    <P>The Bill, I am sure, has the unanimous approval of the House and I think it ought to succeed.  If it does not, if merchants for some reason do not avail of it, other measures will have to be adopted to provide additional storage, but those who are engaged in the purchase and drying of grain are people of enterprise, and the facilities being granted under the Bill are fairly generous and, I am sure, will be availed of to a very large extent. I want particularly to stress the point with regard to drying facilities.  There may, in some towns, be adequate storage facilities for the amount of wheat grown in the area, but drying facilities may not be adequate, and in such cases I should like to see this loan readily available to threshing millers or merchants, so that they could install these facilities immediately or in time for next year's harvest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that this Bill does not contain provision for the giving of grants as well as loans for those who decide to erect grain stores where they have drying facilities.  At the present cost of building, a merchant must be prepared to invest a good deal of capital in a grain store.  That type of building is very expensive and the fact that loans are available is not just enough.  The abnormal price of building materials warrants, or should warrant, the giving of grants as well.  However, I am sure that the loans will entice people to go in for the building of the larger type of grain store.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see in the rural areas what I might more or less call grain <Col N="661" /> depots where the farmer could store his grain, instead of having to go to the trouble involved in having his stacks of oats or wheat lying out until early spring, at the mercy of the elements and of rats.  I am speaking for my own part of the country where that is a common enough procedure&mdash;the haggards full of stacks until well after the beginning of the new year.  Great loss is caused by that practice and that practice is due.  I think, to the fact that we have not got in the different areas what are termed grain depots.  In order to get these, it will eventually be necessary to give grants as well as loans to the smaller type of grain merchant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were grants, co-operative concerns would avail of the facilities.  It is necessary to have in some of the larger places drying facilities, especially for wheat. I find in my area that wheat has always played second fiddle to oats, and it is more or less bandied around and, if the flour mills are unable to take it, any old place does to dump it.  That should not be the position.</P>
      <P>My main purpose in contributing to the debate was to stress the point that grants should be available.  We in Donegal who are very much interested in the seed oats position, find that it is not the most satisfactory thing to have seed oats stacked until very near sowing time.  The ideal thing would be to have depots in different convenient places so that the merchant in the autumn, after threshing time, could buy up the oats, have it processed, select the best oats for keeping as seed and store that seed in proper condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill, I feel, like Deputy Morrissey, that it is a number of years behind time.  I was rather amused to hear Deputies opposite telling us the stories about fertilisers and I wondered why they did not impart that information to Deputy Dillon when he was bringing in all the thousands of tons of superphosphate last year.  I had a rather interesting experience in looking for storage for that superphosphate in my constituency. You went into a town and were <Col N="662" /> told: &ldquo;Their store is here or there.&rdquo; When you examined the store and saw what it was like, you realised you would not put a heap of manure in it, not to mind anything on which you placed any value.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, in the town of Cobh both I and an official of the sugar company, who had been looking two days for storage for those fertilisers, had to end up by taking over Coras Iompair Éireann wagon sheds, where we stored from 5,000 to 6,000 tons of superphosphate.  We had to do that because there was no storage available in the district.  We spent two days travelling the whole of that district looking for storage and could not find it.  To-day, the position is entirely different from what it was five, six or even two years ago.  The &ldquo;combines&rdquo; have come to stay.  Any man who has had experience of a combine harvester is not going to go back to the reaper and binder.  I think that is clear enough.</P>
      <P>I admit that a large number of farmers want a bit of schooling as to the particular time to cut.  They generally utilise the combine to cut at the time they put in the reaper and binder. That is too early for the combine. When the harvest starts there will be an enormous inflow of grain to mills which they will not be able to dry. There is very little use in storage unless you have drying facilities.  If some of the money that is used up in carting wheat and grain from one store to another all over the country&mdash;I think the grain is shifted five times in some places before it finally arrives back at the mill to be manufactured into flour-were given to the farmers we might get more grain produced.  I am concerned not only with the storage of wheat but with the storage of barley, an enormous quantity of which will be available next year.  At the present moment we are paying from £35 to £40 a ton for maize.  That has got to be replaced by grain grown by ourselves. Again, the combine is going to come into play.  Thousands of tons of grain will pour into stores and mills every day of the year.  This grain will have to be both dried and stored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the difficulties I see confronting <Col N="663" /> the country so far as storage is concerned.  There is very little use talking about the stores throughout the country.  In most cases, if you stand on the floor of one of them you would take the floor with you.  Most of us who travel around the country for the purpose of storing fertilisers know the condition of most of those stores.  I do not wish to delay the House except to suggest that where grain stores have been built they should be accompanied by a drying plant.  The cost involved in this useless shifting of grain from one place to another has got to be paid for by somebody, and that somebody is the poor farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  I have some knowledge of the lack of storage for grain in the City of Cork.  I have seen huge sums of money paid to both Fords, Dunlops and the owners of other warehouses throughout the city for storing grain.  Grain has been stored even in the Agricultural Show Grounds.  On the question of fertilisers, there is no storage for fertilisers as such to-day.  I am not at all in agreement with some of the Deputies who advocate that we should have big stores and big drying plants. My view is that the stores should be situated right through the country where there are co-operative creameries and to which the farmers could take the grain direct, have it dried and prepared and thus get the full benefit of that grain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes sad to see the farmers coming into the mills concentrated in Cork City and there waiting their turn to deliver their supplies because there is not storage anywhere throughout the country.  If some £2,000,000 is to be spent I would suggest&mdash;I think Deputy Cunningham mentioned this&mdash;that it be spent on building stores that are needed in areas where there are co-operative societies.  I am not so keen on concentrating too much storage in the big centres.  Huge stores have been built in Cork and this means that farmers throughout County Cork and Munster, who have no place to store grain when they thresh it, have to <Col N="664" /> come to these warehouses.  With all the handling of the grain that takes place from store to store, the consumer pays for it in the end in the price of the flour.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to concentrate those stores in the big centres.  It would be more desirable to see that these stores are built in the areas where co-operative societies are functioning.  I have such areas in mind as Mitchelstown, Deputy Corry's own area, Lombardstown, Mallow, Mourne Abbey and Drinagh.  I would like to see facilities given for the building of stores for all the farmers so that they might not be all the time going to the combines which operate in the bigger centres all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter whether or not the Minister said it. Whether it was his predecessor's Bill or the Minister's own Bill it is a good Bill and should go ahead.  I think that some of the problems we will have in the immediate future in regard to storage will not be problems that can wait the long-term storage accommodation that will be produced under this Bill.  I listened to Deputy Corry on the subject of storage and I must confess that I agree with him.  Next year we are going to have a very serious storage problem, a problem which certainly will not be dealt with by the storage that will be put up with loans made available by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard I think we will have to try to make some arrangement at <Col N="665" /> least to delay the non-combine wheat coming in to the drying facilities until the combine wheat has been dried and got out of the way.  Otherwise, it seems to me fairly clear that you will have a jam in the drying facilities available and that the result of that jam will be that large quantities of grain will be left in sacks with the farmers with obviously much too much moisture in it and will become unusable. I am not suggesting it at all as a permanent solution for our problem, put I think that until such time as we can get on with the building of storage&mdash;and the Minister will, I think, agree that the building of storage takes a long time&mdash;some method must be found by which the price paid for wheat would increase as the season goes on.  That would mean that those people who had proper facilities for putting up the wheat would be encouraged to defer sending in their crop and would withhold their supplies at the time when the drying facilities were being pushed to the utmost.</P>
    <P>There are farmers throughout the country, of course, who will not cut by combine but by reaper and binder, farmers who have adequate facilities to rick and thatch their corn when it is cut and who, in some cases, have not the urgent necessity to thresh it.  If that proportion of the farmers could be induced, by means of higher prices, to hold back their crop and thresh later in the season when the extreme pressure on the drying facilities was over it would meet some of the temporary difficulties which the Minister will encounter until such time as new storage capacity is produced.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say that our annual consumption of wheat was 450,000 tons.  I think it has risen to 480,000.  The likelihood will be that the consumption will be over this figure rather than under it and therefore the other estimates he gave of storage capacity are more likely to be underestimates than overestimates. Bearing that in mind it will be seen that there is a very substantial problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister indicated, in opening, that the 615,000 tons storage capacity is for all grain. Of course, it is not possible to put grain in the type of old building that might be used as a store for fertilisers. For anybody to suggest otherwise is nonsensical and I do not think that Deputy Corry was serious in the suggestions he was making in that regard.</P>
      <P>I understand that at one period during the war, at the beginning of 1945, our storage position was so serious that in spite of wartime and emergency difficulties we nevertheless had to refuse 50,000 tons of wheat which we were offered at the time because we had not adequate storage facilities.  It shows to what limits we were pushed when in those difficult times we had to refuse wheat because we had not the facilities.  It was as a result of the discussion of that fact by the Minister's predecessor, I think, that the plan for the erection of new grain storage was started.</P>
      <P>I believe that during this year about 18,000 tons capacity in one silo was completed at Alexandra Wharf in Dublin.  Then it transpired that the cost worked out at, approximately, £20 per ton storage space.  I do not know if the Minister can verify that figure or not, but I think it was anticipated that 18,000 tons space would cost between £300,000 and £350,000 then, and I am sure that the cost has risen in the last three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not merely the actual shelves for storage but the whole apparatus for dealing with grain which would be put in that store as well.  If we relate those figures as they were to the facts which the Minister has given us, that we want 235,000 tons grade A storage space, it will easily be seen that this Bill will not be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was 235,000 tons.  On the £20 per ton basis the Minister's figure would amount to £4,000,000.  I think, therefore, that something more than the facilities mentioned in this Bill, £2,500,000, will be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case it merely strengthens the point made by Deputy Morrissey.  In addition to the 18,000 tons space completed this year at Alexandra Wharf another 7,000 tons space was in course of erection earlier this year in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 15,000 tons.  There was another 50,000 tons space negotiations for the erection of which started early this year in Dublin. I think that the contract for the erection of that 50,000 tons space had actually been signed and I was disappointed to hear from the Minister that negotiations were only in progress. I wonder did the Minister mean negotiations with regard to terms of payment and not with regard to the contract for erection which I thought had been completed previously.  In addition, in Cork there were, I think, two stores, one of 10,000 tons space and the other of 13,500 tons in course of erection at an early date this year.  An extension of 4,000 tons in Limerick was, I think, completed early this year and another silo was erected in Carlow for 1,000 tons giving a total either erected, in course of erection or planned of 85,000 tons.  That would mean that on the Minister's figure another 115,000 tons would have to be planned elsewhere. I would urge that in so far as is compatible with the economic use of drying facilities that 115,000 tons would be spread as far as possible over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very undesirable that the additional facilities that will be provided should be concentrated, but I would confess at once to the Minister that I do not know what the minimum storage capacity is that it is economical to utilise bearing in mind the fact that there must be facilities to dry down the Irish wheat to 16½ per cent. water content, which, I think, is roughly the water content at which wheat is milled.  I would like the Minister to clarify when he is concluding whether the 200,000 tons new <Col N="668" /> building space and renovated space that the Minister mentioned includes the 35,000 tons already completed or a-building and the 50,000 tons planned or is in addition to that.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make it clear to the Minister that, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, if this Bill does not go far enough in providing funds to meet all the storage difficulties he will have not the slightest trouble from us if he comes back to us again at a later date and says more is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for the introduction of this Bill is well reflected by the welcome it is receiving in the House.  I would join with Deputy Hickey in asking the Minister to consider the erection of well-distributed grain depots.  Where there are co-operative societies and dairy disposals board creameries, there would be ideal locations for the establishment of these smaller storage facilities.  Apart from the question of wheat and fertilisers, if the people had proper storage they would go in for growing more grain so that they could carry over more stock, particularly with the development in relation to Ymer barley.</P>
      <P>All through the years, as a result of a lack of proper storage, we have lost too much of what we grow on our farms through the depredations of vermin on grain intended for stock feeding.  In the dairying counties, people coming in with their milk in the morning could take back the grain they require.  They would know that what they would sow and harvest would be safely stored and that they would not have to bear the heavy losses which they have been suffering through the years because of the fact that they could not store the grain on their own farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would endorse everything said by the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and who have welcomed this Bill.  The Bill will be equally welcomed throughout the country.  As Deputy Sweetman has said, if an extension of the financial provisions is necessary, the absolute necessity of providing storage will ensure that the <Col N="669" /> House will afford the necessary facilities to the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters on this Bill to which I should like to advert.  We would like some more information from the Minister as to whether this A.1 storage is to be concentrated on the ports or distributed over the country.  It is admitted by everyone in this country that we must produce the grain for both human and animal feeding for all foreseeable time.  Therefore, instead of milling all our wheat at the ports, as has been the traditional practice, we should mill it as near as possible to the area where it is grown.  In order to save transport costs, as a long-term policy, the stores provided for in this Bill should be erected convenient to where the grain is grown.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not tell us in introducing the Bill whether the stores would provide drying facilities or not. As has been pointed out by other Deputies, the provision of drying facilities is necessary owing to the use of the combined harvester.  The Minister and his Department are fully aware of that.  Big problems arose for the last few years and even greater problems will arise next year.  Unless more drying facilities are provided convenient to where the corn is grown grave losses will occur during the harvest. I would suggest to the Minister that he should plan to have sufficient storage and sufficient drying facilities provided, especially in the counties where most corn is grown.  If new corn-growing belts are developed, storage should also be provided for them.  It would be a very wrong policy to concentrate all our new stores at a few ports.  If that were done, it would look as if we intended in future to import the grain we need.  I am sure Deputy Dillon would highly approve of building all the storage at the ports.  I have not a bit of doubt about that.  He may have changed his mind.</P>

If that is not done, the farmers and the nation as a whole will suffer very serious loss. A great deal of grain will be badly damaged if adequate drying facilities are not made available.</P>

      <P>Grain storage has to be provided for the accommodation of the cereals our people intend to use. Those fall into two categories.  One category is bread grains and the other category is cereals for animal feeding. Under the category of bread grains the average consumption of our people has been reckoned for many years as a sack of flour per annum per head of the population.  That is 3,000,000 sacks of flour per annum.  Bearing in mind that your average extraction is in the order of about 80 per cent., it means that you require something like 480,000 tons of wheat per annum.  It works out at something about that. Three million sacks of flour are about 400,000 tons, and if you add a fifth on to that, I think it works out at about 480,000 tons of wheat per annum for bread grains.  This is what I should like Deputy Allen and some other Fianna Fáil Deputies to get into their intellects.  It does not matter how much wheat you grow in this country, <Col N="671" /> if you want to continue to supply our people with bakers' bread as opposed to cake bread, you must import from Canada a certain proportion of Manitoba wheat to get the high protein content to provide the texture of dough which will bake in a baker's oven into yeast bread.  A great many well-intentioned Deputies do not know that.</P>

Before Deputy Allen finally attains to his seniority, I suggest that the Minister for Agriculture would share with him the pain of losing the illusion which the Minister for Agriculture had until relatively recently himself but has now prudently shed, and tell Deputy Allen that if baker's bread is to be made in this country we must have access to Manitoba wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The source which wheat comes from must naturally determine where the transit storage will be located.  If we are bound to bring some wheat in through a port, we must advert to the necessity for transit storage for that.  I think the Minister for Agriculture will confirm me when I say that in the current year we will buy no dollar wheat at all except Canadian.  The balance of the soft wheat will be bought in Australia, and the wheat from Canada, the wheat from Australia and the wheat from our own domestic production will complete our bread requirements. That is the position. Storage to deal with wheat or any grain from abroad can be either permanent storage or transit storage and it is vital to make up your mind before you embark on a programme of storage whether you are going to use the storage at the ports purely as transit storage or whether you are going to build permanent storage.</P>
      <P>Deputies should remember that when they are dealing with grain storage they are not only dealing with wheat but with animal feed as well.  Here is the dangerous error into which many Deputies fall.  It becomes a kind of virtue to say that we should not import any grain for feeding live stock because, says the virtuous illusionist, &ldquo;we ought to produce it at home&rdquo;. But no such dilemma exists.  The fact is that we are able to use all we produce at home for stock feeding and import as much more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you what happened in the past.  The storage at <Col N="673" /> Dublin and Cork used to fill up with maize and imported barley, with the result that wheat and other cereals filled up the provincial storage.  Therefore you very often had in Dublin capacious stores, with drying equipment attached thereto, full of dry grain, with mountains of wheat grain being tendered for storage and the drying facilities in rural Ireland breaking down completely under the strain of trying to dry the grain offered.  The result is that, on occasions, I have known cases of grain being grown in Kilkenny, being sent to Dublin to be dried, being directed to Ardee for storage, and then returned to Dublin to be milled satisfactorily, simply because the big stores in Dublin were packed with the imported grain, which did not require to be dried, and the stores which could have received the dry grain and held it comfortably were in fact being tendered wet grain which they could not safely take until it was dried.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I assure you that it is a matter of very urgent importance to clarify our minds as to what the future is likely to hold before we start spending from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000 on building storage.  If we build storage in the wrong places, we pile transport costs on the grain which at present fall on the flour subsidy.  I think the House would be astonished at what it has cost the community to pay the transit charges on grain from one place to another because the storage and the drying facilities are not suitably located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that in envisaging this question of storage I would implore Deputies to face this fact: that there is no contradiction whatever between growing all the feeding stuffs our land is capable of producing and bringing in substantial quantities as well.  It is a disastrous economic heresy for our people to be persuaded that they do something unpatriotic or wrong in producing and finishing on their holdings more live stock than they can feed and finish with the feeding stuffs produced on their own holdings. My hope would be that the small farmer would engage in mixed farming and, having produced all the animal feeding stuff his holding would economically <Col N="674" /> produce, he should then double the quantity by adding to his own domestic production as much more feeding stuff purchased from outside, whether it be from a neighbour or from a foreign country, and on his holding he should in that way produce and finish twice as many live stock as his own acreage will sustain for the great advantage of the whole country.</P>
    <P>Now, if we are to do that, and we ought to do it because the main product of our farming is meat of which there is a world shortage and of which there will be a world shortage for as far ahead as we can see, our storage possibility should be based on two assumptions.  One is that we aim to produce all the animal feeding-stuffs that the land is economically capable of producing.  They fall into two classes, grass and cereals; I include for the purpose of this debate grass and roots on the one hand and cereals on the other, allowing for the necessary rotation which involves inescapably a considerable acreage of cultivated grass, the most valuable crop that can be grown in a country with an annual rainfall of 42 inches.</P>
    <P>There will also be the corresponding acreage of cereals.  The cereals, taking one year with another, will have a moisture content of between 20 and 24 per cent.  They cannot safely be kept in store with a moisture content in excess of 16 per cent.  If they are milled forthwith they will probably be reduced to a moisture content of about 13.  That means, and this is what I would beg Deputies to bear in mind, rural storage without drying facilities is nonsense.  To erect a store or to appropriate an existing building for storage without drying facilities annexed thereto is to put around one's own neck a blister for all time.  It may not be necessary to put a drying unit in every building but if you have conveniently grouped stores at three ends of the one town or on three sides of the one town you must have a drying unit which will serve all three stores preparatory to the grain being deposited there.</P>
    <P>When erecting storage not only must there be drying facilities but there must be every device for <Col N="675" /> mechanical handling that can be advantageously procured.  Now I am afraid that Deputy Hickey will shake his gory locks at me because here, as in Great Britain and various other countries, and America as well, we have run into the difficulty that at the docks and at the mills our labouring men have fallen into the common chartist illusion that machinery displaces men and we are faced then with the fantastic situation, which, I think, obtained for some time in the City of Cork and for a time at the Port of Dublin, in which there was modern up-to-date discharging machinery, but no one would be allowed to work it because our men, whose standard of living and standard of dignity everyone wanted to raise, preferred to go on tramping down into the hold of the ship, filling a bag with grain there, tramping up again out of the hold and walking the grain off the ship, as was done by the servants of Pharaoh 7,000 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it.  I think some trouble arose in <Col N="676" /> Limerick.  The plain fact is that where this difficulty has been overcome we can with safety proceed with the erection of suitable storage.  Where the dock workers are resolutely opposed to its user, it would be madness to erect storage.  All I hope is that that difficulty will be overcome at all costs.</P>
      <P>In fairness to our own men, I think we should make it clear that the same problem at present afflicts the Port of London.  It has arisen not infrequently at the Port of Baltimore and New York.  It is not a peculiarity of our men alone.  It is being slowly overcome. It is closely integrated with the problem we are now considering. Therefore, in respect of rural storage, I beg Deputies to bear in mind that storage does not mean a store; it means a store plus adequate drying facilities.</P>
      <P>Our storage programme, in my submission to the Minister, should follow broadly these lines: there should be available in every grain-growing county storage and drying facilities which will enable every farmer who grows grain to get his grain dried without being under a compliment to the man who dries it.  The present position is that in many parts of the country, if you want to get grain dried for storage, not only must you pay for it but you must beg the miller who does it for you to do you the favour of taking over the doing of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I suggest to the Minister that he must consider forthwith whether he will nationalise the milling industry or leave it in its present state.  If he intends to leave the flour-milling industry in its present state, I suggest to him that he has the right and duty to say to each miller: The Government is prepared to help in providing storage provided the millers do their part.  Every individual miller has the inestimably valuable gift from the Government of a milling licence. What that milling licence is worth it is difficult to estimate, but it is worth a great deal of money and I think it would be perfectly fair to say to every-miller that one of the conditions attaching to the renewal of his licence hereafter will be that he will provide storage and drying facilities for at least 50 per cent. of his annual <Col N="677" /> throughput.  When you have done that and I see the general picture, I will be prepared to weigh in and try to fill up the remaining gaps in our national economy.</P>
    <P>I had not the advantage of hearing the Minister open on this Bill, but I have no doubt that he was careful, with his characteristic generosity, to record faithfully the storage projects which were in progress when I left office, and which, no doubt, he has made substantial progress in bringing to fruition.  There was the merchant-warehousing proposal, there was the Port Milling Company silo, there was the Dublin North City Milling provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the Cork milling proposal, and I think the second National Milling Company proposal from Cork.  There was Rank's new store in Limerick.  I take it that the Minister has given the House full particulars of these, and, therefore, it is unnecessary for me to go further into them.  The Minister, I know, will agree with me&mdash;I agree with him-that, in addition to these arrangements, it was necessary to get power to lend money on attractive terms to other parties who would erect the additional storage necessary after the millers have provided 50 per cent. of their own. If, on the other hand, the Minister contemplates nationalising the milling industry, which I think he ought to do forthwith, he should bear in mind that one of the most useful purposes to which the uneconomic units in the milling industry at present being used could be diverted to would be as grain stores.</P>

      <P>As the Minister must know, at the present time there are a number of fantastically small mills operating with antediluvian equipment. They are kept in operation by the millers for the purpose of fixing high average costings for their flour milling so that the well-equipped modern mills will earn fantastic profits because they can prove that, if they were required to mill as efficiently as they could, <Col N="678" /> some of the small rural mills would be wiped out at once.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is to be done, there are at least ten flour grain stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the Deputy making the case that there will be more storage if that has to be done, but he, surely, cannot make a case for nationalising the flour-milling industry on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not make that case, but I say, if it is to be done, there will be a double benefit in using these small mills for storage.  It will provide you, at virtually no expense, with quite good storage, in the main fully equipped with drying facilities, and will, at the same time, eliminate uneconomic units.  Last, and by no means least important, these mills are situated mainly in small towns where they constitute a very large volume of local employment and preserve in existence the economic life of the community which has grown up around them, quite distinct from preserving the individual employment of the men or women employed in them.  If you destroy completely and obliterate an industry, or an occupation, however small which constitutes a large part of the economic life of a small town, then you reduce that town to a state of destitution.</P>
      <P>Therefore, sight should not be lost of this.  Taking the economic value of say ten of these small units as storage, to build new stores as good would easily cost you £500,000.  After all, £500,000 is worth considering, and, therefore, I think it is something that we ought to put our minds to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second consideration is this. Our storage must cater not only for the domestic wheat crop, but for the domestic oats and barley crops.  It is quite astonishing the quantity of oats that goes mouldy in farmers' lofts in this country.  I think that any farmer who wants to keep his oats in good condition should have facilities for getting it dried if he means to retain it. I think cheap facilities should be provided for him for the purpose.  Over and above that, if our live stock expansion <Col N="680" /> is to continue on the scale on which it is expanding at the present time, we must, and should bring in, in addition to what we produce at home, very considerable quantities of cereals where they can be economically purchased for conversion into meat for sale abroad.  That is the justification for building permanent storage at the ports of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>If we were handling nothing at these ports except imported wheat, then I think we should confine ourselves very much to transit storage.  It is because we ought to look forward to steadily increasing the quantity of cereal feeding stuffs, of one kind and another, coming in here to supplement our domestic production, so that our meat product exports may continue to expand, that I urge on the Minister that the programme which, I assume, he outlined to the House of 50,000 tons by the merchants' warehousing, the 6,000 to 8,000 tons by the North Dublin City Milling Company, the 13,500 tons by the National Flour Milling Company in Cork, and the 10,000 tons by the Cork Milling Company, should be regarded as our short-term minimum.</P>
    <P>We put that in hand as being what was urgently necessary, but, in fact, on the assumption that we would persuade the mills to provide storage and drying for 50 per cent. of their own. Our additional requirements, when I last calculated it, were 235,000 tons. The programme for additional port storage was 23,500 in Cork, 56,000 in Dublin, and 4,000 which Messrs.  Ranks provided for themselves in Limerick, and the Barrow Milling Company.  I think, which provided 1,000 tons of storage.  That gave you, <i>in toto</i>, about 84,000 tons, and it left about 150,000 tons storage to be built in the long-term programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When were the 84,000 tons provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection of it is that there were 10,000 tons supplied by the Cork Milling Company, 13,500 by the National Flour Milling Company in Cork; the Barrow Milling Company and Ranks had acquired and converted buildings in Limerick to provide 5,000. <Col N="681" /> The Merchant Warehousing were negotiating with us for the erection of 50,000 tons and, I think, I advised them if they did not build it I would build it.  In addition to that, the North City Milling Company were to erect between 6,000 and 8,000 tons storage&mdash;I think 6,000 tons on their own initiative and if they got help or a guarantee of user they would extend it to 8,000 tons. That is my recollection.  It is five months since I left the Department, and it is not easy to recall such things in detail because, as the Minister by this time knows, the preoccupations of the Minister for Agriculture are many and varied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>And varied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Varied&rdquo; is the operative word&mdash;everything from a turkey-cock to the building of storage with suitable drying arrangements for imported grain.  When you come to the provision of the long-term storage, I found that we must be dominated by the sequela of nationalisation of the flour-milling industry or, if you are to lay that aside, by the consideration that there ought to be in every grain-growing country storage associated with drying sufficient to enable a farmer to get his corn dried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this. The provision of money is not the only thing to achieve the purpose here. There is no use persuading ourselves in this House that all we have to do is to wave our hands and the thing is done.  The equipment for establishments of this kind is not easy to procure at the present time, and it may take some considerable time to get it. It should be, in so far as the Minister is responsible, of the most modern kind and of the most labour-saving kind because that is the equipment which will make the operation of storage and drying cheapest for the farmer.  I would look forward, were I Minister for Agriculture, with dismay to the attempt to provide cheap and adequate storage for the farmers of this country if I had to do it in a running battle with the flour-milling industry.  I would look forward to it as a relatively easy task if the flour-milling <Col N="682" /> industry were under national control.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is undertaking a task in which he will find it appallingly difficult to get this work satisfactorily done on equitable terms if the existing vested interests are to be allowed to continue their operations.  I do not think, in any circumstances, he will contemplate nationalising the coarse grain milling business, and I think he would make a great mistake if he did. He would find them as tough and as ruthless a group&mdash;the Millers' Association&mdash;as you could meet in a day's walk.</P>
    <P>So long as he does not cross them they will be like cooing doves; but let him, in the discharge of his duty, trespass on their slightest perquisite and there is no tougher gang in Europe and they will block and harass him to the limit of their capacity, which is not inconsiderable.  He will find it from time to time his duty to challenge their claims to protect the distribution to farmers and he will then find himself derided in public as plunging into matters about which he has no understanding and upsetting the economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>Let me say to the Minister here and now: when that kind of dirty fraud is tried on him, let him rest assured they will find no spokesmen in this House. I had too long and bitter an experience of the reverse ever so to treat my successor. When he does have to challenge the vested interests they will stop at nothing to prevent him doing his duty.  Whether in Recess or while this House is sitting, let him rest assured of this: he can face them fearlessly in the certain knowledge that they will have no specious spokesmen from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck with his programme and I can assure him that I will not minimise the difficulties with which he will have to contend in so far as he desires to pursue this programme &mdash;as I do not doubt he does&mdash;if it provides facilities for the farmer and, in so far as he views this problem from the point of view of the farmer and not from the point of view of those who live out of the farmer, let him never apprehend that he will be presented <Col N="683" /> with dilemmas and challenges in Dáil Éireann.  But I do exhort him to view every suggestion presented to him by the milling vested interests of this country in connection with the outlay of this money patiently but with, I go so far as to say, suspicion.</P>
    <P>Make certain there is not a nigger in the woodpile before you buy in all the smiling proposals which will be put before you by the vested interests in this country, because you will discover, the moment you begin to ask them questions, the smiles disappearing and a very different cast of countenance confronting you.  It should be a source of strength to my successor to know when it becomes his duty to beat down on that kind of challenge that he can depend on all sides of this House to hold up his hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see a measure of this kind introduced.  It is unfortunate that it was not introduced many years ago, especially before compulsory tillage was embarked upon.  I have no doubt that very grave losses were suffered by the nation and by the farmers by reason of the fact that proper grain storage was not available when the compulsory tillage campaign was being carried on in full force.  I hope, when this Bill is passed, finance and facilities will be made available through proper channels and that every effort will be made to ensure that no attempt will be made to monopolise the facilities which the Bill proposes to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister something more about the general plan-whether he has in mind the provision of grain storage accommodation for imported grain, including imported wheat.  We have been importing a certain amount of wheat which took much of the available storage&mdash;the very limited storage-which we had.  We were very lucky that the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, pointed out the very real need for proper storage facilities in this country, especially in the event of an emergency.  The real value of this storage will be to ensure that there will not be wastage in the <Col N="684" /> matter of production, that nearly 100 per cent. of production will eventually reach the consumer and that the difference that exists between the original amount produced and the actual amount eventually reaching the consumer will be wiped out.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying, I would be anxious to hear from him what plans there are for drying this grain, whether it is proposed, for instance, to establish drying plants in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of having grain storage established at many points in the country.  I do not believe in having storage concentrated in a few places, even though it might be better from the point of view of economy to have such big stores in a few places where we could have gear and facilities.  In the long run, it might be better to have these stores spread throughout the country.  This will mean a certain amount of economy in the matter of transport.  If all the grain produced in this country has to be transported over long distances to these proposed big stores, not alone will the grain suffer in the course of transport but it must eventually bear the extra cost of that transport.</P>
    <P>I hope that this grain storage space will also be used for the storage of oats and barley and of any cereals produced in this country.  Up to the present, facilities for the storage of oats and barley have not been good.  Many of the ordinary farmers dispose of oats and barley at what appear to be uneconomic prices at a time when there is, possibly, a surplus of these cereals on the market.  He has not got the facilities which would encourage him to hold these cereals in order to ensure there would be more even distribution in relation to supply and demand.  I feel that, in conjunction with this grain storage provision, the Minister should also put forward a plan to the farmers of this country on the basis of floor prices for oats and barley.  They have a guaranteed price for wheat but not a guaranteed price for oats and barley. They have not even got a floor price. If a floor price were provided, I think they call it a price support programme in America, I feel that farmers would be encouraged to avail of the finance <Col N="685" /> that will be granted in relation to grain storage.</P>
    <P>In the long run, I think it will be of benefit to the country as a whole and to the farmers.  I hope that this is not a long-term scheme and that we will start immediately on the provision of this storage.  I know that it is a new departure from the point of view of the present Minister when we take into consideration the forecast of the wheat acreage some years ago when the American experts asked about our programme at that time.  It was indicated, I think, that the number of acres of wheat would be something like 230,000.  I presume that the average yield of wheat for the emergency years was taken into consideration, and that it was acres rather than production which was considered at the time the forecast was being made.  I am much more in favour of increasing production in relation to the number of acres.  I feel the amount of grain storage to be provided should be based on a certain acreage and in so far as the farmers find it economic, we should produce a certain acreage of wheat, oats and barley.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to indicate from statistics the amount of grain that might become available in any good year.  I think we should take a good year or a peak year as the basis for our calculations in connection with grain storage, instead of taking a year in which there was a minimum yield owing to weather conditions or other circumstances.  I am particularly in favour of this plan because in the long run it may enable us also to encourage a programme under which oats and barley possibly could be mixed with other feeding-stuffs produced on our farms so that we would have feeding-stuffs for all our animals.  The world market price of feeding-stuffs has a tendency to upset our economy here when we have to import these feeding-stuffs for the purpose of feeding live stock such as pigs and poultry.  I hope that in this scheme provision will be made for the storing and drying of oats and barley.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to Deputies on the opposite side for the <Col N="686" /> manner in which they have received this Bill.  There has been no criticism of it.  As a matter of fact, I have been commended for introducing it and I do not believe there is much necessity for me to delay the House in replying to any of the questions raised because they were of minor importance.  They were raised principally by Deputies who were not in the House when I made my opening statement.  Had they been here they would have realised that attention was being given to these matters.  For instance, Deputy Rooney raised the question of drying and storage facilities and asked whether they would be provided.  They will be provided.  In addition loans will be made available for the renovation of old stores and derelict stores and for the installation of necessary equipment. All these points were fully covered in the opening statement which I made.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey and with other Deputies that storage is a great necessity in the country at the present time.  That has been particularly true of the years since the increased tillage policy was entered upon.  Much grain has been lost year after year, principally because we had not sufficient storage.  I have had personal experience of many cases in which corn, after being threshed, was left in sacks and stored, not in houses, but in the haggards actually, for a week or so.  Dampness from the ground percolated into these sacks and when the corn was taken out, some time afterwards, it was found that for four or five inches from the bottom of the sack, the corn was sprouting and was no use for any purpose.  By having proper storage and proper drying equipment, we shall be able to avoid all these losses.  I believe that when additional storage accommodation is being provided in the country drying equipment will also be installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the erection of granaries and suggestions that co-operative creameries should take over responsibility for the erection of stores and the installation of drying facilities, I do not think that is feasible because the creamery areas where there are a big number of co-operative creameries, <Col N="687" /> are not the areas where you get corn production on any big scale.  In the Counties of Kilkenny and Carlow, for instance, you have very few creameries and consequently you have no co-operative societies.  But you have people who have been assembling wheat and who have been in the business for many years.  They are known as corn merchants.  They buy all types of corn-wheat, oats and barley.  They have a certain amount of storage and if we help them, by making loans available to improve and add to the storage accommodation and to install drying equipment, I think we shall be meeting the case pretty well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Minister for a moment?  Surely the would consider a proposal for the establishment of <i>ad hoc</i> co-operative societies by farmers to dry and store grain just as we had <i>ad hoc</i> co-operative for the drying and storing of apples?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We could possibly do that in districts where you have not corn merchants, but you have corn merchants in the grain growing districts who have been in the business for a number of years, and who have fairly good storage.  It may not be classed as grade A storage, but it is good storage, and if we make available a fair amount of money to enable them to install drying equipment and to improve their storage facilities, their stores would be perfectly all right for the purpose of storing wheat, barley and oats.  I do not see why we should start off to make a survey with a view to erecting new stores all over the country until such time as we have discovered whether these other stores are sufficient or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But where the Minister makes up his mind that a new store is required&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to take that into consideration.  We are starting off in the other direction at present by making loans available for the purpose of renovating old stores.  It is very necessary to have them in the country because the tendency in the <Col N="688" /> large grain growing areas is to have more harvest work carried out by combines. Somebody has suggested that an effort should be made by farmers who are not using combines to hold back wheat in order to give them a chance of hiring combines.  That is a ridiculous suggestion, because I do not see why the corn of a farmer which is ripe should be held back in order to facilitate the man with the combine. We may possibly be able to facilitate both of them.  Even before the war years, when you had differential prices in harvest and spring, that arrangement did not prove a success.  There are many reasons why it might not prove to be a success even now.  For instance, a farmer may want cash in the harvest time.  Oats and barley are cash crops, and the farmer may not be in a position to hold them back until the following spring.  Of course I agree that anybody who does hold them back will get better seed from the straw in the following spring, but in the majority of cases farmers require the money in harvest time.  That is why you have practically all the wheat sent into the mills within a period of three or four weeks.  That has been the system, and I think it is going to continue to be the system.  It would, I agree, be a good idea if some of the corn could be held back, as it would minimise the storage difficulties with which we are confronted at present.  I do not know that I have missed any of the points that have been raised in the debate. As I say, most of the remarks that have been made have been complimentary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could the Minister tell us with a little more precision his view in relation to the storage which it is desirable to provide at ports?  If he remembers, Deputy Allen took the view that there is a certain minimum requirement at the ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, provision is being made for storage at the ports. Up to the present 60 per cent. of our requirements have been imported.  We have three ports in the country&mdash;I might indeed reduce the number to two&mdash;where you must have storage facilities for wheat.  Consequently, provision is being made for further storage.  Deputy Dillon mentioned that we were going ahead with the new storage in Dublin and in the other places.  With regard to the 50,000-ton silo that was to have been erected in Dublin, negotiations have not yet been completed though I hope they will be completed in a short time and that we shall be able to go ahead with the building.  I am sure the Deputy is also aware of the difficulties that obtain in condition of their licence, to provide Dublin regarding storage facilities. He knows that we had to go to the Royal Dublin Society to store 4,000 tons of wheat there this year and that we had to take storage from Córas Iompair Éireann.  Apart altogether from the question of the importation of wheat, it is essential to have storage in Dublin because of the huge quantities of flour that have to be manufactured in the city and because of the number of months to be fed there.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary and Additional Estimate. - Vote 50&mdash;Industry and Commerce.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,079,995 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to authorise payments due to Fuel Importers, Limited.  As the House is aware, Fuel Importers, Limited, was formed shortly after the beginning of the war for the purpose of procuring supplies of coal, it being intended that it should, if possible, import coal in larger quantities than the ordinary merchant might handle and maintain a reserve of coal.  As coal became scarcer during the progress of the war, the company was also entrusted with the work of building up reserves of turf and firewood.  The money required by the company for the operation of these activities was obtained by borrowing from the banks, the repayment of the borrowings being guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. originally, the amount of the guarantee given by the Minister for Finance was for £500,000, but by 1948 the amount of the guarantee had risen to £6,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the year 1943 onwards it was decided to operate a fuel subsidy.  The turf which was acquired by this company was sold at a price which had no relation to its cost but which was deemed to be a reasonable price for the supply of that fuel to the consumers. In the course of other years the subsidy was extended to firewood and to coal.  The method of operating the subsidy was to vote to the company each year an amount representing the difference between what it paid out for <Col N="692" /> fuel and what it realised on its sale. The total amount paid out to the company in that way in those years up to 1948 was £6,776,000.  Prior to that year, the loss shown in the company's accounts represented the element of subsidy and fuel prices.  After 1948 the loss shown in the company's accounts was due to the disposal of the reserve stocks which were still held at the beginning of 1948&mdash;stocks which had been purchased at high cost and which were sold, in the better conditions of 1948, 1949 and 1950 at the price which they could realise.  For each of these three years, 1949-50, 1950-51 and the present financial year, 1951-52, only a token provision was made under the fuel subsidy sub-head of the Vote of the Department of Industry and Commerce and no payment was, in fact, made to the company in respect of the losses which it had continued to incur.</P>
    <P>At the end of this financial year the accumulated losses of the company are estimated at £3,080,000.  That figure is arrived at as follows: The ascertained loss to the 31st December last, including interest upon bank overdraft and all overhead expenses, was £2,557,323. The company's audited accounts are prepared on the basis of the calendar year.  At the end of the year 1948, after crediting the sum of £1,175,000 which was made available in the Estimate for that year, the profit and loss account showed a credit balance of £11,075.  In 1949 there was paid out to the company a further £500,000, which was the balance of the provision in the Vote for the previous year.  In that year only the token Vote of £5 was taken.  Consequently, the company's loss at the end of the year amounted to £1,861,275.  In the year 1950 the profit and loss account of the company showed a loss of £696,050. That, added to the loss carried forward from the previous year, brought the total undischarged losses of the company at 31st December, as I have said, to £2,557,325.</P>
    <P>There is an estimated loss likely to be realised on the remaining 1947 coal and turf still in stock.  At the beginning of this year the company held, of that 1947 coal, 224,738 tons and also 30,480 tons of turf.  The coal was distributed <Col N="693" /> between the dumps at Dublin and Cork.  The turf was all at Cork. There were no sales of coal effected from the Cork dump during the present year to date, because the task of building up a new reserve in the present circumstances has been impeded there.  The accumulation of a new dump at Cork has been retarded somewhat, but it is anticipated that the whole of the 1947 coal remaining at Cork will be disposed of before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>From the 1st of January last to the 20th October, 177,000 tons of coal were disposed of from the Dublin dump involving a loss of £175,000. Stocks on hands on the 20th October amounted to 45,000 tons.  The company also estimate that that will be cleared before the end of this month, at a further loss of £28,000, making a total loss for the year of £203,000.  After deducting a small profit of £250 on the sale of anthracite, the net estimated loss in 1951 on the realisation of the coal stock will be £202,750.</P>
    <P>The company estimate that a loss of £83,250 will be incurred on the ultimate realisation of the turf stock at Cork.  That stock at the beginning of the year, as valued in the company's books, was £95,020.  Sales during the year up to the 20th October amounted to 9,500 tons, including provision for shrinkage.  These sales were effected at a loss of £18,600.  The remaining 21,000 tons, valued in the company's books at £65,000, are of very poor quality and are expected to yield only about £1,000 in sales.  In addition, it is estimated that it will cost about £20,000 to clear the Cork dump and remove the mould and unsaleable turf from it.</P>
    <P>Wages and overheads are estimated at £90,000; while bank interest and depreciation come to £112,000.  Certain retrospective amounts due to county councils against the emergency turf production are calculated at £10,000. There is approximately £4,000 due in compensation to the owners of dump sites.  That produces a total of £3,079,323, which has been rounded off, for the purposes of the Estimate, to £3,080,000.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that no part <Col N="694" /> of the cost of importing coal from America this year is included in this Estimate.  All these costs will be borne on the selling price of the coal.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the building up of reserve stocks of coal or similar commodities may at some time involve a loss.  A reserve stock is held against the risk of shortage due to an international emergency.  If there is an international emergency, the stocks will be utilised, and it may be assumed that no loss will be experienced.  If there is no emergency then at some stage a decision to that effect will be taken, and that decision will be accompanied, no doubt, by a consequential decision to dispose of the reserve stocks.  I do not know how anybody can hope to fix a formula for deciding when the danger of an emergency is past.  I think the most likely indication which anybody will have is the commencement of a fall in prices.  It is to be assumed, therefore, that if the reserve stock is held for a period in which no emergency develops, it will be dispersed only when some fall in prices indicates that the danger of scarcity is past.  It must be assumed that there is a risk that in respect of the present reserve stock which is now being accumulated, and which we hope to build up to about 200,000 tons, there will be at some future date a loss to be written off if the emergency against which the stock is being accumulated does not develop.</P>
    <P>The Estimate does not include any provision for costs or expenses which the company may be called upon to pay as a result of the occupation of the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>The ultimate payments of subsidy from the sum made available by the Supplementary Estimate will be made to the company on foot of audited statements showing the actual loss incurred.</P>
    <P>In case any Deputy is under any misunderstanding, I should say that this sum is not being charged against tax revenue.  There is no surplus tax revenue against which to charge it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear now that this is to be met as a capital charge. I have spoken so often in the House in the last three and a half years on the question of fuel stocks, I had thought it would not be necessary again to try to put the facts of the situation before the House and the country; but certain Deputies, for some reason which I have difficulty in understanding, seem to think that, in the question of fuel stocks and particularly in relation to turf, they have something with which they can lambast their opponents.  I do not propose to go into this matter in any controversial spirit at all; I merely want to outline what happened -how these very large stocks of fuel in the various dumps came to be there, when they were put there, the reason they were put there and the conditions under which they were put there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will have to throw their minds back to the winter of 1946 and <Col N="696" /> the spring of 1947, and Deputies will remember that the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947 were perhaps the two most severe seasons that ever struck this country, certainly in our memory. They struck us at a time when we were very vulnerable, because we had practically no reserves of fuel to meet that crisis, and it was a crisis when it came.  In the cities and towns, and particularly in this city, during the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947, I doubt if it would be an exaggeration to say that certain people perished from cold, and it is well known that during that period people not merely burned parts of their furniture but tore up flooring and tore down stairs for themselves and their families.  That is well known to have happened here in the city and a scare was thrown not merely into the people generally but into the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>At the end of that very severe spring, when the frost and snow had at last cleared off, we found that we had practically no fuel of any description and we then went from one extreme to the other and an all-out effort was made to get fuel, by hook or by crook-turf and firewood from home; whatever expansion, if any, could be got from our own limited coal resources; and the world searched for fuel.  In a period of roughly eight to ten months, immense dumps of fuel were assembled almost without regard to quality and I might say almost without regard to price.  Most of it, other than what we were able to secure at the time from Britain, came from America and some smaller lots from other places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Turf was brought from the most remote parts of the country, irrespective of cost, to Dublin and various other centres.  Firewood was brought, mainly, into Dublin at a very high price, and, in the middle of all that drive to get fuel, the Minister and, I think, some of his colleagues, went to Great Britain about October, 1947, in an effort to get from the British an undertaking that they would supply to us a minimum quantity of coal over the following 12 months and an agreement was entered <Col N="697" /> into whereby the British bound themselves to deliver to this country in the year 1948&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;between 650,000 and 680,000 tons. I think there was some question at the time of their being unable to begin deliveries until about February, but actually they began delivery about two months before that, and the Minister found himself at the beginning of 1948 with a mild winter, and, ignoring the British commitments in regard to 600,000 or 700,000 tons of coal, with roughly 500,000 tons of coal in the Park and some of the other centres, with somewhere in the neighbourhood of three to four years' supply of turf at the then rate of consumption in the dumps; and with-using his own words &mdash;at the then rate of consumption something like ten years' supply of firewood in the city.  On top of the 250,000 tons of firewood, 350,000 tons of turf and approximately 500,000 tons of coal, we had coming into us or due to come from Britain&mdash;and it was delivered-something in the neighbourhood of 700,000 tons of British coal.</P>
      <P>That was the situation we were met with and the Minister was informed by those charged with the responsibility of providing turf for the year 1948 that there were no further places where turf could be dumped, that the dumps were absolutely full and that, if they were instructed to go on producing to the maximum hand-won and machine-won turf, the turf produced in 1948 would have to be stacked along the sides of the roads.  The Minister found himself in a dilemma.  I am merely stating the facts.  It was from one extreme to the other&mdash;from the extreme of having no fuel in the spring of 1947 to having too much fuel in the early spring of 1948. At a conference which was held, the Minister was asked to take certain decisions and he decided (1) that the camps in part of Kildare and over the border in Offaly where men were in camp for the production of hand-won turf should be closed down, and (2) that the decision&mdash;this was only a week before the change of Government -as to whether hand-won turf was to be produced during the 1948 season should be deferred from that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised by the Minister's <Col N="698" /> decision in that regard because he found himself with what I have outlined&mdash;500,000 tons of foreign coal, 350,000 tons of native turf, 250,000 tons of firewood, with firewood still pouring into the dumps at that time at the rate of 4,000 tons a week, and, on top of that, between 500,000 and 750,000 tons of English coal.  I found myself in a dilemma.  I do not think anybody will accuse me of being antagonistic to the production and use of native fuel.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do with it?  At the then rate of consumption, we had clamped in the dumps of this country 350,000 tons which the Minister admitted would not be used up under three years.</P>
    <P>There are some Deputies who know something about turf cutting, saving and clamping.  There are some Deputies anyway who know quite well what a clamp of good turf, produced and saved by a man for his own use, would be like if it were left in a stack for three years, much less stacks of turf cut and saved in the rushed period during which there was very little&mdash;and there could not be&mdash;supervision of the turf, its quality or saving.  Turf was rushed from all parts of the country. All grades of turf from the top of the bog to the black spit below the bog were all piled in.  We knew it would not last.  Again, some of us knew that as rapidly as turf would deteriorate timber would deteriorate even more rapidly.  All that was put into the Park dumps and other dumps at so much per ton.  Mind you, it was not all bone dry going in.  It had to be weighed out at so much a ton.  In the natural way, under the climate, the tonnage of firewood shrank rapidly, as anybody who has ever cut or saved firewood for himself should know.  It would be almost true to say that some of the turf after a year or a year and a half under the weather, with clamps breaking down and being remade, was washed down the main road of the Park.  It had to be got rid of.</P>
    <P>I tried to get rid of it originally at the nearest point to the economic cost we could find.  People would not take it.  We offered it at half what it cost. Then we offered it at a third of what <Col N="699" /> it cost.  I could not get anyone to buy it.  It was a question of letting it simply be washed away or selling it to people and giving them the use of it at whatever price could be got for it. Finally, we had to bring the price of turf down to £1 a ton.  There was one rick of turf in Cork which was offered, I think, to the local Society of St. Vincent de Paul or some other charitable organisation to take away for nothing because it was growing grass and weeds.  It would not have paid to take it away.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of coal, you have to remember the circumstances in which this fuel was got into the country.  It was got into the country following on the worst winter and spring we had experienced in our lifetime and when we had no fuel.  We had no processed fuel.  It had to be got.  A lot of coal which was not suitable had to be brought from America. It was some of the most expensive coal that could be brought.  Some of the coal had to be brought in the most expensive way from the freight point of view.  I would like Deputies&mdash;if there are any here who have not been in the Park in the last three or four years-to visit the Park and see the dumps.  Of course, the dumps are very small now, containing only about one-tenth the quantity of coal that was there formerly. I would invite Deputies to go up and drive between those huge dumps and see what coal there is there. The percentage of slack in that coal went as high as 80 per cent.  I would say&mdash;I had a look at the dumps during the last week-that the slack content would now be 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>What are we to do with it?  Get rid of it?  I am not criticising the Minister for bringing it in.  I am not criticising the Minister about either the quality or the price of it but I am not going to allow some of the people sitting behind the Minister to criticise the people on this side of the House regarding it.  It is the height of hypocrisy, to say the least of it, to denounce the people on this side of the House for having killed the hand-won turf scheme in 1948 in view of the facts. I want to know what would have <Col N="700" /> become of the hand-won turf if it had been produced on the same scale in 1948?  If that turf had been given a free run of the market what would have become of the 350,000 tons in the Park?  Was it to be kept there until it was washed into the ground or down the main road?</P>
    <P>I am not complaining of the amount of money that has to be met here.  I confess that I do not know the Minister's reason for bringing it in now at this particular point.  I do not understand the urgency for it.  There may be a reason but the Minister did not make it very clear in his opening remarks.</P>

      <P>The Minister talked about interest.  In any case, I hope the Minister will give his mind on this when replying so that we can finish&mdash;I hope once for all&mdash;this question about fuel, dumps and everything else being bandied about in the way it is.</P>
      <P>The facts are as I have outlined them.  I do not believe the Minister himself&mdash;unless on a point of detail-will question what I said.  Those are the facts and Mr. Lemass knew in February, 1948, as well as I knew at the end of February, 1948, that our trouble was going to be to dispose of those dumps of coal, firewood and turf without completely dislocating home production.  That is the situation.  I am glad that the Minister was able to say that the loss on the sale of the coal from the Park this year would not amount to more than £1 a ton approximately.  That is due entirely, of course, to the fact that the price of imported coal has risen so steeply that the price of the coal that we have in the dumps can be married into it at almost cost price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want Deputies to remember that some of the fuel that was landed in the dumps in 1947 was landed there at £8 a ton.  Some of the home fuel that was landed there, given a subsidy and <Col N="701" /> resold, cost £8 per ton as well as some of the stuff that was brought practically from the other side of the world. Some of the fuel that cost £8 a ton had to be sold at £1 a ton, or become a complete dead loss not merely to the Treasury but to the citizens of this State.  Sooner than see it washed down the Park road we decided as a Government that it would be better to let our own people have it at £1 per ton, burn it and have the benefit of it. I do not think that anybody in this House can find fault with that.  If I could have got £4 or £5 per ton for it I would have got it because it had cost the taxpayers more, but I could not get it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to say anything more than that about it.  I could go into detail about it and say a great many things in answer to statements made during the last 12 months and even during the past couple of months by certain people on the opposite side of the House, but I would like to hear a clear statement from the Minister as far as this particular dump is concerned and have it buried once and for all.</P>

      <P>I thank God that my capacity for <i>saeva indignatio</i> is not dead.  It is a mystery when I think of the martyrdom that Deputy Dan Morrissey was put through cleaning up the messes left to him by Deputy Seán Lemass, as he was after he left the office of Minister for Industry and Commerce, that Deputy Morrissey can have the patience, the heroic forbearance to get up here and say to him: &ldquo;All I want is to let this business be buried.&rdquo;  I have not got it and I do not propose to show it, and I think that Deputy Morrissey is mistaken in shrugging his shoulders and simply saying: &ldquo;This does not make any effect on me; I can afford to shrug it off.&rdquo;  Our people are entitled to know the truth, and although Deputy Morrissey is right in believing that the mountainous dump for which the present Tánaiste was primarily responsible has done him individually no injury in the eyes of his neighbour, I say that it is a mistake to consent to the deception of our people by the dirty, rotten fraud that has been done upon <Col N="702" /> them.  Bear in mind that the Tánaiste comes into this House to-night and says quite nonchalantly that all the Taoiseach said in Cork was a fraudulent falsehood.  The Taoiseach went to Cork and he said: &ldquo;My Minister for Finance is in a desperate position, to relieve which the Government, of which I am the head, must ask the people to make unprecedented sacrifices because we are confronted with a short fall in the revenue of £10,000,000 sterling.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance had said, and repeated, that before this year is done the Government of Ireland would not have the wherewithal to pay the civil servants, and he said that before the world.  The Minister for External Affairs also reported to the O.E.E.C. in Paris, and quoted from O.E.E.C. in Paris a report which has been plastered all over the world that Ireland is involved in an acute crisis which calls for drastic and extreme measures.  There is not a shopkeeper in Ireland who has not felt the lash of the Fianna Fáil whip, and three and a half-fifths of the entire deficit alleged by the Taoiseach, three and a half-fifths of the deficit which the Taoiseach alleged was unprovided for, is now declared by his Tánaiste, and soon to be successor, as no deficit &mdash;a huge confidence trick on our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1948 when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, dealt with this question, the Tánaiste, then Deputy Lemass, sitting on the front Opposition Bench, said: &ldquo;Charge it up to the national debt and you will have come well out of this crisis of 1939 to 1945.&rdquo;.  From the first fortnight that our Government existed the accursed question of this fuel appeared on the Cabinet agenda approximately once a week or once a month.  When items come on the Cabinet agenda they get what is called a circulation, and pinned on the front of the circulation is a blue page which sets out the style and title of the matters set out on the agenda and the style and title of this matter tended to grow and grow with the passage of the weeks.  Ultimately it came to be known by members of the Cabinet as Briscoe's coal.  Many a time when this item appeared I turned to the Taoiseach and said: &ldquo;Oh God, is this <Col N="703" /> Briscoe's goal again&rdquo;?  Why?  Because at the first Cabinet meeting I attended as a Minister of the Irish Republic one of the first questions to be decided was whether the Minister for Finance should issue a cheque for the commission payable to Deputy Briscoe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Among those who accepted that offer&mdash;and the initiative came from the Minister&mdash;was Deputy Briscoe in association with some others.  In any case, coal came in, and I remember some of it was still coming in when we formed the Government.  It was very expensive coal and I think it was the coal that ultimately poisoned the seals in the pond in the Zoo, and the fish to book. We then discovered that sulphurous content was washed down the gutters in the Park, flowed down the channels into the pond in the Zoo, and the seals drank it and were carried away in a fainting condition and subsequently died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That coal sat in the Park, and it was offered to the gas company; it was offered to the Electricity Supply Board; it was offered to anybody who would buy it, and it was one of the few matters on which unanimity was secured in this country, not in Parliament, but amongst the plain people of Ireland, that in the whole 3,000,000 of them, corporately or individually, you could not get anyone to take it away, and I believe some of it is there still.  When the price of coal began to go up to the price at which it is at present standing then <Col N="705" /> some of it became saleable and it was disposed of.</P>
    <P>When I think that every blooming ton of this rubbish was brought in before we ever entered office and that the atmosphere sought to be created by the prophets of the Fianna Fáil Party is that this is one of the problems that they have to wind up, I must say that it is one of the multitude of blisters that were left on our neck by Fianna Fáil when they went out of office.</P>
    <P>I have only begun on the coal.  Wait until I tell you the story of the blocks and I want to emphasise that this represents 3.5 fifths of the whole case that has been made by the Fianna Fáil Government that this country is bankrupt.  Is there no limit to the shameless indecency of the Tánaiste? Is he not ashamed to have been part of a dirty campaign around this country to maintain that it is bankrupt, knowing in his heart that he meant to come in here and declare that what the Leader of the Oppostion said was true, that that was a capital item which every sound financier in the State insists should be paid for out of borrowed money to be paid back over 30 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just rejoicing that I am not at middle age yet because <i>saeva indignatio</i> poorly describes my reaction to the indecency of his performance here to-day.  Remember this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, he did not think it necessary to mention that this item was to be capitalised until he was <Col N="706" /> pressed.  His charming disingenuous way of announcing that interesting fact was to say that there was not enough revenue to meet this item and that it was therefore proposed to make it the subject of a loan transaction. That may be good enough for what sits behind him.  That may be good enough for a silver jubilee celebration of Fianna Fáil but he is standing in the Irish Parliament now.  Does he think he can get away with it?  Cantering around the stage of the Capitol just to show what he would look like when the present Taoiseach is in the Park is one thing but occupying his seat in Dáil Éireann is another.  Here, after his jubilee speeches, he will be called to account.</P>
      <P>Now let me tell the story of the blocks, because that was a princely transaction.  When we came into office there was in Phoenix Park the plethora of fuel that Deputy Morrissey has described but into Phoenix Park there were then streaming every day hundreds of lorry loads of logs.  Now, the basis on which those logs were produced was that, assuming we got the full sale price prescribed for them, the Treasury reckoned to lose £3 a ton. That was the extent of the subsidy on the blocks delivered in Phoenix Park. They were coming in at the rate of 4,000 tons a week at a time when Deputy Lemass, as he then was, told this House that there was ten years' supply of logs in the Phoenix Park. Will Dáil Éireann be surprised that Deputy Morrissey caused investigation to be made as to why 4,000 tons of logs per week were still coming into Phoenix Park when his predecessor de clared that there was ten years' supply there already and when there was a loss of £3 per ton by way of subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now allege-let it be controverted if the Tánaiste dares to controvert it-that the facts are these, and they are a tragic story: When the emergency of the war period closed, a number of fellows who had gone into the Army and spent three or four years there with little or no earning capacity, got their gratuities when they came out.  There was this fuel problem and wanting to be independent men, not beholden to anybody, with great courage, they took their gratuities, they bought lorries, <Col N="707" /> they contacted some friend or trustworthy person in a forestry area in the country, they got the timber cut below and they carted it to the Park, sold it to Fuel Importers in the Park and divided the profits between themselves and whoever was associated with them. All honour to them for being impatient to get on their own feet and earn their own living and not be a burden on anybody. In October, 1947, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass, reported to the Government that there was too much timber in the Park and that they ought to stop the influx of logs.  Now Deputies will remember that the General Election of 1948 was precipitated by the by-elections in Tipperary and South Mayo. Look at poor Deputy Ó Briain smiling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision was taken that it would be highly inconvenient to stop the boys bringing logs into the Park or the chaps cutting the logs down the country this side of the general election and it would be as well to let things rip.  If my memory serves me right, the loss was about £3 a ton on the logs.  That was the convenanted loss; that was the subsidy.  There were 4,000 tons a week coming in.  For 18 weeks the Treasury deliberately undertook a loss of £12,000 a week on the assumption that they would be able to sell the logs at the price, although there was ten years' supply in the Park.  Now, here is the tragedy: that 18 weeks represented a total loss to the Treasury of between £200,000 and £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it became our duty to stop that business we found ourselves confronted at once with the problem that all these poor chaps who had put their gratuity into a lorry suddenly <Col N="708" /> found that there was no use for the lorry.  If that body of men there had had the moral courage to do in October what we were bound to do the following March they could have gone to every one of these ex-servicemen, bought back their lorries from them at 100 per cent. of the price they had paid for them, given back into their hands their gratuities and still have saved the Treasury money.  But, instead of that, they continued to bring those logs into the Phoenix Park until we came into office and many of the poor chaps who put their gratuity into a lorry found themselves with a lorry, the resale price of which would not pay off the instalments still due upon it. Their whole gratuity was gone, their little enterprise was sunk, and Fianna Fáil was able to say when the general election was over: &ldquo;If we were beat it was not by leaving a stone unturned. We thought of everything and made provision, but we got beat on the merits.  There was nothing we could have done that we did not do.&rdquo;  If their peace of mind was worth the price paid for it, they are even less than I think they are, and, God knows, that is pretty little.  That was one of the most cynical, one of the most cruel, one of the most shameful things that ever came under my notice.</P>
    <P>Of course the truth of it is that, like the fools we were, for the last three and a half years we were working too hard to have time to tell these stories. But, with the help of God, the members of the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil will stir any <i>saeva indignatio</i> I have and, when an excess of charity imposes silence on my colleagues, I will be here to fill in the gaps and to let the truth be told.</P>
    <P>Hand-won turf!  Do Deputies forget Deputy Aiken from those benches over there proclaiming the institution of an industry second only to Guinness's brewery and a greater source of employment than the agricultural industry? He said that on a Supplementary Estimate for the purchase of 250,000 empty sacks in which to win hand-won turf.  He had one of them here and held it up.  It was above seven feet long and printed on it in black letters was &ldquo;Irish hand-won turf.&rdquo;  I heard him say from those benches that this <Col N="709" /> would yet be an industry in this country second only to agriculture in its power to give remunerative employment to our people.  That came before the Committee of Public Accounts, and if anyone is sufficiently interested in it he can look up the records where I reiterated the prophecy I made in this House on the occasion of Deputy Aiken's <i>démarche,</i> amidst the execration of Fianna Fáil, that &ldquo;the day will yet come when all we will have left whereby to remember this new departure is the remnant of empty bags that this Estimate is designed to finance.&rdquo;  But the time came when we had not even the empty bags&mdash;they disappeared with the turf.  I do not know what became of them.  They scarcely melted although most of the turf melted.  If anyone who is in doubt about that goes to Deputy McGrath of Cork City he will take him by the hand and show him over about 4,000 tons of turf which melted.  It is below in Cork City and no one will take a present of it.  The lowest tender to cart it away and dump it daunted even the most extravagant Minister that could be found to examine the question.</P>
    <P>Have you no shame?  Is there no Fianna Fáil Deputy sufficiently ashamed of this business to get up and say that he will stand for a lot, but that this has hit the jackpot?  Are Deputies not ashamed to go back to their constituents and admit to them: &ldquo;We were taken for a ride; we were told the country was bankrupt because this £3,250,000 had to be found this year&rdquo;? In Dáil Éireann the Tánaiste slapped them across the face and said: &ldquo;We told them that because it was necessary to keep them quacking down the country, but we never meant it.&rdquo; They are sitting there like graven images. Are they ashamed or cross?  I doubt if they knew the meaning of what he said.  I have never seen men in my lifetime so humiliated as Fianna Fáil have been this night.  Just imagine being sent down to tell your own constituents that this was the financial truth as explained to you by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, and having to go back this week-end and tell them that you were taken for a ride, you were used as <Col N="710" /> stooges in the confidence that you would not find out, and in the hope that the Opposition would not expose it.</P>
    <P>Surely for men and women elected to this House as representatives of the Irish people there is some degree of degradation to which you will not submit. Surely there is some stage at which one at least of the Fianna Fáil Deputies will stand up and say: &ldquo;I am here by the suffrage of the people and not by the licence of any individual, however ambitious or energetic, and I will not be used as a dishcloth to wipe up the messes whenever the Tánaiste thinks it necessary to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party was it right to deceive our people in regard to this fundamental question as to whether profligate mismanagement of public money had confronted this country with a true financial crisis? Was it right deliberately to mislead them?  Was it right to use Fianna Fáil Deputies to do it?  Is there a man amongst them who will call the Tánaiste to account and ask him to-night: &ldquo;Why did you order us to tell our friends in the country that the liability for this sum gave the Minister for Finance sleepless nights and caused the Taoiseach to apprehend an imminent financial and economic catastrophe for Ireland, when it was all a shameless fraud?&rdquo;  Oh, I do not mind the busted flush.  The busted flush will take anything in order to hang on to the coat-tails of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, or anybody else who will have them on their coat-tails. One of them has crept into his pocket.  I suppose all the rest are travelling that road too.</P>

I think, ultimately, Deputy Morrissey, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, sanctioned a sale price of £1 per ton.  We even had some qualms of conscience then that those who bought them would have to use one-half of them to burn the other half.</P>

He is flying for his life now like a scalded cat, because there are Deputies here who are not impressed by all this frothy dribbling fury.  What case had he to make?  He had no case.  Deputy Morrissey put the position fairly clearly when he said at the very outset that this country faced a very abnormal position in 1947, an abnormal winter, in which all the fuel resources were completely exhausted.  Is there any blame to the Minister in charge of the economic affairs of the country because he set out with all the forces he could command to accumulate supplies of fuel when he saw the <Col N="712" /> position in which the people were in 1946 and particularly in the winter of 1947?</P>

Was not the only thing that any conscientious Minister could do to go out and accumulate all the fuel he could?  The one charge of which the Minister is accused to-night by Deputy Dillon is that he accumulated too much fuel and that he was not sufficiently optimistic to think that after an exceptionally severe winter there would be an exceptionally mild one.  Was it not possible that the winter 1947-48 might have been just as severe?  If the then Minister had failed to accumulate supplies would he not be condemned now not alone by the Opposition but by every section of the community?  It was excusable to fail in 1946 because no one anticipated the severe winter of 1947, but there would have been no excuse for him if he had failed to secure supplies in the following winter.  The crime he is now accused of is that he accumulated too great supplies.</P>

      <P>Cheap maize from America.  He did not get cheap maize or cheap coal.  The result was we had no fuel last year and we had to get the county councils and everybody else to produce fuel for us.  There has been a lot of talk about having to sell these wood blocks for £1 a ton.  The fact of the matter is that firewood which had accumulated here in the city was worth at least £3 per ton when it was sold for £1 per ton.  It was sold at £1 per ton in order to discredit the previous Government.  Although I was not opposed to the inter-Party Government at the time I told them they were making a mistake and I told them that, in order to make political propaganda, they were liquidating an asset which could be useful to the people.  I know farmers in my own constituency who had timber on their own land but they came up to Dublin with lorries and bought this timber at £1 per ton because it was very good value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was wilful waste to liquidate the timber at that price, and I will tell the House why.  Deputy Dillon believed that there would be no end to the cheap coal with which John Bull was going to supply us.  He had put his faith in the unlimited generosity of John Bull, and said: &ldquo;We will get rid of our native supplies of timber, turf and other fuel.&rdquo;  If Deputy Dillon's fellow Ministers had not been so foolish at to listen to his brawling and bellowing they would, during 1948 when coal was coming in at a relatively low price, have set out to accumulate supplies of it, and would have used up the supplies of timber, turf and coal which they had in existence during that year.  If they had done that, they would have been in a far better position than they found themselves in later.  However, I trust the position <Col N="714" /> now is that never again will Deputy Dillon be able to dictate the economic policy of this country in regard to peat, wheat or beet.  He said that these projects had gone up a spout.  I think that Deputy Dillon has gone up a spout now, and it is a good way to have him.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that in this debate, and on this important subject, Deputy Dillon could not refrain from making a personal attack on another Deputy in the House.  Is there any limit to the malice of this particular man who will insist on dragging the reputation of this House in the gutter with his slanders, and without any thought of charity for a fellow Deputy?  Some people say that Deputy Dillon's slanders of another Deputy do not matter very much, because he does it every other day and nobody believes him.  But I had this experience.  I went into a hairdressing establishment in this city a couple of years ago and I heard the distinguished operator, the hairdresser, tell one of his clients about the awful scandal which had happened and which had been exposed by the Minister in which a Deputy had got lime by fraud.  Everyone in this House knew that that charge was false, and knew that it was a malicious lie.  Yet, it was swallowed and accepted by people in the City of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of other matters arising on the Estimate which, I think, are worthy of consideration. <Col N="716" /> Deputies are familiar with a fuel problem, particularly during periods of shortages of fuel supplies and severe weather.  It is easy enough to discuss a fuel problem when supplies are plentiful and when the weather is not severe.  Last winter, the fuel supply position seemed uncertain and, just as in 1946-47, when efforts were directed towards getting supplies of fuel almost at any price and anywhere, public attention was focussed on it.  When, however, the crisis passes, nobody bothers thinking about the problem except, I suppose, when an Estimate for payment is presented to the House, or when the matter comes before the Dáil in some other way.</P>
      <P>I believe that the whole fuel supply position merits consideration, not merely from the point of view of the high cost of imported fuels, but especially from the point of view of fuel economy&mdash;in the use of fuels.  In other countries, where fuel supplies have been difficult, they have developed new techniques and new methods in order to conserve supplies.  I do not think that anybody, knowingly, wastes fuel in this country, but I think it is no exaggeration to say that we are wasteful in the economic utilisation of fuel.  I believe that an investigation should be conducted into fuel economy, and that the fuel problem should be considered as a whole, not only from the point of view of solid fuels but from the point of view as to what co-ordinated plan should be adopted by the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna and any other body with responsibility in the matter, in order to conserve available supplies and so make the maximum use of these for domestic and other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other correlated aspect of that matter is that, in any new trade agreement with Britain, the coal supply position will inevitably be the subject of discussion.  With the change in prices for fuels and the increased cost, I believe that considerable care will require to be exercised in order to safeguard our position and ensure that, whatever arrangement is adopted, will enable us in the future to have a reasonable guarantee of minimum supplies, especially when <Col N="717" /> supplies from elsewhere are both difficult to procure and extremely costly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Minister must have&mdash;I believe that he has it at his finger-tips&mdash;much more interesting information and figures than he gave to the House in the simple manner in which he introduced this fairly large Estimate.  I am also satisfied, from what he admitted in the House last week, that this Estimate is being pressed for now because the banks are pressing him to clear up whatever is due to them in the shape of interest payments or other moneys.  That, I suppose, is in accordance with the policy of the banks, who appear to oppose this Government in regard to their dealings with other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister what is the full period covered by every item included in this Estimate.  This is obviously what one could describe as a carry-forward Estimate.  I would like to know from the Minister the date from which this Estimate originated, either in regard to money borrowed from the banks or interest charges due to the banks.  Are we to take it from what the Minister said that some portion of this Estimate covers the period from 1943 onwards?</P>

      <P>I think it is in the interests of the people who may be called upon to pay some portion of this loss that they should know what approximately is the portion or percentage of the losses over the whole of the period covered by this Estimate, in regard to turf, timber and coal, separately if the Minister has that information.  I am sure he has the information or that he can get it from his official advisers.  Could the Minister <Col N="718" /> give the House any information&mdash;and this would be very interesting for future reference at any rate &mdash; in regard to the percentage covering production costs, transport, delivery, administration and wastage?  Wastage must cover or represent a very high portion of the total losses involved since this scheme came into operation in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have been in the House when Deputy Morrissey gave us the very interesting information that a very big portion of the turf which still, apparently, lies in the turf clamp at Cork, would not be taken away for nothing by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and by other charitable organisations in that city. That is worse than selling it at £1 per ton.  I would press the Minister also to let the House and the country know what portion of this Estimate, totalling £3,097,995, represents accumulated interest, and if it is correct to state the compound interest on moneys borrowed since the commencement of this campaign by fuel importers.  Can it be possible, for instance, that one-fifth of the total amount of money which we are now being asked to pass at the request of the Minister represents, or covers, accumulated interest or compound interest?  In any case, what is the total interest due to the banks and for which they now appear to be pressing, according to the statement made by the Minister here in the House last week?  I do not want to delay the House or to hold up the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister, and I hope he will not regard my request as unreasonable, for figures which the taxpayers of the country are entitled to get.  According to what the Minister now admits, in a casual way in reply to a query by Deputy Cosgrave, this money, instead of being passed on to the taxpayer by way of increased taxation, is now going to be met by borrowing. It is very interesting to hear from the Minister that we are going to borrow £3,097,995 and to pay back to the banks a very big sum for interest charges.  Are we going to pay them <Col N="719" /> further interest on the interest which we already owe them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To-night we are being asked to agree to pay to the capital debt a further £3,000,000.  This, of course, arises from the fuel muddle of 1946 and 1947, which eventually faced the inter-Party Government in 1948 and which they had to straighten out. When it was necessary for the inter-Party Government to take action at that time the Fianna Fáil Party made political propaganda out of it and complained that the inter-Party Government had stopped the hand-won turf scheme and had caused unemployment in the country.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at that time Mr. Lemass, realised the difficulties which were going to face the country if the stocking of turf in the Park continued, apart from the stocking there of coal and timber, he came to the stage when he found it necessary to face up to the situation, and to call a halt to the programme of piling up stocks in the Phoenix Park fuel dump. I think it is most unfortunate that advantage should have been taken of this £3,000,000 by the present Minister for Finance during the last few months in order to create the impression that this country was bankrupt and that we were in a state of financial chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This £3,000,000 was used in his little argument and the result is that a considerable trade depression has come about and that unemployment has reached a figure higher than it ever reached at any time since the inter-Party Government took office.  It is just as well that we have at last reached the day when the Fianna Fáil lie is exposed.  It was a lie that was created in the minds of our people regarding the Phoenix Park fuel problem. The inter-Party Government faced up to the problem at that time and they found it necessary to sell this fuel at a loss rather than allow it run down the drain.  We all see coal running down the drain after a heavy rainfall.  Coal was decomposing in the Phoenix Park fuel dump, but the turf was mouldering even more rapidly than the coal.  We were faced with ten years' supply of fuel.  On the very day on which the <Col N="720" /> inter-Party Government took office, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out that there were huge stocks of turf in the Phoenix Park and that it would be advisable to dispose of that turf as soon as we could.  He said it would eventually show a loss, being perishable, if it were allowed to remain in the Phoenix Park for a long period.  This statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-night makes it clear once and for all to those who were engaged in the hand-won turf scheme the reason why the scheme was abandoned in 1948.  It also makes clear to those who were engaged in the production of timber fuel and the haulage of timber why those activities also were brought to a standstill early in 1948.  In 1947, apparently, the Fianna Fáil Government were overtaken by panic because during the winter of 1946 there was a desperate shortage of fuel in this country.  Every day in the week we read, particularly letters in the newspapers from people advising how, first of all, to burn turf and, secondly, how to make a good fire from the fuel that existed at that time. They had all kinds of recipes.  It all arose from the fact that we had a very hard winter and the Government were caught out; it was only when the hard winter came that it was found they did not make proper arrangements to ensure that there would be a sufficiency of fuel for our people.</P>
    <P>But that was no excuse for the campaign which they undertook after the winter of 1946 and the early spring of 1947.  It was no excuse for them to embark on a fuel production programme which resulted, in less than 12 months, in the production of a ten-year supply, including hand-won turf, a small amount of machine-won turf, timber fuel and imported coal.  We all remember the racket which appeared to be going on then in regard to imported coal.  Truck owners were able to earn something like £13 a day drawing that coal into the park under contract with the importers of the coal.  In the long run, all that had to be borne by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This action here to-night, when we are asking for this £3,000,000 to be transferred to the capital account <Col N="721" /> instead of asking the taxpayers to bear the burden, reveals the whole story. It was thought from statements made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, that the revenue for this year was going to show a loss which included £63,080,000.  He has now considered it wiser not to show these figures in his budgetary account in the matter of current expenditure when it comes to the time for him to produce figures again.  It is just as well that it became necessary for the present Government to admit this loss and give an opportunity to the House whereby the circumstances which brought about the loss can be debated and discussed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to add any more to what has been said, but I approve of the action now taken.  I think it is the only action that can be taken in the circumstances.  I would not be in favour of advocating that the taxpayers of this country should pay through the nose for what now has proved to have been outlandish folly on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government. Possibly, this campaign of fuel production, particularly in the latter part of 1947 and early in 1948, was pursued for the purpose of deceiving the people and creating a kind of false prosperity.  But who was paying for that false prosperity in the matter of haulage and supplying the money for this timber and turf that was being produced?  It was the people themselves who were actually paying for that prosperity that was deliberately created prior to the general election which took place early in 1948.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted now that this fuel production campaign could have been and should have been brought to a standstill when a sufficiency of the turf had been harvested in 1947 and when we had imported a sufficiency of coal and produced a sufficiency of timber.  We could forgive the Fianna Fáil Government if they set out in 1947 and produced, say, a two or three years' supply of fuel&mdash;and even a three years' supply would not have been advisable, knowing that both turf and timber were so perishable, apart from the fact that coal was inclined to disintegrate <Col N="722" /> when exposed to the weather. But we could have forgiven them if they had set out to produce a three years' supply.  The basis of their activities was the result of a hard winter in 1946-47.  It was an exceptional winter and their activity seemed to suggest that we should expect these exceptional winters year after year. Instead of producing fuel that would last for two or three years, we had the spectacle of having a ten-year supply gathered there in the Park. Due to the fact that this fuel was exposed to the weather, the taxpayers to-day have to bear the loss which might have been anticipated then by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

I am rather inclined to address myself to the Minister about how we are to deal with our fuel supplies in the future, and I am now referring to turf that is being produced this year and being delivered in the City of Cork, about which I have some knowledge.</P>
      <P>During the past week, I had representations made to me from very disinterested people from the political point of view&mdash;lady visitors to the blind and old age pensioners&mdash;complaining about wet turf that was being delivered to those poor people and gave me the chance of visiting some of the houses so that I could see the turf. That is the reason I am trying to put a blanket over all that happened in the past and to do something practical about our fuel supplies for the future.

      <P>We hear a lot of noise to-day about fuel subsidies.  I asked a question some seven or eight months ago in connection with the quantity of fuel that was on hands in January, 1948, and how much of it was left in January, 1951.  I got certain figures which showed that about £8,000,000 worth of fuel had been sold in that period.  We hear a lot of noise to-night about the loss on fuel and about the <Col N="724" /> outrageous idea of putting in stocks of fuel.  Judging by the present attitude of the British Government in regard to agreements made and not honoured, we may be very glad to have some fuel next March, even the wet turf about which Deputy Hickey talks.  I suggest that the fact that there are not stocks of fuel in the country now is a pretty grave responsibility for somebody, and I say that the stocks of fuel which were accumulated and disposed of should have been replaced.  I say, further, that the manner of their sale was a scandal and an outrage.  I saw down in my own district, from Cork to Youghal, every day, lorry loads of blocks floating down to the farmers' yards at £1 per ton&mdash;one-third or one-fourth of their value.  I do not know what is the reason for their sale at that price but I know they could have fetched without any trouble whatever three times that price.  You would not cut a ton of blocks for £3.</P>

All I have to say is that the attitude of the inter-Party Government toward fuel is the attitude of an individual who comes to town, takes a furnished room, and who, the first week, sells a table, the second week sells the old chair and in the finish sells the bed.  So far as the fuel is concerned, it was put up and sold&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy's colleagues in the county council were pretty active during the summer months endeavouring to get some small bit of fuel to replace the coal which they purchased from Britain but which they did not get.  After the agreement we made with Britain for the coal she increased the price, though I cannot say now how much the increase was. These are pretty tough facts.  The behaviour of the Opposition in connection with the fuel question reminds one of nothing more than an old lady going off to the pawn with something under her shawl.  That is the way they went off with the timber and sold it for half the value of the ticket.  That is the way the timber, the fuel that is mentioned here, was sold.  That is the way the coal was sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish we could approach this matter in a more enlightened manner than that shown in the past 20 minutes.  It is not a question of other Parties wishing to find fault with this payment of £3,000,000.  It would be more appropriate if we could find means whereby in the future we would not have to <Col N="729" /> provide such an Estimate as this, arising out of fuel subsidies.  I was not here when the Minister was addressing the House and I do not know whether he apportioned the £3,000,000 out between coal, blocks and turf.  I have a feeling that the big percentage of this £3,000,000 goes towards the subsidisation of turf.</P>
      <P>Coming, as I do, from a turf area, naturally enough, I have some interest in the production and utilisation of that fuel.  I am quite candid about this &mdash;I believe that turf is not a suitable fuel for large cities and towns, not because it does not generate sufficient heat but because it is bulky, hard to store and hard to keep dry.  There is also a certain amount of waste, which tends to bring about a subsidy in the long run such as we are asked for to-night covering a period of years. It would be better for the Government to advise Bord na Móna or whatever body is responsible for turf production, to see if they could utilise it in another form, such as electricity, which could be used more economically in large cities and towns.  I believe that would call for less subsidisation and that there would be less waste. I have been through the Park, and while I do not wish to fix the responsibility for the accumulation of fuel between 1947 and the latter part of 1948, definitely there was quite a bulk of fuel there.  Though I am no judge of coal, it was apparent to anyone that the coal that went out from there was not first-class.  The Minister has explained that there was no alternative, that he availed of the only opportunity he had to acquire that type and quality of coal.  Of course, it would be better than no coal.  I believe the accumulation of such a large pile of coal, turf and blocks was not essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to continue to use turf in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and large towns, we must provide some kind of shelter so that it will not become waterlogged, with resultant waste arising out of hundreds of thousands of tons being stacked, as occurred during the war years and up to lately in the Phoenix Park.  If we can turn turf into some other form of power, it might solve the problem.  For instance, in the <Col N="730" /> last three or four years we have developed large housing sites in Dublin, where central heating would be more appropriate than the kind to which we have been accustomed.  If we had a furnace able to provide heat for 1,000 or 2,000 houses in a newly developed site, we could provide the necessary fuel in an area adjacent to the furnace and under shelter.  That would be more economical and there would be less waste, while it would have the desired effect of heating the homes.  We could look to cities in other countries and see what they are doing in modern houses to provide central heating by new methods.  As the Minister is well aware, turf blocks the chimneys in a very short time and is especially dangerous in cities, as far as fires are concerned, because the charcoal or that which rises from the fumes piles up if the chimneys are not cleaned every three months.  In the country, where the houses are set apart, it is sufficient to do that every six months or every year, but in the cities it is particularly dangerous to property and to the lives of others.  There is also in the cities the dirt and dust which make it not at all healthy or wholesome as a city fuel.  We should try to address our remarks to the elimination of waste and consequently the elimination of the necessity for these subsidies.  I dare say that, no matter what Government was in power, we would have to provide this subsidy, in view of the circumstances that developed out of the war and its aftermath.  We should try to get the Government of the day &mdash;no matter what Government that may be&mdash;to ask Bord na Móna to consider turning the turf into some other type of power.  Until that is done, the large cities and towns will not take the turf unless there is dire necessity and no other alternative, as occurred in 1943, 1944 and 1945 when coal was not available.</P>
    <P>It was suggested here on some occasions that shelters should have been erected in the Park.  I think it would be impossible to cover such a huge area of land to store turf.  The only solution I can see would be to try to use it on large housing schemes in some other way.  The mental hospital <Col N="731" /> in County Mayo, a large building housing 2,000 people between patients and staff, is heated solely by turf, and I am told by those in charge that it is more economical than coal and means a saving in every direction.  If an institution like that can be heated by a furnace, a number of institutions or a large number of houses could be similarly heated.  That could be one way of helping to eliminate these subsidies, as it would eliminate waste, eliminate the hauling and rehauling, bringing a few tons here and a few tons there, creating dust and waste.  That is one approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to introduce Party politics on this matter.  I am prepared to admit that, in the circumstances arising out of the war, the Government were faced with a peculiar situation and I suppose they did the best they could.  They may have been at fault or could have done better but this is not the time of the day to discuss that and will not bring us nearer to solving the problem so as to ensure that this time 12 months we will not have to provide a similar subsidy again.  We should make our remarks with that in mind.  If we do so, we may achieve our object and will have done a good night's work.</P>
    <P>Let us forget what happened in the past and cease trying to put the baby in anybody's arms.  We would have a very difficult search if we wanted to find out who actually was responsible for all the fuel muddling that has taken place over the past years.  I hope the rest of the debate will be on a higher level than the debate to which we have listened for the past three-quarters of an hour.</P>

      <P>The first intimation the House had that this sum came due in the current year was in the speech made by the Minister for Finance during the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill a couple of weeks ago.  In that speech, it will be recalled, the Minister endeavoured to make the case that the Budget in the current year was a cooked Budget, a faked Budget, and, in order to bolster up that case, the £3,000,000 odd due to Fuel Importers Limited was paraded among the <Col N="732" /> figures for which the previous Government failed to make any provision in the Budget for the current year.  It was pointed out in the course of that debate to the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance that this sum of £3,000,000 odd which was included in the sum of £10,000,000, which was to be the Budget deficit for the current year, was not a proper figure to be included in the current Budget.  It was a sum which should be funded and treated as a debt to be paid off over a number of years.  I must say that I came into the House to-night to try to make that argument here and to compel the Government, if possible, to take the view that this amount due to Fuel Importers was something which should be treated as a debt, an amount to be paid off over a number of years. I regret that I was not here when the Tánaiste made his speech, but I understand that it is now the policy of the Government to treat it as a debt, as something to be paid off over a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and should not be included in order to make it appear as something for which money from the current Budget has to be paid.  Our objection to the Minister for Finance introducing this figure in the context in which he did introduce it was that he was endeavouring to persuade the country that this was something which was going to lead to a deficit on the current Budget.  We say that that is not at all a correct interpretation of this figure and that this is a debt which is repayable over a number of years. In order to demonstrate the fact that this was a debt and not an item to be met out of current expenditure I quoted here to the Tánaiste in the course of the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill a statement in the Central Bank Report &mdash; that much maligned Report&mdash;on page 12 where they implicitly treat this debt due to <Col N="733" /> Fuel Importers as a debt to be repaid over a number of years.  I am glad to see that that debate had many beneficial results in the form of bringing the Government to its senses and this, I think, we can claim to be another.</P>
      <P>We heard a lot in the course of the past few weeks about the current Budget deficit.  If that deficit is broken up in the manner in which the Taoiseach broke it up in his speech, it will be seen that a sum of £1.5 million was allocated by the previous Minister as a surplus for the current year; that savings on Estimates were estimated at £1.5 million; and that a sum of £2,000,000 was estimated as an increase in the buoyancy of the revenue for the coming year.  On the Taoiseach's figures the estimated deficit for the current year was then going to be £5,000,000.  It appears now that the £3,000,000 are not now to be included in that sum.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It might be of interest, and the House, I am sure, will be concerned to know, what provision was made in the Estimates against that item. The £3,079,950 was provided for in the Estimates by a token vote of £5.&rdquo;</P>

The Minister for Industry and Commerce has unburdened himself in the course of the past couple of weeks of some remarks about lawyers in the Government.  Lawyers' training does help them to this extent: that they will not make a bad point in an argument if they cannot stand over it. That is what was demonstrated in the course of that debate as a result of the pressure put on the Government by the Opposition in relation to the proper financial method of dealing with this debt due to fuel importers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Minister should be so terrified yet, but perhaps he is thinking of the past. I welcome this opportunity, as one of the Deputies for Leix-Offaly, to speak on this Estimate.  It is notable that the Estimate should have been introduced by Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce, because if ever an Estimate had a history, this Estimate has.  During the years from 1948 to 1951 we heard time and time again a wail from the members of the present Government, as the then Opposition, with regard to the entire turf policy of the inter-Party Government. That campaign was created, fashioned and led by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Starting in April, 1948, wearing, as I imagine, some bog-worker's trousers, he tramped from one end of the country to another throwing up his hands in holy horror and telling us that the inter-Party Government had stopped hand-won turf production; that hand-won turf production had an assured and guaranteed market here; and that their stoppage of that particular campaign was something that could not be justified.</P>
      <P>He indulged in that campaign knowing well the facts which are now disclosed by him to the country three years later, knowing well that the continuation at that time of subsidised turf production was costing the country far more than it could afford. The present Minister knew that. Nevertheless, for political purposes, he indulged in a very dishonest campaign. Furthermore, he knew, six days before he left office, on the 12th February, 1948, that&mdash;the Minister now has the records and can check them&mdash;at a departmental conference he had decided to stop the county council hand-won turf production scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey says that is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the records and can look them up now.  I state that the present Minister, on the 12th February, 1948, decided to discontinue the hand-won turf production scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  Let me put <Col N="736" /> the Deputy right.  I am going to do something that is never done by those on the far side of the House.  At the conference, the then Minister decided that the hand-won turf scheme in the camps was to be discontinued and he deferred taking a decision as to whether or not the county council scheme was to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Deputy.  The present Minister, Deputy Lemass, when he engaged on this campaign in the year 1948 and from that on, did so, knowing that had he been reappointed by the Taoiseach as a Minister in the last Government in February, 1948, he would have acted exactly as his successor did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not do anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, for cheap political purposes, he started that dishonest campaign.  I wish that the Government Deputies of Leix-Offaly were in the House to witness this debacle to-night.  I wish they were here to listen to their deputy leader explaining to the House and to the country the parlous position in which he had placed turf production before he last left office.</P>
      <P>I know well that turf producers down the country will view this Estimate with considerable interest. They will be able to assess the value of the campaign that has been indulged in during the last 3½ years.  I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy, Deputy Martin Corry, who has now gone out of the House, talking about all that Fianna Fáil did to preserve fuel supplies.  It is hard to be patient, listening to Deputies speaking in that fashion. None of us are so young that we cannot remember the winter of 1946. None of us are so young that we cannot recollect that, some six years after the emergency broke in this country, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had the fuel supplies in such a mess that there was not a fire to be had in this city or in any other city of this country.  That was in 1946. Then, in the greatest fit of ministerial panic ever shown, we had this fools' progress in the year 1947 for which the country is now asked to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> I do not think there has ever been any part of administration so mishandled as turf production was mishandled by the present Minister during the entire years of the emergency.  Money was made, we know that.  Plenty of money was made.  It was not made by those who produced turf in Leix or in Offaly.  It was not made by the primary producers. It was made by the flock of get-rich-quick merchants who were able to get between the producers and the unfortunate consumer.  Every one of us knows that well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the moneylenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And the moneylenders. It opened up a new market for financial organisations in the country.  Men started in that campaign with a wheelbarrow and finished owning a fleet of lorries.  Those are the people who made money out of the turf.  The producer and the consumer did not make it.  The emergency and the entire period of turf production over which the present Minister presided unfortunately have done more harm to the production of turf in this country than any flooding of the country with British coal.  When the emergency came, you had turf producers in this country&mdash;certainly in my part of the country&mdash;who had a genuine belief in turf as an industry.  You had men who, unlike the Minister, did not like it merely as a means towards a political end.  They looked to the emergency&mdash;as they were entitled to look to it&mdash;as an opportunity of selling turf freely in Dublin City and in Cork City, making it not merely an emergency substitute for coal but a national fuel.  They regarded the emergency, when it came, as giving them that opportunity to which Griffith had made reference some 30 years earlier. It is tragic that the opportunity was destroyed completely by the Administration over which the Minister presided. He allowed the production of turf to go on regardless of the cost, regardless of quality and without supervision merely for the purpose of backing up an alibi of wet clay for himself in the Phoenix Park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the turf production campaign <Col N="738" /> ended in the early part of 1948&mdash;before the inter-Party Government came into office&mdash;with it ended the greatest chance that the producers of turf ever had of selling turf as a popular fuel in this country.  I wonder does the bog Deputy, Deputy Cogan, from Wicklow, remember his own speeches on that matter only three and a half years ago?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Deputy remember King Herod?  As a Deputy of Leix-Offaly and as a Deputy who had to stand up to the campaign launched by the present Minister as Deputy Lemass in the years from 1948 to 1951, it is gratifying to me at least to see the evidence given by the present Minister to-night that his campaign was a dishonest one.  In the present year a new turf production campaign was started.  I think I am in order in saying that that campaign, unlike the former campaing, was started on a proper basis.  I think I am in order in saying that this time, at any rate, the primary producer has had an opportunity of supervising the production of turf from the bog, of presenting it to the market himself if he so wishes, and of getting a fair price in return.  I hope that that will continue and that the Minister, learning from his mistakes, will, in relation to future turf production, endeavour to ensure that more and more societies and cooperative movements are banded into the production of turf, and that he will more and more ensure that those who produce turf are given the facilities and the help not merely to produce it but to carry it also to market.  If that is done the turf industry will benefit. If that is not done we will get back to the situation where middlemen, counting merely the profit guaranteed to them by the previous Minister, and for which the taxpayer is now asked to pay, cared nothing for the quality of what they were carrying but thought only of the load.  I hope that we will not see that happening again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I join with Deputy Costello in referring to the other aspect of this Estimate, the manner in which it ties up with the second scandalous campaign indulged in by the present Minister, <Col N="739" /> the later one which he started some months ago to convince everybody that this country was bankrupt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate would not have been moved if this Minister were not Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I say that it was moved deliberately by him for the purpose of proving if he could that this liability had to be faced by the present Government and accordingly that the financial position which they were approaching was not their fault.  It is part and parcel of a very deliberate campaign. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste were hard pressed during recent months to tot up figures of our liability in order to prove their contention that the former Government had budgeted for a deficit. They argued figures, totted figures, crossed out figures and substituted others, the whole effort being designed to show that the former Minister had deliberately underestimated the amount of money he required this year and this Estimate is part and parcel of their campaign.  What does it mean? It means that the people of the country represented by the Deputies of this House are being asked to pay in this financial year £3,000,000 in respect of a debt incurred some years ago to Fuel Importers.  It has been paraded in such a way as to imply that this was a liability incurred in this financial year.</P>

The first notable thing is that at the very end of the present financial year the Minister asks the people of the country to pay for something which was incurred three or four years ago.  There is a political side to that.  That is part of the colour which has been given by the Minister and his colleagues to the entire financial position of the country, part of the effort to justify increased taxation in <Col N="741" /> the next few months.

      <P>The position is that at the end of the financial year we are suddenly called upon to meet a liability incurred some years ago.  It is interesting that that should be so. I know that if the Minister had remained in office continuously from 1947 to date the manner in which the liability would have been met&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was met every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The liability never arose until the Minister lost his head in 1947, until the Minister went daft in 1947 and until, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, the Minister had not the political courage to take the steps in October, 1947, which the circumstances indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the moment this Government lost three by-elections, he poured the taxpayers' money into the pocket of every cheap &ldquo;spiv&rdquo; in the country, because he had not the political courage to take action then.  That is what caused this liability to arise. The people are now being asked, suddenly, in the present financial year, to fork up the £3,000,000 in order to <Col N="742" /> pay for the fact that the present Minister, from October, 1947 when he knew, because he made the agreement, that British coal was coming back into this country, when he knew, because he made the mess, that Irish turf could not be sold in Dublin, to February, 1948, he continued to pay £4 a ton for useless fuel and to stock it in Phoenix Park.  That is what created this liability.  We have to find £3,000,000 out of the pockets of the taxpayers because of the Minister's political cowardice in the past.</P>
    <P>I use the Minister's own expression. That is a serious situation.  It becomes slightly more than serious.  It becomes slightly criminal, when the Minister should take advantage of his own folly under present circumstances to ask the people at this late time of the year to pay this particular debt.</P>
    <P>Ordinary prudence would dictate that the debt be levelled over a period of years.  An ordinary interest in the turf industry itself would dictate that course.  Apparently, political expediency dictates every action that the present Government takes.  I have no doubt that after this money has been voted by the House, as I am sure it will be, the next step will be increased taxation which has been hinted at time and time again by different members of the present Government.</P>
    <P>When proposals for that taxation are introduced in this House it will be stated that the Government had no other course open to them in respect of this liability than to raise it by taxation in the present financial year. We have pointed out to them the alternative course.  We know well that they will make a parade of this as an excuse but that they will do in fact what any sensible Government would do and parcel out the liability; that they will make the noise; that they will try to make the case that this liability has to be met but in fact they will not meet it.</P>

      <P>The speeches that we have listened to to-night from the Opposition clearly demonstrate the deceitful Party that they are.  Here we are asking for a sum of £3,000,000 to pay off a debt that was incurred when it was essential to provide fuel <Col N="743" /> for the people.  The speeches of Opposition Deputies to-night clearly demonstrated that their knowledge of fuel production is nil.  Deputy O'Higgins said that we all remember the winter of 1946.  The people must remember the harvest and the winter of 1946.  It was in 1946 that we had to organise workers all over the country to try to collect the harvest.  The harvesting of turf was an even more difficult proposition. I happen to be a turf producer myself and to know the difficulties under which we have to produce turf in the winter months.</P>

      <P>I know the conditions under which we have to protect turf in the winter months.  Everybody knows that turf is not a commodity that is easily protected.  It could not be done during the emergency.  Everybody knows that most of the turf that we hear was left in the dumps in the Phoenix Park is turf mould.  There is an enormous amount of that.  It is alleged that we brought that into the park and left it to go waste.</P>
      <P>This country must face up to the fact that during the emergency it was essential to produce fuel for the people in the towns and cities.  That was the duty of the Government of the day. If the inter-Party Government had been in office at that time they would have found that it was their duty to try to get turf produced.  At that time machinery was not available or procurable for that purpose.  There was only one way in which we could get turf produced and that was by the sleán and the barrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made in the speeches to-night to what was done by us to do away with hand-won turf.  Do the Opposition not realise even now that they themselves had to call upon this House to get hand-won turf produced to tide the country over a difficult time when other fuel coul not be obtained? <Col N="744" /> Do they not realise that every county council that was called upon by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Norton, produced most of their turf as hand-won turf and that it is hand-won turf that is in the ricks and stacks all over the country at the present moment?  Why do we continually abuse the people who made the effort and responded to the call to produce turf?  Deputy O'Higgins said a moment ago that we tried to pour money into the pockets of every cheap &ldquo;spiv&rdquo; in the country.  Is the man who took off his coat and went into the bog and produced turf a cheap &ldquo;spiv&rdquo;?  Is the man who harnessed every type of vehicle during the emergency when new vehicles were not obtainable, a cheap &ldquo;spiv&rdquo;?  Of course, Deputy O'Higgins has a tradition behind him and it is not one that I would like to have behind me.</P>
    <P>If the timber that was sold in the Phoenix Park had been handled properly, £3,000,000 would not be required to pay the debt.  Anybody who knows anything about timber knows that timber is not suitable for firewood until it is seasoned and that it will not season in a day or two days.  Timber that has been cut two years and has lost all its moisture is suitable for firewood.</P>

      <P>On the motion for Adjournment, Deputy Cogan gave notice to raise the subject matter of Question No. 29 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter, I am actuated by a desire to see that an injustice is not done to a very important profession in this country, the journalistic profession.  I am also actuated by a desire to see that a grave menace is not created in this country to the liberty of the Press and to the liberty of a citizen in freely expressing his opinion.  The Irish News Agency was established under an Act of this <Col N="745" /> House and in the past two years over £50,000 has been voted by this House for its upkeep.  It may be claimed that this money is repayable, but God only knows when, if ever, it will be repaid. A grant of £25,000 per year out of the taxpayers' money has been provided for the news agency over the last two years.  It is important to consider whether, in granting this money to maintain this news agency, we are not creating a monster that will destroy all freedom of expression, all freedom of thought and all freedom of the Press in this country.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was going through this House, a number of Deputies expressed grave concern lest the Irish News Agency should become a menace (1) to the journalistic profession in Ireland, and (2) the freedom of the Press.  Those views having been expressed by Deputies, I think, on all sides of the House, the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride, took steps to assure the House in the most emphatic way that it was not the intention of the Irish News Agency to supply what he described as &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news to the Irish newspapers or any other newspapers.  Speaking on the Second Reading of the Irish News Agency Bill on 13th July, 1949, as reported in column 761 of the Official Reports, Deputy MacBride said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not proposed that the news agency should enter into the field of &lsquo;hot&rsquo; news.  To non-journalist members of the House I might elaborate that.  It is not intended that the news agency should supply reports of accidents, crimes, racing, Dáil debates or stock exchange reports.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As reported in column 762, in the same debate the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Now having stated the things that the Irish News Agency is not intended to be, let me state briefly the function and the purpose of the Irish News Agency.  Its function will be to put Ireland on the map by supplying to the Press of the world accurate information concerning matters of cultural, trade and general interest calculated to promote tourism, trade and cultural relations. <Col N="746" /> That will be its steady function.  When necessary, it will give Ireland's viewpoint on political matters, but only when necessary. It is not going to be a political propaganda machine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later in the same debate, as reported in column 844, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy de Valera, in effect, said that he agreed with the proposal but that he thought it was unworkable. He said he certainly agreed that there should not be any distribution of what I termed &lsquo;hot&rsquo; news.  I believe I should explain in a little more detail the type of news I visualise as emanating from the news agency.  I visualise sending out the kind of news and information not normally covered by existing news agencies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On November 16th, on the Committee Stage of the Bill, as reported in column 958, Deputy MacBride said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no reason to think that the Irish News Agency would in any way cut across the work which is being done by any Irish journalists at the moment.  As a matter of fact, I am quite certain that it would not but that, on the contrary, it would stimulate more work for journalists in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the Final Stage of the Bill on November 24th, as reported in column 1454, Deputy Cowan asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Did the Minister say that there would not be any &lsquo;hot&rsquo; news in the ordinary sense?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And Deputy MacBride answered:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Yes certainly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In introducing the Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad on November 30th, as reported in column 182 of the Official Reports of the Seanad, Deputy MacBride said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the second place, the news agency is not intended to enter the field of what I described in the Dáil as &lsquo;hot&rsquo; news competition.  There was a good deal of play made in the Dáil as to what I meant by &lsquo;hot&rsquo; news.  The term is understood in newspaper circles in America.  It is not intended to cover such things as accidents, crimes, court trials, racing, <Col N="747" /> stock exchange reports, or even debates in the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, he gave a most emphatic undertaking both in this House and in the Seanad that the Irish News Agency would not enter into competition with the ordinary journalist in the exercise of his profession.  Notwithstanding that solemn undertaking, we have over the past year growing evidence that the Irish News Agency is actually competing with journalists in supplying news to Irish newspapers. To-day, Deputies received a copy of a resolution passed unanimously by the Oireachtas Press Gallery as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This special general meeting of the Oireachtas Press Gallery, held on Wednesday, November 21st, places on record its grave concern at the Irish News Agency's unfair and unjust competition with Irish journalists in the reporting of home news and sport and the supplying of news pictures and features.  This is a serious violation of the assurance given to the Dáil and Seanad by Mr. MacBride, the then Minister for External Affairs, when the agency Bill was passing through the Oireachtas, to the effect that the agency would not engage in the reporting or distribution of &lsquo;hot&rsquo; news, or in any activities prejudicial to the interests and livelihoods of Irish journalists.  As taxpayers, whose money helps to finance its operations, we consider it most inequitable that a State-sponsored organisation should operate against journalists in this way.  We view with alarm the Irish News Agency's steady encroachment on the day-to-day professional work of Irish newspapermen, and strongly urge that the agency should be confined to activities of a character not harmful to Irish working journalists.  That copies of this resolution be sent to the Taoiseach, the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Finance, and to all members of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Irish News Agency is not carrying out the function that it was intended to carry out, or, <Col N="748" /> rather, that it is overstepping that function and, by its activities, is violating the undertaking solemnly given to this House by Deputy MacBride and on the strength of which this House enacted the Irish News Agency Bill.</P>
    <P>Two very grave issues are raised by the action of the Irish News Agency. The first is that Irish taxpayers who engage in the profession of journalism, which is not, I think, a very secure profession, but rather one of considerable hazard and risk, find themselves up against competition from a State-sponsored organisation financed out of public money.  Journalism is to-day private enterprise in the truest sense of that word and all these journalists have to contribute as taxpayers to the finances of the Irish News Agency, an agency which is apparently crushing them out of existence.</P>
    <P>I am informed that newspaper offices have been inundated with news of every kind supplied to them by this agency.  Not only have they been supplied with news but they have also been supplied with pictures.  Stacks of pictures have been sent to newspaper offices in the city.  I presume the taking of these pictures is financed out of public money voted by this House. To me that appears to be altogether wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go deeply into this matter and I appreciate the information given by the Minister to-day at Question Time, that a conference is about to be held between the journalists and the Irish News Agency.  We all hope good results will accrue from that conference but we have no guarantee as to what the results will be.  We know that the Dublin branch of the Irish Journalists' Association has been endeavouring for some time to meet the Irish News Agency and discuss the matter.  I do not think it was very courteous of the agency to refuse to meet those journalists.</P>
    <P>There is a second issue of grave import in relation to the growth and development of this particular organisation. If the supplying of news to Irish newspapers by this agency continues and if it continues also to be financed out of public moneys the ordinary <Col N="749" /> journalist will be put out of business. The net result will be that the newspapers will be solely dependent upon this State controlled agency for their supply of news.  That could be a very serious and a very dangerous position if it were allowed to develop.  The Press would be submerged and the supply of news to our newspapers would be canalised through this authority.  There is grave danger there.  News can always be coloured, but I will not go into that now.  I do not think the Irish News Agency has impressed itself on the people as being very fair in the presentation of news.  We all remember how an event in my constituency in a place called Baltinglass was distorted by the Irish News Agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order that Baltinglass should be mentioned. If the Deputy will allow us to reply, that will be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not deal with it except to say that the news was completely distorted and certain small farmers were deliberately libelled by a reporter sent by the Irish News Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better keep to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the same reporter in recent months, having gone from Baltinglass to Limerick, discovered leprechauns in the fields down there and advertised them to the world.  I merely mention that to show that this is not an agency in which we could put such implicit confidence as to put out of business scores of independent journalists who have a long tradition behind them and who guarantee to the community the presentation of every viewpoint and the accurate and fair reporting of every fact.</P>
      <P>I think this is a dangerous organisation now because of the way in which it has developed.  I hope some good will come out of the conference.  If good does not ensue, the responsibility will rest on the Minister to take action to ensure that this monster created by his predecessor, perhaps without the present Minister's support, will not be allowed to destroy the cream of the Press in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the good case that Deputy Cogan made at the outset should have been spoiled towards the end by his own effort to smear it.  When the Irish News Agency Bill was introduced it was on the clear understanding that that agency would not enter into direct competition with the staffs of our Irish newspapers or do the work which can be done and is being done by Irish journalists.  That was the intention of the Government. That was the intention declared here and if there was any question of the Irish News Agency coming into direct competition with the staffs of Irish newspapers or Irish journalists not only would the Bill not have been passed by the House but it would never have been introduced by the Government.</P>
      <P>Speaking for this side of the House, if the Irish News Agency is, as is alleged by Deputy Cogan and by the resolution passed by the journalists' association, in direct competition then it is indulging in something in which it was never intended it should indulge.  If the agency is in direct competition direct instructions should be given by the Minister to that body to stop that particular activity.</P>
      <P>If the agency is not able to find enough to do over and above what can be done and is being done by Irish journalists, then the Irish News Agency should be brought to an end. It was created for a certain purpose. It was certainly not created for the purpose set out in the question to-day. I think most of us felt that there was very useful work which the agency could do, work which was not being done and could not be done by Irish journalists.  In so far as coming into direct competition with Irish journalists is concerned, the agency was certainly never created for that purpose and if it is indulging in that work it ought not to be allowed to continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point that Deputy Morrissey has made as to what the the objects of the news agency were in the opinion of the previous Government, I think the only thing we can go upon is the written record, and the <Col N="751" /> memorandum and articles of association. These, which were drafted and signed and put out by various civil servants who held shares on behalf of the Government state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  The name of the company is &lsquo;The Irish News Agency.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>2. The registered office of the company will be situate in Ireland.</P>
      <P>3. The objects for which the company is established are the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  To carry on the business of a news agency in all its branches and to ensure the collection, dissemination, distribution and publication of news, intelligence and photographs inside and outside Ireland, and for these purposes to use any telephone, telegraph or wireless system or any other means of communication.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In view of that section in the memorandum of association, I do not know how Deputy Morrissey could make the speech which he has just made. Apart from that, that is the law on the matter, and if the Government did not know it was the law it was about time they got out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the law.  It was started to collect and disseminate news inside and outside of Ireland&mdash;news and photographs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am doing, and would have done before now but that Deputy Morrissey intervened with his particular contribution to the debate.  Now, I am in a difficulty.  I do not want to say anything here to-night that would in any way interfere with <Col N="752" /> the talks which, I hope, will be embarked upon between the directors of the Irish News Agency, on the one hand, and the journalists' union on the other.  Ever since we became the Government I have had various complaints from individuals about the operations of the news agency.  When I got these complaints I referred them to the directors of the news agency and I also asked those who were complaining to take the matter up with the news agency.  There are complaints in growing volume from some journalists' unions and from journalists.  I am glad, however, to hear that very shortly some of their representatives are going to meet the directors of the news agency.</P>
      <P>Now on one side you have the complaint from a certain section that the news agency is operating to jeopardise the livelihood of certain journalists, and, on the other hand, you have a newspaper like the <i>Derry Journal</i> starting that it will have and is having the opposite effect.  The <i>Derry Journal</i> of yesterday, Monday, December 10th, in the course of an article dealing with this matter said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The other is that the proposed service to Irish provincial newspapers will lead to unemployment amongst journalists.  None of the critics have attempted to state how. The truth is that it will be a great boon to provincial papers which have not and cannot have correspondents in every district, and in consequence miss happenings of interest or importance. Some of the provincial papers have correspondents in the large centres but are unable to cover the small places.  The Irish News Agency will do this for them, and supply the news &lsquo;hot&rsquo; as it supplies it now to Britain, Europe and America.  This will be a boon to the provincial papers.  Instead of causing unemployment amongst journalists, it will provide jobs for correspondents all over the country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see what will be the outcome of the talks between the representatives of the journalists who are to meet the directors.  The outcome of these talks will be considered very carefully by me in the Department of External Affairs.  As I said in the <Col N="753" /> beginning, I do not want to say anything to-night that would prejudice these talks so I hope Deputies will forgive me for not replying to certain points that were made by Deputy Cogan, and to some other points perhaps <Col N="754" /> that were made by Deputy Morrissey.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 12th December, 1951.</P>
