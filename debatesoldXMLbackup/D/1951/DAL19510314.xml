    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my speech on the 2nd instant, when moving the Second Reading of the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950, I announced that the Government intended to grant increased rates of old age and blind pensions and to modify the means test in respect of them.  I also indicated that the necessary amendments to give legislative effect to the proposals would be submitted on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  That is still my intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a short Bill providing for the increased old age pensions would be of an uncontentious nature and could be enacted within a week?  Is the Minister also aware that it is not fair to the old age pensioners to keep them waiting while a highly contentious Bill is being passed which may take a long time to get through the House?  Does the Minister think that that is fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that the Government's generosity in this matter has overwhelmed the Deputy.  I am also aware that an amendment on the lines indicated is <Col N="1843" /> appropriate to a Bill of this kind and, with the warm co-operation of the Deputy and the House generally, there should be no delay in getting this Bill through so as to enable this increase to be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer my question?  As Deputy Cogan pointed out, is it not correct that the benefit of the increased old age pensions could be given much more quickly if provided under a separate Bill than if provided by amending the Social Welfare Bill? Is there any objection to proceeding by way of a separate Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate that question all the more if I did not remember that the Deputy and his Party voted against a modification of the means test in 1947 when it would only cost £500,000.  Since then we have given an additional £2,500,000 to the old age pensioners and are now giving another £1,250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what his objection is to answering my question?  Is the Minister not interested in this except for its political advantage?  Is it not a fact that the old age pensioners could get the benefit more speedily if there was a separate Bill?  What is the Minister's objection to that?</P>

      <P>I understand from the Commissioners of Public Works that the working drawings and specification for the new school have been prepared, but that bills of quantities will have to be drawn up before tenders are invited. The commissioners will be in a position to have the preparation of bills of quantities put in hands when an official lease, vesting the site of the new school in trustees, has been executed.  It is expected that the lease will be completed at an early date.</P>
      <P>Although it is not possible to say, at present, when work on the erection of the new school will be commenced, there will be no avoidable delay in completing the arrangements which I have mentioned.</P>

Mission to Ireland, as saying that the Irish Government had made no formal proposal for the release of counterpart funds for tourism as yet, and that hence the E.C.A. Mission had made no recommendation to the American Government in the matter; and, if so, whether he will make a statement in connection therewith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Cosgrave) (for Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As to the second part of the question, exploratory discussions have been under way with the E.C.A. Mission for a considerable time past on the question of utilising grant counterpart funds for the promotion of dollar tourism.  These discussions derived from correspondence between the mission and the Government in the course of which a proposal in general terms was initiated in July, 1950, and followed up by supplementary data in October, 1950.  The mission commented on this submission in November, 1950, asking for its further development to enable a formal proposal to be made to E.C.A., Washington.  This was undertaken by the newly-constituted Tourist Board as part of its re-examination of the general field of tourist development.  On the basis of this examination the Tourist Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1951, the text of which has recently been circulated to Deputies, was drafted.  The Deputy will note that Section 3 of this Bill provides for the payment to the Tourist Board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of non-repayable sums for the purpose of making grants to proprietors of premises registered under Part III of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, for the improvement, modernisation and extension of such <Col N="1846" /> premises.  It is the intention of the Government, subject to the agreement of E.C.A., to finance these payments out of grant counterpart funds and the formal proposal to this effect is on the point of completion and will be submitted immediately to the E.C.A. for their agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware of the serious inconvenience caused to the residents of Cullin village, County Cork, due to the failure of his Department to have telephonic communication arranged with the local sub-post office in the area; and, if so, if he will proceed to have a public telephone erected immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to similar questions on the 28th February last, it is the intention of the Department to instal a telephone in every post office.  As there are still about 700 post offices to be dealt with&mdash;most of them in remote areas&mdash;the work will have to be spread over a number of years.  In order that the best progress may be made, the order in which call <Col N="1854" /> offices are installed is determined mainly on engineering considerations. Cullen is not one of the call offices included in the programme for the coming year and it is not, I regret, possible to say when a call office will be provided there.</P>

      <P>The question of the review of the 1948 Civil Service pay agreement is being dealt with under the newly-established machinery of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.  The matter has been discussed on a number of occasions at the Civil Service General Council and, these discussions not having resulted in agreement, the staff side have forwarded a statement of case for transmission to the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  A counter-statement to the staff claim is at present being prepared and when it has been completed the claim will be referred to the arbitration board.</P>

I am not yet in a position to indicate the purposes for which the remaining grant counterpart moneys will be utilised; these must be agreed with the United States Government under Article IV (6) of the Economic Co-operation Agreement.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, we are doing just what other Departments, such as the Land Commission did.  In the various counties, they appointed paymasters.  We are taking, over the counties.  We have already taken over Galway, Roscommon and Clare and we find it more efficient to do as other Departments are doing, that is, to give an opportunity to people down the country to do this work instead of increasing the staff at head office.  That is in reply to the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question.  As to the first part of his supplementary question, as to why these vacancies are not advertised, 63 appointments have been made by the outgoing Government of paymasters in different Departments, such as the Land Commission and the Board of Works, and none of these was ever advertised.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the circumstances which have caused the temporary suspension of cigarette production by the Irish-owned and smaller tobacco manufacturers; and, if so, whether he will consider what steps he might usefully take to ensure that the trading methods of the foreign-owned tobacco companies will not prove unduly prejudicial to the interests of the Irish-owned firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that certain firms have recently suspended or reduced their production of cigarettes because of a reduced demand for their products and because of transport difficulties during the recent strike.

      <P>The position regarding hospital accommodation in Waterford generally was recently discussed with a deputation from the Waterford Board of Public Assistance which is directly concerned with the provision of general hospital accommodation in <Col N="1881" /> Waterford City.  It was explained to the deputation that in view of the need for making rapid progress with a limited programme of hospital building, including only works of the greatest urgency, many desirable projects such as the provision of a new general hospital for Waterford had to be deferred.  This view had already been conveyed to the local authority in July, 1948, when the short-term programme for hospital building was first drawn up.  The deputation was, however, informed that the improvement of the existing county hospital should be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the rehabilitation of the county hospital and the provision there of modern facilities which are urgently needed is a sound and economical proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £48,550 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Garda Síochána (No. 7 of 1925, No. 10 of 1926, No. 5 of 1937, No. 19 of 1941, Nos. 1 and 17 of 1945) and for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949).</P>
      <P>The gross amount under the various sub-heads is £54,328, but as there will be an estimated surplus of £5,778 on appropriations-in-aid, the net additional sum required is £48,550.  Deputies will have noticed from the Estimate that additional provision is required under seven sub-heads, the two main items being £20,497 under sub-head A in respect of salaries, wages and pay and £28,884 under sub-head E in respect of clothing and equipment.</P>
      <P>The estimated increased expenditure under sub-head A is due to the fact that the number of retirements during the period to date has been less than was anticipated.  The original estimate was framed on the basis of a strength of 5,550 Gardaí on the 1st April, 1950, whereas the strength on that date was 5,576.  Further, there were fewer retirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-heads C and D deal with subsistence allowances and locomotion allowance.  The excesses of £1,200 and £1,000 under these sub-heads respectively are due to increased expenditure on (a) duty in connection with the local elections and (b) payment of <Col N="1884" /> arrears of subsistence allowance under the Garda Síochána Allowances Order, 1949.  This expenditure was not anticipated when the Estimates were being framed.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E deals with clothing and equipment.  The sum of £28,884 under this sub-head is mainly required to pay for belated deliveries of clothing which were expected prior to 31st March, 1950, and for which provision was made in the 1949-50 Estimates. Provision is also necessary and had been made to meet the cost of early deliveries of cloth for Garda uniforms to the value of £7,650 for the year 1951-52.  No deliveries of this cloth were expected prior to 1st April next.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F&mdash;furniture, barrack bedding and bedsteads &mdash; the extra provision of £1,227 under this sub-head is mainly required in consequence of the purchase of bedding and mattresses which it was anticipated would have been delivered and paid for before the 31st March, 1950.  Sub-head I&mdash;fuel and light and water&mdash;the excess of £1,000 under this sub-head is due to the general rise in the price of fuel. Sub-head M &mdash; compensation &mdash; the expenditure under this sub-head is always conjectural and the commitments to the 31st March next will necessitate the provision of the additional amount shown&mdash;£520.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine my remarks to sub-head A.  I gathered from the Minister that he anticipates the force should have been reduced to 5,550.  I do not know whether he is satisfied if that is enough.  I agree there is a case for reorganisation, say, in the City of Dublin.  I recently read in the newspapers&mdash;I suppose the Minister's attention was drawn to it, too&mdash;about an experiment that was tried in Salford in England and also in Aberdeen for the better running of the police forces in those cities. Whether it has been better than the old system or not I do not know, but it appears to have been more efficient. I think that at the present time the Minister and the Government are very badly advised to reduce the strength of the Gardaí in small country stations, until, at any rate, the emergency conditions <Col N="1885" /> have entirely disappeared. That may take some time.  I think it is a great mistake altogether.  I had occasion to draw the attention of the Minister's predecessor to that on a couple of occasions when speaking on the main Estimate.  I think myself that the work of a non-police nature which the Gardaí do is done much better and more cheaply than it could otherwise be done.  I think that if other inspectorial work was delegated to the Gardaí it would be done better and cheaper than it is.  In addition, I believe myself that we would be giving, as we had been doing up to recently, a fairly good service to the people in those districts.  In remote places people feel more comfortable if they know there is a Garda station in the area.  I certainly felt, along with a lot of other people, a bit upset when it was found necessary, owing to a reduction in the strength of the Guards in the country districts, to cut off the telephone service at 11 p.m.  I know that you cannot use a Garda station as a telephone exchange, but it is very useful for the people in remote places. I may be wrong, but the report which appeared in the Press gave us to understand that, owing to lack of personnel, the telephone facilities which were available in these districts were being cut off.  That is a very serious state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make much capital out of a question that was asked in the Dáil last week, but it is a fact and the Minister is aware of it, that there has been a reorganisation drive by an illegal organisation which has necessitated the increasing of the guard on certain people.  In view of that and the fact that a political organisation had on its agenda the question of extending that drive to the country, I think it is a very bad time to reduce the Garda strength in the country districts. I hope the Minister will not allow the strength of the Garda to fall any lower than it is.  Since this State was set up I think the strength of the Garda was always about 7,000.  Now, apparently, the Minister has estimated that it will drop to 5,500.  I do not know what figure it is meant <Col N="1886" /> ultimately to arrive at, but I put it to the Minister that he ought not to rely on the introduction of mechanical transport and the suggestion of having the Guards concentrated in towns and going around and paying an occasional visit to other districts and closing up the country stations until conditions are better and more stable than they are at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may not have made it sufficiently clear.  The 5,550 refers to Guards only and the total strength will be 6,950.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea when the committee which has been set up will report?  Is it part of their policy to close down these small stations?  That is what I am concerned about.  From what I read about the experiment which has been tried out, of having a sergeant and nine Guards with cars and transmitting and receiving sets, it has been a success.  They appear to have been able to do much better work, but I do not know whether it was more costly.  That may be all right in Dublin which would lend itself to that kind of experiment.  But the closing down of the country stations should not be proceeded with.  I hope the new Minister will examine the matter from the point of view of our past experience and hesitate to go too far in that direction until things have settled down more than they have up to the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the topic mentioned by Deputy Boland.  We ought to comp liment ourselves as a nation on the fact that there is so little serious crime in the country and that for a long period there has been very little serious crime.  That tendency has been gradually developing and, with that development, naturally there must be a complete reorganisation of and a totally different attitude of mind towards the forces of law and order. The forces of law and order are the Garda.  Deputy Boland approaches this problem from the viewpoint that we had approximately 7,000 Guards, that we had Garda stations all over <Col N="1887" /> the country and that it would be unwise to interfere with that organisation. The Deputy knows as well as I do that originally the police organisation was established for purposes not entirely connected with peaceful conditions as we understand them.  These police stations were established here, there and everywhere through the country, not for the maintenance of law and order, but for the purpose of spying on the people.  The day when it is necessary to spy on the people has long since departed.  Consequently, the attitude of the Minister and of the Department in trying to bring about a rational reorganisation of the force was a good thing.</P>
      <P>I have often thought it an extraordinary thing that we should have these Garda stations through the country with five or six Gardaí and a sergeant apparently doing no very useful work, although at the same time they were fully occupied doing this, that or the other thing.  We might, with advantage, experiment with the idea of a single Garda living at home to whom complaints might be made, from whom advice might be sought and who would be in touch with a well-organised police force in the larger towns in which there would be specialists of all kinds to come on the scene right away if anything out of the way occurred.  In that way we could have all the assistance that the public requires from the Garda made available and at the same time have a very efficient Garda force to deal with any crime that may arise.  Complaints have been made that there is difficulty in finding recruits for the force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is so.  If you open up recruiting, you can get a very large number of highly-educated young men who will apply for admission to the Garda.  After a year or two or three years, however, they may find that persons with the same educational qualifications who went into other walks of life are doing much better or they may find that some of their comrades <Col N="1888" /> who go to serve, say, in the London police, are doing much better and are being promoted quickly. Those very keen, intelligent, well-educated young men will become dissatisfied and, after a short period, they will be anxious to obtain their discharge and leave the force.  That means a tremendous waste in training. The training that a Garda undergoes is a very intensive form of training and requires a concentrated effort.</P>

If it is in order, I claim the right to speak on it.</P>

      <P>There are many comp licated problems in the City of Dublin.  The East Wall area has been looking for a Garda station for many years past.  The citizens regard these stations as places where they can get sound and useful advice.  The city is growing enormously and we need a bigger force.  We need more stations.  In addition to all that, we can then have this mobility about which Deputy Boland spoke.  I am always glad to hear judges comp liment the Gardaí on their efficiency and the speed with which they manage to reach places where crimes have been committed and the way in which they deal with those crimes.  We need reorganisation on rational lines.  I hope the Minister will not be influenced in any way by this unfortunate swan song from Deputy Boland on illegal organisations and armies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Boland in his request that the Garda Síochána should not be reduced in strength.  If anything, I think it should be increased. Last year 20,000 additional motor cars were registered.  Motor traffic is growing on the outskirts of the city since it has become so difficult to get through the main thoroughfares with a resultant danger to school children.  I think the time will come very shortly when a Garda officer will have to be placed on duty at every school at times when the children are either arriving or leaving the schools. Some of the thoroughfares which used to be merely secondary roads have now become main traffic arteries and in the interests of the children there should be someone on duty to regulate the traffic on these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the time has come, too, when the Gardaí will have to go on traffic control duty earlier.  It is impossible to cross O'Connell Bridge in the morning between 8.30 and 9 o'clock because of the density of traffic with all the people going to work.  I think the Gardaí should be on duty earlier in the morning.  The same is true, too, of the evening when the workers are going home, and others are coming in to theatres and so on.  One has only to look at the numbers of bicycles parked <Col N="1891" /> in O'Connell Street to see the number of people on the road just at the time when the traffic policeman is going off duty.  I would support the idea of increasing the Garda Estimate for the purpose of improving the conditions generally for the Guards.  Deputy Cowan, as a member of the corporation housing committee, as I am, is perfectly aware that a new Guard cannot get housing accommodation and that a Guard who had been living in Dublin and had been transferred to the country and is retransferred to Dublin and who, in the meantime, has been married and has two or three children, cannot get housing accommodation at twice the amount of money that is allowed for rent.  The rent allowance should be increased to give him a chance to meet the demand that is made on him.  The general conditions would warrant an improvement all round.  I do not intend to say any more.  I do not want to go into the details.  I looked at the Estimate to see how far I could go and, if I were to go any further, I, like Deputy Cowan, would be thanking the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to go a little further than I should.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the question of school and traffic duties and to increase the number of Guards on these duties at various points.  There are places where, a year or two years ago, it was not thought necessary to have a traffic Guard on duty but where it is necessary now.  I have in mind places on the outskirts of the city and thoroughfares where the traffic has greatly increased. Deputy Cowan is keenly interested in the Donnycarney area.  The number <Col N="1892" /> of traffic Guards there should be increased.</P>

      <P>In regard to the maintenance of the strength of the force, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to something we have seen published within the last few days.  I read a report in the papers of a case where, apparently, a house-breaking or larceny of some description was committed at the far side of the country&mdash;County Galway, I think.  It seems from the report that the technique in that case was to steal a car in Dublin, use it to convey the perpetrators of the crime to Galway, and steal another one in the vicinity of Galway to get back.  That was the inference one drew from the facts, as I read them.  I want to make it quite clear that I have no further information beyond what I read in the paper. That, obviously, brings up the question of quick communication between Gardaí.  Although it does not come on this Estimate, the question of telephone facilities after 11 o'clock at night is a serious matter and the question of having Guards in a position to intercept such operations quickly is an important matter.  That gets back to the question of strengths, which is relevant here, and I would ask the Minister to bear these considerations in mind in support of any proposals to increase the strength of the force.</P>
      <P>The importance of that force to the community nobody will minimise, and how much this State owes to its police force for the quiet, silent and extremely efficient work which that force has done in the past years of its history, will never really be appreciated.  It deserves well of the community and it deserves the support of the community in enforcing the peace of the community. For these reasons, I would like to add my voice to the voices of other Deputies in encouraging the Minister to give that force all the facilities and all the strength it needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the reorganisation of the Garda Síochána has been referred to.  I do not know what great need there is for reorganisation because, in my view, the Garda <Col N="1893" /> Síochána as it now stands is doing very good work and has been doing very good work since it was established.  This idea of reorganisation tends more to undermine the morale of the force than anything else.  I had a question on the Order Paper to-day to inquire about the activity of this inter-departmental committee that was set up to inquire into the question of the reorganisation of the Garda Síochána.  My reason for asking that question was the fact that I have found a certain amount of uneasiness among members of the Garda Síochána because they do not know what the future has in store for them. Some of them think that they will be retired.  Others think that there is a move being made to extend the age. They do not know where they are.</P>
      <P>The retirement age at present, I understand, is 57.  Some time ago it was rumoured that the age was to be extended.  I do not know, of course, whether the Minister or the commissioner has considered that aspect of the case but, in any case, I do not think it is right that there should be all this talk about the reorganisation of the Garda Síochána or about what Deputy Cowan described as the &ldquo;reorganisation of the Garda Síochána on rational lines,&rdquo; as much as to say that the organisation has been proceeding on irrational lines up to now.  I think the Garda Síochána can be compared favourably with the police force of any country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan also referred to the question of maintaining peace in this country and one would imagine by the way he spoke that it is only since the present Government came into office that we have peace.</P>

      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle does not consider it relevant, I do not propose to pursue this matter, but I would remind the Minister it is a very dangerous and very unwise thing to allow the strength of the Garda Síochána to fall below such a figure.  I think the figure is as low as it can be. The figure given was 5,500.  I do not consider that a sufficient strength for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>This idea of closing down barracks all over the country, which was mooted recently, does not appeal to me or to the people of the country.  They think we should leave very well alone.  In allowing the strength of the Garda Síochána to fall to such a low figure, I am afraid we are being penny wise and pound foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland has already referred to the night telephone service.  There have been rumours that a move is being made to close that service down here and there.  I think that would be a disastrous thing, because the general public have found the night telephone <Col N="1896" /> service in these Garda centres of great benefit.  The Government would be well advised to set their faces against any proposal of that kind.  The Minister's predecessor told me last week, in reply to a question, that there was no such proposal.  I hope that is true.  It would be very unwise to close down that telephone service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, due to lack of personnel. If the strength of the force is to go down below a certain figure, the personnel will not be there to operate that telephone service.  I do not know if it would be relevant on this occasion to inquire if the Department and the Commissioner are making sure that Irish-speaking Guards are being sent to the Gaeltacht.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear to me that sub-head A of this Supplementary Estimate is almost in the form of an apology for the fact that the Garda Síochána is even at its present strength.  It more or less suggests that if it had been possible, that sum which is in excess of the former Estimate and which is now required would not have been there.  I would like to see a greater amount proposed for the purpose of meeting extra strength, additional recruits, rather than that we should be, as it were, apologising for the fact that the Garda is as strong a force as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The City of Dublin, as Deputy Byrne has already mentioned, is continually growing and, naturally, the duties of the Garda in the city, whatever may be the position in the country&mdash;and I do not propose to discuss the country because I would not know anything about the Garda position there&mdash;are becoming much heavier.  The situation in the city is certainly becoming embarrassing <Col N="1897" /> for the Garda.  We see men doing excellent work as pointsmen on traffic duty.  How they maintain their good humour in the circumstances which surround them, and the difficulty of standing there for hours on such duty, passes my comprehension.  The fact remains that there are only a few of the positions sentinelled, as it were, by these pointsmen.  There are many more positions throughout the city crying out for a similar service.</P>
    <P>I can hardly imagine the Minister would be a party to allowing the Garda Síochána to be reduced below its present figure.  The Minister corrected the former Minister in regard to the figure of 5,500.  He informed him that it was 7,000.  That is correct, and we cannot dispute that.  The point is there are 1,450 men in plain clothes. Naturally, these men must work in the most unobtrusive fashion possible. They cannot advertise themselves as policemen; if they are to do their duty they must keep in the background. Their work is of such a specialised kind that they can be only of limited use to the uniformed police.</P>
    <P>One of the tests of whether the police force is sufficient to meet existing circumstances is the number of undiscovered crimes in the Twenty-Six Counties.  We know there are large numbers of crimes committed, burglaries and other crimes of one kind or another, and no person has ever been detained in connection with them.  I wonder would that position be changed if greater patrol duties were carried out in the suburban areas of Dublin? We have been reading for a considerable time of the campaign of burglaries in suburban areas.  The gentlemen who carry out these burglaries seem to be doing it in a reasonably organised manner.  They will go to one area to-day and carry out their work and then transfer their activities to the opposite side of the city where they are not expected.  That sort of thing is very difficult to control. It might not be so difficult if there were more uniformed Gardaí available.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to follow Deputy Cowan along the lines he pursued.  He <Col N="1898" /> is an adept at getting out of order, but he manages to do it for a considerable time before he is brought to book. If I were to do that, I would be rightly ruled out of order.  Therefore, I do not intend to do it.  Deputy Cowan manages to do that in an expert manner, but when he observes anyone else going off the line in the slightest way he manages to take over the duties of the Ceann Comhairle and do a sort of felon-setting by drawing the Ceann Comhairle's attention to the matter.  I do not intend to follow that line.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister, now that he is assuming such a responsible office, to give some reconsideration to the proposed reduction of the police force.  I should like to express strongly the opinion that that question should seriously be reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the matters, in fact nearly all the matters, which were raised in the course of the debate are amongst those that have been considered by this committee about which Deputy Kissane had a question on the Order Paper to-day. As I informed the Deputy, and as I now inform the House, the report of the committee will be available in the next few months.  I am not going to forecast, nor can I forecast, what the recommendations will be.  I doubt if they will be such as to confirm many of the fears expressed here to-day.  Let me say right off, or rather let me repeat what was said by General MacEoin last week, that there is no truth whatever about the reports circulated in newspapers and through other channels, in regard to rural Garda stations closing down at 11 p.m. There is no truth whatever either that Garda stations in the rural areas are going to be deprived of the telephonic facilities which they have enjoyed up to the present except in certain small stations where, because of leave of absence or illness, the strength of the station falls below a certain number. It is only for that reason that there would be any curtailment.  I fully agree with Deputies that the telephonic facilities which were made available in local Garda stations, particularly in remote rural areas, were <Col N="1899" /> of benefit to the local community, especially in cases of emergency, but let me say also&mdash;and I knew this before I became Minister for Justice&mdash; that in most areas there was a tendency to abuse these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite true, there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully appreciate the value of these facilities to the public, I certainly would not stand for a moment for the abuse of them, an abuse to such an extent as would interfere with the Guards in the performance of their ordinary duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in case the public might get the impression from all that has been said here, that there has been a very big reduction in the Garda forces, the fact of the matter is that the average strength of the Garda over the years has been about 7,200.  The present strength is approximately 6,950 or 7,000. In regard to the question of the size of the force, my view is that the force should be as large as will be required to safeguard the rights of the law-abiding citizens of the country.  So far as I am concerned, I would not approve of any move to reduce the number of the Garda merely for the sake of economy, but Deputies, I think, will agree that you might get a more efficient service as well as a more economical service by reorganisation. Deputy Kissane said he saw no reason whatever why there should be any reorganisation.  Everything which was said by other Deputies made it perfectly clear that the changing circumstances of the country and the shifting of the population in the country, in themselves would call for a reorganisation of the Garda.  I am rather sorry that Deputy Kissane took the line he did.  I would not wish that any member of the force should feel in any way uneasy and I have no hesitation in saying that no member of the force need feel in any way uneasy, need feel that he is going to be treated badly in any way or that his position will be made any worse than it is to-day. Again I must say I do not understand why Deputy Kissane thought it desirable <Col N="1900" /> to take the line he did, asking all sorts of questions about additional Guards.  I felt like asking Deputy Kissane when he was raising questions about this, that and the other, what his reason was for dragging all this out in public.</P>

Special reference was made to the work performed by the traffic men in this and other cities, particularly in the City of Dublin.  I think that was a very well deserved tribute.

      <P>The suggestion put forward, and not for the first time in this House, by Deputy Cowan, that we are reaching the stage when we shall have a village constable in each area, instead of a Garda station with a sergeant and three or four Guards, may not meet with universal acceptance. I am satisfied that over a great part of rural Ireland, certainly that could be done, if our police force were doing nothing but police duties but we know as a matter of fact, that police duties represent infinitely the lesser amount of their work, because there is hardly a Department of State for which they are not also working.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Boland that, I think, perhaps they can do it, because of their local knowledge and their standing with the public, more efficiently and certainly much more economically than inspectors recruited in any other way.  When we talk about the village constable, remember, we may do that if we confine him entirely to police duties, but if we want him to collect statistics and attend to all the other matters which the Guards are doing at present I am afraid that the proposition would not be a feasible one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan used a phrase, and I do not think he meant it.  The only reason I am referring to it is because, when talking about the force in the beginning, the phrase was that part of their duty was to spy on the people.</P>

      <P>If I misunderstood the Deputy nobody will be better pleased than I will be, and nobody more ready to acknowledge it.  I do want to add my voice to what has been already said, that they are an excellent force to whom we owe much.  My reason for referring to what Deputy Cowan said is that one of the reasons why they have been so effective and so successful is because they were accepted from the beginning, right down through the years, by the people of this country as their friends.</P>

      <P>They were there to see that the rights of the law-abiding citizen were protected.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Traynor to the question of a reduced force or rather not having enough to cover an ever-expanding.  City of Dublin to give adequate patrol protection to the out-lying areas.  I feel there is something in that.  However, I feel it is a bit too soon for me to express definite opinions until I get a better grasp of the situation.  I am just giving expression to impressions made on me in the ordinary way before I became Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned something about the campaign of burglaries there is.  That, of course, is something that is not peculiar to Dublin or to this country.  It is something that happens in every big city in every country in the world.  That, of course, is no reason why we should not take the most effective steps that can be taken to reduce it to the smallest possible dimensions. <Col N="1903" /> I can only say, in conclusion, that the points which have been made by the Deputies will be noted.  I hope that, when we get the report of this committee which has been inquiring into the whole question of the force over the last 12 months, it will enable us to improve the position, not merely from the point of view of the public, but from the point of view of the force and of the members of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £114,030 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1951, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate has been rendered necessary, in the main, by increases in the wages of forestry labourers unforeseen when the original Estimate was framed; the purchase of heavy machinery for the mechanical preparation and drainage of bog and other lands in order to fit them for planting, and stockpiling of fencing materials, tools and building requisites.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this financial year the wages of forestry labourers ranged from 58/4 to 64/7 a week.  Since that date various increases in wages have been granted and the rates now range from 62/- to 74/6 a week.  It is, therefore, necessary to ask for an additional sum of £68,250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A start has been made on the provision of heavy machinery by the purchase of 15 crawler tractors and fittings, and eight each of two types of ploughs specially designed for forestry work, one type to cut shallow drains and provide sods for mound planting and the other to cut deep contour drains.  Five of the tractors and two of the ploughs have already been delivered and a sum of £18,615 <Col N="1904" /> is required to meet the payments which have become due.  It is expected that the remaining tractors and ploughs will be received early in the next financial year.</P>
    <P>In view of the supply position, forward purchases are being made of rabbit netting, barbed wire and other fencing materials and tools.  A sum of £64,750 is required to meet payments for such materials already delivered or due for delivery before the end of this month.  A sum of £5,185 is required for additional expenditure on normal purchases of tools and materials.</P>
    <P>The lack of suitable housing accommodation for foresters at many of the State forests has caused serious difficulties.  Some suitable houses which have come on the market during the year have been purchased and there has also been some advance purchasing of materials to be used in house construction during 1951-52. £7,080 is required under these heads.</P>
    <P>Additional provision for travelling and subsistence allowances of the out door staff has become necessary as a result of increased travelling in connection with purchase of land.  A sum of £1,750 is required.</P>
    <P>As against these increases additional revenue from sales of timber is anticipated to the extent of £31,000, but this will be in part offset by a deficiency in other receipts of £6,460. There are savings usable to the total amount of £27,060.  A net supplementary amount of £114,030 is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to indulge in any criticism of the forestry department to-day.  I shall defer doing so until we get the main Estimate. I think it would not be quite fair to do so to-day.  I have no objection to the payment of extra travelling allowances.  I assume these were as the result of the survey that was made and of the visit by Mr. Cameron.  I am glad that portion of the expenditure is being devoted to the purchase of tractors and ploughs.  I suppose I may assume that this stock of mechanisation is for use on land which hitherto was not considered plantable.  That is <Col N="1905" /> a forward move and I offer my approval of it.  I understand the Minister to say that he is purchasing a number of new buildings for forestry workers. That is something which we can all approve of.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amount to be spent on building, I was wondering whether the Minister intends to make any extension in connection with the school at Avondale.  In view of new possibilities, it would seem to me that a big extension is needed there for the accommodation of the pupils.  The most interesting thing to me is the question of the purchase of land.  I am not going to question the Minister in regard to that to-day, though I hope that on the main Estimate he will be very clear as to the amount of plantable land acquired during the last few years and this year.  One particular section of land purchase would be that devoted to nurseries and I should like the Minister to tell us, in view of the expanded programme, what he has done with regard to the provision of further nursery acreage; if he has acquired many acreas of land for nurseries; if he intends to open, or has opened, any new nurseries and, if so, where.  As I say, I will discuss this matter on the main Estimate, but I should like the Minister to give us some information along these lines.  I should also like him to tell us when Mr. Cameron's report will be available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity on this Estimate to refer to a matter which I have raised before but which has not yet been dealt with satisfactorily by the Minister or his Department, and that is the question of the wages of forestry workers.  Last year it became the policy of the Minister and his Department, after a fairly lengthy period of agitation and pressure on the part of the trade union organising forestry labourers, to pay the county council rate to forestry labourers.  That was a long overdue step.  As we all know and as has been stated many times in this House, stated so often that it has become almost hackneyed, forestry workers have been <Col N="1906" /> performing a very essential national service; one which is not too easily discernible by the masses of the people but which, nevertheless, is very real. While they have been performing that service, the return which they have been receiving in the form of wages over a long number of years has been very poor.  In order to try to remedy that to some small extent steps were taken to persuade the Minister and the forestry section to pay the county council rate and that was done in every county except the County Dublin.  We have not very much forestry work in the County Dublin, although in the south county, particularly in the mountainous areas, there is ample opportunity for the extension of the forestry programme.  If we have from 20 to 30 forestry labourers in County Dublin, that is as many as there are there.  But, despite the fact that there is such a small number, the Minister saw fit to single them out from all the forestry workers in the country and refused to pay them the county council wages rate paid in the County Dublin.  That is totally unjustified.  No matter how the Minister may try to defend it, I do not think the Minister can justify that action so far as the forestry workers are concerned.  It seems to be based on some Civil Service idea of economy. The County Dublin forestry workers, instead of having their wages based on the Dublin County Council wage rate have been based on the County Wicklow County Council rate.  That does not apply to any other county.  The reason for that step, apparently, is that the Wicklow rate for road workers and for forestry workers is lower than the rate being paid by the Dublin County Council to road workers by about 15/- per week.  Therefore, in order to save the yearly cost of 20 men at 15/- per week, the very mean step was taken of refusing to pay the Dublin County Council rate for road workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take advantage of this Supplementary Estimate to ask the Minister to remedy that obvious injustice and not to try to make a case for this step which was taken by the forestry section, as no case exists.  The cost to the Exchequer of paying these men what they should be getting would be <Col N="1907" /> negligible and not worth talking about when dealing with Estimates which run into millions of pounds, but it is a very important matter for the men concerned.  Fifteen shillings a week for forestry labourers means a great deal, and I ask the Minister to remedy this injustice.  I hope that when he is introducing his main Estimate he will be able to announce a new rate of wages for forestry workers, not alone in Dublin, but throughout the rest of the country, because undoubtedly forestry workers are not being paid a living wage at present.  They never have been paid a living wage, and the Minister could do himself a good turn by going down in history as the first Minister to afford to forestry workers some sort of a decent chance to live.  They are not getting that at present.  I ask the Minister when replying to deal with that matter on a fair basis and not to rely on the prejudiced attitude of some of the officials of his Department in relation to the forestry workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate was necessary in the main because of the increase in wages and for the purchase of machinery.  Deputy Moylan asked me for what purpose the machinery was needed.  It is needed to prepare land which was hitherto unplantable. That may mean some unplantable land which the forestry department may have accumulated over the years.  The machinery will also allow us to avail of offers of land which we could not touch up to this and which it is most desirable to plant provided that the plantations will be a success.  The machinery and the methods of soil preparation which the machinery will place at our disposal will ensure that success.  A good deal of the unplantable land which we have on hands is barren mountain top.  There are also big expanses of bog which could not be handled up to this because the plantations would be a failure.  That is the purpose for which the machinery is necessary.  Five <Col N="1908" /> machines have already been delivered and I hope that world conditions will not prevent us from getting the full number we have ordered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifteen, which ought to be sufficient for our needs for a year or two.  After we have been using these for a time we will know whether we require more.  I believe that we will require more, that the 15 will not be sufficient, because in many parts of the country there are vast expanses of unplantable ground which, if we had machinery to deal with it, would produce successful plantations.  It was in connection with that that I visited the Scottish and English forests last year. I saw the type of machinery used there and the type of the work they were doing.  They carried out some experiments both in England and Scotland which proved conclusively that land on which plantations were a failure when it was unprepared would, when it was prepared by this method of ploughing, produce young trees just as well as if they had been sown on good arable land.</P>
      <P>We have bought some houses because the lack of foresters' houses has a hampering effect on the work of the Department, inasmuch as where foresters are married men they must be provided with housing accommodation. It is not easy to change them about.  Because of the expanded programme it may in the future be necessary to take a man who has acquired a fair amount of experience in the Department and move him into an area that we intend to develop.  If he happens to be a married man it might be very difficult to move him and it has happened in the past that we have not been able to take advantage of some of the best men in the Department for a particular job.  Not alone do we intend to buy houses where they become available but we also intend to erect houses of our own in forestry areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan asked for particulars of the nursery acreage.  I have not got <Col N="1909" /> the details since it would be necessary to compile them in a tabular statement, but I can supply them if necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The nursery acreage has been increased from 280 acres to 700 acres and many new centres have been opened up.  I am familiar with a few of them&mdash;one in Wicklow, two in Mayo and one fairly large one in Portumna on the Earl of Harewood estate.  The best idea I can give the House is to say that the acreage has been increased to 700 acres.  That is not quite sufficient for our needs and we shall need an extra 40, 50 or 60 acres to cope with our full programme, but the acquisition of that acreage will not present any difficulties.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cameron's report will be made available as soon as possible.  He was sent here by the Food and Agriculture Organisation to report on conditions here and, indeed, throughout the world.  He made his report to his director.  Courtesy copies were sent to us and as soon as printing can be undertaken, copies will be made available to the Deputies.</P>
      <P>With regard to Avondale, the house there has now become unsuitable as a school for trainees.  Double the number of trainees will be required in the future and we are immediately up against the problem of accommodation. Avondale happens to be the most suitable site since the best training facilities exist there.  Hitherto we took in about 12 trainees each year and kept them for two years and the house there was generally carrying approximately 20 to 25 trainees.  We have decided, therefore, to build a completely new structure in Avondale.  It will accommodate 50 students and the old structure will be retained for other purposes. The building of the new structure will proceed as rapidly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne raised the question of forestry workers' wages.  He appears to take the attitude that forestry workers in Dublin have been victimised and that the Department holds some kind of grudge against them.  That is <Col N="1910" /> not true.  First of all, since this Government took office three years ago, forestry workers have received no less than three increases in pay.  If I remember correctly, forestry workers were receiving something in the neighbourhood of 48/- per week when this Government took office.  To-day the rates range from 62/- to 74/6.  In Wicklow the rate is 74/6.  There are a few forestry workers working actually inside the Dublin boundary, but they are really working in the County Wicklow forest, because an arm of the forest stretches across the county border.  A very difficult situation would be created if men in one part of the forest were receiving a certain rate of pay while others a couple of yards away were receiving a different rate. It is common knowledge that the Dublin County Council, because of the high cost of living in regions bordering on the city, has given a specially high rate, a rate which no other county council pays.  Paying a few forestry workers in County Dublin the Wicklow rate of 74/6 is not unreasonable taken by and large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Not revolution, but discontent, with the possibility that men might refuse to work in one part of a forest as against another part. There is a certain amount of difference all over.  You have adjoining county councils, such as Mayo and Galway, Cork and Waterford, Tipperary and Kilkenny; in all those you have a slightly different rate and in one forest it is possible that a lower rate of wages will be paid to the men than is <Col N="1911" /> paid to another group working a mile away in a different county.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1951, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including Housing Grants and the purchase and sale of Homespuns.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £10 is intended to allow of the utilisation for the activities of the Gaeltacht services division of the Department of Lands of the £35,000 estimated Appropriations-in-Aid, treated in the original Estimate as Exchequer extra receipts, and additional Appropriations-in-Aid which it is estimated will be received.</P>
      <P>The additional receipts thus brought into account will be utilised to meet additional estimated expenditure (1) under sub-head D (6), which provides for the purchase of yarns and other manufacturing materials mainly for the use of the knitwear industry; (2) under sub-head D (8), which provides for the purchase of materials and machinery and the meeting of other expenditure in connection with the toy industry; and (3) under sub-head D (9), which provides, principally, for the purchase of wool for use in the spinning industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under each of these sub-heads the additional expenditure is necessitated <Col N="1912" /> by the increased cost of materials since the original Estimate was prepared and by a decision to start the building up of reserves of supp lies against a possible emergency.</P>
    <P>Of the total estimated additional expenditure of approximately £65,000, approximately £10,000 is offset by savings on other sub-heads, leaving a balance of something under £55,000 to be met out of the additional amount now shown as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The sales of the products of the rural industries of the Department have shown some degree of recovery during the year.  As a result, the receipts have been sufficient to cover the full amount credited as Exchequer extra receipts in the original Estimate and to provide, apart from that amount, over £28,000 towards meeting additional expenditure out of Appropriations-in-Aid and the net additional expenditure under the debit sub-heads of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Provision has had to be made for a deficiency of over £7,000 in the receipts from sales of marine products.  This deficiency is due mainly to the fact that the purchase of sea-rods this season has been greatly retarded because of weather conditions, which did not allow the sea-rods to be dried sufficiently for earlier purchase and disposal. Expenditure which normally would have fallen on this year's Vote will fall to be met out of next year's Vote with consequential effect on receipts.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that an additional £3,000 will be received from the disposal of materials no longer required for the use of the industries.</P>
    <P>In order to provide for the additional expenditure contemplated, it is necessary to ask the Dáil for £10 only as a token Vote.</P>

      <P>Having spoken in Irish, I would just say a few words in English on this Supplementary Estimate.  It is a rather confined Estimate and I have been told that I am not at liberty to discuss anything connected with housing grants on this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I wanted to raise this matter now is that I <Col N="1916" /> consider it one of urgency.  Regarding materials for Gaeltacht industries, as I have already asked in Irish, is it because these materials have become more expensive, dearer to purchase, that the Supplementary Estimate is required?  What materials are these? I did not hear the Minister giving a list of the materials, but I suppose we will come to it later on.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on the toy industry.  It is in my opinion a very important industry for the Gaeltacht and I believe it is capable of greater expansion.  Up to the present it has been confined to one place in County Donegal, a place called Crolly.  There is also a place in the County Mayo Gaeltacht, Erris, and there was also, if I remember rightly, a toy industry in Spiddal.  I remember on the occasion of the presentation of the main Estimate to the Dáil reference was made to the Spiddal toy industry. So far as I could gather from the speakers in the debate on the Gaeltacht Estimate, the Spiddal toy industry had closed down.  I do not know whether it has reopened.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten me and the House, because if it is the case that an industry of that kind has been allowed to lapse, I would consider it a retrograde step. On that occasion I understood the Minister to say that the toys that were being produced in the Gaeltacht factories were comparable with those produced elsewhere, if not better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I also understood him to say that some of these toys were being exported.  Apparently there is a demand for them even outside this country.  If that is the case I believe the time has arrived when we should expand that toy industry.  If there is an export market and if these toys are suitable for our people at home I do not see why we should not try to establish a few more toy industries in other parts of the Gaeltacht.  Once or twice I had the pleasure of visiting the toy industry in Donegal and I was delighted to see the number of young people especially who had employment in that factory.  The employees there seemed to be quite satisfied with the <Col N="1917" /> nature of their employment.  I was wondering when would the time come when similar employment would be provided for our people in other parts of the Gaeltacht, especially down as far as the Kerry Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the Kerry Gaeltacht has not been receiving very much attention as regards industry.  I really do not know why.  I had a question recently down here.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce about a certain industry that I was told flourished in the Dingle Gaeltacht some years ago.  It was the growing of a kind of flax for rope making and I was informed that at one time several acres in the Dingle peninsula, around Dingle, were under this crop.  During the emergency there was a shortage of rope fibre here and it would have been a good thing if we had that industry. Indeed, it would be a good thing now because a similar shortage might arise again.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed me that such an industry would not be an economic proposition, so I suppose that they must have investigated it; the technical advisers to the Department must have investigated the possibilities of that industry.</P>
      <P>However, there may be an opportunity of starting some other industries in that part of the Kerry Gaeltacht, thereby keeping as many people as possible at home.  Unfortunately, as I need scarcely remind the Dáil, there has been an exodus from the Gaeltacht, from every part of it, north, south and west.  Even now I understand that whole families are leaving the Gaeltacht and going to foreign countries.  I consider that a national tragedy in a way.  It is very hard to find the remedy.</P>

I do not know whether I am right or not in that, and I would like to hear the Minister's views on it, especially since, apparently, it is established that these toys are of very good quality and that there is a good demand for them, not merely in this country but outside it.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head D (9), I do not know what to say about the spinning industry. I have not any great knowledge of it myself since it is confined mostly to Donegal.  Probably, some Deputy from that county will have something to say about it.</P>

    <P>I do not intend to delay the House on this Supplementary Estimate, but there are one or two things which, I think, I had better refer to in English since I am anxious to get an explanation from the Minister about them.  I presume it is a tradition which has grown up in the preparation of the Estimate for this Department&mdash;but I have never succeeded in understanding it clearly&mdash;to have different connotations of the three sub-heads or rather of the first sub-head and the other two.  There is a reference under sub-head D (6) to materials, and under sub-head D (8) and (9) to the toy industry and spinning.  I should like to know in respect of what the revised Estimate is brought in for materials if not for the toy industry and spinning.  I am sure there is an explanation, but it is not apparent from the Supplementary Estimate itself.  I would be glad if the Minister would clarify the matter when replying.</P>
    <P>There is one comment that was not made on the Estimate, and in fairness to the Minister I think it should be made.  It is that, however gloomy a view we take of the picture of the Gaeltacht generally, and I am not one of those who sees it through rose-coloured spectacles, I do not believe that half enough is being done.  If five times the sum of money asked for were provided, I still would be inclined to say that, for the job in hands, it <Col N="1920" /> would still be insufficient.  I think that a certain meed of praise and of congratulation is due to the Minister in connection with the Appropriations-in-Aid. These are very substantial and spring from additional receipts.  I do not know to what extent that is due to the inflated money values which appertain to-day.  Taking the matter at its face value, the Minister, I think, does merit a certain meed of praise in that respect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Chair would allow me to refer to a matter which I dealt with when speaking in Irish.  I do so for the benefit of the Minister.  I would be glad if he would let us know whether any provision is being made for increased wages for the workers engaged in the toy industry and spinning industry.  It is not apparent from the face of the Estimate that any such provision is being made.  If not, then to that extent the Minister has failed in his job, because, I think, such a provision should have been made.  Quite frankly, I am not an enthusiast about the types of toy industry and spinning industry on which such reliance is placed by the Gaeltacht Services section of the Minister's Department.  I believe that if we are going to keep the people in the Gaeltacht at home, we will have to provide a much more solid and less exotic type of industry than the manufacture of toys.</P>
    <P>I am not going to suggest specifically to the Minister the particular direction which that industrial expansion should take.  I do feel, however, on this occasion, as I felt before, that the whole question of the development of industry in the Gaeltacht is so completely and inextricably tied up with the development of an afforestation programme and the basing of industries on a developed afforestation programme that to look in any other direction without taking that into account is, to a certain extent, a waste of time.  I may be completely wrong, but I have the feeling that an undertaking like the toy industry, while it may, as Deputy Kissane said, produce goods which are uniformly excellent and commercially saleable, would be difficult to develop in a real way that <Col N="1921" /> will solve the endemic unemployment problem that you have continually in the Gaeltacht.  That can be solved by a vigorous and consistently pursued policy of afforestation, by the development of industry based on the utilisation of fish and fish products, and I think only in that way.</P>

      <P>I shall pass from it. I always have the feeling that this Estimate is one which has the goodwill of the Minister, and if the Minister is not presenting a bigger bill to the Dáil, it may not be the Minister's fault.  I repeat to the Minister what I said on at least three occasions already in this House, that as far as the provision of services for the development of the Gaeltacht and the setting up of industry there are concerned, he need never worry about the size of the bill as far as our Party is concerned, because we will back him to the last penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Estimate, even though I come from a constituency practically one half of which belongs to the Gaeltacht area.  The Minister is better aware of the situation in that Mayo section of the Gaeltacht area than I am and I am glad to see that he is making every effort to help out the people of the Gaeltacht and to do as much as he can for them.  I am in agreement with Deputy Lehane that the population of the Gaeltacht is declining.  That may be because successive Governments have not done sufficient for the Gaeltacht and the people in it.  It may be that there has <Col N="1922" /> been so much emigration to England, the United States and elsewhere over a considerable number of years that when people come back they put it into the minds of other people in the Gaeltacht that there are better things for them across the seas.  That may be the cause of a certain amount of restlessness which there is amongst the Gaeltacht population.  However, the responsibility is on the Government and on the Minister and his Department to try to help out the Gaeltacht people as best they can.</P>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Deputy Lehane that the establishment of an industry like the toy industry will not be a proper solution and will not satisfy in full the wants of the people in the Gaeltacht.  I do not want to go outside the scope of the Estimate, but there are at least three or four different Government Departments which should be as interested in the Gaeltacht as the Department of Lands.  The Department of Agriculture should help out with the fisheries and the Department of Industry and Commerce should also help in the matter.  The effort that is being made by the Minister, particularly in regard to the forestry programme which he is now introducing into the Gaeltacht&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the start which the Minister has made in that direction is deserving of praise, because it is the first real effort which has been made towards the development of forestry industry in the Gaeltacht.  It would be a wise policy if the Minister could introduce into the Gaeltacht some other type of industry as well as the toy industry and he would have the co-operation of Deputies on all sides of the House.  I do not think the Minister for Finance would stint him in the spending of money.  I hope that the effort which <Col N="1923" /> the Minister is making will be continued with even more success.</P>
      <P>We are told that the products of the toy factories and the spinning industry in Tourmakeady are satisfactory and of good quality and are fit to compete in an outside market.  That is something which we should be proud of.  We are able to say that the Gaeltacht people can come up to scratch when asked to do so in regard to the products of their little factories, and the expansion of these should get every consideration and encouragement.  The kelp industry and other industries in the Gaeltacht have also been of benefit and shown a profit, and when the Minister decides to spend more money on these things, he deserves every praise and encouragement. I agree with Deputy Lehane that the best approach to the Gaeltacht problem would be the expansion as far as possible of the forestry industry in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <P>It is rather difficult for Deputies, speaking on this Supplementary Estimate and anxious to aid the people of the Gaeltacht to the extent that they would like, to keep within the bounds of relevancy.  But Deputy Lehane and Deputy Commons were somewhat pessimistic when speaking of the toy industry.  I am sure that both of them are aware that this is only a beginning of an industry.  There has to be some beginning.  It is a matter of nursing it carefully, encouraging it by every means possible and eventually developing it to the stage when it will be of much greater value to the people than it is at present.  I had the pleasure of seeing some examples of the toy industry some time ago at the Royal Dublin Society Spring Show or Horse Show.  They happened to be those little lead soldiers, the things that we used to get from Germany years ago.  I was astonished to learn at the time that these experiments were carried out completely and solely in the Gaeltacht. The colouring of the uniforms of the toy soldiers was something that had to be seen to be believed.  I think that industry should be encouraged as much as possible, particularly from the point of view of developing it to the fullest <Col N="1924" /> extent.  That does not necessarily mean that other valuable and useful industries should be excluded.  Deputy Commons and Deputy C. Lehane must be as well aware as I am of the magnificent industry that was established in Germany mainly among the Bavarian peasants; that toy industry was second to none in the whole world. It employed vast numbers.  There is no doubt that if we could establish a toy industry on similar lines in the Gaeltacht it would be of inestimable advantage to the people in those areas.</P>

      <P>The lead toys that were turned out, particularly in Spiddal, were certainly excellent in quality and very attractive.  Strangely enough, they sold very well during the war&mdash; sold as the saying goes, &ldquo;like hot cakes.&rdquo;  The moment war was over, the demand dropped and we had to temporarily close the factory in Spiddal.  The factory did not close down for good.  It was closed for a period of two to three weeks while a change over was made from the manufacture of lead toys to soft toys, such as dolls and parts of dolls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  At the moment there are 30 employed there constantly and we hope to expand a little further in the near future.  There is no market at the present time for the lead toys, but the soft toys that we are now producing are selling all over the world. The following figures will give the House some idea of the market: Ireland, £41,230; Britain, £27,421; Canada, £180; Gibraltar, £10; U.S.A., £7; Sweden, £11, making a total of £68,859, or nearly £70,000 on toys alone.  The quality is good.  While there is no danger of toys being left on our hands through over-production there is not at the moment room on the market for an expansion of the industry. The three factories, Elly Bay in North Mayo, Spiddal in Galway, and Crolly in County Donegal, are turning out our full requirements.  We are not faced with a flood of orders that we cannot cope with, but we are constantly exploring markets in an effort to discover if there is any room for expansion.</P>

      <P>Deputy C. Lehane said he was not quite clear as to what is needed under the various sub-heads.  Under sub-head D (6) we want woollen yarns for knitwear.  Under sub-head D (9) we want yarn for spinning and turning out tweeds and so on.  We have to keep each sub-head in a separate compartment though the materials may be fairly closely allied.  The amount required to meet price increases under sub-head D (6) is £3,621 and for stockpiling £14,120.  That is for woollen yarn for the knitwear industry.  Under sub-head D (8) we have the toy industry; the money there is required mainly for materials like plush, cotton and packing material, £4,700 to meet price increases and £10,720 for stockpiling. Under sub-head D (9), spinning, there is only one item, wool.  The price increase there will not come as a surprise to Deputies.  The amount required is £7,500 and the amount for stockpiling is £24,080.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane mentioned the increase in wages in the toy and spinning industries.  There was an increase in January, 1950, and another as late as last October.  These matters are looked after by the Department, as otherwise there would be a good deal of criticism in the House if our workers were not paid a satisfactory wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Commons and Deputy C. Lehane both mentioned forestry. Forestry does not arise under this Supplementary Estimate and we cannot discuss it.  No doubt it will arise on the main Estimate.  When that is introduced I shall have good news for the House in relation to an expansion <Col N="1926" /> in forestry, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas.  I am aware that industries so far in these areas cater specially for women.  I hope to rectify that in the future and I hope that my attempts will have the desired effect of stemming emigration and the flight from these areas.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a toy industry in Kerry is dependent upon the market for toys generally. If the three factories at present in production were not able to meet the demand it would then be possible to consider the establishment of a factory somewhere in the Kerry Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of establishing a toy industry in Kerry, should the necessity arise, would receive very sympathetic consideration both from myself and the Department.  There is no money in the Vote for kelp, but sea rods do come in.  I understand they are there to be gathered along the coast of Kerry. We are paying £4 12s. 6d. for dried sea rods anywhere we can get them and there is no limit to the market.  The <Col N="1927" /> Deputy might do a vast amount of benefit to his constituents along the coastal area if he makes that known. If they gather sea rods and do them up in bundles and dry them, as they do from Donegal to County Clare, they have £4 12s. 6d. a ton to get for them. It is a useful source of remuneration to many people along the sea coast who have, perhaps, small holdings and no fishing industry to supplement their earnings.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £19,270 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs, already approved by the Dáil for the financial year ending 31st March, 1951, amounts to £5,488,600.  Owing to causes which could not have been foreseen, this provision will be insufficient, and an additional sum of £19,270 will be required to meet expenditure up to the end of the financial year.</P>
      <P>The gross extra expenditure on the sub-heads for which the original provision is insufficient is estimated at £186,920.  Against this, however, receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid will be higher by £60,600 than was estimated and savings amounting to £107,050 will be available from other sub-heads, leaving a net sum of £19,270.</P>
      <P>The causes of the increased expenditure are briefly as follows:&mdash; Sub-head D, increase, £5,500; this is due to expenditure on the acquisition of certain sites, for which no provision was made in the main Estimate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>One site in question is at College Green.  This refers to the purchase of a head landlord's interest in 28 College Green, one of the buildings constituting the College Green Post Office.  It amounts to £9,000. There is then the purchase of a new post office site at Wicklow.  The sale was to have been closed last year, but it is being closed this year.  The provision there is £420, making a total of £9,420.  Savings owing to the purchase of other sites not being completed amount to £3,920, so the net sum required is £5,500.</P>
      <P>On sub-head E (5), the increase is £119,000.  The increase is due to (1) growth of traffic, mainly to the United States of America and to the British Commonwealth and Europe, and (2) payment in this financial year of accounts due to be paid, but not received last year.</P>
      <P>In sub-head G (1) the increase is £47,420.  Of this sum £45,920 is attributable to the purchase of emergency reserve stocks owing to the international situation.  The balance is due to increased prices of commodities purchased.</P>
      <P>The increase in sub-head G (2) is £10,000 due to purchases of emergency reserve stocks, mainly of cloth.  The increase in sub-head N (1) is £5,000, due to greater expenditure on marriage gratuities and death gratuities. That explains the various increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is not here; I regret it for several reasons, especially as it is largely due to ill-health.  However, it has placed the Tánaiste in an extremely awkward position because, having been secretary of the Postal Workers' Union, he is now in the position of being the employer, and this makes it very difficult for him to deal with the matter properly and adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into a general criticism of the Department now.  As regards the sites, I am glad the situation in College Green is being cleared <Col N="1929" /> up.  I do not know whether that involves any of the property where the new building is, but as regards the new building it is very urgently needed and it is essential to have it completed, because apparently the present position with regard to the telephone exchange is a chaotic one, owing to lack of space and the lack of a proper room for the personnel to deal with the calls coming in on the increased number of telephones which have been installed all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows, of course, that this has nothing to do with the proposed new exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  As regards stores, apparently the only increase here is due to an increase of price.  Both here and in the Book of Estimates I notice there does not seem to be any awareness of the possible shortages that may occur later on and I urge the Department to try to lay in as much in the way of stores as they can.  When we were in office&mdash;I do not claim this as a political claim at all&mdash;I would like to emphasise that our controller of stores was quick enough to pick up an amount of material, especially of cable, which carried us through the emergency.</P>
      <P>Every effort should be made now to increase this Estimate for the next year and to show that the attitude indicated in the Supplementary Estimate is not going to be the attitude during the coming year.  I know there may be difficulty in obtaining supp lies, but every effort should be made to obtain them because that is the one thing that may hold back development later on.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will bring in his Telephone Capital Bill soon in order to deal with the problem of increasing telephones all over the country.  I do not intend to discuss legislation now but I would like to say that.  I do not suppose the property at Ardmore comes under the Post Office.  Has it been bought by the Post Office for broadcasting purposes and is it on that account?</P>

      <P>I shall convey Deputy Little's sympathy and good wishes to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and his expression of kind solicitude for his early return to his parliamentary duties.  Deputy Little is concerned about the purchase of stores and I want to set his worried mind at rest by telling him that we are making provision for the purchase of more stores than were ever bought before. If the Deputy thinks that his achievements during the emergency were monumental, he will be satisfied that the purchases on this occasion will be substantially more.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs will not want for money when it comes to buying stores in advance, because the Government's desire is that the maximum possible quantity of available stores should be bought as prudently as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been reasonably friendly in this discussion, but when Deputy Little proceeds to warn us about the need for purchasing stores, without having made any inquiries as to the quantity we bought, even Deputy Traynor will not object to my defending myself.  I am doing that by telling Deputy Little that there is no need for any furrowed brows on this matter.  We are buying all the stores necessary and will continue that policy, so as to ensure that there will be no shortfall in the matter of supp lies, so far as money will enable us to purchase these supp lies.</P>
      <P>With regard to Pearse Street, while it is not referred to in the Estimate, I know that it is a problem dear to Deputy Little's heart.  He toyed with it for 16 years and the place was just the same in the 16th year as it was in the first year.  The Deputy will be glad to know now that an alternative site to Pearse Street has been purchased, or is about to be purchased&mdash; a very much better site, very much more conveniently located, a very much bigger site and much more suitable&mdash;and, for the first time, there is now a ray of hope that some effective steps will be taken in due course to give the City of Dublin the central sorting office that it ought to have had during the many years Deputy Little sat on this side.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It was the intention to take the Second Reading of the Defence Bill, which was circulated to Deputies towards the end of November last, before the Christmas recess.  The parliamentary programme did not, however, permit this, and there is not now, of course, any possibility of having that Bill considered and passed before the end of the present session.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, therefore, to continue the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts for a further period and the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1951, proposes to effect this continuation for a period of 12 months.  It may be added that, even if the permanent measure were passed by the Oireachtas and enacted, a breathing space would be required to enable all the necessary regulations and administrative measures consequent on the provisions of that Bill to be prepared.</P>
      <P>If the Defence Bill is enacted early in the year, it may be possible to repeal the Temporary Provisions Acts before the 31st March next but this, of course, will depend upon the extent to which the necessary regulations, etc., can be prepared in time.  It will be realised that the Defence Bill is one of the longest measures to appear before the Dáil and that considerable revision of existing regulations and administrative measures will arise from the enactment of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, coming before the Dáil as it does annually, usually provides an opportunity for members of the Opposition to raise questions relating to defence and to the <Col N="1934" /> Army.  In the normal way, with the Estimates coming along, these matters can be debated in full.  However, more than 12 months ago, the Defence Bill proper, that is, the permanent Defence Bill, was introduced.  I think it was introduced in the month of December and this House ordered the Second Reading for 15th February.  Almost 12 months ago, I asked the then Minister for Defence if he would give us a specific date on which we could discuss matters of defence.  The then Minister, apparently, was not prepared to give us a date and he gave as the reasons that he could not control the activities of the draftsman.  Twelve months have passed and we are still awaiting the Second Reading of that permanent Bill. I do not think the Bill is one which will cause the House very much trouble.  It is not, as far as I can see, a very controversial Bill, but it would afford the House a splendid opportunity of general discussion on defence.  If the Minister can assure me that the permanent Bill is coming along in the near future, I shall not discuss this tempoary measure at length.  The people, naturally, are entitled to be kept as informed as possible on the danger situation that exists in the world to-day and, from that point of view, we on this side of the House, naturally, would be inclined to discuss this Bill at greater length if we were not assured that the permanent Bill would be coming along in the near future.  Can the Minister give us any assurance that the Second Stage of the permanent Bill will be taken at some early date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of another Temporary Provisions Bill is something that causes me considerable concern.  Since I came into this House three years ago, I have pressed very strongly for the introduction of a Defence Forces Bill which would enable this House, for the first time in 28 years, to discuss the provisions under <Col N="1935" /> which the Army is administered and under which discip line is maintained. I have received every conceivable assurance that the permanent Bill will be introduced at an early date.  Last year, when there was some opposition to the Temporary Provisions Bill being enacted for another year, the House was assured that, if we agreed to extend the life of the Temporary Provisions Bill until, I think, 31st March of this year, the House would in the meantime have an opportunity of considering in full the permanent Bill and of dealing with it.  That assurance has not been kept.</P>
      <P>I think the House can justifiably complain about what has happened in connection with the Defence Forces Bill.  No matter what assurance the Minister may give now that the Bill will be brought before the House at an early date, it is clear that that cannot be done.  It is clear that the Defence Forces Bill cannot be brought before the House before next autumn, because the volume of important legislation, Estimates, financial business, the Budget, the Social Welfare Bill, the County Management Bill, is such that any assurance the Minister can give cannot possibly mean that the Bill can be discussed before next autumn.  By that time there may still be a volume of very important legislation awaiting consideration by the House.  I am not familiar with procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not familiar with procedure, because I have not seen it.  Is there a possibility that the permanent Bill could be committed to some select committee representing all sides of the House?  I do not know whether that can be done or not.  If it can be done, it ought to be done, so that quite a lot <Col N="1936" /> of the administrative and discip linary machinery that is in the Bill could be discussed by representatives of all Parties in the House and by any Deputy who would like to be on that select committee.  In that way, possibly, we would get an opportunity of examining in detail the matters that are included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want the House to realise that, no matter how sincerely the Minister may give an undertaking that the Defence Forces Bill will be brought before it as soon as possible, that assurance cannot be kept because of the volume of legislation and business that has to be done.  I would rather have no assurance from the Minister than the sort of assurance that we have had, which has not been honoured.</P>
      <P>The position, therefore, is that we are asked to extend this temporary legislation for, probably, its 28th year. Realising that there will be no opportunity for months at least for the House to consider the permanent Bill fully, I think I should avail of the opportunity to refer to the Army, the strength of the Army, Army policy generally.</P>
      <P>The object of our Defence Forces is to carry out the defence policy of the Government.  What is that defence policy?  Have we decided, in any eventuality, to entangle ourselves in a possible future war?  If we have decided to entangle ourselves in a possible war, is the Army organised, is it of sufficient strength, and has it adequate armament for the purpose? If the policy is to maintain neutrality, have we the military strength, the military equipment and the military organisation sufficient to maintain that policy of neutrality, or, if we want to go further and recover by force part of our national territory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those are matters which, I think, ought to be considered in connection with this particular Bill. No matter what may be said, either in this country or in some other country as to what our policy might be in the event of our national territory being reintegrated, I think we should have a very clear statement from the Minister that this country is not tied, or does not propose to tie itself in the future, in regard to these particular matters.</P>
      <P>Now, whether it will be our intention to participate in a future war or whether it will be our intention not to participate in a future war, but to maintain a policy of neutrality, either decision necessitates a considerable military force, not necessarily a permanent force, but a military force armed adequately, equipped properly and properly organised.  I think it is the general concern of the public that our Defence Force should be strong enough for any such test that may face it in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred yesterday, in an incidental way on a supplementary defence Estimate, to a matter that does affect the strength of our Defence Force. Are the Defence Forces strong enough? Have we enough personnel in the permanent force, and have we enough officers, N.C.O.s and men in the Reserve, and have we enough officers, N.C.O.s and men in the F.C.A.?  If we have not the strength at the moment, is it the intention and determination of the Government to bring all those component parts of our Defence Forces up to that proper strength in the immediate future?  In connnection with that matter, I would like to put before the Minister a point of view <Col N="1938" /> which I expressed in this House to his predecessor, that we have in the country a very large, well-trained body of officers, N.C.O.s and soldiers who have rendered service over a long period to the country, and who, because of an artificial age limit, have been discharged both from the regular force and from the Reserve.  That large body of trained officers, N.C.O.s and men ought to be made available for the Defence Forces so that they could contribute the knowledge they have gained and improve, by their service, the efficiency of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Some few years ago a decision was taken to impose an arbitrary age limit that eliminated some of the most valuable material we had from active association even with the Defence Forces.  I pressed the Minister's predecessor that those individuals ought to be brought within the Defence Forces again, and that their services ought not to be lost to the country.  I think that, with that point of view, the Minister himself, from his long experience as a soldier, must agree.  Even in the Regular Army at the moment, although the age limits have been increased somewhat, officers are reaching the age when they are compelled to retire on pension. They are paid a pension by the State, but they are completely cut away from rendering any further service to the Defence Forces.  That is an unwise policy and it is wrong.  Even in America, shortly after the last war ended, there was that idea of retiring officers and men in their prime from the army.  After a short time they discovered that that was an unwise policy and they decided to bring back quite a number of those experienced soldiers into the American forces.  We are not a great country like America; we have not the reserves of man power or material which they have.  We are short in man power and we are very short in material.  That being so, the State ought to get every ounce of energy, efficiency and service that they can from the people.</P>
    <P>I press the Minister very strongly to revise these age limits and to ensure that when an officer retires from the <Col N="1939" /> Regular Forces he will become a reserve officer for a number of years until he reaches an age when it is reasonable to assume he will not be fit to fight any longer; that those very experienced officers of the old reserve, men who were comrades with Deputy Major de Valera and myself, be recommissioned in the reserve so that they can render service to the country.  The officers who have been retired under the age limit are willing to serve longer.  But the foolish policy in operation prevents them from doing that. We give them a pension which I do not consider adequate, but, nevertheless, it is a substantial one, and we say: &ldquo;We do not want your help or assistance; we do not want your service any longer.  If a crisis comes, we shall look for you and we expect you to come in and we will have some sort of <i>ad hoc</i> organisation or disorganisation.&rdquo; I suggest to the Minister that that very large trained body of officers, N.C.O.s and men who have rendered long service to the State, who are still young enough to fight, young enough to concern themselves with the administration of all these new units of the F.C.A. which must be formed, young enough to carry out administrative duties and responsibilities, should be invited to renew their active association with the Defence Forces either as soldiers, N.C.O.s or officers.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Traynor and Deputy Major de Valera would agree that when the last emergency came and it was necessary to recruit a very large body of men, the units that contributed most to the organisation of that large body of men and to the training of them were those officers and N.C.O.s who were known as the A and B Reserve. Tribute was paid to them by the then Minister for Defence, by the Chief of Staff and by general and other very responsible officers.  When there is a world crisis, it does seem strange that those people should be left at home doing nothing, with their very valuable knowledge and experience going to waste, when that knowledge and experience could be utilised in building up the F.C.A.  This is not a wealthy country; it is not a country which can maintain a very large Regular Army. <Col N="1940" /> That being so, it has to do the best it can with the resources at its disposal. The amount of money which it would cost to pay the salaries or wages of those trained experienced individuals would not be very much, but they would contribute more than one hundred fold to the success of our Defence Forces if they were permitted to make their services available.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of matters which I might speak about but, like Deputy Traynor, I shall leave the most of these matters over until we have a proper consideration of the permanent Bill.  I do think it necessary to say that we have had three Governments in this country, the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government, the Fianna Fáil Government and the present Government, and none of these Governments has treated the ordinary soldier, the N.C.O. or officer as he ought to be treated.  The rate of pay given to our soldiers has been a scandalous one; the rates of marriage allowances have been scandalous; the rates of lodging, fuel and light allowances have been scandalous. On occasion, we pay great tribute to the wonderful men who manned our Defence Forces in time of danger.  We are very generous in our comp liments to them, but we are not so very generous in the way we are treating them. The soldier ought to be paid a reasonable wage, and it is because he is not being paid a reasonable wage that we have the position to-day that it is almost impossible to obtain recruits for our Defence Forces.  There has been talk about advertisements to persuade young boys to join the Defence Forces. Those advertisements are no use.  Every individual soldier is a standing advertisement for the Defence Forces.  If he is satisfied and happy, he will attract his friends to come into the Defence Forces.  If he is continually grousing, if he is continually broke, if he cannot stand his round in company, he is no advertisement for the Defence Forces. I think everyone will agree that whatever the future of this country and, indeed, of the world may be, it is time that we made provision for any eventuality that may come upon us.  It is necessary that there should be an <Col N="1941" /> increase in the Regular Army.  That increase can only be brought about by making Army service attractive.  I urge the Minister strongly to ensure that pay is increased and the present rates of pay are improved.  If he does that, he will get all the men he requires to man our Defence Forces without any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>Improved conditions of service are also important but I think we can leave that matter to the Minister.  It will only be necessary for us to bring complaints to his attention from time to time in order to have the situation remedied.  I hope that the recommendations I have made to the Minister will, in turn, recommend themselves to him and that we shall have as a result of his good offices a contented Army for the first time in the history of our country.  I have had long experience of the Army.  I have never known it to be either happy or contented.  I have known the finest of young men longing for the day when they could shake the dust of Army service for ever from their feet.  That is not as it should be.</P>
    <P>In times of crisis, in times of war and in times of emergency when there is the possibility of a fight soldiers will remain in the Defence Forces because of the element of excitement.  When the time of emergency, war and crisis passes, and they must return once more to the drab routine of barrack life these young men will not remain in the Defence Forces unless conditions are attractive and rates of pay are good.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the brave young man who is prepared to take up arms to defend his country and to lay down his life for it should not be treated as the cinderella of our national services, paid as a pauper might be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything that has been said by Deputy Captain Cowan.  Unless some improvement is made, a very small number of recruits will present themselves for national service in our Defence Forces.  I would appeal to the Minister to do away with the differentiation that was introduced some 12 or 18 months ago as between junior and senior officers in relation to <Col N="1942" /> rates of pay and subsistence allowances. The first and second lieutenants were completely overlooked.  All others received an increase.  Indeed, for the first time in the history of our Army a differentiation was made between senior and junior officers.  There may be some substantial reason for that.  I think the Minister used the analogy of the Civil Service for comparison purposes.  No real comparison exists. The Army is a drab vocation in peacetime. In wartime the soldiers are there prepared to risk their lives at any moment in the defence of their country.  I think it was Rudyard Kip ling who wrote about &ldquo;Tommy This&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tommy That&rdquo;.  We can say &ldquo;Paddy This&rdquo; and it is &ldquo;Mr. Paddy Murphy&rdquo; when the fighting is to be done but, when the fighting is over, the position is worse than it was before.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister, too, to make provision for married men. Surely we ought to be able to establish permanent military centres here such as our old enemy established when she was in occupation for her married soldiers.  In Fermoy married soldiers are living under the most primitive conditions.  I know that recently local authority houses are being made available to them, but that is a very recent innovation.  I think the Department of Defence should provide accommodation for its personnel. They should provide permanent married quarters.</P>
      <P>I trust the Minister will do something to rectify the position with regard to the first and second lieutenants and the differentiation that has been made.  They are the people who bear the brunt of the training and organisation and of the administration at times.  These officers should be put on the same basis as the senior officers.</P>

      <P>Some of the speeches that have been made since the Minister presented this Bill and Deputy Traynor spoke on it have widened the issue and one is left with a choice of either broadening this into a plenary debate or dealing with it as an item of business to be passed over with expedition, leaving the general debate to a later occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> I think in all the circumstances it is better for this Party to adhere to what Deputy Traynor said and I do not intend to elaborate on any of the points raised.  I will, however, offer a few remarks to the Minister.  He will, during the recess, have an opportunity of finding his sea legs in his new office.  There have been matters touched on which he could very well note and he can be sure he will hear more about them at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the debate on the Estimate will be general and unrestricted and there is no opportunity being lost in not going into details now.</P>
    <P>I would like to make these remarks about the Bill.  The way some Deputies have been talking, one would think the provision of a temporary Bill each year was, so to speak, due to inaction on the part of Governments in not presenting a permanent Bill, and that that went on for something like 28 years.  It might be no harm to reflect on this fact.  There is a very good constitutional tradition for a temporary Bill each year.  I think it arises in other Parliaments, but there is a sound idea for it.  The idea was that if you give the Executive an Army only for a year, it has to come back to you to account for it and, therefore, you have an assurance or an insurance that the matter must come up for discussion each year and that the Legislature has control over the armed forces of the State.  That was the basic constitutional idea behind it.</P>
    <P>But things have changed, in that the opportunity always comes up on the Estimate now.  It is necessary to vote the money, so the constitutional safeguard involved in having an annual Bill is not so important as it was once considered to be.  There is a case for a permanent Bill and I think we are at one on this, that a permanent Bill would be desirable.  It is desirable it should come forward as quickly as possible once it has been presented to the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to make this comment about the Bill, and Deputies should realise it, that the permanent Bill, beyond providing for the existence of the <Col N="1944" /> Defence Force, does nothing more thereafter than to provide for its administration in the sense of maintenance, discip line and so forth.  It in itself is not to be taken in any way as making provision for the implementation of a specific defence policy.  The passing of the permanent Bill will lubricate and make more efficient the administration of the Army and so will contribute to the efficiency of the Defence Forces.  But it will do no more than a temporary Bill to enable the Government to put a positive policy into force here or develop the Defence Forces as the times demand they should be so developed.</P>
    <P>What we have to do to-day is simply to pass a provision legalising the existence and the maintenance and the development of the Defence Forces for the coming year.  There is nothing more than that actually to be done on this occasion.  We will join issue with the Minister.  He can look forward, I think, to a fairly complete discussion on this matter when his Estimate comes up.</P>

      <P>On the question of pay, which Deputy Keane mentioned, perhaps I would help the Minister if I refer him to a series of questions asked on this matter by a number of Deputies extending over the past year.  There some information was given and later the Minister will be able to ascertain that his Department furnished me with some details and these, I think, could more profitably come up on the Estimate. There is no doubt there is a case now for the revision, or the examination at any rate, of the question of pay to the forces.  There is also the matter which we discussed last night, and I will take the opportunity to mention these B.A.O.s to the Minister.  Beyond that, I think that every Deputy will agree that it is a necessity to pass this Bill.  It must be passed by the end of this month.  There is no valid reason, however, for offering any opposition to it in principle and, as we are agreed that the debate will be unlimited on the Estimate, I think we could profitably give the Minister his Bill in all its stages now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In my capacity as a member of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee I have come in contact with a number of soldiers seeking housing accommodation and, in most cases, their wages do not permit them to pay the rents required.  I would put to the Minister, as I have put it many a time&mdash;and I was glad to hear one of my colleagues making reference to it&mdash;the desirability of the Government putting up a fund and creating a housing trust that will house not alone their soldiers but their ex-soldiers as well at a reasonable rent, a rent which they can pay out of the pensions which the Government will know they have.  It is unfortunate for some of these young men who are leaving the Army, married men with families.  These men leave at a rather early age.  They have to seek housing accommodation and they are not able to pay the rents demanded.  Then they come along to the local authority and that local authority has to try to find places at suitable rents for them.</P>
      <P>If the idea were considered sympathetically by the Defence Department it would be their duty to create a housing fund and build houses for their soldiers and ex-soldiers at rents which these men can pay from their pensions.  It would be a very commendable thing.  I am aware of the fact that the young married soldier especially is not able to meet his friends on equal terms no matter where he goes because of wages and conditions.  The wages you give a soldier to-day are not sufficient to put him on a par with his friends of the same age and enable him to indulge, if it is at all possible, in the little luxuries in which they can indulge.  I put it to the Minister that the Army men should be paid a higher standard of wages and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Deputies, I agree that the Bill is necessary.  I hope that, under the new Minister, the improvements suggested for the Army by Deputies on every side of the House will be carried into effect.  The young men who may like Army life and who look to Army life should be encouraged in every way and should not <Col N="1946" /> have a grouse because of the conditions. It is up to the Minister to make a contented Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to direct the Minister's mind to certain facets of this matter which I feel need urgent attention and I do so, in a way, in anticipation of what I may have to say subsequently on his Estimate.  I should like to put on record my appreciation of the fact that the Minister has gone back to Defence, if I may put it that way.  I feel that, with his understanding of the Army, there should be a better era in front of it.  I want to direct his attention to certain problems which I and former colleagues of mine, ex-officers, have found to be paramount at the moment. Deputy Byrne was concluding when I came into the House and was addressing the Minister on the question of pay in the Army, and I want to direct the Minister's attention to it, not from the social angle, but from the angle that we are undoubtedly facing at the very least semi-emergency conditions, with the prospect of a deterioration into worse conditions.  The Minister will have to face immediately the question of expanding the Army, of getting recruits for his Army, and he can only do that by an amelioration of conditions and by making conditions for reservists and for the F.C.A. infinitely more attractive.</P>
      <P>The Minister yesterday indicated that there was difficulty in keeping a rural force on its toes in times of peace. That difficulty can be overcome and the Minister must face the task of overcoming it immediately by making the work of the F.C.A. more varied and more interesting, and by making the conditions under which they meet and the amenities for their meeting infinitely better than they are.  The Minister will have to face the problem, and very quickly, of trying to reinterest the vast section of trained personnel throughout the length and breadth of this country in the Reserve of the Army, and I do not think he can do that unless he comes to grips very quickly with the stern problem of trying to wrest a little more out of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> I think it is the experience of any of us who had the honour to serve in Óglaigh na hÉireann that there is a wealth of goodwill and effort there which merits infinitely more consideration and infinitely more remuneration than we have been able to give it.  It is a highly specialised training, and, while I do not want to go into detail on issues of pay and so on&mdash;there will be a later occasion for that&mdash;I should like the Minister to appreciate that the wealth of goodwill that awaits him in the Army can be stimulated by an earnest effort on his part, in his initial stage as Minister, to put right some of the old grievances and to grapple with Finance, whose latest scheme, under the recent Army pay increases, has been to give with one hand and to grab back with the other.  There are matters in the Army that are causing grave disquiet.  It was brought to my notice recently that where an unfortunate officer, by his effort, merits promotion, the rent of the apartment given him by the Army&mdash;not moving out of the house he is in, but merely if he happens to rise from captain to commandant&mdash;goes up by £40 a year.  These circumstances are Gilbertian and they are appalling, when one realises that the efforts of a man earning promotion for himself on his merits, without changing his abode at all, can mean an increase of £40 a year in rent.</P>
    <P>I want to say in a very earnest way &mdash;we will have a very full and frank discussion on the whole issue of defence on the Estimate&mdash;that these are immediate problems.  There is this unrest there and I and Deputy de Valera on the other side, feeling, in a non-political way, that the Army is something of which it is worth while keeping the goodwill, an Army that has stood loyally by all Governments and an Army which lives in that tradition to-day, feel that it is time for the Minister to come to grips with the main issues causing this disquiet.  If the Minister does so, I am absolutely confident, and I am quite sure that any ex-officer in this House has the same confidence, that the goodwill which expanded the Army into the huge emergency force during the emergency <Col N="1948" /> is still there to give the Minister all the encouragement he wants if the day should come when he will call on it again.</P>

      <P>Not an exhaustive notice, but the headings under which the offensive will be taken.  For that reason, I am very grateful to Deputies for the manner in which they put them forward.  Deputy Cowan raised a point about the undertaking of my predecessor to bring in the permanent measure.  He went a good way, because the Bill has been produced and circulated, which, in itself, was a very great task.  An opportunity for the Second Reading of that Bill can be provided, I am sure, long before the time suggested by Deputy Cowan, but I do not say that it will be passed, because it is a very large Bill with a great number of sections, and, as it is a Bill which must be kept in the Committee of the House, it will require a good deal of attention.  Having some experience of the Army Acts in the past, I know that certain sections were given twists which they were never meant to have when originally passed by the House, and I would like to see this Bill examined in very great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of policy has been mentioned, and I do not think it is necessary for me to refer to it in any great detail.  The Government has declared its policy in relation to the international situation.  The question has been asked whether, if it was neutrality, we were in a position to defend it.  I think so.  I am perfectly satisfied that this country would be able to put up a very decent show and would be able to hold its own for a period longer <Col N="1949" /> than even the strongest of them might expect.  We have proved that in the past.  There is one point in respect of which I am in agreement with some of the speeches made, that is, the retirement of Army men too early.  While I might not be able to run as fast as I was 20 or 30 years ago, I might fight the better by having to stand and I would know how to do it, and there is a lot to be said for retaining the services of those who are in a position to serve.  I can assure the House that it is a matter to which I will give serious consideration, in consultation with my staff.</P>
    <P>On this question of defence, it has been found in recent years that, even where the main army has been broken up, the column or underground movement, which was practically established for good here as a method of war, is a very effective weapon in the defence of a country against aggression from outside, or even when occupied. Therefore, I think we should leave that matter to a further date, and I hope that, either on the Estimate or at some other early opportune time, I will address myself to that problem and say what I do think of defence, in so far as it is in the interests of the State to give it.  I will be as communicative as I can be to the House upon every matter relating to the whole defence system.  The House is entitled to that. Perhaps, if necessary, there are other steps we could take to let the House know what the conditions are.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious about the question of reserves.  There is a very large number of trained personnel in the country, not only of our own forces from the last emergency, but citizens of our own who have served in other forces.  In the interests of the State, these persons should be made use of and brought in to defend this country, if necessary.  Of course, there may be arguments against that line but, at the same time, I would be quite prepared to serve with them and have them in the Defence Forces.  I would certainly like to have them if I were commanding in the field.  I think I could make very good use of them.  The question of reserves is one to which I will pay very much attention in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1950" /> On the question of pay, of course, there has always been a problem.  In peacetime, military personnel never got what they were entitled to.  They got it when they were fighting, all right, and all sorts of inducements were given while the war was on.  Then, when it was over, as everybody knows, they were not so well thought about. That was really something that the soldier had to suffer.  Because he did serve in the Army, it was nearly a bar against him.  In so far as that can be rectified, in this country, as far as I am concerned, I will try to get over it. The question, of course, is conditioned by the amount in the kitty.  The question of finance is involved in any country but in this country in particular it is a very serious matter that cannot be lightly dealt with.  Whatever force we have, it should be the most contented and loyal force possible.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing, I do not want Deputies to mix up the situation as it is now with the situation in the days of the British occupation. Remember, the barracks that they built in Fermoy or elsewhere were garrisons which they had for the purpose of calling on them to assist the semi-military police force, called a police force, when required, to keep us in the position that, according to them, we ought to have been kept in.  If we are building up a Defence Force here at the moment, it will not be in the interests of the State at all to pin them down too tightly to the garrison situation because it would not take an atom bomb, or anything like that, to eliminate that garrison very quickly.  I am in favour, in so far as it can be done, of dispersing armed forces through the civil population.  In that connection, I am also very much in favour of the F.C.A. line of defence as being a very important one.  The possibility of an emergency is all the more reason why we should not at this stage start building something that might be knocked down quicker than we put it up.</P>
    <P>There is the question of retiring ages.  There may be a year or two wrong in this list which has been handed to me as being approximately correct.  They are extraordinary <Col N="1951" /> captain, 51; commandant, 54; lieutenant-colonel, 57; colonel, 60; major-general, 63.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Subsistence allowances and many other things like that have been mentioned but I do not think I should go into them at the moment.  On the Estimate, which I will try to get as early as possible, I will deal with them.  I will take Deputy de Valera's advice to try to get my sea-legs under me.  I do not know if he means that I ought to see the Navy as well as the Army.  I will try to be in a position to give the Deputies, as I have promised, all the information to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I might say that, for years, this question of a permanent Army Act was raised by the Opposition when they were in opposition before and it is raised by them now, but when they became a Government they were not able to produce it.  There is a great constitutional safeguard in having an annual Act to establish the forces of the State, because when you have the permanent Army Act, although there is the safeguard of having to vote the money, if the members of the Defence Force are legally in existence and if Parliament decided not to pay them, there is the danger that they might try to take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this section was under discussion on the last occasion we had a different Minister in charge of it.  It is rather strange to relate that that position was, in fact, anticipated by Deputy Connolly, because in one of his arguments he did make the point that a different situation would arise if, at a later stage, there was a different Minister in charge of the Bill.  I am happy to think, however, that there will be no great change so far as the explanation that we had of this section is concerned which was given by the former Minister.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is the vital section of this Bill so far as court officers are concerned. Manifestly, on the face of the section there are shortcomings and defects in it, but it is difficult to criticise those defects in the light of the assurance which was given by the then Minister on the Second Reading. We have, to a very large extent, to take this Bill, which is almost unique in its terms, on trust.  A number of amendments which were put down were ruled out for reasons well known to Deputies.  I would like to impress on the Minister that those amendments were a very fair reflection of the desire of the House to have the Bill improved along the lines therein indicated.  It is felt that such improvements would bring satisfaction to the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is some time now since the Bill was under discussion in the House, and for that reason it may be no harm if I run over briefly some of the points already made.  Perhaps I may be allowed to refer to the defects in the Bill as they have been indicated by the representatives of the association concerned.  First of all, they say that there is no indication of what will be the basis of qualification so far as a certificate is concerned; secondly, that there is no indication of what may happen to a part time officer who will not come within the question of certification. There is a far more serious complaint, due to something which happened in this House in 1926, and that is the position of officers who are now retired without either pension or gratuity.  The fact that they are in <Col N="1954" /> that position is due to a defect in the Act that was passed in that year.  That Act only catered for those who were then in whole-time employment.  There was no consideration or provision either made for those who might qualify for whole-time employment after the passing of the 1926 Act.</P>
    <P>The result of all that is that a number of people have gone out without any provision whatever, either in the way of pension or gratuity.  There is a natural anxiety on the part of those people as to what provision may be made for them under the terms of this Bill.  There is another aspect of that which deserves to be mentioned, and it is that some of those people have passed away, leaving dependents behind them.  No provision whatever has been made for those dependents. Neither is there any provision for the dependents of those officers who have died since the Bill was promised in 1947.  A strong plea was made in all parts of the House that people in that position should be considered.</P>
    <P>There is another point which was referred to in one of the amendments, and it is that service given in what may be described as the formative years of the courts, that is to say between 1922 and 1927, is not reckonable for pension purposes.  Even that has been extended to the small number of persons who were eventually taken from the District Courts to other sections of the Civil Service.  They have been denied credit for the service given during those particular years.</P>
    <P>I put it to the present Minister that there is an extraordinary measure of goodwill in this House towards this Bill.  That has been the attitude towards this particular matter during all the years that I have been a member of the House.  There is only a very small number of men affected. That number will become smaller as the years pass.  Due to the excellent service which those men rendered to the State, the general feeling is that no great strain would be imposed on the resources of the State if, at this point, they were treated in a generous way.  I, like other members of the House, have been in touch with the people who can speak for these particular <Col N="1955" /> officers.  I know it is their desire that there should be placed on the records deep appreciation of the personal interest taken in this particular subject not only by the former Minister but by his predecessor.  The present Minister will have the gratification, I trust, of rounding off the position which has baffled all those who have preceded him in his office.  I repeat that it will only take a small amount of money to round off the position in a satisfactory way.  I would appeal, therefore, to the Minister's sense of consideration and fair play.  I suggest that from a financial point of view the matter should be treated generously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to speak at length on the section.  In view of the fact that we have a new Minister, I should like again to state the case for the Circuit Court clerks who were omitted from this Bill for reasons which I could not understand. I hope the Minister will not lose sight of what I said when speaking on a previous occasion.  He will find all that I had to say on the records.  We have a new Minister, and I am not going to go over all I said previously.  I am puzzled as to why those officers were left out, and especially with regard to the retrospective portion of the Bill. They are apparently being left out altogether.  I hope the Minister will look into all that, and so not store up any trouble for himself.  Even if he settles with the District Court clerks, he should settle with the others, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I use this occasion to congratulate the Minister on his appointment?  We all trust that he will do honour to the position.  His predecessor favourably impressed the House, particularly in connection with this little Bill.  I wish to support the points that have been put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Boland. The House, if I may say so, spoke to the Minister's predecessor in a manner which might be considered unanimous. The reaction of the Minister put the House at its ease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I was the only one who was a bit dubious of this legislation, but, like the other Deputies, I could not <Col N="1956" /> fail to be charmed by the personality of the previous Minister.  I accepted his assurance in regard to several matters which are included, particularly in this Section 3.  I am sure that the present Minister would reiterate what his predecessor said.  I feel that we may be pushing at an open door in reference to this matter, but it would give us some deeper satisfaction if the Minister did underwrite what his predecessor stated.</P>
    <P>The amendments which were ruled out of order because they would impose a charge on public funds should have some consideration from the Minister. There are not many persons affected by the intended rectifications of the Bill and the Minister might do well to consider enlarging the scope of Section 3 so as to bring under it those who did service to the country in the past in this particular sphere of activity, particularly those who, in the very early days, gave service in the setting up of these District Courts under the Provisional Government and those who took over the duties of petty sessions clerks.  Some of those, unfortunately, have fallen by the wayside; some of them have not received recompense or recognition for their services, and it would be a very generous measure of justice on the part of the Minister to embrace within the provisions of this section those who have rendered that service in the past.  There are others who, through the changes of time, have departed from the service.</P>
    <P>I made a plea to the former Minister, and I repeat to the new occupant of the office, that the few cases which are outstanding of these early occupants of the office of assistant District Court clerk should receive certificates now, no matter what different occupation or State service they are in, so that they may use those certificates to increase their pensionable years of office in the Government service in other Departments.  These are matters to which we have addressed ourselves.  There are other small matters to which other Deputies addressed themselves.  I feel sure that the Minister will take into consideration the unanimous wish of the House that, rather than having unending <Col N="1957" /> Bills in future dealing with small points in reference to the welfare of these officers of the courts, the opportunity should be availed of by him on the future stages of the Bill to enlarge the scope as much as possible and bring in those who were thought by the House to be worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will probably facilitate the Minister if I repeat what I have already stated in support of the case put forward by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and other Deputies. I feel this opportunity ought to be availed of to clear the air with regard to these court officers who are outside the scope of this amending Bill. Undoubtedly, the introduction of the Bill in itself is a good thing.  It is intended to remove a number of grievances but, unfortunately, it does not go far enough.  I understand there may be some difficulty as to how far we can get with this Bill now.  I understand that it is the desire of the Minister that the Bill should be passed into law as soon as possible.  I also understand that it was the intention of the Minister to consider the suggestions put forward in a unanimous way by Deputies representing all sides of the House; that he was to consider those representations and, on the Report Stage, introduce such amendments as he could to remove those other grounds of grievance which would still be left in the legislation as it stands at the moment and would be left if the Bill were passed in its present form.  I simply rise to support what has been said by previous Deputies and to show the Minister that in this matter there is no Party issue involved, that it is the general desire of Deputies on all sides of the House that this vexed and thorny question should be settled once and for all now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read very carefully in the Official Reports the various speeches made on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage so far as it has progressed up to now.  It is quite obvious from the speeches made and the approach generally to the Bill that, as Deputy Cowan said, it was discussed from an entirely non-Party <Col N="1958" /> point of view.  Not only have I read the speeches made, but I have discussed the Bill and the representations which were made to him with the former Minister, Deputy MacEoin, and I am entirely in accord with his line on this matter.  I have been trying in the last few days, and will continue to try between this and the next stage, to get the largest measure of advancement in the direction which we have been asked to go by Deputies from all sides of the House that we can get. In so far as I have to refuse to meet some of the suggestions put forward, I should like to say that it is not due to giving the amount of money involved. It is certainly not due in any great measure to the question of money, but there are other problems and difficulties to be faced.  There is also the question of creating&mdash;I hope I will not be misunderstood when I use the phrase&mdash;dangerous precedents, of creating difficulties.  I am hopeful that I shall be able to get agreement and be able to tell the House on the next stage that we have gone further even than the former Minister promised towards meeting some of the suggestions put forward.</P>
      <P>For instance, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan raised a question about the period between 1923 and 1927.  Perhaps I am going further than I should, but I hope that I may be able to get that period from 1923 to 1927 bridged.  If I do it will apply also to those who were established under the 1926 Act as well as to those who are covered by the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question raised by Deputy G. Boland about Circuit Court clerks and officers, we cannot bring them within the scope of this measure.  The position is quite different there.  But arrangements are being made to provide machinery which will enable those officers to secure establishment.  The Deputy knows that the question of unestablished officers in the Civil Service is a very big one.  There are numbers of unestablished civil servants in every Department of State.  The question of unestablished service counting for pension purposes is, likewise, a very big question and would have to be dealt with in <Col N="1959" /> some other way rather than under a measure like this.  We have been able to get agreement, however, under which machinery will be set up almost immediately to give Circuit Court officers an opportunity in a comparatively simple way of securing establishment.  I do not know whether it is necessary for me to say any more on this.  My predecessor covered the ground very fully.  I subscribe entirely to what he said on that matter and I shall endeavour to get, if possible, even more than he hoped to achieve to make the Bill a better one than it was when it was first introduced.</P>

After all, 70 ought to be old enough.  I do not know why the Government should do this unless they have some reason of which we are not aware.

      <P>I think the real reason for this amendment should be known to Deputy Boland.  There are two people holding this particular type of office.  They are in the position that they are non-pensionable and under present legislation at least one of these officers could be continued until he actually dies in harness.  I think this is something that cannot happen again and in the circumstances, since he is <Col N="1960" /> not a pensionable officer and since this cannot occur again, I would appeal to Deputy Boland to allow the section to stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor seemed to think that he was making a good case because there is another official still remaining appointed under one of the old British statutes.  The answer to that is that this Bill, under which this gentleman is required to retire at 70, was only passed in 1945.  After all, these anomalies are gradually disappearing.  Most of them are gone now and one cannot make a case for extending this to people who have been established so recently as 1945.  I do not think there is anything in that argument.  It is certainly unconvincing.  I shall not press the matter.  If the Minister does not agree, well and good.</P>

      <P>I have very little to add to what I said last night except to <Col N="1961" /> deal with one statement made by the Minister.  At column 1649, Volume 124, of the Official Reports, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Open confession is good for the soul.  I never realised that our people were capable of absorbing as much as they did.  They got more butter from native production in 1950 than ever was eaten in Ireland since Brian Boru was killed at Clontarf, and frankly that took me by surprise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Frankly, that surprised me.  Knowing the wild statements made by the Minister, we decided to check up on that and yesterday the Taoiseach was asked the following question: If he will state the total production of creamery and farmers' butter for each year since 1933?  In reply, he gave the following particulars: In 1937 there were, 1,227,000 cwt. produced.  I will not say that they were eaten at home, because I understand butter was exported in that period.  In 1940-41 there were 1,177,000 cwt. produced; that is, 639,000 cwt. of creamery butter and 438,000 cwt. of farmers' butter. In 1945 there were 606,000 cwt. of creamery butter and 471,000 cwt. of farmers' butter; that was 1,077,000 cwt. altogether and every blooming lb. of that was consumed here at home.  Not a lb. of it left the country.</P>
      <P>For the year 1950 the space for farmers' butter is marked &ldquo;not available&rdquo;. In 1949, 1,084,000 cwt. of butter were produced in this country; that is, 688,000 cwt. of creamery butter and 396,000 cwt. of farmers' butter. That was only 7,000 cwt. more than was produced and eaten in this country in 1945.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Donnellan has brought in the Leader of the Farmers' Party, Deputy Halliden.  I am sure he will be most interested in these figures.  On the basis of what I have stated, there was no justification for the export of 37,000 cwt. of butter.  The total <Col N="1962" /> quantity produced in 1945, between creamery and farmers' butter, was 1,077,000 cwt. and the total quantity produced in 1949 was 1,084,000 cwt., just 7,000 cwt. more.  Whether the Minister expected that the people had become so impoverished under his Government that they were going to consume 37,000 cwt. of butter less, I do not know.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out last night, it was in the carrying out of an enormous bluff, a most contemptible bluff, that he endeavoured to force down the price of milk by 2d. a gallon.  I had not the advantage last night of those figures. This question was asked only yesterday and it was answered by the Taoiseach. It was impertinence on the part of the Minister to stand up here in his usual flamboyant way and tell us there was never so much butter consumed since the days of Brian Boru.  Then he was responsible for bringing in here what to us looks very like butter that was taken out of Brian Boru's tent in 1088.</P>

      <P>To approach it you would need a gas mask, something like the Minister told us about some years ago with regard to Irish butter.  Those figures I have given disclose some very significant facts.  There has been a reduction in the production of farmers' butter in the years between 1944-45 and 1949.  In 1945 we produced 471,000 cwt. of farmers' butter and in 1949, the latest year for which we have figures available, we produced 396,000 cwt. of farmers' butter.  That shows a reduction of 75,000 cwt.  In future when we are taking into consideration the supposed increase in creamery butter we have also to consider the very definite reduction, year by year, in the production of farmers' butter.</P>

The Minister does not know what quantity of farmers' butter was produced in 1950.  If he did, surely he would have given the information to the Taoiseach.  Have the Department gone back to that incompetent pitch, since it left the good hands of Deputy Patrick Smith, that they do not know yet, in March, 1951, the quantity of farmers' butter produced last year?</P>

      <P>Is it that the Minister has the figures and dare not make them known even to the Taoiseach or this House?  This flamboyant Minister comes in here and tells us that there was never more butter consumed since Brian Boru was killed at the battle of Clontarf, in an effort to gull not alone Deputies but the farmers, who, he knows, are nothing better than slaves on the completely uneconomic price he is allowing them at present for milk.</P>

      <P>If proof of that were wanted, we have it in the figures for 1938-39, the last normal year, as compared with the complete figures for 1949, which show that there is a reduction of over 100,000 cwts. of butter produced, in spite of the fact that we have more cows than we had since Brian Boru.  I do not know what they are milking.  We are faced with this kind of camouflage and bluff, a rather contemptible bluff, on the part of a Minister who endeavoured to beat down, with that kind of raméis, the unfortunate farmers, instead of giving them the increase he was bound to give them for their increased costs of production since the price of milk was last fixed <Col N="1964" /> by Deputy Smith in 1946.  The price as fixed then was 1/2 per gallon at the creamery for the summer months. Deputy Halliden and other Deputies of the Farmers' Party, who were then on this side, complained bitterly that the price was uneconomic and they had a motion down before we left office demanding an increase in the price. Deputy Halliden will find it still stuck in one of the pigeon holes.  If the price was not good enough in 1947 and if there has been an increase in the cost of production, as Deputy Halliden knows there has been, of over 30 per cent. since then, where is the justification for his sitting behind that Minister, representing the farmers of North Cork and holding him up and helping him out in scourging the farmers whom he pretends to represent here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made that statement, because it brought me back a little and enabled me to find out where this Danish butter came from.  The Minister is now engaged on a new scheme.  He says he is not going to have Jerseys, Guernseys or any of these Pekinese breeds, as he called them some time ago.  Now he is shifting the Kerry cows up to Donegal and I suppose he will inseminate them above with a Jersey bull.  &ldquo;Anybody familiar with the congested areas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will remember the perennial difficulty of providing West Donegal&rdquo;&mdash;he is shifting them very near the Border&mdash;&ldquo;and parts of Connemara with the type of <Col N="1965" /> cow which could give a decent yield of milk under the very rigorous conditions that obtain there.&rdquo;  He went on to say that he had in Kerry a breed of cattle unique in the whole world.  These quotations are to be found at 1633 of the Official Reports of 8th March last.  He said that when he learned that certain sophisticated farmers in the country were bringing in Jersey, Guernsey and Ayrshire cows, he apprehended that they would start bringing in Abyssinian cows.  I suppose that was to pay for the muck barley he brought in last year.  He said that he hoped to embark the first contingent for Aranmore, if it had not already gone there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Halliden will remember the pressure that used to be brought by certain portions of West Cork and the greater portion of County Kerry for permission to keep other bulls than Kerry bulls and other cattle than Kerry cattle, which were prohibited by the Department of Agriculture at the time, but now we are spreading them out and they are to go travelling.  We have done more than that, because we have gone off for the alternative market, and &mdash;you would never believe it&mdash;the Minister tells us that he is going to breed Kerry cattle for shipment&mdash;of all the places on God's earth&mdash;to Palestine. That is the latest, and, in addition, there is no Irishman fit to breed these Kerry cattle.  It would never do for anybody down in Kerry to start breeding these cattle and getting in touch with Deputy Bob Briscoe and sending them out to Palestine.  &ldquo;I am very glad to inform the House,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that one of the most distinguished breeders in Scotland hopes to establish a modest farm in the south-west of Ireland whereon to assemble consignments of Kerry cattle for shipment to Palestine where a profitable market exists for them for precisely the same reason as they are proving a success in West Mayo and West Donegal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Agriculture, when he was a wild bad colonial boy sitting over here, telling us of the exploits of a case of poultry which went to one of these fly-by-night markets that the Fianna Fáil Government were looking for on the Continent, instead <Col N="1966" /> of looking for the glorious market that Mother England was providing.  Lo and behold, that Minister now has not alone gone to the Continent but, as he told me in this House recently, every ambassador of his throughout Europe is marching along from door to door with a basket of eggs in his hand, and is hammering at the doors trying to sell the eggs.</P>

      <P>The portion of the Minister's remarks in introducing this Estimate, to which I wish to refer&mdash;I hope in a constructive manner&mdash; has to do with the question of hides and pelts, to which the Minister makes an opening reference at column 1638.  He gives figures to show a remarkable expansion in the number of animals slaughtered for the dead-meat trade under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts and, while he is pleased with this remarkable expansion, he laments that it has the unsatisfactory feature in it that the hides and pelts of these animals are retained for processing in our own country.  I do not quite follow that that is an unsatisfactory feature in itself.  The Minister, I am sure, must intend to say there that it is unsatisfactory in reference to the conditions which he mentions later on. That is, that the slaughter of cattle is materially conditioned by the price realised for the hides, and, only for the peculiar feature of this matter, he believes that we could greatly increase the number of beasts slaughtered for this purpose and, therefore, we could considerably improve or increase the exports of this industry.  He states that &ldquo;a sum of £5 per hide deducted from the price of the cattle because they are being slaughtered in Ireland and the meat exported has resulted in great difficulty in my expanding the dead-meat trade which would bring grist to our mill in Ireland.&rdquo;  I am afraid it is very hard to understand that sentence.  Perhaps the Minister would explain what he intended to convey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, if you put a comma after the word &ldquo;exported&rdquo; the meaning is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1970" />
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister goes on to show that that is the result of manipulation by a certain ring.  If the matter could be remedied without disturbing the market and the tanneries, and giving a boost to the price of leather, which would adversely affect the price of shoes, he could materially expand this dead-meat trade.  But, unfortunately, the Minister has been unable to find a way out.  He says that if he could find a way out he could double, treble or quadruple the number of cattle slaughtered in this country for the dead-meat trade, and that a remunerative market, which waits on this expansion, is in America, Canada, Great Britain and on the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he would be very grateful to any Deputy, on either side of the House, who could resolve that dilemma without, of course, increasing the price of every pair of boots by 5/- and without closing down the tanning factories.  Well, it is a challenge, I suppose, to most Deputies to try to assist the Minister.  I was wondering whether a method of approach to this problem did not occur to him.  If, as he states, the resolving of that difficulty will enable the dead-meat trade, and those in charge of it, to increase their exports by four times surely some impost could be borne by the dead-meat trade to its own advantage. It would appear to me that, without penalising the farmers but by enabling the increase to be given to the farmers, in fact, without having them to subsidise the tanning industry&mdash;the boot and shoe industry enjoys high protection to the extent of £1,000,000, according to the Minister&mdash;the dead-meat trade might be persuaded to bear some of the cost of this subsidy without influencing the price of boots and shoes.  It should be possible that some charge could be put on the exports of the dead-meat trade.  There should be some way of taxing them by regulation or otherwise so that they could bear some of the difference between the present price of the hide and the world price.  According to the Minister, the world price is about 2/10 per lb., while this Hide Improvement Society is paying the farmers the <Col N="1971" /> princely sum of 10d. per lb. for the hides of beasts slaughtered in this country.</P>
    <P>There is evidently great difficulty, according to the Minister, in changing the set-up, though he stated a stroke of the pen could alter it.  Evidently, he has no desire to use the pen in this manner.  Therefore, he should address himself to other means to regulate this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurs to me that if the Minister and his experts put their minds to this in a more detailed manner than it is possible for me to do, and if by so doing the situation could be remedied, the exports would go up according to the Minister's contention. The people who would benefit thereby would be those who are at present profiting from the dead-meat trade.  Surely, there have been, in other countries, methods by which one industry will facilitate the export trade of a section of that industry or of an ancillary industry in much the same way as that was started in Germany in regard to the export of sugar. Surely, it would be possible for the people now drawing profits from the dead-meat trade in this country to pay, according to the quantity of their products which they exported, some amount which would ease the difference between the 2/10 per lb. and the 10d. per lb.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I find it impossible to get figures.  There was a question addressed to the Taoiseach to-day in relation to the number of hides received by the tanneries.  No information was available regarding the number of hides and pelts received <Col N="1972" /> by the tanneries.  Figures were given with regard to the number of cattle and calves slaughtered in Ireland in the third and fourth quarter of the year, but even here it appears that the information is very difficult to come by.  But, if there are cattle available, if they could be slaughtered, and if the export could be quadrupled, it would appear to me that in quadrup ling it they would not only make the same profit per unit as at present, but they would considerably increase the profit on the increased turn-over.  It appears to me to be a very peculiar situation in which the increase which is desired evidently by the Minister would lead to an increase in the losses to the industry concerned.  The Minister could hardly, if I read him correctly, contend or desire that the business should quadruple its losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the mystery is even deeper than I considered it when listening to the Minister in his opening remarks.  It appears to me that there should be some possibility&mdash;I leave it to the Minister to examine that&mdash;of regulating the export of the dead-meat trade in such a profitable market as exists, a remunerative market according to the Minister, not a market in which a loss is made, but a market which is remunerative, and, therefore, I can only assume, remunerative to those who are handling this trade&mdash;that they are making a profit and not a loss.  If they are making a profit, some portion of that profit, it appears to me, could easily be diverted by regulation or legislation or otherwise in such a way that the farmers would receive more than they receive at present at the rate of 10d. per lb. for their hides and yet, at the same time, the price of shoes would not be adversely affected, would not rise by 5/- a pair.  However, I shall leave it at that and the Minister may probably get some little thought on it.</P>

      <P>The people of Dublin find that there are cases where some members of a family prefer Danish butter to the Irish and, again, where some prefer the Irish to the Danish. If Deputy de Valera wants to tell us that every person in Dublin has the same taste in butter, surely he is trying to butter the House.  I am quite certain that the Minister could provide a very sufficient answer to this.  Even if it were shown that the butter is not 100 per cent. as nutritious as the Irish, yet the margin by which it falls short would be very little.  It is an accepted fact that in Glasgow, a city with which I had acquaintance and with which I have very many connections, Danish butter is always preferred to Irish; when Danish butter is available, the Irish butter does not get a ready sale. Deputy de Valera, if he investigates the matter, will find that to be perfectly correct, even amongst the members of the Irish section of the <Col N="1974" /> community there, patriotic and all as they may be, and they are generally more patriotic when away from home than we are here.  But the case made against the butter is very flimsy, and I wish the Minister would give the House some actual scientific solution of this problem.</P>

      <P>There is one matter related to one sub-head of this Estimate which I would like to mention to the Minister.  My information is that the Minister, apparently through the Flour Millers' Association, caused the distribution allowance of wholesalers to be discontinued very recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that some days ago the Minister gave instructions to this effect and that the effect is to withdraw from those wholesalers the distribution margin or allowance that was customary heretofore.  I understand that there are some 200 firms involved in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Yes&mdash;that they perform a useful established service in the distribution of these milling offals &mdash;bran and pollard, I think, were mentioned&mdash;and that the effect of this step of the Minister's will be very prejudicial to this element in the distribution machinery.  I understand that this step in cutting out their margin and, as I understand it, charging the same price as would be charged direct to the customer, will have a very prejudicial effect on their employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Here are the factors I want to put to the Minister.  No matter what may be the ideal in any particular set of circumstances, no <Col N="1975" /> matter what a person in the Minister's position or any Government wants to do, one must necessarily take into account what the <i>de facto</i> situation is.</P>
      <P>In fact you have that particular element in the business organisation concerned.  If my information is correct, I think there are very legitimate grounds for complaint in relation to the Minister's approach to this matter. That approach seems to have been made without any regard to the interests of the people concerned.  I do not want to get into the very involved matter of distribution.  I simply put the case for these people, who are entitled to fair treatment.  They are performing a useful service under the existing order of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is.  These people would not have had customers had they not been performing a useful service to the community. I think it is safe to say there was nothing abnormal in their case.  They secured their position in the normal development of business.  They did not enter into that business without there being some merit in it and without their performing a useful service to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless it is a fact.  The Minister takes this step without any reference to the people concerned and the inevitable result will be to prejudice that section of the community represented by these people and their employees.  I fear this is just another precipitate decision on the part of the Minister where the Minister, I assert regretfully, acted without reference to the situation as a whole and to all the facts.</P>

      <P>The Minister brings me to the flour milling report. It would be all right to base oneself on <Col N="1976" /> that report had the Minister either accepted it or rejected it <i>in toto.</i>  The fact is that parts of the report have been accepted by the Government and parts have been rejected.  It is hardly fair to blame the authors of the report for the consequences when one accepts some bits of it and rejects others.</P>

      <P>One can hardly maintain then that one is acting on the report.  However, that is beside the point.  This matter has been brought to my attention.  I understand it happened only a few days ago.  I think the method by which it was done is <i>per se</i> objectionable.  Hypothetically, I can see a number of approaches to the problem but I admit quite frankly I have not had an opportunity of studying them in more detail.  I recommend the matter to the Minister for his reconsideration, taking everything into account and, in particular, allowing, if necessary, for transition phases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry referred to hides.  Apparently Deputy Corry does not understand the position. There is a fixed price for our live stock and for our dead meat.  There is a difference in price for our hides and it pays one better at the moment to take the live weight.  There is something wrong in the hide business.  I cannot understand the situation.  The week before last, in Manchester hides were making 4/0½ per lb.  Last week I was perturbed at the number of lorries down my part of the country on their way to the North of Ireland with hides. I understand that one can actually afford to lose one's lorry, costing £850, and the hides, and still make £1,600 profit.  There is a ring in existence.  I was in Cork on one occasion and a butcher told me he could not dispose of a quantity of hides.  I rang up Carrick-on-Suir and I was told that they could not accept hides from me because I was not an agent.  The agent at the moment is netting 1/11 per lb. for himself and the butcher is getting only 10d.  That is where the trouble is. The people who kill the animals should sell the hides themselves and do away with the man-in-between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> I do not see why the boot and shoe industry should receive so much protection. I see by the Press that Irish tanneries are a good investment. When the people become sufficiently awake to the situation there will be no hides for the tanneries unless the rings are done away with.  It pays better to sell a beast live weight because the price for hides at the moment is unremunerative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this Estimate was referred back by almost 50 per cent. of the elected representatives of the people proves that there are some unusual features in it, and that it needs more than ordinary attention from the House.  It is not often that a Supplementary Estimate is referred back at the close of the financial year. The Minister, in introducing this, thought fit to introduce many things besides just the present needs of his Department.  He raised the matter of hides, the price paid for them, and the loss sustained by the farmers.  He set himself out to persuade the farmers that they are losing £5 per beast on every beast slaughtered.  The Minister knows that is not an established fact.  He knows quite well that there is an open market here for all our cattle so far as Great Britain is concerned. If a hide is worth 90 per cent. more in England the English buyer here calculates the value of that hide when competing against the Irish buyers in our markets.  Is not that a fact?  Is it not a fact also that we export more than two-thirds of our total production of cattle?</P>
      <P>The Irish farmer receives, in respect of every beast, whether killed here or exported, the world market price for the hide plus the meat.  There is no question about that.  Deputy Fagan knows quite well that the English buyer is aware, when he comes to the Dublin market on Wednesday morning, of the price of the beast's hide and he gives the value of the beast in England, the meat plus the hide.  The Irish butcher must pay that price against him, otherwise he will not get cattle.  Let that bubble be burst, once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know anything about the middleman of whom Deputy Fagan <Col N="1978" /> talks, the man who handles the hides. The Minister called those people crooks here.  He said they formed a ring and they were crooks.  As usual, everybody engaged in industry of any type is called a crook by the Minister.  For the Minister to call any group crooks is, I am sure, just the same as to call them gentlemen.  I hope the Minister will not continue trying to fool the farmers that they are subsidising the tanneries to the extent of £5 for every hide.  They have no such subsidy and no one knows that better, or should know it better, than the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an open market for our cattle and the price is paid for the meat plus the hide.  Deputy de Valera mentioned just now that the Minister proposed to do away with wholesalers of offals and that he will take whatever livelihood they have from some 200 wholesalers of offals here without due notice.  He intends to wipe them out with one stroke of the pen.  Why not wipe out the middlemen Deputy Fagan refers to, also with a stroke of the pen?  The Minister for Agriculture has killed many agricultural industries during the past three years.  At one time he talked about the bacon producers and the manure manufacturers as crooks.  He referred to the cereal people and the people who produce root seeds as crooks.  He said the people who produced pedigree wheat seed were crooks.  Everybody who had anything to do with agriculture was a crook, according to the Minister. I hope we will not hear anything more about the £5 subsidy for the leather merchants or the boot and shoe manufacturers.  They are not receiving any such subsidy from the Irish farmers.  The ten cwt. beast is worth the same price at Birkenhead as in Dublin, plus the carriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in the Supplementary Estimate to pay more by way of subsidy on butter.  I have on numerous occasions raised the question of farmers' butter with the Minister. Yesterday the Taoiseach referred to the production of butter here.  I am sure the Minister is not unaware of the <Col N="1979" /> production of creamery and farmers' butter all down the years.  He must have noticed that the production of farmers' butter has fallen very considerably in the past two or three years. He talked <i>ad lib</i> about the increase in the output of creamery butter.  In 1950 it was little greater than in 1937.</P>

      <P>He is asking for £479,000 extra in the present financial year&mdash; that amount is being sought as a subsidy. He reduced the price of creamery butter to the consumer.  This is a production subsidy, but there is no production subsidy for the producers of home butter.  The farmer-producers are being put out of existence. They are selling off their cows. They are putting in calves, and maybe the Minister desires that.  I know farmers with ten to 20 cows and they are not milking them now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will come down to the Shelbourne area.  He <Col N="1980" /> has made no attempt to address the Shelbourne farmers.  He will take good care not to go down there.  I challenge him to go down there.  The Minister has been requested from all sides for many months to increase the price of milk payable to the farmers who deliver to the creameries.  He has obstinately and deliberately refused to give any increase to the farmers for their milk in the present year.  He must be aware that very heavy charges have been put on the farmers over the past three years.  I think it was in 1946 his predecessor fixed the price of milk delivered to the creameries at what it is now, 1/2 in the summer and 1/4 in the winter.  It was agreed by all sides of the House at the time that the amount proposed to be paid to the farmers in 1946 was not exorbitant, that it was as low a price as could possibly be justified, and an unanswerable case exists for an increase in the price of that milk at present.</P>

      <P>Rates have gone up; wages have gone up; the price of agricultural machinery has gone up; the price of manures and seeds of all kinds has gone up; and the farmers cost of living has gone up.  He must buy boots and clothes the same as everybody else, and his cost of living has gone up as much as that of any other section of the community in the matter of his ordinary workaday life.  His food, clothing and drink have gone up in price, just as have those of Deputy Cowan or anybody else.</P>

      <P>We are not grumbling about it.  We are proud of the means by which we make our livelihoods. The farmer is proud of his method of livelihood, but when the State steps in and fixes an uneconomic price against him, he must growl and kick.  He should not be put out of existence, and he is entitled, as a good citizen of the State, to the cost of production of whatever he produces.  The policy of this Minister is to deny to the farmers an economic price for their <Col N="1981" /> milk and his efforts are directed to reducing their standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The inevitable result of that effort of the Minister to reduce the standard of living of the farmers must be to reduce the standard of living of the agricultural worker.  There must be fewer of them employed or they must work at a lower standard than their present standard.  That is the inevitable result of the Minister's deliberate pursuing of that policy&mdash;a depressing of the living of the agricultural community.  I am precluded from referring to the price of milk delivered to cities and towns, but I will have an opportunity of discussing it on another occasion.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable sum in this Supplementary Estimate for subsidies in respect of flour and wheaten meal. Arising out of the Acts under which these subsidies are paid, the price of wheat is fixed, and we charge the Minister with being dishonest with this House and with the farmers because he has not seen fit, before 14th March of this year, to increase the price which farmers will receive for the wheat when they harvest their crop next September. The present price was fixed by the Minister's predecessor in October, 1947, and announced in the public Press.  What the Minister did when he came into office was to say: &ldquo;Very well; if any group of farmers is so insane as to want to continue to grow wheat, we will fix it for five years.  We will blister them and let them see whether they want to grow it after five years or not.&rdquo;  As I have said, the cost to the farmer of producing wheat from every point of view has gone up since 1947.  It is the lowest-priced cereal that can be produced from the land to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Deputy adverts to the difference between green and dried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Dried wheat.  I am not one of those who believe that green or wet wheat should be delivered to any mill.  I want to see wheat of fair quality delivered by the farmers, and if they are encouraged properly to harvest their wheat and deliver it, and if they are paid a fair price for it, they will do so.  Since taking up office, the Minister has been a great advocate of increased machinery.  Any green or wet wheat which went into the mills in 1950 was the result, first, of the wet harvest and, secondly, the increased use of combined harvesters.  Fortunately or unfortunately, for better or for worse, combines have come to stay and their number is increasing year by year, but I can see nothing the Minister has done to increase the drying facilities down the country where the wheat is being grown.  In Wexford this year we have four or five times the number of combined harvesters&mdash;at least, there will be four or five times the number before the harvest&mdash;that we had two years ago.  There is not a single extra kiln in that part of the country to dry the wheat, which must go immediately to the mill from the combined harvester.</P>
      <P>If it is a very dry season, it is all right, but if it is a wet season, like last year, more wet wheat must go into the mills.  If the farmers are forced by circumstances, by labour and other conditions, to use combined harvesters to harvest their corn, facilities must be provided to have it dried, and dried right away.  The Minister has done nothing whatever to organise these facilities which are so urgently needed. In the counties of Leinster and Munster which grow the corn, the combined harvesters are doubling in number from day to day and the corn will be going into the mills green or dry, according to the season.  If it is a bad harvest like last year, it will be wet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I appeal to the Minister to take into consideration the fact that the farmers are entitled to at least as much as he is paying the foreigner for wheat and they should be offered over <Col N="1983" /> £30 per ton to grow wheat this year. A big proportion of the land being tilled is unfit for growing barley and unfit for growing oats, but it is most suitable for growing wheat, and the farmers living on that type of land are entitled to their cost of production for producing wheat.  There is not a man, woman or child in the country to-day but knows what the Minister's attitude to the growing of wheat in this country is.  He has made use of every adjective and every adverb he could find to belittle the growing of wheat.  He has done that time after time and he has used his position in this House in an effort to switch Irish farmers off producing wheat.  He has been doing that consistently over the years and in deliberately depressing the price paid to farmers this year, he is trying to kill that industry, as he has already succeeded in killing other industries, notably the egg industry.</P>

We hope and pray that the weather may allow the farmers to have their cereal crops planted before we reassemble after Easter, and we hope that at this season of goodwill, Easter, the Minister for Agriculture may look to the agricultural community and provide them with fair and remunerative prices for their butter, wheat and other products.

It is his duty to do justice to the farmers, to the creamery supp liers, to those who will produce wheat in the coming year and to give them a fair price even for farmers' butter.  It is his duty to wring from that Government, with the support of the Deputies behind him who represent agricultural constituencies, a fair price for the agricultural community. If the Deputies who sit behind him, who represent agricultural constituencies and farmers' interests, will only do their duty, the Minister will succeed in getting from the Government a fair price for agricultural produce, such as wheat, milk and butter.</P>
      <P>We have to wait another day to deal with eggs and other matters.  We will have a day for that before the year is out.

      <P>I was speaking for three minutes.  I had no intention of devoting my whole speech to the Minister, but I did think it was right to draw public attention to this vicious campaign against the Minister.  What has the Minister been trying to do in regard to the items for which he has been criticised?  Has he not been trying to do the best he could for the farmers?  The farmers are being held up here as beggars by the Fianna Fáil Party, as people who are starving, as people who are unable to pay their way and unable to pay their agricultural workers, and as people who are unable to pay for machinery.  The allegation has been made that the Minister has been responsible for bringing about that state of pauperism.</P>

      <P>I think it is only reasonable that, when we have this Supplementary Estimate discussed in this particular way, somebody should endeavour to try to put things right. I am amazed at this new idea that the farmer is to be deprived of all individual liberty.  I am amazed that Deputies who are farmers themselves should come into this House and, on this Estimate, suggest that farmers are helpless people, that they are hopeless individuals, that they do not know themselves what is good for them or what is right for them, and that their position of despair has been brought about by a man who has worked almost 24 hours of every day to improve conditions for them. Deputies may laugh.  They might prefer to hear that every minute of every day will be ordered for them, that everything they should do in their own interest they will not be permitted to do, but that some Minister will direct them and order them what to do.  These are the boys who talk about communism, socialism and everything else.</P>

      <P>I say, and I am proud to say it, that no person could have done more for the farmers than the Minister for Agriculture has done in the last three years.  I say that the farmers of the country appreciate and acknowledge that, and no amount of vilification or abuse can alter that substantial fact.  Throughout the country there are more, and not less, agricultural workers being employed; there is more machinery being bought, and more happiness has been brought into the homes of the farmers in the past three years than they have ever known before.  That is due, not to the people who have carried out that sustained campaign of vilification and bitterness, but it is due to the person whom we happen to have and whom we are glad to have as our Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister for Agriculture on many matters, but I must acknowledge&mdash;and I think it is only right that it should be acknowledged&mdash;that no man could have worked harder or worked better on behalf of the farmers than he has.  If the Minister for Agriculture has difficulty in regard to his markets, difficulty in regard to the things we want to sell, difficulty in regard to the prices of the articles we have to buy, these are difficulties that are due to a very difficult international situation.  I think it is a very horrible thing to find in a House such as this, representing the country, that there are Deputies who would be glad to see the prices of our agricultural exports collapse to-morrow if they could bring down the Minister for Agriculture on that issue.</P>
      <P>Should it not be the wish and desire of every Deputy that the best bargain that can be made for the farmers of this country should be made?  But they know that the better the bargain for the farmers and the better the bargain for the country, the worse it is for them&mdash;and they look to their own interests first.  I prefer to look to the interests of the farmers.  I prefer to look to the interests of the country. Looking at those interests I simply desire to say, and I shall say no more on this Estimate, that we have a good Minister for Agriculture and that we ought to be proud to have him.</P>

I feel it is my duty to draw the attention of the Minister to something which has occurred in my constituency. In particular, I want to refer to a very large meeting of farmers which took place in Dungarvan. They were extremely indignant about the milk position and I understand that they are turning away from milk production and are going to rear cattle instead.</P>

      <P>As a result, our consumers will suffer.  If the farmers cease to produce milk and turn instead to the rearing of cattle, factories both in Dungarvan and in Carrick&mdash;in which the Minister is interested&mdash;will suffer very considerably.</P>

      <P>The Minister talked about the consumption of butter in this country.  He left one factor out of consideration, the consumption of butter by the tourist trade in this country, which has increased to such an enormous extent over the past few years. Probably the consumption of butter by tourists accounts for the difference between the previous consumption of butter and the current consumption of butter.  It would leave the ordinary people consuming just the ordinary amount which they consumed before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> In some parts of the area in which I am interested, especially around Carrick-on-Suir, quite a large number of farms have been advertised for grazing this year.  I am aware that a number of farmers' sons who know farming would be very anxious to get an opportunity of getting farms like that and carrying out tillage for wheat and so forth.  But apparently the policy of the Minister is so much in the direction of rearing cattle that they are not encouraged, as has already been illustrated with reference to the price of wheat, for instance, to till for wheat.</P>

      <P>I am also greatly concerned about the leather factories. There are at least three in which, as a Deputy, I am interested.  I really think that the Minister should find some solution of the problem.  I do not deny that there are great difficulties there.  However, it is the duty of the Government to try to find some solution of the problem as between the factory itself which is, after all, anxious to produce leather as cheaply as possible in order that boots may be cheaper, and the farmer and the butcher so that they may get a fairer price.  It is not for the Opposition to try and find the solution.  That is a matter for the Government who have all the machinery at their disposal. They have full information and they should be able to find a solution of a difficult problem such as that which is involved in the contrast in the price given in another country and that which we have to pay in this country in order that the consumer may get the finished article at as reasonable a price as possible.</P>

      <P>I was not aware of the custom in bygone years in this regard but I should like to put this point of view.  It would have been a good thing if the junior staff and other workers attached to this particular faculty had been similarly considered by the Minister. Will the Minister indicate, when he is replying, whether he proposes to take any steps along those lines in the near future?  It must be obvious, for the same reason that has compelled him to take this particular step, that the same conditions must apply to other persons attached to the faculty which I have mentioned.  I do not intend to discuss general agricultural policy on this Estimate though it has been done, in particular, by members of the Opposition Party.  An opportunity for that will come on the main Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than once I have had occasion to disagree with the Minister on various aspects of his policy.  With Deputy Cowan, I should like to say that it would be a better thing for this country, and certainly far better for the farmers as a class, if the criticism by the Opposition were more constructive and if less personal spleen and animosity were displayed by the Opposition.  The Opposition may think that they are doing themselves and the country a political favour.  I do not think they are.  We have had elections <Col N="1995" /> and by-elections, particularly in my own constituency, and it has been proved very plainly that personal spite and spleen vented in public does not benefit any political Party.  I think that the leaders of the Opposition are well aware of that fact. However, the stage Irish antics of Deputy Corry and of some other Deputies may from time to time seem to be expedient though I am convinced that they will spell the ruin of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>We have listened to these two archpatriots, Deputies Cowan and Dunne, lecturing us as to the attitude we should take up on this side of the House and it appears now that if we criticise the Minister for Agriculture and find fault with his Department, as we are perfectly entitled to do, we are to be called saboteurs and people who indulge in vile abuse.  As far as I can recollect, no vile abuse of the Minister for Agriculture has been indulged in; his policy certainly has been criticised and criticised for certain definite reasons. For instance, the people on this side of the House cannot see for the life of them why it should be the policy of the Minister for Agriculture to import wheat from the ends of the earth at a much higher price than he is prepared to pay the Irish farmer.  We believe that that is not a sensible policy and that it is not good for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing app lies <Col N="1996" /> to beet.  We on this side of the House cannot understand and a lot of people in the country cannot understand why the Minister would not go all out to encourage the farmers to grow as much beet as possible so as to obviate the necessity of importing sugar from the far ends of the earth.  If we say that to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Government, is it to be called abuse?</P>

      <P>I hope that I, at any rate, will not be called a campaigner in abuse if I tell the Minister that.  I consider that I am telling him the truth. A lot has been said already about the price of milk and that is my chief reason for intervening in this debate to-night.  Like other Deputies I consider that the Minister is wrong in not doing something to increase the price of milk delivered at the creameries.  I come from a part of the country where the production of milk is the main industry of the farmers, and of course everybody knows that the dairying industry is the foundation industry of farming and if it is allowed to decline that it will be very hard to bring it back.  I cannot understand why the Minister has repeatedly refused to meet a deputation from the milk supp liers.</P>

      <P>The federation is in my opinion representative of the dairy farmers and they are entitled to have a deputation received by the Minister. They are entitled to put their case for an increase for the price of milk before the Minister and if the Minister has a case with which to rebut theirs then he can do so.  These are people who have made a study of the problem and understand all about it and they should be received by the Minister.  We all recall that after the change of Government the Minister for Agriculture went around telling the people with a flourish of trumpets that he was to be the servant of the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan referred to the difficult international situation and proceeded to lecture us and to tell us that we should not embarrass the Minister or the Government in view of it.  It is a pity that Deputy Cowan was not here when there really was a difficult international situation when certain members here did not hesitate to embarrass the then Government.

That is a very strange technique indeed, I must say.  Have not the farmers of the country as much right to put a case to the Government as any <Col N="1998" /> other section of the people?

I do not know what kind of reception he gave them, or whether they extracted a concession from him. My information is that he gave them a blank refusal and that they came away with their tail between their legs.

Deputies Dunne and Cowan came to the rescue of the Minister for Agriculture and condemned in very loud terms the tactics adopted, as they said, on this side of the House, vilifying the Minister.  In fact, the language used in describing the Minister's policy is very mild in comparison with that which we have come to expect as part and parcel of that same Minister.  It is only a few days since he used terms which are anything but edifying in this House or outside it.  He referred to a Deputy here as &ldquo;a scalded cat&rdquo;. Again, referring to the same Deputy, he talked about his &ldquo;rôle of galloper for broken-down generals&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister charged certain individuals outside this House with bringing potatoes into Dublin and regarded them as racketeers.  These people are not members of this House, nor are they in a position to challenge the Minister in the House.  The Minister is allowed to use such terms regarding traders legitimately trading in potatoes from Donegal to Dublin, bringing them into Dublin when they were scarce.  They are described as racketeers.  Then we have Deputies taking sides with the Minister and abusing the Opposition for vilifying, they say, the Minister.  If there is one member, one Minister in particular, who gives vent to all sorts of personal spleen, and in no uncertain terms, it is the Minister for Agriculture; and anything which he may get from this side of the House, or outside the House, he very well deserves.  The terms which are used in relation to him are very <Col N="2001" /> mild in comparison with those which he himself uses to others.</P>
      <P>In regard to the £5,000 loss incurred by the Department last year, the Minister tries to give the impression that he came to the rescue of the people of Dublin.  His main idea was to excuse the expenditure and make the public believe it was well spent money.  He did not go so far as to indicate to the House or to the public that the main reason and the true cause of the scarcity of potatoes in Dublin last year was the reckless bargaining he carried on earlier in the season, when he oversold the crop, with the result that there was a definite scarcity, which did exist and existed purely as a result of his not having true recourse to the facts at his disposal, that sufficient potatoes would not be grown to meet the English contract of 50,000 tons.  Therefore, the £5,000 in this Supplementary Estimate is something which the Minister has imposed on the country through his own incompetence earlier on.</P>
      <P>Had he risen in the House and told us that that £5,000 was expenditure as the result of a mistake on his part earlier in the season, we could have understood him; but in his true style, his style best known in this House, when there is a mistake made&mdash;and God knows there have been many mistakes made by this Minister for Agriculture&mdash;he does not try to give us a reasonable explanation as to why those mistakes were made.  Rather does he stand up and abuse people who cannot defend themselves, in the House or elsewhere.  That is a wellknown fact, both here and outside, yet we find there are Deputies who feel so sorely for the Minister, when he is being duly and deservedly criticised, that they must rise to take his part and abuse the Opposition for making criticism of things which they see to be wrongly done during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question, discussed here at great length on both sides of the House, as to the price of hides and how the fixed price adversely affects the amounts which the people get for their cattle.  The Minister makes a song about the situation, and holds out to the House and to the public <Col N="2002" /> that if there were a free market for hides it would mean £5 per head more per beast to the producer.  In doing that, he does not refer to the fact that the prices to be paid for our cattle are governed by that agreement made in 1948 by the Minister and by the Government, which they then described as a very good bargain.  That agreement leaves us in the position that 90 per cent. of our cattle must, perforce, be sold to the British market, with the result that we are not now able to sell our cattle in a free market, and the buyers are not in free competition with each other.  Britain holds the monopoly, and very recently the Minister himself stated that we were actually losing £4 per beast to Britain as a result of that agreement.  Yet, while admitting the loss of £4 per beast sold to Britain, in other words, £4 per head for 90 per cent. of our exports of cattle, he will come into this House and tell us about the ring which exists in the hide trade, at the moment resulting in a loss of £5 per beast to the farmer.  He will talk about £5 more which the farmers would get if there were a free market for hides when, as a result of the restricted market imposed on the farmers by the Minister in the 1948 agreement, we are now receiving £4 per head less for 90 per cent. of our cattle.  We could get that £4 per head more if we had an open and free market where the buyers would be free to buy what they wanted at whatever price they wished to pay.</P>

      <P>Will the House agree that it would be better for us if we never made the 1948 agreement whereby we are now compelled to send nine-tenths of our cattle to Britain irrespective of what other buyers may require?  Is it not a fact that after the war and until the 1948 agreement was made we had a position existing in this country which we had long sought for, namely, that we had buyers from different continental countries competing with Britain for our live stock?  That is something which we had sought for years and years and which never really materialised until after the war.  What happened after the 1948 agreement? We find that nine-tenths of our cattle are being sent to Britain whether we like it or not.  How can any Deputy or Minister maintain that we have the same position now as existed prior to 1948, that there is a free market and that all competitors are on an equal footing, when we are compelled to send 90 per cent. of our cattle to Britain?

While we stick to our side of the 1948 agreement in regard to sending 90 per cent. of our cattle to Britain, she has let us down in regard to one of the items which we were to get in return, namely, coal.

      <P>Coming to this question of potatoes, now that the Minister is in the House let me quote what the Minister had to say and the terms which he used in regard to certain people who are not members of this House and who have not an opportunity of replying.  As <Col N="2005" /> reported in column 1635 of the Official Report for the 8th March, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-head M (9) refers to the potato reserve scheme.  That money was used for the purpose of breaking a racket which was started in this city towards the end of last year. Some enterprising souls got it into their heads that there was going to be a scarcity of potatoes in Dublin about May or June of last year, and suddenly, where there was an abundance of potatoes, to my knowledge, the vanishing trick took place.  There was not a potato to be found.  The price of potatoes began to shoot up on the Dublin market and <i>mirabile dictu</i>, as the price rose, a thin trickle began to approach the City of Dublin from the general direction of Donegal.  I then took precautions to bring sufficient potatoes into Amiens Street to create a situation in which the Great Northern Railway were not prepared to accept consignments of potatoes from Donegal because their storage in Dublin was packed, and, to my great amusement, a number of public spirited citizens sent urgent messages from a number of stations in Donegal asking what, in the name of God, had happened and why would they not take potatoes....&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On to-day's Order Paper there appeared a question over my name addressed to the Minister for Finance, asking him if he would state whether he would arrange for an increase in the wages of the workers employed on the Brosna drainage scheme and on other similar works; when it is proposed to have such an increase granted, and if arrangements will be made to have the increased rates of pay paid without delay.  To my amazement the reply <Col N="2006" /> was in the most unfavourable terms. I presume that when the Parliamentary Secretary gave the reply he was speaking on behalf of the Government and was stating Government policy in this matter.</P>

      <P>Correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply was that the wage rates of men employed on artificial drainage works are reviewed from time to time as occasion arises. The wages of the labourers and other classes employed on the arterial drainage schemes at present in operation, namely, the Brosna and the Glyde and Dee, were increased as recently as September, 1950, and further increases are not in contemplation.</P>
      <P>I hope I am not foolish in presuming that when the Parliamentary Secretary spoke to-day he spoke as the mouthpiece of the Government.  He told us, in other words, that the Government had not under consideration the question of reviewing the wages of these unfortunate workers employed on works of national importance.  In the constituency which I represent a number of these workers are employed. These men are hard workers. They work long hours.  The work is strenuous.  It is work of national importance. Their employers are not private individuals.  They are employed by a State Department and by the Government.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that the rates of pay were increased last September.  The labourers engaged on this work are in receipt of 1/5 per hour.  Is that the rate of pay that the Parliamentary Secretary advocated when he was in opposition?  Bord na Móna are paying their workers 1/7 per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From information I have just recieved, I understand that, despite that 1/7 per hour, there is a strike in my constituency by Bord na Móna workers; they consider 1/7 insufficient. The drillers employed by the Office of Public Works are in receipt of 1/7 per hour.  The lowest increase those men would be entitled to would be 3d. per hour to meet the ever-rising cost of living, about which we hear so much <Col N="2007" /> in this House.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary or anybody on these benches deny that the cost of living has gone up?  It has gone up by leaps and bounds.  It is continuing to rise and nobody outside Grangegorman can believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>Is it not only right that the State, who is the employer of these men, should set an example to private employers and give to them the headline that many farmers are giving to-day?  Drivers of compressors and pumps are in receipt of 1/8 per hour. The least they could expect to meet the continued rise in the cost of living would be an extra 3d. per hour.  The men in charge of this drainage scheme at Brosna, which is the pride and joy of the Government, have from 1/6 to 1/10 per hour.  The lowest paid builder's labourer in Dublin is getting 2/1½ per hour.  The men controlling the works, the supervisors on the Brosna, the Glyde and the Dee have from 1/6 to 1/10 per hour.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary stand up here and defend that?  Has he got the courage and the pluck to go to the Government and tell them that he refuses to remain in charge of an office which treats its workers in such a shabby and disgraceful fashion as compared with other workers?</P>
    <P>Helpers and carters are in receipt of 8½d. per hour for their horses and carts.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not realise that a horse must be fed?  Does he not know that he must get his sweet hay and his oats about which the Minister for Agriculture boasts and brags because of all the hay that he says is available and the price at which it is available?  We have been told a good deal about oats and the price of oats.  The unfortunate men with horses working on the Brosna drainage scheme have to buy oats and hay; otherwise their horses will not be able to work.  They are in receipt of the princely sum of 8½d. per hour for their horses, 8½d. per hour to cover the cost of feeding a horse not to mention what will have to be paid for cart grease and the upkeep of the cart.  If a man wants a spoke in a wheel he must pay a carpenter at least £1 to do the job for him.  Yet, the Board <Col N="2008" /> of Works pay their carters 8½d. per hour.  For a pony and cart the sum is 5½d. per hour and for a donkey and cart 4½d. per hour.  The least these men should get is the county council rate.  The county council rate for carters is 18/- per day.  We have been told that for a 48-hour week these men receive 68/-.  Is there any other group of workers who have to stand in water from the time they fall into work in the morning until the whistle blows in the evening?  Is there any other group of workers treated in the same way as these unfortunate men are treated?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may tell me that in my constituency the rate of pay for agricultural workers is 54/- per week, but that is not the line to adopt.  No sane person would compare the rate of wages paid to an agricultural worker with what should be paid to men who are carrying out work of national importance.  In many cases the farmer has to farm under very peculiar conditions.  He is the employer of his own labour.  Surely what a private individual pays his employees should not be taken for comparison purposes with what the State can give its workers.</P>
    <P>It is quite true to say that I raised this question in July last.  It is quite true that an increase was given to the workers in April, 1950, and a further increase in September of that year.  I suggest that another increase is now due.  I say they are foolish men, and I want that to appear on the records of the House, to allow themselves to slave under the conditions under which they work on drainage at the present time when they could get more elsewhere. The unions with which they are associated&mdash;and, if they are not organised, it is their own loss&mdash;should make themselves felt and heard.  These men should not work for the rate of pay that they are getting at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to give advice always in the interests of the workers.  I am not concerned with what will suit the Government.  I am concerned only with what will suit the ordinary workers.  I have been nine <Col N="2009" /> years here advocating one thing and another and every syllable I ever uttered was in favour of the workers. The fact that I support the Government is not going to hamper me from championing any cause in connection with which I consider I am within my rights.  They are the section who deserve more sympathetic consideration than they are receiving.  Even the old age pensioners are being provided for by way of increases and every section of the white collar workers is being equally provided for.  Every section of the workers and every trade union is organising in an effort to get increased wages and I submit the Government should give immediate consideration to the granting of a substantial increase to these workers.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be prepared to reconsider this matter sympathetically and that he will be able to tell us he will give it complete reconsideration and that the Government will be prepared to grant these workers who are carrying out work of such national importance the least any working man can expect, and that is, a wage that will enable him to live and to bring up his family in decency and comfort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the appeal made by Deputy Flanagan, that the Parliamentary Secretary be requested to review the position so far as the workers employed on the Brosna scheme are concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply to-day, said an increase was granted last September. In a supplementary question I asked him was he aware&mdash;I was not quite sure that he was then aware&mdash;that the Leix and Offaly County Councils and the Forestry Department, which is presided over by his colleague, Mr. Blowick, the Minister for Lands, had granted increases to their workers.  In Offaly County and in the adjoining County of Leix increases were granted last September.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the work performed by the forestry and road workers is not quite as dirty as the work that is done by the men on the Brosna scheme.  These men have been given an increase of at least 7/6 <Col N="2010" /> a week in Leix, and in Offaly, where the Brosna scheme is operating, the road and forestry workers were recently granted 6/- a week of an increase, to come into operation on 1st April next.</P>
      <P>These are matters which the Parliamentary Secretary should consider and for that reason I strongly appeal to him to reconsider the reply he gave to Deputy Flanagan to-day and grant a reasonable increase to all sections of workers employed on the Brosna scheme.</P>
      <P>On previous occasions when requests of this kind were made to the Parliamentary Secretary he met those requests or demands in a very reasonable way.  I ask him to do the same on this occasion and grant increases to the men employed on the Brosna scheme, increases that will be at least as good as those granted by the representatives of the ratepayers to the men employed by the Offaly County Council and by his colleague, the Minister for Lands, to the forestry workers in the same area.</P>

      <P>I have received it in a nice fashion&mdash;&ldquo;They should not work, they should get out of work,&rdquo; to quote Deputy Flanagan.  That is a nice way to approach the matter. I am more than surprised.  Last April they had a grievance.  Deputy Davin made an app lication and Deputy Flanagan was interested too, and a strike was organised.  As Deputy Davin knows and as, I think, does Deputy Flanagan, I went there, and in 24 hours I had settled that strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, last September, they looked for an increase.  We immediately <Col N="2011" /> settled it up with them.  I hope that the workers on the Brosna will not be led away by a question like this and that they may think they have another grievance.</P>

      <P>I visit that place occasionally.  The drainage schemes are being carried out under the 1945 Act and so far from what it was like in the past when the workers had to stand in the water, the work is largely done now by machinery and it is very seldom such a thing has to happen with the workers there.  Deputy Davin accompanied me and we did not see anything of that sort.</P>

      <P>While other workers can swagger round in the afternoons, they are standing in the water from early to late.  I saw those workers.</P>

      <P>It is my duty to see them as well.</P>

      <P>It is your duty to pay them.</P>

      <P>I think I have made my point.  I have told you the majority of those people live around the scheme. They are mostly farmers' sons.  They come along there and get continuous employment.  Sometimes if they have to work on their own farms they remain away from us for a while, but it is seldom that happens.  They are contented there.  I am proud of the work they are doing and I hope they will not be disturbed by a question like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will do as I say down there.</P>

      <P>I hope they will not be disturbed by a question like this.  If they have a grievance, if they think they have&mdash;I think they have not at the moment&mdash;it can be considered.  When <Col N="2013" /> I thought they had one last April I increased their wages by 4/- a week. Last September I increased their wages again by 4/-.  I brought them up by 8/- for a 48-hour week to what is greater than the agricultural rate of pay for a 54-hour week.  I do not think they have a grievance now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of living has gone up since.</P>

      <P>If they think they have a grievance, if Deputy Flanagan or Deputy Davin think they have, I am willing to meet Deputy Davin and Deputy Flanagan and the workers on that scheme, but I do not want them to be led astray by questions of the type Deputy Flanagan has put down.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 15th March.</P>
