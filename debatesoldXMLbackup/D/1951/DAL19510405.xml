      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether any agreement or arrangement was made with the British Government in respect of the censuses to be held simultaneously here and in Great Britain during the present month; and, if so, whether he will give particulars.</P>

      <P>No agreement has been made with the British Government in respect of the censuses of population to be taken during the present month.  The only arrangement made is an informal reciprocal one between the Central Statistics Office and the British census authorities, whereby (a) in the case of ships in Irish or British ports at midnight of 8th/9th April, 1951, which depart before the census forms are collected, either authority will collect and return the completed forms of the other, (b) in the case of ships which are at sea, travelling between Irish and British ports at midnight on the night in question, it has been arranged, so as to avoid duplication, to enumerate the persons on board such ships at the ports at which they arrive on the morning of 9th April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The dates between which a census can be held either here or elsewhere are somewhat restricted. It is desirable to hold it at a period of the year when the passenger traffic is at a minimum and also at a period at which the weather is reasonably good.  In that way, the most suitable period is, roughly, between March and Whit.  It was a question of fixing some date in between that period.  I understand that that is the reason for fixing it at this period of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state whether any complications arose between the Department of Local Government and/or the committee of management of the National Health Insurance Society and the landlord of Árus Brugha in the years 1937 and 1938; and, if so, the outcome of the negotiations between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Árus Brugha was purchased in fee simple in 1933 by the Provisional Committee of Management of the National Health Insurance Society. It is presumed that the Deputy's question relates to a dispute which arose in 1937 between the committee of management and a firm of building contractors who completed an extension of the building in 1936.  A settlement was reached in May, 1938, following discussions between officers of the former National Health Insurance Society and the contractors.</P>

      <P>The Council of Education has not yet made a report.  The Deputy will recall that on the occasion of its being set up I asked the council to agree that their first formal task should be to advise me on (1) the function of the primary school, and (2) on the curriculum to be pursued <Col N="156" /> in the primary school from the infant age up to 12 years of age.</P>
      <P>The council have met on seven occasions. They have necessarily had the task of examining and studying a considerable amount of material.  They are at present inviting public bodies, organisations and persons who are in a position, because of their experience or qualifications, to furnish information which would be of special assistance to the council in its deliberations and to submit statements of their views, together with any recommendations which they might desire to make regarding the function and the curriculum of the primary school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that, notwithstanding Section 5 of the Land Act, 1950, the Land Commission are, in many cases of compulsory acquisition, offering prices far below that which the owners would obtain in the free market; and, if so, whether he will indicate the basis on which the Land Commission arrive at the prices in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy in the first part of the question.  That being so, the second part of the question does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that representations have been made to his Department by quite a number of landowners whose land is about to be acquired for division among local people and that their general complaint is that if they disposed of their lands on the free market, they would get much more for them than they are getting from the Land Commission? Would the Minister undertake to have these complaints investigated so that those people might get the benefit of the relevant section of the recent Land Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a case pending in Monaghan where a man purchased a holding of 32 acres in 1923 for £448 <Col N="158" /> and the Land Commission now want him to give them the holding for £370, a reduction of £78 after 28 years and after he has improved the land considerably? Does the Minister think that just?  I thought it was decided when the Bill was going through this House that people were entitled to market value for their holdings but here that is not the case.  Why should this man give his land to the Land Commission for £78 less than he bought it 28 years ago when the value of land has been enhanced and when he has improved it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with Deputy Mrs. Rice first, if the price is less at the present time than that which the owner paid for the farm, the land has probably deteriorated since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to defend them.  This is one of the excepted matters for the commissioners. If their offer is less than the value the tribunal is there.  If the Deputy will give me particulars of the case I will have it looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the definite policy of the Government to pay full market value for lands about to be acquired for division?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a matter of Government policy.  The law this House has laid down is that the Land Commission will pay market value for all land which they either acquire or resume.  Every person who appeals, I take it, is dissatisfied with the price offered, but it is silly for any person inside this House or outside it to say that he could get a better price on the open market than the Land Commission is giving him.  How does he know when he did not sell it and test the open market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a citizen having a complaint under Section 5 of the Land Act, 1950, what machinery has the Minister at his disposal to have it thoroughly investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This House handed over the question of the investigation <Col N="159" /> of complaints and prices to the Land Commissioners.  In the commission there is ample machinery; there is a court of appeal presided over by a judge of the High Court, and any person who does not wish to take the price he is getting has ample opportunity to appeal.  People as a whole since the passing of the Land Act, 1950, have been thoroughly satisfied. There may be people who think they should have got more, but by and large, there is complete and general satisfaction with the working of Section 5.</P>

I have nothing to add to the statements I made regarding the price paid for eggs by the British Government, except to say that my forecast that our export of eggs to Britain would be seriously affected by the low prices has been borne out&mdash;the quantity of eggs shipped to Britain in the first three months of this year being less than half the quantity shipped in the corresponding three months of 1950.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state what steps, if any, were taken to ensure that imported foreign butter is up to the ordinary standards of quality heretofore obtaining for butter fit for sale to the public in this country, and whether any consignments of foreign butter recently imported were found to be in whole or in part sub-standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Chinn Chomhairle, with your permission to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.  The imported butter recently placed on sale as part of the domestic butter ration was obtained by the Butter Marketing Committee.  In placing contracts for the purchase of this butter abroad, the committee stipulated that the butter must be of choicest quality and must contain not more than 16 per cent. of water and not more than 2 per cent. of salt.  The <Col N="164" /> butter was supplied on this basis and I am satisfied that the supplying countries gave us butter of their highest export standard as supplied by them in large quantities to many other countries.  Consignments on arrival in this country were examined by inspectors of my Department and were found to be uniformly of first quality.  A representative number of samples was also analysed for salt and water content.  Since the Deputy's question was received, I have seen particulars in the daily Press in regard to the recent prosecution of a retailer for selling imported butter which was found not to have complied with the standard of maximum water content laid down in the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.  I am satisfied that the quality of the butter concerned in that case is not representative of the quality of the butter generally.  The Deputy will, no doubt, appreciate that, even in the case of Irish creamery butter, the quality of which is above suspicion, instances may and do occur in which, notwithstanding the fact that the utmost care is taken to ensure that the water content of the butter does not exceed the prescribed minimum, occasional churnings reach the market containing excess water.  Convictions are regularly recorded for such contraventions in the case of Irish butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the Minister is, of course, aware that the retailer has no choice but to accept the butter offered to him.  I think the Minister will agree that that is the position and that in the case of the prosecution&mdash;and I understand that there is at least one other pending&mdash; the trader was simply selling as he received it certain butter which was found to be deficient.  In such circumstances, would the Minister take steps to indemnify the traders concerned for the loss and also to vindicate their reputations in this matter, by admitting or pointing out that they have no choice in accepting butter which is offered to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be of interest to me to discover how Deputy de Valera comes to be informed so precisely of the activities of the Corporation <Col N="165" /> inspectors who are conducting this inquisition into Danish butter at present in the City of Dublin.  The House may be interested to know that since 1949 there has been only one prosecution in the city for creamery butter which fell below the Food and Drugs Act standard.  Suddenly, a spate of solicitude has broken out amongst the inspectorial staffs, who are apparently concerned to inform Deputy de Valera of their intention to seek samples of Danish butter in the City of Dublin for the purpose of establishing that the butter is of an inferior standard.</P>

In regard to flax seed, inasmuch as the bulk of seed is being imported by a co-operative society in the Deputy's and my constituency on which I have heard no reflection made heretofore, I am surprised that the Deputy should represent to the House and the country that that co-operative society is fraudulently dealing with the people in respect of seeds.

      <P>Following on the rejection of the offer made on 11th January last for the joint purchase of the Great Northern Railway undertaking, the directors of the company were informed on 12th March that it was proposed to introduce legislation in the two Parliaments with the object of acquiring the undertaking at a figure of £3.9 million.  This figure is based on the average stock exchange valuation of the different stocks of the company in the three years, 1948, 1949 and 1950.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that the basis on which the value is assessed is an equitable basis?  He has based the value on the prevailing stock exchange prices over a number of years.  Is he satisfied that the stock exchange valuation forms an equitable basis for the purpose of assessment?  If he does, what about our national stock issues here which show a substantial depreciation in value at the present time on the stock exchange?  Because of that, does he not consider that when acquiring other people's property it should be done on the basis of agreement mutually arrived at which would be a more favourable basis than the stock exchange?  The latter is a very uneven basis on which to go when acquiring other people's property in the interests of the State, and the Parliamentary Secretary is certainly not just when taking that basis.  I do not believe the proposed Bill will ever pass this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is ground for some difference of opinion as to the basis on which the purchase price is fixed, but I think it is only right to remind Deputies that the Government had no desire to acquire this undertaking.  Our Government was approached, just as the Government of the Six Counties was approached, when the company found itself in certain difficulties.  In the light of those difficulties and because the future prospects appeared no easier from the financial point of view of the company, it was regarded as reasonable to take the stock exchange quotations for the three year period, the last three years in which the company operated as a private enterprise.  I might also remind the Deputy that it is the same basis, the three previous years' working, as was taken in the case of the acquisition of the former Great Southern Railways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is, no doubt, aware that some years back a substantial part of the transport services of Northern Ireland <Col N="179" /> was taken over by the Government of Northern Ireland.  This action had the effect of leaving the Great Northern Railway without a particular service and placed it in the position of running at a loss for the past few years in the Six County area.  At the same time, their service in Southern Ireland, where they had access to road traffic, continued to pay.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary kept that clearly in view when entering into a contract to take over a bankrupt concern from the Six Counties and add it to the paying concern operating in Southern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to deal with a matter of this kind by way of reply to supplementary questions.  All these factors were taken into consideration. As I explained earlier, the circumstances under which the Government was requested to provide a system on the same basis made it obvious that there would be difficulties in deciding on compensation or in fixing the purchase price.  The Deputy is aware that that part of the undertaking within the jurisdiction of our Government has been run right up to the present as a paying proposition.  It is only right, however, that a company of this nature should be regarded as a single unit and it was in those circumstances that the Government felt itself reluctantly obliged to acquire the undertaking jointly.</P>

These are very important matters for Youghal.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether the exportation of Irish wool will be prevented forthwith and if the price of the next Irish clip will be controlled so as to give a profitable price to the farmers and thus prevent the speculators from depriving our clothing factories of this necessary raw material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the Deputy I am anxious to prevent speculation from depriving clothing manufacturers of the raw material they need, but I am not satisfied that the best way of achieving that object is to prohibit completely the export of wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that a large proportion <Col N="188" /> of the Irish wool crop has no attraction for Irish woollen mills, but I can assure the Deputy that I will take whatever steps are necessary to enable these mills to have an opportunity of purchasing at a fair price whatever kinds of Irish wool they need.</P>

With regard to the second part of the Deputy's supplementary, I think that has been met in full or as fully as could be by the reply I have given here.

The new rates represent an improvement on existing scales and, in addition to providing for the grant of an immediate increase of up to £25 to an attendant on obtaining registration in the Supplementary (Mental) Part of the General Nursing Council Register, will also enable the staff concerned to <Col N="197" /> reach the maximum of the salary scale in a shorter period.

    <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill because (1) it does not provide a comprehensive or balanced scheme covering the needs of all sections of the community, and (2) it would impose greatly increased burdens on both employees and employers whilst providing benefits little better in many cases than those now available.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Ryan.)</P>

    <P>3.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill because no provision is made therein for the payment of benefits to small farmers and casual workers who are not included in the Bill as at present constituted.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy John Flynn.)</P>
    <Col N="199" />
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one deep regret in this matter and it is that Deputy Flynn has given notice of his intention to withdraw his amendment. I am sorry to see him leave the House now, because I should like to put a few figures before him.  There are in Deputy Flynn's constituency in Kerry some 21,000 farmers, if we can call them farmers, living on less than 30 acres per family.  The Deputy's amendment says that no provision is made in the Bill for the payment of benefits to small farmers and casual workers who are not included in the Bill as at present constituted.  I wonder whether Deputy Flynn considers that the 2/6 promised to the old age pensioners in Kerry, and which he knows as well as I know can be screwed out of the Minister whether this Bill passes or not, is a full justification for throwing overboard these 21,000 farmers who live on less than 30 acres per family in County Kerry.  Is the Deputy prepared to do that?  That is a question which I should like the Deputy to ask himself before he walks into the Lobby. The total income per family of these men would not be £3 a week and Deputy Flynn knows that as well as I know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard talk about the workers.  Any one of these 21,000 men &mdash;we have altogether over 250,000&mdash; living on holdings of less than 30 acres will do more work in one week than any of the so-called workers who are to benefit under the Bill would do in their whole lifetime.  There is a wide difference between the man endeavouring to rear a family on the ten to 30-acre holding in this country, as a worker, and the gentleman who dishes out tickets in some trade union office and who is called a worker, and there is a wide difference between the amount coming into the household of each of these men's families in any one week and the amount coming into the household of the other man.  The man in the Transport Union offices in Cork does not expend much sweat dishing out members' tickets every week and I can guarantee to Deputy Hickey that the &ldquo;bucko&rdquo; dishing out these tickets will knock down three times as much as any of the men who are completely knocked out of this Bill and have no <Col N="200" /> benefit whatever to gain by it will get.</P>
    <P>These men have no means of increasing their income.  If any one of these trade union gentlemen finds that the cost of living has gone up, he immediately puts in his demand to his employer for an increase and he gets it, or knows the reason why, but if these farmers come even to their representatives here and appeal to them, they will find marching into the Lobby against them, to prevent them getting the increase in the price of their agricultural produce to which they are entitled, not alone the Labour Party <i>en masse</i> but the so-called representatives of the farmers over there. They are the same people who are now prepared, on this second occasion, for the sake of the fruits of office, to throw overboard and sell out the unfortunate people whom they pretend to represent.</P>
    <P>An attack was made here last night on Deputy Dr. Ryan, particularly by Deputy O'Leary who is from the same constituency, in connection with the insurance company of which Dr. Ryan is a director.  I can promise Deputy O'Leary that whenever he lifted the thimble off any of Deputy Dr. Ryan's insurance bills, the pea was there.  If the pea was found very often under Deputy O'Leary's thimble, he would not be here at all.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared at any time, for any Party, to vote for any Bill that will put on one side 500,000 of our people.  The total number occupied in any manner in this country is 1,300,000 and that includes even the three-cardtrick man.  Of that number, 503,000 are farmers, their wives, their sons and daughters over 14 years of age, working on the land; 358,000 of that 500,000 are working on holdings under 50 acres and, under this Bill, they are to be cut out completely from any benefits whatever but they are to have the pleasure of paying so that others may benefit.  The unfortunate fellow who has 15 acres of Kerry bog will wake up on Monday morning and find that when he wants his little plug of tobacco for the week there will be an extra bit on it.  To pay for what?  We are told by the Minister for Social Services that <Col N="201" /> there will be £4,500,000 taxation in the first year.  That has to be paid for by this unfortunate fellow.  When he buys his ounce of tobacco, he has to pay his share of that £4,000,000 odd.  When he buys an ounce of tea or a grain of sugar for his children he will have to pay for it and, if he ever succeeds in getting together the price of a pint, he will have to pay for it in that also. Who will he benefit?  Under this Bill, Sir, the general manager of Córas Iompair Éireann will have to pay 3/6 a week out of the public purse.  We all know that Córas Iompair Eireann are bankrupt and that we have to find the money for them.  When you have men such as Deputy Davin as chief officers, it is no wonder they are bankrupt. The taxpayer will have to pay 3/6 for Deputy Davin.  We should be quite clear on that.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Davin deny that that is so?  A Deputy tells me that he has retired.  Thank God.  I withdraw completely as that is the case.  However, the present general manager of Córas Iompair Éireann comes under this Bill and the unfortunate devil that I have described, with an income of less than £3 a week, with 15 acres of Kerry bog, who is trying to drag out a livelihood, trying to support his children and trying to put boots on them to send them to school, will have to pay his share of the £4,000,000 odd that is to help to give an extra pension, along with all the other pensions he will get, to the general manager of Córas Iompair Éireann and to every bank manager. When there is so much shouting about the workers, let us examine who will benefit.  Take the ordinary worker who, year after year, has had deductions from his wages for the purpose of a fund out of which he will get sickness benefit and a pension at the end of his period of employment.  Now he will be asked to pay, in addition to his present contribution, a further 3/6 a week.</P>

What will Deputy MacEoin and Deputy McGrath do for their class here?  The country blacksmith is completely cut out under this Bill.  Of course, he could not be recognised by the Minister for Social Services.  What has the ordinary country blacksmith to do with the collar and tie gentlemen in the Post Office?  Take the case of the country carpenter, who carries out all the local repairs.  What is his position under this Bill?  He is also cut out.  Take the country shoemaker.  I said to the local shoemaker: &ldquo;You are all right now that you have the Social Insurance Bill.&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;I do not benefit under that at all.  That is for the bank managers.&rdquo;  They have taken the people that I have referred to out of it but these people will have to pay.  For whom?  Where do the people in Deputy Seán Collins' constituency, who live along the Beara Peninsula, come under this Bill?  Are they expected to pay £4,000,000 odd a year so that men who are at present earning £6 10s. to £12 a week may <Col N="203" /> benefit?  There is no trade unionist earning less than that now.</P>

      <P>I will deal with the farm labourer in a minute.  He has been my baby a long time before I ever heard of Deputy Dunne and he was always well looked after by me.  You will find that when you come down my way.  You will be welcome any time you come but I think you will go back much wiser than you came.  You will not be dealing with the &ldquo;haw-haw&rdquo; farmers around Dublin when you come down my way.  Where do these unfortunate men, the fishermen about whom Deputy Collins expresses so many regrets from time to time, come under this comprehensive Social Security Bill?  The poor old carpenter, the ordinary job carpenter, who goes around to the country making a cart, a butt or a pair of wheels and who is classed as what is known as self-employed, does not come under it.  The blacksmith who puts shoes on the old horses, the ordinary mason who goes around building sheds, does not come under it.  All these, the whole lot of them, are cut off.  The only class who benefit by this are certain types of collar-and-tie labour.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about the fellow in the attic.  I think the fellow in the attic is pretty well provided for at the present day.  Houses are being provided for them at the expense of others.  I was inside an ordinary labourer's cottage recently and there were two men in that house earning. That cottage was let at a rent of 1/- a week, plus rates, and these two men had between them an income of £14 or £15 a week.</P>

If you take all the people who are supposed to be self-employed in the first instance, take the <Col N="204" /> 500,000 farmers and the relatives in the second instance and then every little shopkeeper and every man who happens to be an employer out of this 1,300,000, what have you left?  Whom will this Bill benefit?  There is very little use in Deputy Dunne referring to the agricultural labourer.  He has gone, gone like the wind.  No man would be idiot enough at the present day to work for £3 per week while he can get anything from £5 to £10 for doing nothing.  These fellows are gone.  You can see that by the fact that we had to buy Brian Boru's butter the other day.  These classes are finished and, judging by the attitude of this House, there is now a sinister determination to finish off the last productive class in the community&mdash;the class producing the bread, butter, milk and sugar for the drones, producing these commodities at a wage, roughly, of £3 per week.  The price of milk at the present day would allow of a wage of only 33/- a week for a labourer, yet Labour, led by the nose, went into the Lobby to vote that that price should not be increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think possibly it would have been better if Deputy Corry's contribution to this debate had never been made because we are coming to grips with a problem that will have to be tackled objectively on its merits.  We have got to decide first and foremost whether we accept the principle that social service is necessary, and I think on that there is complete unanimity on all sides of the House.  It is true that some moralists and theologians, acting and talking for themselves alone, and in many cases actuated by a deliberate bias that excluded from consideration the merits of any problem, have made far from worthy contributions to the general atmosphere that was built up round this piece of legislation before it was actually introduced.  I come here to analyse, as best I can, what I feel <Col N="206" /> should be the rational approach to the whole problem.</P>
      <P>I think it is a common adjunct to the modern conception of the duty of a democratic State that there must be provision to help certain sections of the community, particularly the aged, the blind, the widows or those who are suffering from temporary difficulties owing to sickness.  Now, there is a furore about this Bill.  Most of it, of course, has a political background. Has anybody sat down and realised yet what this Bill really is?  Its purpose is the co-ordination of a tremendous number of services already in existence, bringing out of a chaotic complex system of confusing Acts one solid workable Act to cover old age pension schemes, national health, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. But as well as doing that it is adding some new benefits.  Let us examine these for what they are worth. Is there any Deputy who is not consious of the necessity for improved maternity benefits, and for the introduction of mortality benefits?  Nobody is going to deny the Christian basis for giving better grants towards the mother in the period immediately prior to and subsequent to the birth of the child.</P>
      <P>Is there anybody in this House who, in conscience, can object to the removal of the dread spectre which obsesses so many people during their lives that, in the end, they may find a pauper's grave?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two principles are the main new departures in this Bill outside of what is already in existence.  We had the extraordinary speech of Deputy Corry which dealt with everything but what is in the Bill.  He talked about the agricultural community, which both he and I have the honour to represent, as if it were a down-trodden, brow-beaten, suffering community.  Unquestionably, the agricultural community is enjoying more prosperity to-day than it has ever known in living memory.  It is true that the Bill may not be as wide as some of us would like.  What we have to consider on the Second Reading Stage is the broad principle of the Bill.  There will be a later stage when <Col N="207" /> the combined intelligent and constructive opinion of the House can be brought to bear on the Minister if we feel there are ways in which the Bill can be improved.  But, surely, on this stage we have to face the simple issue whether, in fact, there is the onus placed on the State of accepting the responsibility of looking after certain sections of the community who are ill-fitted to look after themselves, and whether or not it is a good principle, a principle which is based on a contribution basis, to ensure that any person to whom this Bill applies, having given a reasonable lifetime of service to the benefit and advancement of this nation, may not, on reaching a certain age, be assured, at least of this, that he will not be cast aside on the waves of charity.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are many people to whom this Bill will not apply. Some of them were referred to by Deputy Corry&mdash;blacksmiths, travelling carpenters and various self-employed people.  I am quite certain that these people will not be in the least bit grateful to Deputy Corry for his contribution to this debate.  It is true that it might be possible to press for their inclusion, but if one looks at the scheme which is being operated in England one will find that the contribution of a self-employed person would be practically twice that which is being asked on the highest scale from anybody in this Bill.  Nobody is going to suggest to me that either a journeyman carpenter or a blacksmith in the country is anything like the poor down-trodden individual painted for us by Deputy Corry.  These men are doing extremely well in my area. In the country, it is extremely hard to get one of these journeymen carpenters or a journeyman handyman to do an odd job of reconstruction or repair about a farmer's place.  I do not want to approach this Bill on any basis other than that of analysing what is the duty of the State towards those members of the community who have worked for a weekly wage over a long period of years in the service of the State when they retire.  I want to analyse how far our responsibility goes to those people.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="208" /> say that they want social services, that they want bigger and wider social services, but they got a woeful belly ache on the morning the Minister came to the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to make his announcement in connection with the long delayed and long merited increases for old age pensioners, widows and orphans.  Since then, Deputy Lemass, on the one hand, and Deputy Dr. Ryan on the other, with occasional bleatings and conflicting opinions from their back benchers, have been trying to mend their hand. They now do not know where they are because their social service idea is like the alleged blue-prints of the scheme which Deputy Dr. Ryan meant to have left behind him in the Department of Social Welfare, but which could not be found.  We are here, elected representatives of the people, to deliberate upon a measure which is going to bring benefit to sections of the community that I hope to prove merit our favourable consideration.  It is common case that we have a responsibility to the old age pensioners who can no longer work and who are not in a position to support themselves.  It is common case that we owe a duty to the family who may have lost their bread-winner in tragic circumstances.  We owe it to the widows and to the orphans.  Nobody will quarrel with the fact that we owe a duty to the blind.  Nobody in this House will have the courage to stand up and quarrel with the fact that we are going to improve conditions for the expectant mother.  I do not think anybody in this House is going to quarrel with the fact that we are going to make available to people a certain grant to ensure that when their last remains go to their place of burial they will go at least with a reasonable respect and with the reasonable equipage that we associate with the burial of our dead in this country.  What are we quarrelling about here?  The quarrel at times seems to be that Labour is swallowing Fine Gael.  The next quarrel is: &ldquo;Oh, if Fianna Fáil were there we would have given you a <Col N="209" /> better one.&rdquo;  You were here too long and we got none.</P>

      <P>The position is that we in this House, as the custodians of authority in this country, as the people who put Governments into office, owe a duty to the people we serve.  I think this Bill shows a courageous advance towards the acceptance of responsibility that must ultimately be that of the nation to people who, through years of toil and sweat, have helped in the development not only of the economy of the country but who have helped in the full development of the nation in the broader sense.  A coordinating Bill, giving further and additional benefits in certain recognised and accepted worthy cases, has caused this mighty furore.  Why did the Deputies representing the farming community not come in here and tell the truth?  There is one tremendous advance in this Bill that the Opposition seem to be deliberately ignoring&mdash; possibly wilfully shelving.  With this Bill goes one shocking iniquity that oppressed us in rural Ireland for too long.  I refer to that iniquitous system that prevented the old man or the old woman from transferring their holdings to the young and getting their pension, unless the young man in the place was married.</P>

Undoubtedly, however, an effort is made in this Bill&mdash;and I am inviting my friends on the other side of the House to come forward with a constructive and intelligent scheme to include these people and we will analyse it in this House.  We can only suggest at the moment that they can band together in the co-operative union <Col N="210" /> through which they can become members of this particular scheme.  If you have something better in this wonderful, unfound and unfindable scheme of Fianna Fáil's to put before this country and this House for its consideration, now is the hour.

      <P>It is best to forget him.  It is true that there are defects in the way of making the scheme apply in an over-all way to the community. The thing that irks and annoys me about this complete measure is that while the basis of it is common case and while the principle is admitted, instead of getting together here as reasonable intelligent people to try and improve still further and enlarge the scheme, we come in here as a group of petty little schoolboys jibbing and gibing at each other.  Immense charges have had to be met in this State up to now to enable us to discharge our obligations to certain sections of the community.  We accept and the House unanimously accepts that principle. Why have we bickering and childishness on the Second Stage of the Bill when we should be getting the Second Stage through and getting the House, together with its collective intelligence, to try and make this Bill, the principle of which is accepted, a better Bill for the country in general?  I think that we would be doing infinitely more service to the nation if we were to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On what basis can one object to a scheme which is based on a three-way contribution&mdash;one part by the person to benefit, another part by his employer and the third part by the State?  If the man is self-employed it would straight away present the difficulty that his contribution to the scheme would have to be twice that of the man who is employed.  It is true <Col N="211" /> that it is the aim of all individual industries to try and get some pension scheme for their employees.  That is a principle that is growing more and more rapidly in our modern State. What quarrel should these people have if they are asked to fit into a national plan and if they want, above the general national plan, to make special provision, extra to that, for their employees?  There is nothing in this Bill which will stop them from doing it.  But is it immoral, as was suggested by some people purporting to be theological experts, to try and fix a minimum standard that is going to be something above the horrible and miserable subsistence level that some of the most necessitous classes in this country have had to face in the years gone by?</P>
    <P>Is there something wrong, something indecent or something improper in trying to make the future a little bit brighter than the very dull past?  Mind you, I am not afraid to go down to West Cork and answer the questions I will be asked on this Bill because I believe that we are bound in duty to do as much as we possibly can for the necessitous classes.  If a practical and reasonable way can be found of including small farmers and their sons in the social services, I feel sure that we will get an opportunity of enlarging those services or of introducing new legislation.  I have been trying to get a solution for the problem myself; I am not enamoured of a Bill that cannot be more general in its sweep, but I say squarely and honestly that this Bill is stepping out in the right direction and I will step with it.  If not in the year or two before us, I hope that with a proper approach to the question, we may find unanimity and commonsense to meet a problem which at present is being put into the field of petty politics.  This is a bigger problem than politics.  God knows, none of us knows when the boot may be on the other foot.  We do not know when we or ours may find ourselves through no fault of our own forced to make use of either the sickness or old age benefits set out in the scheme.  Is it <Col N="212" /> unworthy that we should remove from continuing mendicancy these unfortunate people?  I think it is a worthy act.  It is true that you can pinprick the Bill in many ways but on its principle we are all on common ground and believe that some type of social service is necessary.  Fianna Fáil say it is necessary; they say that this is not good enough, but as yet they have not given us one practical suggestion for its improvement except: &ldquo;Take out the increase in old age pensions so that we can vote against it; if you leave it in we are hobbled&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I speak as a person who is generally interested in finding the best solution possible to the problem.  I take it that the Bill is put forward as a type of social security and that there will be ready agreement to its improvement if practicable.  I take it that it is put forward to give a lead to the House so that if possible it may be perfected before it becomes law.  I make an honest appeal to the House to get away from wondering whether you are going to lose Mick McCarthy's vote or Liam Hayes's vote and consider how to make social services practicable, workable and available in the most generous and general way to the people who need it.  That is our duty as legislators.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about this measure is that while many people of different religious denominations have purported to denounce it no authoritative condemnation has come from those who are recognised as the directors of religious thought, either the Catholic or the Protestant bishops.  We have had airy vapourings from one worthy gentleman who was absolutely slashing in his condemnation, but if he had removed from his poison the bias and prejudice of political allegiance and disillusion there would have been nothing left for him to say.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give a measure of justice to some at least and I hope we are not far from the time when it may be extended throughout the country.  I do not at all agree with the suggestion that this Bill will keep drones.  The drones of our system are not among the lowly paid or the working class. The sooner we realise that and are fair <Col N="213" /> to those decent hard-working people the sooner will credit redound to us all.  It is horrible to suggest that these people are drones living on the oppressed, depressed and harried agricultural community.  In their day and generation they contributed as much to this nation as any class in the country.</P>
    <P>Let us get at this Bill and improve it where we can.  Let us not impede it just through frustration, anger, prejudice or bias.  Let us face with commonsense an issue that we must face some day.  Let us find a way to make things better for the type of person Deputy Allen and I represent, the small farmers, the people of the rural areas.  If we can find a way to do that I will press for its implementation.  Let us get together and find a way to make this a better Bill and let us not tear down something to which we can offer no alternative.</P>

      <P>Since this Bill was introduced and circulated, the Tánaiste has announced on the Second Reading his intention to amend it by making certain provisions for old age pensioners, blind pensioners and people in similar classes.  There is, however, nothing in the Bill itself which makes any provision for those sections of the community not covered by contributory insurance.  If any Deputy feels that the principles involved are so bad that it is necessary to vote against the Bill on the Second Reading, he can do so knowing full well that he is not voting against any proposal to increase non-contributory old age pensions or the other benefits which the Tánaiste has promised to introduce at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone will agree that, having regard to the manner in which the cost of living has risen, during the past year in particular, and even during the past few months, there is urgent need to give at least an additional half-crown to the old age pensioners. The additional price they have to pay for fuel will more than absorb that additional benefit.  Therefore, there is no disagreement on that question. I think that a reasonable proposition was put up to the Government by four independent Deputies&mdash;Deputies <Col N="214" /> P.D. Lehane, Sheldon, O'Reilly and myself.  We asked the Government to embody the provision for an increased old age pension in a separate Bill and have it passed through the House immediately.</P>
    <P>It could have been passed before Easter, if the Government had been prepared to meet our request; and those increased pensions could be on the way towards being paid almost immediately.  There is nothing to prevent at any time the giving of this increased benefit, except the unwillingness of the Minister for Finance; but once the Minister for Finance and the Government have announced that they are prepared to concede the additional money required to meet an increase in the old age pension, there should be no delay whatever in giving that pension. It has been announced in the public Press that that increase of 2/6 is to be forthcoming and it is unfair to the aged and to the blind and to those in need, the weakest section of the community, to keep them waiting in suspense while a difficult and complex Bill is under discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheehan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the Deputy think of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought of it immediately, as soon as the proposition was made to hold the old age pensioners to ransom, to use them as hostages, so as to ensure that a Bill which is bad fundamentally in many respects should be rushed through the House.  If the proposal to give an increase to old age pensioners were an honest or sincere one, it should have been embodied in the Bill when it was being drafted.  Long consideration was given to this Bill.  It has been under consideration, I presume, since the White Paper was issued more than a year ago.  There have been, as we know, two Bills announced.  This is the second draft of this Bill that has been introduced.  There was ample opportunity to embody in the Bill the provision for increased old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that it was only when the Government suddenly <Col N="215" /> realised that there were so many independent Deputies prepared to vote against the Bill as originally introduced, that they decided that they would be forced, in order to get the Bill through, to offer this additional half-crown.  That is not the way to treat this House.  It is not the way to treat a very important piece of legislation. If there is anyone who can claim credit for the fact that this additional half-crown has been promised, it is those of us independent Deputies who made it clear that we were not supporting the Bill as introduced.  So when Deputy Sheehan asks when did I think of this, it is necessary to ask when did the Government think of it. Why did they not think of it sooner than when they realised at the last moment that they could not get the Bill through without giving this concession to a very needy section of the community?  I think that this is a dishonest proposal, and I want to assure the House that if they meet the demand which has been put up by four independent Deputies here, and the demand which is also embodied in a motion which I have tabled, that non-contentious legislation containing this half-crown be introduced into this House, then there will be no difficulty whatever in getting such a Bill through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear at the outset that the half-crown is not in the Bill.  The Government had not the moral justice or the sense of justice or fair play to the old age pensioners to put this half-crown into the Bill and it was only when they were coerced by us independent Deputies that they made this promise that it would be introduced subsequently.  I do no agree with that dishonest type of procedure in introducing a Bill of this kind, which is of such immense importance.  It is a Bill which embodies many dangerous principles, principles which have been very properly criticised by those whose function it is to study legislation and to study administration from the purely <Col N="216" /> Catholic and religious point of view. Those people have studied this proposal very carefully, and I consider that their reasons were presented very moderately, very fairly and very carefully, and presented with a view to offering some guidance in this matter. They have never wished&mdash;and no fairminded person would wish&mdash;that an attempt should be made to rush this House into supporting a contentious Bill by putting in a half-crown for old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Government now to bring in a Bill with this 2/6 and I can assure the Government that it will be passed as speedily as possible through the House.  Then we can get down to consideration of this Bill.  The Bill before us, which has been printed and put into circulation, contains no provision for the 2/6.  We could consider it and after careful consideration decide whether on its merits it is worthy of support.  Leaving out whatever the Minister's intentions may be with regard to amendments on the next stage, this Bill on balance is a bad one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has fundamental faults and fundamental virtues, just like every other Bill.  There are always some good points in every piece of legislation, even the worst piece introduced here.  Everyone will agree that it was urgently desirable that the sickness benefit should be increased, particularly that it should be increased in cases where the insured person has a family depending upon him.  That was urgently needed and I think every Deputy will agree that that particular provision is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, however, could have gone a little further in that respect. He should have included in the disability benefit all insured persons who suffer disability through injury or accident, apart from those who suffer disability due to illness.  Workmen's compensation liability should have been included in this Bill and the general community would have welcomed such a change and such an improvement.  Whether a man is incapacitated from work because he <Col N="217" /> has met with an accident in the course of his employment or because he has contracted some disease is immaterial. He should receive the same benefit while he is unable to work.  That is a point which deserves reasonable and fair consideration.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are bad points in this Bill and those bad points outweigh those which are good and desirable. There are three main faults in this Bill.  In the first place, it seeks, and seeks very successfully, to concentrate in the hands of the central Government functions which should be, in a right society, performed by the family and some of which could also be performed by a local organisation, particularly by a vocational organisation. Secondly, it is bad because it seeks to provide certain services which in my opinion are both unnecessary and undesirable.  It seeks to compel the ordinary working man to pay a substantial contribution which is just the same as any other form of direct taxation, and he has to pay that for the specific purpose of keeping a large section of the community in complete idleness.</P>
    <P>I hold that the first function of a Government in regard to the workers is to see that they have constant employment.  The usual Socialist slogan is, &ldquo;work or maintenance.&rdquo;  I hold that the slogan of a good Government should be work without the alternative of maintenance.  I hold that a properly constituted Government, a Government constituted on sound principles and acting on sound principles, should be able to provide work for every citizen able and willing to work.  If they fail to perform that function, and only then, they should finance the provision of maintenance, not out of compulsory contributions from the workers, but out of general taxation.  I do not agree that any worker should be compelled to insure himself against the incompetence of a Government, because it is only incompetence that produces unemployment. Therefore, if it is necessary to provide maintenance for the unemployed through the incompetence of the Government, the Government should <Col N="218" /> provide it by other means than a direct levy on the workers and their employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that this has been the pattern of our insurance since 1911.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was expecting that interruption.  I know that there are a lot of things which have been wrong since this State was established and before this State was established; but if a thing is wrong that is no reason why it should be extended to such an extent that it can never be redressed. An evil like this on a modified scale is not as harmful or as dangerous as it is when it is extended and made universal.  That is one of the principles upon which I am opposing this Bill&mdash; that we are extending and expanding the whole system of unemployment insurance to such an extent that we are creating a vested interest in unemployment, that we are compelling large sections of the community to contribute so much of their weekly income to insurance that they will naturally feel they are in some way entitled to recover the money which they have paid.  As I say, if you fail to perform the important governmental function of providing full employment for our workers, there is only one thing you can do and that is to provide the assistance for them out of general taxation. I want to get away from the bad principle which the Minister has mentioned and which he now seeks to extend and expand so as to cover every section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another section of the community for whom the Minister has made provision in this Bill, namely, able-bodied persons of 65 years.  I do not know what percentage of the total population these people form, but they must be a very considerable section, and I am certain that the provision of this retiring benefit, as it is called, will impose a very heavy liability upon the whole insurance scheme.  I do not think that that service is either necessary or desirable.  If we had a position in this country in which the volume of output was so high that we could not find a market for it either in this country or <Col N="219" /> outside, if our external balance of payments was so favourable that it would not be necessary to increase our agricultural or industrial output, then there might be a case for shortening the working life, just as there might be a case for shortening the working week or the working day.  But we have not that position here.  We have the position in which we are unable as a nation to pay our way because our volume of output does not keep pace with the volume of consumption. Therefore, we are seeking to introduce by this Bill something which will retard the output of the nation and something which will impose a very heavy burden on the insured section of the community and also of course on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>There is no reasonable case for this retirement benefit.  Under the health insurance provisions heretofore in force, and particularly under the health insurance provisions in this Bill, a worker of 65 years who is in poor health, a worker who is medically unfit to go to work, can receive benefit. On the other hand, it is the duty of the State, either in this Bill or otherwise, to make provision for the unemployed. Therefore there can be no justification for this provision which seeks to induce healthy, able-bodied persons to retire at 65 years.  The whole trend of all legislation in this country should be to encourage people to work as long as they are able, as long as their doctor advises them they are capable of working, and in that way make their contribution to the general pool of goods in the country, and thus contribute to the raising of the general standard of living of the entire nation.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious defect in this Bill.  It leaves out of consideration almost half the working population of the country.  I regard the health benefits and the provisions for widows and children as important and desirable but under this Bill those benefits do not apply to more than half the working population though the entire population will have to contribute towards the general taxation <Col N="220" /> in order to provide them.  That seems to me to be very unfair to the small farmer who may have to meet heavy liabilities through prolonged illness. So far as the middle classes and the small farmers are concerned I have never believed in providing them with completely free medical services but, if they or their families have to face prolonged illness or avail of specialist and institutional treatment involving heavy expense, I think then they do need some assistance.  I think the small farmer and the middle-class farmer should benefit in that respect, the middle-class farmer who pays one or two men and who has to work hard with his own brain and muscle to provide a living for himself and his family and wages for his one or two men. That man is brought under this Bill only in so far as he is registered as an employer.  He must make a fairly substantial contribution to the finances of the Bill but he cannot draw any benefit from it.  The struggling farmer who employs one man and who must pay out 3/6 per week in respect of him may have very serious commitments to meet should he or any of his family fall ill.  But he cannot turn to this Bill in such circumstances for assistance.  There is no social security for him.  In that connection, I would like to refer to the opinions of some Catholic clergymen who have considered this matter very carefully.</P>

I do not want to be side-tracked.  This is an important matter.  It is important for every section of the community.  I do not think these clergymen would have given the matter the attention they did give it if it were not so important.  They would not have set down their opinions in writing if they did not think grave principles were involved which should be considered objectively and seriously here and I take it it was mainly with the intention of ensuring that this Bill would get the consideration it deserved that they set down their opinions in regard to it.</P>
      <P>I want to quote now from <i>Rural Ireland</i>, the annual issued by Muintir na Tire.  At page 101 of last year's issue Father Phelim Ó Briain refers to a statement made by the Bishop of Clonfert.  The statement is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is strange that in an agricultural country like ours, no account is taken of agriculture except that a comparatively small number of agricultural labourers (about 70,000) is included; but the farming community generally is excluded&mdash;the community that forms our greatest industry, employs the most workers, produces the most wealth and, as a class, receives so small a fraction of the national income.  All are definitely excluded; they may not enter the scheme even if they wish.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Father Ó Briain went on to refer to the farmers' income.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Specious and quite fallacious attempts to make a case against farming in favour of some other class are completely refuted by certain elementary economic facts that should be known to everybody.  The most recent public estimate of our national income has put it at about £300,000,000.  Of this sum, only <Col N="222" /> £100,000,000 went to the agricultural community....  The last census shows the rural population to be more than 63 per cent. of the total population.  But only 31 per cent of the whole national income reaches the farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a complete answer to those who say that the farming community are so prosperous they have no need to fear social insecurity and they have no need for social security.</P>
    <P>Just before I left home this week I was speaking to a small farmer with 20 acres of land.  He has three pigs for sale and he found that the price he expected to get had been reduced by £3 per pig.  That means that there is £9 gone out of the little income that farmer hoped to derive from fattening these pigs.  There is very little social security there.</P>

This Bill is a drastic step in the direction of State control in every walk of life and over every section of the community.  It is a long step towards socialism in its simplest form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the first fundamental consideration of any Government is to respect the rights of the family.  In this Bill, certain obligations are being imposed upon a section of the community compulsorily <Col N="223" /> to pay increased contributions and the whole scheme is centralised around the old bus station or the new bus station or whatever it is in Store Street.  Why should we not have every function that could be transferred to the family, so transferred?  I have spoken to people who have studied the social question from a moral aspect and they have said that the only justification for the State coming in to make provision which ought to be made by the head of the family is that social conditions are so bad that it is impossible for him to do so.</P>

      <P>I have outlined the manner in which the Bill is bad, and I have outlined the good aspects, and I have suggested to the House the provisions which are good and which should be extended to the sections of the community who are excluded.  I instanced the case of the person who pays a worker weekly and who has to contribute insurance in respect of that man, the ordinary struggling farmer. I instanced the case of the small farmer who may have members of his family seriously ill.  There is no benefit provided for those people in this Bill.  That is the type of provision which I would like to see made more comprehensive. I also referred to people who are excluded from the Bill, people who <Col N="224" /> suffer a disability or who are incapable of working owing to injuries.  They should also benefit under this measure. In other words, I am asking that the health benefits of this Bill should be extended to all sections.</P>
      <P>I am not asking that the compulsory insurance should be extended to the small farmer.  He is never unemployed. I have never asked that he should be requested to contribute towards that. I have objected to the agricultural labourer, to the small farmer and the farmer who employs an agricultural labourer having to contribute jointly towards providing money for unemployment insurance.  In my view, unemployment is due to the incompetence of the Government and if they fail to provide full employment they should provide the money from other sources rather than impose a direct tax upon the lowly-paid worker.</P>
      <P>Since references have been made to certain matters&mdash;I think Deputy Cowan is developing certain attributes as a theologian&mdash;for his benefit I think it might be no harm to quote the words of the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan, Bishop of Clonfert.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If I were a member of a trade union consisting of men in secure and constant employment, and if I were asked to draw up a scheme for my union without considering the rights or needs of others, I would be inclined to adopt this scheme.  But if I were asked to draw up a &lsquo;national&rsquo; scheme&mdash;and this scheme is supposed to be national&mdash;I could not look upon it as a model to follow. The proposals, in my opinion, violate distributive justice in imposing burdensome taxation on the whole community to pay benefits to a new privileged class.  The trade unions themselves stand to benefit financially from the scheme.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have indicated the extent to which this Bill is founded on false principles.  I have indicated that it seeks to provide two services which it is not desirable that the ordinary worker should be compelled to pay a levy in order to finance. There are some people who suggest that those services would not involve very high expenditure.  For that reason I want to show how much of a saving could be effected if we were to delete those services.  I believe if we deleted those unnecessary and undesirable services we would not need to increase the contributions payable by the worker and his employer and we would not need to increase the State contribution; at least, we would not need to increase the contributions payable by the worker and the employer and we would not need to provide any more out of State funds than is already provided under the Bill.</P>
      <P>The services which I consider it is undesirable that the worker should be compelled to insure against are unemployment and retirement.  The retirement pension could be deleted altogether with advantage to the entire community.  It serves no useful purpose.  It is no benefit to the worker and it is an injury to the State.  I live among farm workers who would much prefer to work to 70 years and in some cases even beyond that age.</P>

      <P>There is a strong inducement offered in the Bill to workers to retire at 65, and there is an indication that this inducement may be supplemented. <Col N="226" /> There is also another aspect, and I am open to correction in this respect.  I understand when this Bill becomes law people over 65 will not be entitled to draw the health benefits that are provided.  If that is so, it is almost coercing them into accepting retirement at 65.  With regard to unemployment, I hold that that service should be financed out of State funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that the amount required would be very small provided this country were properly governed and if every man who can work was provided with work.  The sum provided in this Bill for unemployment benefit and for retirement pensions amounts to £5,150,000 out of a total of £8,800,000; that is, very much more than 50 per cent. of the money that will be extracted from the worker and his employer will be spent upon services which could, with advantage to the State, the workers and everybody concerned, be dispensed with.  Deputy M.J. O'Higgins asked whether the employment benefit should be provided out of State funds or general taxation. My contention is that, with proper local organisation and effort by all concerned, we could provide almost 100 per cent. employment for all our workers.  It is only a matter of getting down to the work.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan claimed that the State had no function in regard to employment.  The State has a very definite function in regard to employment.  That function is to provide employment without any reservation or qualification.  That was not accepted as the obligation of Government in 1911.  In 1928 or 1929 it was not accepted by Deputy McGilligan. It was not accepted until recent years. It is now generally accepted by Governments in all countries that they must undertake the function of providing employment for those who find it impossible to secure employment. If we deduct this unnecessary and undesirable expenditure from the provisions of the Bill, we can avoid the necessity for increasing the contributions made payable by the workers and the employer and it will not be necessary to add anything to the expenditure of the State so far as the services of the State are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated that I disagreed with the Bill on the ground that it makes for more intensive centralisation of all social activities in the hands of a centralised Department.  The Bill takes away many of the responsibilities which could be left in the hands of the head of the family.  It <Col N="228" /> takes away a lot of the responsibilities which could be left with great advantage to a locally constituted body such as a parish council or a parish guild. We ought to approach this question on Christian lines.  We ought to approach it on the lines indicated by people who have studied those questions from a Christian standpoint.  I believe in the philosophy that is embodied in this volume of <i>Rural Ireland</i> issued by Muintir na Tíre and in this volume of <i>Christus Rex</i> issued from Maynooth.</P>

      <P>I am not worrying about Deputy Hickey.  I have said that I understand and agree with the philosophy of Muintir na Tíre and of <i>Christus Rex.</i>  I do not want to add anything to that or to take anything from it.  I think it is a sound philosophy and one which we as a people would do well to study more closely, instead of aping the fashion of the British Socialist Party.  We often talk about the Six Counties having to keep in step with the Government in London, but we are keeping in step even to a greater extent and perhaps trying to keep a step ahead occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be well to ask where we are going, in what direction we are going. It would be well to ask where is the terminus, where is the end of the journey.  Is it not a complete <Col N="230" /> Socialistic State, in which everybody is eating out of the Government's hands, in which the Government supplies everything to everybody and takes everything they have from them, or, rather, takes before giving because no Government can give anything to the people but what it takes from them?  We ought not to allow ourselves to be rushed headlong into this measure of so-called social security&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which provides no social security and no security of any kind for a large section, which excludes a large section from the operation of one or two provisions which are good and which, on the other hand, compels ordinary workers to make a substantial contribution out of their week's wages, which levies a tax on them, because there is no difference whatever between the weekly contribution which is compulsory and the contribution he pays through taxes.  It is collected compulsory and for that reason one may put it in the same category as any other tax.  We are asked not to give this Bill careful and deliberate consideration and not to pay any attention to clergy or such people, outsiders, who are not politicians. We are not to give their views any consideration whatever and we are asked to vote blindly for this Bill and to rush our country blindly into a system of so-called social security from which it will be difficult to retrace our steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated that the one justification which one clergyman with whom I discussed the Bill offered was that, if a large section of our people are poor, the State must come to their assistance.  If that is the justification for the Bill, it would be a justification only for a temporary measure, but this is a permanent measure.  Take the case of the boy of 16 who has left school.  Week by week, a sum of 3/6 is collected from him for the remainder of his life and that contribution is collected from him on the understanding that he will be provided with the dole, if he happens to be unemployed. <Col N="231" /> That is a situation of which I cannot approve.</P>
    <P>We would do well to advance cautiously in regard to this measure. We could very easily provide for a bettering of the health benefits and the benefits for widows and orphans. That, I think, is the greatest hazard the ordinary man in weekly employment has to face&mdash;the hazard of sickness and death, leaving his dependents unprovided for&mdash;and I would be in favour of these benefits being increased to the extent to which they are increased in the Bill, but, so far as the other services are concerned, I am against them.</P>

I have indicated the lines on which a Bill would be acceptable.  I have indicated that improved health benefits and improved pensions for widows and allowances for orphans would be desirable.

I have indicated also that I would make an exception in that respect, if the Tánaiste were prepared to include workmen's compensation. In that case, the former employer would be prepared to pay a higher contribution than he is paying at present.  These are the suggestions I put up and I say that, because of its many faults which far outweigh its benefits, the Bill is one which ought to be condemned and the Tánaiste for that reason ought to be advised, and, if necessary, compelled to withdraw the Bill and to introduce a measure more acceptable to the House and to the people.</P>

If there were nothing else to arouse my opposition to it than the way in which it was introduced, that would be quite sufficient for me.  One would think from the furore that took place over there that this was the first time this country had heard of social security, social welfare or social insurance and, according to the speeches which were delivered, by Labour Deputies especially, one would think that the Fianna Fáil Government never did anything for the poor, the needy and the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>If I would be allowed to proceed, I would say it was dishonest procedure on the part of the Government to come in here with a Bill of this description without a single word about an increase in old age pensions in it and, when they found that there were certain members on their own benches who were in danger of voting against the measure and defeating it, they came along then with the afterthought of an increase of 2/6 in the old age pensions, for, I submit, it was only an afterthought.</P>
      <P>Of course, any intelligent man looking at this, any man outside watching the procedure here, could see that, that it is only as a matter of expediency that the Minister and the Government are now promising 2/6 increase in the old age pension.  Why was not the section inserted in the Bill the first day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the Government had ample time to consider <Col N="236" /> it.  The fact of the matter is that they had no intention whatever of doing it until they found that there was a possibility, and more than a possibility, a certainty, that certain members on whose support they counted would vote against this Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, as it is called.  Why do they call it the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill? Because No. 1 Bill had to be relegated to the waste-paper basket for the reason that I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I was intrigued to hear Deputy Collins speaking on this Bill.  I always like to hear him.  Frequently he makes useful contributions to the debates but, having regard to his Party and his Party's past history, I thought he was inclined to be a bit over-enthusiastic about it.  He said he would have no objection or no hesitation to go down to his constituency and stand over this measure.  Deputy Sweetman also spoke from the Fine Gael benches.  They are the only two Deputies who have spoken so far from the Fine Gael benches.</P>

      <P>We have not seen the manifesto.  I should like to see a copy of it even now, to ascertain what the social policy of the Fine Gael Party was in 1937.  In any case, any thinking man must come to the conclusion, even if they had a social insurance or a social welfare scheme in their election manifesto in 1937 and forgot about it in the succeeding general elections, that they were not very much concerned about it.  That is why I say that the concern and enthusiasm displayed by the few speakers from the Fine Gael benches within the past couple of days seem very unreal.  The funny thing about this measure is that nobody seems to be in a position to tell us what its full implementation is going to cost the country.  The Minister mentioned some figure.</P>

Deputy Flynn, like myself, represents a good many small industrious farmers in Kerry and naturally I was interested to observe that there was one Government Deputy going to stand on his feet to champion the cause of these small farmers by insisting that the small farmers of the country would not be forgotten in any measure put through this House.

      <P>I, like other speakers, deprecate the idea of discouraging people from work after the age of 65, because I know very well that people at the age of 65, especially in rural Ireland, are almost as good at that age as they were at any time.  Many of them at that age are better able to work than people who are 30 years younger.  While the Minister and other speakers opposite may say that there is nothing in this Bill to prevent a man from working after he reaches the age of 65, still is it not only natural to expect that, when there are certain benefits provided by the State; when there are certain benefits made available by the State to people when they reach the age of 65, the temptation will be there for those people to give up work and accept the benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>But that could be carried too far, especially when we have regard to the fact that the span of life is longer now than it was 30 or 40 years ago.  In fact, I would venture to say that the span of life, since the first Old Age Pensions Act was passed in 1908, is at least five years more than it was then because of increased hospitalisation and increased medical services and so on.  Therefore, I do not think that any case can be made for this clause in the Bill, a clause which, I should say, virtually provides for the retirement of people from work at the age of 65, when as other speakers have said, every able-bodied person should be engaged not only in production but in increased production.  We hear a lot about increased production, especially <Col N="242" /> from the land.  I, at any rate, do not think that this clause in the Bill will make for increased production.</P>
      <P>We were discussing recently the deficit in the balance of payments, and we discovered that in 1950 that deficit amounted to £30,000,000.  What is the only way in which we can rectify that position?  The only way is to stimulate production.</P>

It is over £10 a year and, of course, the employer&mdash;whatever type of an employer he may be, whether a farmer or an employer in the cities and towns <Col N="245" />&mdash;will have to clap down another £10.

      <P>I have listened to the case that has been made by Fianna Fáil against this Bill.  It is a typical case.  It is a very old dodge to oppose a Bill such as this on the grounds that it is not good enough, that it does not produce adequate benefits and, at the same time, that it is too costly.  Many of us are familiar with that state of mind.  It is a typical Fianna Fáil approach.  We had it during the 16 years that Fianna Fáil were in office. When we endeavoured to get increases in wages for road workers we were told: &ldquo;You cannot do it; it would seriously upset agricultural workers&rdquo;, and when we tried to get an increase in wages for agricultural workers we were told: &ldquo;You cannot do it because it would upset the balance between agricultural workers and local authority workers.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing, however, in an introductory way the mentality behind Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil established the Department of Social Welfare and Deputy Dr. Ryan was sent there as Minister to prepare a comprehensive social welfare scheme. Deputy Ryan spent a considerable time warning the House and the country that the implementation of that scheme would mean increased contributions from the workers.  That was his message.  All the time he was preparing the people for the fact that if a Social Welfare Bill were introduced workers and employers would have to contribute more.  Now the Deputy has somersaulted and says that we do not need any increase in contributions but can raise the necessary funds by taxation. What does that show to me? It shows a Party that is dishonest.  It shows a Party which knows, which must know, that it will not assume the responsibility of office again; it shows a Party in defeat attempting to gain the few miserable votes that will keep some of them in Parliament after the next election.  That is the total reason <Col N="247" /> for that somersault.  Deputy Childers is here.  He is a Deputy who, speaking in the country, holds himself out as a responsible individual who faces realities when nobody else does and I am quite sure that when he gave his consent to a scheme such as Deputy Ryan has proposed he knows that Fianna Fáil has gone the way of all flesh.</P>

But what has he been doing in regard to this Bill during the last three years? Since the Minister took responsibility for the Department Deputy Lemass has been demanding the White Paper, the White Paper, the White Paper. When he got the White Paper he wanted to know when we were going to get the Bill, when we would see it, when it would be circulated and when it would get its Second Reading.  He had been twitting the Government on social welfare for the last three years and endeavoured to get all the political assistance he could out of the fact that the Bill was not introduced earlier.  Now that a concrete measure is before him, he, astute politician that he is, sees the danger to Fianna Fáil in the Bill, and says: &ldquo;Withdraw it; let us get around a table and talk about it.&rdquo;  He made no such suggestion for the past three years, but now when he sees it is about to become law in spite of his Party he wants us to have a chat about it.  The mentality there is that nothing is right unless Fianna Fáil does it.</P>

    <P>I heard Deputy Kissane this evening talking about some of the social <Col N="248" /> welfare schemes introduced by Fianna Fáil, and he instanced children's allowances.

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was 1943. Deputy Kissane and other Deputies say it is wrong to give a retiring allowance to a man of 65 who has worked probably 50 years.  That is the Party that introduced here and passed into law legislation to give £500 a year pension to Ministers of the Government after a few years in office.  Fianna Fáil gave £10 a week to a man after a few years in office as a Minister, yet they say it is wrong to give a retirement allowance of 24/- to a worker in the rural areas or in the city who has worked and sweated over a period of 50 years. Where is the honesty about that sort of thing?  I want to know from Deputy Childers or from anybody else in Fianna Fáil where the honesty is in that.  &ldquo;Political blackmail&rdquo; are the words used by Deputy Kissane; it was political blackmail, he said, for the Minister to provide that old age pensioners would get £1 a week, that the means test would be substantially modified, that those who were in receipt of special allowances under the I.R.A. Acts or pensions for army disability might receive the total old age pension of £1.</P>

That is what they said they would do and over every dead wall in the country they published a list of honourable men who had served this country honestly and they headed it &ldquo;The roll of honour.&rdquo;  What was that roll?  It was a list of men who had received pensions from the then Government for services to this State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan comes in here and says we must be concerned with Christian principles. In other words, the suggestion is that in this Parliament in a Christian State Deputy Cogan is the leader of Christianity.  He says it is wrong to bring in this Bill on Christian principles, as it has been condemned by Christian philosophers.  Deputy Kissane, while complimenting him on his speech and very sensibly declaring he did not agree with him on a number of points, made some reference to the discussion that has gone on in the country in regard to this Bill.  The whole principle of social welfare has been condemned by certain individuals. As far as this House and this Parliament is concerned, I am glad to see that Fianna Fáil adopt the same line as the Minister and the Government, that there is nothing unchristian in the Bill.  If we have the Government side and the Fianna Fáil side both agreeing that there is nothing in conflict with Christian morals in it, it is impertinence on the part of Deputy Cogan to say that we are not dealing with the matter on Christian lines.</P>
      <P>I have read a lot of the criticisms.  I was at home one evening when I was approached by a couple of young ladies and I was asked to oppose this Bill, as a Catholic.  I was told it was unchristian and entirely wrong.  I asked a few questions about it.  I wanted to know if it was wrong to have the old age pensions for so many years, to have unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, and national health insurance benefits. Apparently there was nothing wrong in having those things, but when you brought them into a comprehensive scheme, when you administered them in one Department under one Minister, apparently there was something wrong. Those two ladies said to me, after I discussed it with them: &ldquo;Oh, you are too clever for us, but we will give you a document which we hope will convince you as a Catholic that you must vote against the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document they gave me was <Col N="252" /> this: <i>The Principles Against State Welfare Schemes</i>, by the Rev. E.J. Hegarty, D.D., M.A., B.Ph., H.Dip. in Ed., Cork.  I was interested and I read that document.  I found in it declarations that seemed to me entirely unchristian&mdash;but it is not for me to say that they are.  I explained to those ladies that in matters of religion I would be guided and directed by the declarations, statements and advice that might be given by persons in authority in the Catholic Church, and that as far as I was concerned it was entirely a matter for the Archbishop of Dublin to say that that was a Bill which was in conflict with Christian principles, but nobody else had any such right so to direct me.  When I read this document I came to the conclusion that it was written by a person who was not in very close touch with realities.  I came to the further conclusion that, instead of being a document of authority, it was a political pamphlet, and I use the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; in its broadest and widest sense&mdash;not a Party political, but a definite political document. One of the statements in this document is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tenants of corporation houses are known to saw the rafters off the roof for convenient fuel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A statement such as that ought not to be made because it is untrue.  It certainly ought not to be made by the Rev. E.J. Hegarty.  He also says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Local schemes for giving allotments and seeds are a dismal failure. The &lsquo;Dole&rsquo; keeps 40,000 to 60,000 idle at a time when works of national importance are hindered by labour shortage.  Those receiving State assistance often spend more actual money on amusements and luxuries than many farming or professional people could afford&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That is written by the Rev. E.J. <Col N="253" /> Hegarty as a condemnation of State welfare schemes.  I say that the Rev. E.J. Hegarty ought to be ashamed of himself, and I make no apology to anybody for saying it.

      <P>I am sure you do. The reverend gentleman referred to the National Health Insurance Society and the taking over of that society by the State under recent legislation. Here is how he describes it:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It can well be compared to the Tudor suppression of guilds, etc., and is even accompanied by a corresponding looting of funds (£6,750,000 national health assets are &lsquo;transferred&rsquo; (!) to the Department of Social Welfare).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The action of this House in transferring funds, as would have been done no matter what Government was in office here, is described by the reverend gentleman as a looting of funds, and that is the individual who is held up here by Deputy Cogan as a person from whom we ought to take authoritative reasoning.

      <P>Then he talks about &ldquo;the Chosen Ones&rdquo;.  The workers who have been successful in organising themselves into trade unions are the &ldquo;Chosen Ones&rdquo;.  I agree there are some of our workers who are not yet members of trade unions, though I think they ought to be members of trade unions.  I would like to see all our workers in trade unions.  But they are the chosen ones, the trade unions. I cannot help coming to the conclusion that this form of attack has been used in connection with this Social Welfare Bill because the Bill has been introduced by a Labour leader.  That is why I say I consider this to be a political document.  &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; the reverend gentleman says&mdash;and I think this has been quoted already in the debate&mdash;&ldquo;why ought people to bother with any form of marriage at all if the State will care for them from the cradle to the grave?&rdquo;&mdash;is not that a reflection on our community?&mdash;&ldquo;by maternity benefits, children's allowances, public housing, free education, free medical attention, vouchers for food and clothing and fuel, free dole for the idle, finally a life-pension, a grant at death, and pensions for widows and orphans?  If we have all these,&rdquo; he says&mdash;and we have some of them at the moment and we shall have more of them when this Bill is passed into law&mdash;&ldquo;why bother with any form of marriage at all?&rdquo;  Then he says: &ldquo;There is much sober truth in the paradox that we have as much right to free love as to free spectacles.&rdquo; That is the sort of document that has ben circulated throughout this country in condemnation of the principles of social security.  I would not object so much if that document had been written by a professed politician or a professed sociologist; but when it is written by a clergyman, when it is supposed to carry on it an <i>imprimatur</i> and when it is circulated by religious organisations, then I think it ought to be condemned here and throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Dr. O'Hegarty, or anybody else, <Col N="256" /> wants to enter into political discussions in relation to social welfare he is perfectly entitled to do so, but he is not entitled to do so under the cloak of an <i>imprimatur</i> and through the medium of certain organisations which believe that they are doing a Christian duty in circulating such a document. Dr. O'Hegarty condemns the White Paper.  &ldquo;It goes the further logical step,&rdquo; he says, admitting that &ldquo;schemes of social insurance and assistance ... are, in effect, a redistribution of the national income,&rdquo; and then he asks the question: &ldquo;Who gave the State this authority?&rdquo;  Who gave the State authority to redistribute the national income?  That is the question Dr. O'Hegarty asks.  Professor Ó Briain complained that the national income is not properly redistributed. Dr. O'Hegarty wants to know what right has Parliament to redistribute it. I think Parliament has every right to redistribute it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed my opinion in condemnation of this political document.  Some of the allegations in it are an improper censure on our Catholic people, on the ordinary citizens of our country.  These references to the mother's pint and to the cutting-down of the rafters in the houses for firewood would be bitterly resented had they been made by an enemy; I condemn them when they are made by an alleged friend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that <i>Rerum Novarum</i> and <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> have not been mentioned here.  They have been in existence for a long time.  Both have laid down the models which the Christian State should follow.  It is significant that while we praise the theories in these excellent documents we find great difficulty in applying them in practice in our own State. <i>Rerum Novarum</i> and <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> have been in existence for many years.  What attempt has been made to model this State on the lines set out in those documents?  None whatsoever. But when we try to bring in this social welfare scheme, when we try to abolish poverty and misery and <Col N="257" /> hunger, when we try to give a new life to many of our citizens, when we try to give them the security to which they are entitled we are immediately told we must not do that but we must rather try to put into practice Christian principles.  I have yet to learn that it is a Christian principle to allow people to go hungry, to allow them to be without shelter, to allow them to live in poverty; no one has ever taught me that that was a Christian philosophy or that they were Christian principles.  I do not believe they are Christian principles and I do not believe it is a Christian philosophy. In any effort this Parliament makes to abolish poverty and want and misery and insecurity they are doing a Christian duty.</P>
    <P>Every Party here has said at one election after another that we must bring our social welfare schemes up to the level of the social welfare schemes in the Six Counties and in Great Britain.  Every Party said that was a sound practical step towards the ultimate abolition of Partition.  I think that is a very sound view.  Our Catholic colleagues in the Six Counties have been living under a social security scheme for a number of years.  Our Catholic colleagues in Great Britain have been enjoying the benefits of a social security scheme for a number of years. I would like to meet the individual who, because they are enjoying the benefits of a social security scheme, would suggest to them that they are living in sin.  I would like to meet the individual who would suggest to them that they ought to give up these benefits, that they were immoral and wrong and contrary to their principles and philosophy.  But that sort of malicious propaganda can be used down here; it can be used down here for political purposes against the Minister and against trade unionism.</P>
    <P>This Bill, when it becomes law, will bring us closer to the social security schemes in both Great Britain and the Six Counties and it will help to narrow the gap that divides us from them in matters of social welfare.  It does not go as far as I would like it to go.  It probably does not go as far as the Minister would like it to go but, in <Col N="258" /> present circumstances, it is a solid attempt to create a sound foundation upon which we can build the finished edifice of social security and social welfare.  I much prefer the bird in hand to the bird in the bush.  I much prefer the bird that the Minister gives us here in this Bill to the bird that is flying around the Fianna Fáil bush and that may never be trapped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want, and that is why I want this social security scheme passed.  This is not the last Social Security Bill or Social Welfare Bill that will be passed; clearly, it is not the last, and there will be many more of them passed. But we must start off with a solid foundation.  There is this solid foundation, and I think it is a wise foundation&mdash;the solid foundation of contributions. When the worker contributes to social welfare, when he pays his 3/6 a week into that fund, an increase of 1/7 over what he was paying, he is contributing to a fund to which he has a moral right, a fund which must pay out the benefits that he pays his contributions for; he is not at the mercy of future Ministers for Finance who may, for Budget purposes, reduce those benefits.  By the system of contributions, we are putting the worker in the position of being able to say: &ldquo;I am contributing well to that fund; I am entitled to those benefits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No politician, no matter what his political views may be, no Minister for Finance, can disturb or interfere with those important benefits.  I will not go over them in great detail, but those benefits that are enshrined in the Bill are better than Deputy Dr. Ryan could give us through an insurance company. Deputy Kissane said that an insurance company could give greater benefits.  I am quite certain Deputy Dr. Ryan has had this matter examined, and very closely examined, because he has facilities for examination and, taking it that people are going into this scheme irrespective of their state of health or age at the time they go in, I am quite certain that Deputy Dr. Ryan has been advised that no insurance company in this country, on the same contributions, <Col N="259" /> could give the benefits that are laid down in this measure.  If he has got an opinion from an actuary to the contrary, I defy him to produce that opinion to this House or to the public.</P>
    <P>This is a good scheme and Deputy Dr. Ryan knows it is a good scheme. It is a scheme that will be of advantage to many thousands of our people. It will drive away the spectre of hunger and misery.  We have had too much of that hunger and misery in this country for the past 25, 28 or more years.  I do not mind what hunger was in this country before we got control of our own affairs, but it has been a lasting disgrace to the country, a lasting condemnation of the representatives of the people, that we should have had hunger and misery during the past 29 or 30 years when we had control of our own affairs.</P>
    <P>The moralists will say: &ldquo;You are asking the farmer to contribute something and he may not get benefit out of it.&rdquo;  That is a new one.  The political moralists are now saying that it is unfair to ask the farmers to contribute through taxation to this scheme because they may get no benefits out of it.  This Parliament has been giving to the farming community in the past 25 or 30 years very substantial sums, amounting to millions. The farming community has been getting that from the taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know quite how to begin to refute some of the nonsense talked by Deputy Cowan about Fianna Fáil, but I suppose I might start by saying that for the last 25 years we have preached in Fianna Fáil the conception of a progressive advance in social security measures. We started ourselves about half the social insurance schemes of this country.  We extended them gradually and we have always adopted the point of view that if associations of producers and manufacturers or workers were unable or unwilling to insure themselves voluntarily against the different risks that occur in people's lives the State would have to do it. That has always been the policy of Fianna Fáil and, so far as I know, it always will be.</P>
      <P>A great many of us regret that we did not secure independence at a sufficiently early date so that we could progress by the voluntary method as, for example, in the case of Denmark, where a great many of the social security schemes were started and promoted by co-operative societies, where people began by coming together in districts and insuring themselves against old age, sickness and disease.  The principle gradually grew and the services increased until the State found it necessary to ensure a universal standard of efficiency, and found it necessary to provide a contribution for these societies.  Unfortunately we only secured independence partially in 1921, and it was necessary for us to catch up, so to speak, on time that had been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> I wish to reiterate that Fianna Fáil has always stood for the principle of social security.  That does not mean that we cannot criticise freely any Bill that is placed before us in this House. That does not mean that we are not in a position to say that you are spending too much on one particular service and too little on another.  It is perfectly legitimate for us in Fianna Fáil to question the whole of the Social Security Bill on the grounds that the Government is increasing expenditure so wildly and with such an absolute lack of plan that the effect of expenditure on social security instead of being to help the worker might simply be to increase inflation and raise the cost of living by the mere fact that it threw another few millions a year into circulation on top of an already unbalanced Budget. that does not mean that we are opposed to the idea of social security.</P>
    <P>When you have, first of all, the Social Security Bill, and then the offer of increased old age pensions&mdash;I might add, one of the lowest political bribes made in the history of this country in order to maintain the votes of certain individuals&mdash;plus an unknown amount for medical services, plus an unbalanced Budget of about £7,000,000, plus all the other plans they may have in mind so long as they can keep in office, we have a perfect right to say what we think about it.</P>
    <P>I suppose we may have to repeat again for the hundredth time in this House what we did do about social services because Deputy Cowan talks about this Social Security Bill as though it were the first step in the history of the country to counteract poverty, as though poverty has never been fought before.  He talked as though it was the first step to implement the Papal encyclicals.  Such appalling ridiculous nonsense.  For 16 years Fianna Fáil was in office, and in every year of its existence it passed measures in this House which had the general effect of implementing what might be described as a broadminded middle path interpretation of the encyclicals.</P>
    <P>We started widows' and orphans' pensions.  We started unemployment assistance.  We initiated children's <Col N="263" /> allowances.  We initiated wet-time insurance.  We increased widows' and orphans' pensions twice during our period of office.  We increased old age pensions twice during our period of office.  We increased unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance twice during our period of office and we also improved the national health insurance code and increased the benefits in it twice also.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan, in the course of his speech, made an attack on a leaflet written by a clergyman against this Bill.  I think that one of the most interesting and stimulating things in this country is the fact that you can read leaflets on the subject of social welfare written by clergymen of a number of denominations giving their individual points of view with regard to a social problem.  I see no reason why they should not do it.</P>
      <P>It is a little ridiculous for Deputy Cowan to suggest that when the word &ldquo;<i>imprimatur</i>&rdquo; was written on the front cover it was supposed to mean it was infallible.  We all know that was a perfectly ridiculous suggestion and that was the idea that Deputy Cowan tried to convey.  As I have said, it is a very interesting thing to have stimulating conversations and discussions on this question written by people who have regard to religious doctrine. The more we have of it the better so long as everybody understands that there are various interpretations of these things.</P>
      <P>I might add, too, that while Deputy Cowan made this attack on this clergyman who chose to oppose the Security Bill, he did not mention the fact that two of the principal leaders of Fine Gael, in speeches made since this Government came into office, indicated that they agreed substantially with every word written by that clergyman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest that the Taoiseach directly approved of the pamphlet written by the clergyman in question.  What I do say is the view he expressed that social services could be regarded in the nature of medicines coincided to a considerable degree with the general view expressed by the clergyman.  I did not say he gave it his specific blessing.</P>
      <P>I now have the actual quotation and maybe it is just as well to read it to the House to indicate how far prominent Ministers of Fine Gael are prepared to sacrifice their own point of view in order to maintain a Government in office.  Speaking on 13th May, 1947, at column 73 of the Official Debates, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Money is wanted for social services. That is the justification for all the extravagances that have been perpetrated and inflicted upon this country by Government profligacy in the last six or seven years.  ... The existence of social services is an indication of ill-health in the body politic.  In any case, as has been said, they are nothing more than a <Col N="265" /> row of medicine bottle showing disease in the household.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the point of view of Fianna Fáil.  We have never had any objection to the idea that if associations of men and women of the various professions are unwilling to collect amongst themselves the amount required to provide for the expenses and difficulties of life, the State can come in, and, by way of contributions from workers, by way of State taxation and contributions from employers, redistribute a portion of the national income and, in fact, effect compulsory saving.  That is what this Bill does and what Deputy Ryan's proposals do. They both compel people to save for themselves against disaster and against the difficult circumstances of life.  It is a compulsory saving Bill and it is just as well that we stopped a lot of the claptrap being talked about it, as though the money were coming from nowhere, as though the people were not paying for it.  Like all other measures of social security, it is compulsory saving and nothing else, and people are being made to save in spite of themselves by this Bill.  The rich pay a little more than the poor in the way of saving, but the vast majority of the people will be paying for the vast proportion of the cost of these services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan suggested that the Fianna Fáil Party, because of its attitude towards the Bill was showing signs of defeat.  I am quite agreeable to accept his challenge.  I would not mind if we went to the country and had a general election, and even if we went so far as to say that we will postpone the Social Security Bill for one year until we can see if we can find enough money to put this country into a state of preparedness in view of the present emergency.  If we put that to the people of the country, I am absolutely certain that we would gain an over-all majority and I would not be in the least afraid of accepting the challenge on that basis.  That is my answer to Deputy Cowan when he suggests that we are a Party in defeat.</P>
    <P>So far as the details of the Bill are concerned, I want to refer in particular to the absence of any improvement <Col N="266" /> in the children's allowances and to the fact that they are included in the scheme put forward by Deputy Ryan. I am becoming a little ashamed of the degree to which we exploit the old people of this country in order to get votes.  I am tired of all the talk that is carried on with a view to attracting the votes of 158,000 old age pensioners and I believe that the vast majority of these old age pensioners are not going to accept any bribe offered to them. I am tired of hearing so much talk about the old age pensioners, who represent 5.26 per cent. of the whole population, or one in 20, and so little talk about the children of the country who have no votes and about whom one cannot arouse the same popular political clamour.</P>
    <P>I might add that when Deputy Cowan suggests that the 1944 election was fought on the subject of children's allowances, he was talking the most arrant nonsense.  Everyone who remembers the 1944 election knows that it was fought on a number of general issues and that children's allowances were scarcely mentioned in it.  On very few occasions did Fianna Fáil specifically offer a particular social service on the eve of an election.  Most of the great social services we instituted were either scarcely mentioned in our election programme or instituted during the period in between elections as was the case with widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>I think it is time we talked a little more about children in this country. We hear a great deal of talk throughout the country about old age pensioners and about the great increase being offered by this Government, but we hear no reference to the fact that the previous Government twice increased old age pensions and we hear still less reference to a far more important subject, the whole question of the support to be given to people with large families.  We hear everywhere about old age pensioners getting a half-crown more a week, but we hear very little about the dull and nonpolitical national nutritional survey prepared by a group of experts and presented by the present Government and with absolutely no contentious or <Col N="267" /> adverse criticism by the present Minister for Health, the implication being that there is nothing wrong in the reports, nothing which need be criticised and that the information in them is correct.  This kind of stuff is dull and does not draw votes, but in it lies a clue to the solution of a great deal of the problem of poverty in this country.</P>
    <P>Every one of these five reports shows that if there is any real grinding poverty left in this community, if there are any adverse circumstances affecting people's lives which require attention, it is in the case of families of four, five and more children.  These five reports are full of dull statistics but these statistics are fundamental. They may be dull but they deal with the amount and kind of food eaten by people of various grades of society, of every grade of society, according to the size of the family.  They show beyond all doubt that there is too little spent on food in numerous families among the working people; they show beyond all doubt that there are far too many bread-and-spread meals amongst workers' families, small farmers' families, congested district farmers' families and agricultural workers' families, where there are four and more children.  They show also that in many large families there is a great and serious deficiency of certain kinds of vitamins and foods.  They show that workers who have large families provide a monotonous and deadly diet for their children, try as they will to produce the best they can for them.</P>
    <P>Every one of these reports shows that No. 1 upon the programme of the Minister for Social Welfare should have been an increase in children's allowances.  There is not the faintest evidence that there is the same condition of poverty or strain of existence in workers' families where there are only one, two or three children.  They have their difficulties.  The cost of living is very high, but the real core of the problem is among the persons with large families.  I want to give it as my private point of view that again I think it is a great pity we were not an independent nation a long time ago, because in relation to a country like ours, where families are large and <Col N="268" /> marriages are late, if ever there was a case for all trade union wages being based on the size of the family, it exists in this country.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that it would be asking an enormous amount of both employers and trade unions to reorganise the wage structure of the country so that people would be paid, as they are in certain continental countries, on the basis of the number of persons in their family and their marital state.  I know well it would be extremely difficult to work out the whole problem of ensuring that there would be no discrimination against married workers and workers with large families by employers.  I am not asking trade unionists to do it, because I realise it is an almost insuperable problem; but the only alternative to it is a gift by the people with no family and with small families and by the unmarried people to the people with large families.  There is no other solution of the problem of the poverty of the worker with a large family, and my criticism of this Bill to-night is that it does not provide sufficiently or, in fact, in any way, for an increased scale of children's allowances.  I am not ashamed and not in the least afraid to say, putting it this way, that I do not want particularly to see £1,000,000 spent on increased old age pensions unless, before that happens, a certain amount of money is spent on increased children's allowances, and if it is decided that we can afford increased children's allowances, I am prepared to agree that, with the present cost of living and under present circumstances, it is a good thing to increase old age pensions by another 2/6 per week but, as I have said, to my mind, the whole question of children's allowances should be considered.</P>
    <P>To my mind also there is very great need for an extension of child welfare in the City of Dublin.  There is very great need for an extension of child welfare of every kind by contributions to voluntary societies and, if necessary, to societies to some degree stimulated by the State for looking after the children of large families in Dublin.  A great deal of the poverty <Col N="269" /> and a great deal of the mortality of which Dr. Browne, the Minister for Health, has spoken exists because of the difficulties of mothers in looking after large families, particularly when the family is increasing or about to increase in numbers, and the Minister for Health's scheme, which forms the subject for another discussion, does nothing to deal with that social difficulty. It is dealt with partly by charitable societies and by the conventual orders.  It is not dealt with sufficiently.  It still exists, and it all adds to my argument that the children in large families deserve the first consideration of the Government, before anyone else.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary for me to quote from this report. Not half enough about it has been spoken in the country in general.  I do not know whether it is necessary for me to read the figures, in order that they should be recorded in the House, in connection with the differences in expenditure by people with large families and by people with small families.  Some of the information is very interesting and it seems to me that it should receive far more study from members of the House.  For example, I take the dietary survey of the farm workers' families and I deal with table 4 (b)&mdash;the average expenditure per diet head weekly on food in 177 farm workers' families, classified according to the number of persons in the family&mdash;and I find that the total amount spent on food per diet head in the case of a family without children, per week, is 19/6; the total amount spent per head in a family of eight, nine, ten or eleven persons is 10/1, which is just about 50 per cent. less. If anybody tells me that there is not need for readjustment of the children's allowances, in face of that simple statement that in farm workers' families where there is a large number of children there is spent about onehalf of that which is spent by a man and his wife without children, I should like to hear the criticisms of the suggestion that more should be done.</P>
    <P>In the summary of the Report on the National Nutrition Survey, the following paragraph occurs&mdash;No. 2, on page 11:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" />&ldquo;The consumption of meat, milk, eggs, vegetables and fruit increased consistently as income increased, and decreased with almost equal consistency as the number of persons in the family increased....</P>
    <P>Milk consumption at 5.1 pints per head per week was low for a rural survey; the figure in Dublin City was 4.8 pints and in farming families was 9.2 pints.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, agricultural workers with large families were drinking half the milk of the farmers living around them and were drinking very little more milk than persons living in Dublin City.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take the time of the House by repeating the main conclusions of these reports but they go to indicate what I said before that children's allowances deserve the first consideration of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in connection with this Bill, what he thinks will be the social effect of the provision in the Bill whereby a farm of under £30 valuation can be assigned without any conditions being attached thereto.  I should like to ask him whether he thinks it will encourage the settlement of the farm on younger people or whether he thinks it will have any adverse effect.  I should like to hear what views he has to express in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that, when the Minister decided to introduce an increase in the non-contributory old age pension of 2/6 a week, he did not reconsider the whole question of the character of the means test.  As I understand it, three-quarters of the persons of age over 70 in this country are now receiving an old age pension of some kind or another.  They amount to just over 5 per cent. of the entire population.  One in every 20 people you meet is getting an old age pension of one kind or another.  It is a very large number of people.  It seems to me there are two simple courses that should be adopted, either one of which might get over the difficulty of the means test which involves an examination of savings, an examination of the income attached to small plots in the case of cottage dwellers, <Col N="271" /> an examination of all the elements of thrift in the life of an applicant for an old age pension.  The first is, to give everybody in the community an old age pension automatically, which would cost a considerable amount of money, which does not on the whole seem fair to me; the second would be a simple valuation limit, such as has been proposed in Deputy Dr. Ryan's alternative proposals.  If three-quarters of the people over 70 years of age are entitled to draw an old age pension, is there anything socially unfair in simplifying the means test, particularly in rural districts, in making the means test depend on valuation and having, in addition to that, the question of the maximum amount of cash that can be held?  Would not it save a great deal of administrative expense and would not it save, as I have said, the continuous examination of a man's thrift in life?  Would it create any abuses?  Can the Minister for Social Welfare say in what percentage of cases there might be a very unfair refusal of an old age pension to a person because he happened to be above or below the line?  It seems to me this suggestion is well worth considering before the Bill reaches its final stages, because such a huge proportion of the older people do finally get a pension and they amount to such a large proportion of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan, in speaking on this Bill, discussed the question of unemployment.  I cannot understand Deputy Cogan's point of view that the Government must guarantee work and cannot and should not guarantee maintenance in lieu of work.  The problem that affects this country is that which affects most countries, the fact that labour is not mobile to a considerable degree.  The people will not leave their homes in many cases.  Another section of the people in the community like to leave their homes or have to leave them under compulsion.  There is a great deal of winter unemployment, while in summer in many areas it is difficult to find workers.  Workers have neither the desire nor have they the training, in many cases, to move from one occupation to another.  It struck me as <Col N="272" /> extraordinarily old-fashioned of Deputy Cogan to suggest that the Government has only a right to guarantee work and should not guarantee maintenance in lieu of work, because the Government that could provide work for the people of this country to the degree of 100 per cent. all the year round, in winter and summer, in rural and urban districts, if there was a profound depression in England and if there was absolutely no employment for workers who have been leaving this country for many years&mdash;in very large numbers under the present Government, I might add&mdash;would be a miraculous Government under the circumstances. There must always be some insurance provision, some assistance provision, for those who are unable to find work either temporarily or for considerable periods.  In fact, a great deal of what Deputy Cogan said struck me as being extraordinarily old-fashioned, something like what one would hear coming from the British Conservative Party about the year 1910.  He seemed to refuse to accept the general principle of a social security plan under which the Government would undertake to provide necessities for persons unable to provide for themselves.  In conclusion, I should like once more to ask the Minister to consider the alternative measures put forward by Deputy Dr. Ryan, particularly because of the fact that under these measures provision is made for increased children's allowances where families are large.</P>

      <P>The speech of Deputy Lemass here last evening gave ground for the hope that there would be a new approach to this Bill, so far as the Opposition is concerned.  The main speech from the Front Opposition Bench, at least in my hearing, since Deputy Leamss spoke was delivered by Deputy Kissane.  I must confess that I was disappointed by the speech of Deputy Kissane, coming as it did from a Deputy in a responsible position as a member of the Front Opposition Bench, because the appeal&mdash;I think it might be classed as such&mdash;of Deputy Lemass seemed to have fallen on completely deaf ears, so far as Deputy Kissane was concerned.  The speech of Deputy Kissane on this subject might be described as a purely <Col N="273" /> destructive political speech.  I was disappointed in the sense that the Deputy paid very little attention to the Bill or to those aspects of the Bill referred to in such an admirable tone by Deputy Lemass last evening.  I had hoped that if Deputy Lemass were to succeed in convincing his colleagues along the lines which he indicated last night, it might best be reflected in the vote of our friends on the Left, were they to allow the Second Reading of this measure to go through unanimously and then apply themselves to whatever improvements might be effected in the normal course of the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute also to the manner in which Deputy Dr. Ryan made his contribution to the debate on this Bill prior to the Recess.  I should say that it was admirable in tone and, from his point of view, in content as well.  Notwithstanding that he was obviously at a disadvantage in not having at his disposal official resources, he evidently gave considerable thought to the proposals he outlined.  Deputy Dr. Ryan rendered one extremely valuable service to the promoters of the Bill.  He removed once and for all the impression that was being sedulously fostered outside that this Government, and this Government only, were responsible for fastening on the shoulders of the community an unwanted Bill, not only an unwanted Bill but a Bill that might be harmful in many directions.  We have heard since these proposals were first promulgated, criticisms and references to such well-known phrases as the &ldquo;Welfare State&rdquo;, &ldquo;Socialism&rdquo;, &ldquo;Totalitarianism&rdquo;, and so on.  To Deputy Dr. Ryan's credit and to Deputy Lemass's credit, may I say that they made no attempt whatever to cash-in on the particular atmosphere that was being created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service that Deputy Dr. Ryan rendered in my opinion was that he removed any lingering doubts there might be amongst the public outside that this was a one-sided measure; in fact he conveyed the impression that if Deputy Dr. Ryan and his Party had the opportunity all they would do would be to extend the terms of the Bill, even though the extension of its <Col N="274" /> terms might mean, and in fact would mean considerable taxation.  I think we are entitled to ask the critics outside, because so far we have not had many critics here, is there anything in this problem of social security which justifies the idea that we should have a different approach to it from any other country in the world?</P>
    <P>Social security, as I understand it, is based very largely on four factors&mdash; the hazards of old age, illness, unemployment and widowhood.  The incidence of these disabilities or these particular conditions is no less severe here than in any other country in the world.  One would imagine from the criticisms we have heard that the proposals now before the House are of an extremely revolutionary character. Indeed may I say that it was suggested in certain quarters that they are contrary to Catholic teaching.  That is completely fallacious.  This Bill is largely a co-ordinating Bill, in respect to social services existing under certain categories at the present time.  I am prepared to admit, and I am proud to admit, one revolutionary change, one that we as members of the Labour Party particularly hail with pleasure&mdash; the provision at long last of a retirement pension at the age of 65.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is provision of a kind for old age.  This Bill proposes to improve the provision in two ways, along the lines of a contributory retirement pension at 65 and, at the non-contributory end, to increase the old age pension up to £1 per week.  There is also an improvement in the position of the man who is stricken down with illness.  Be it said that up to the present the only provision, in this year of grace, 1951, for a man who falls ill is that made under the National Health Insurance of 22/6 per week, irrespective of the number of dependents he may have. The worst feature of that provision is the fact that after six months of illness the law at present provides that the man's benefit drops to 15/- a week. That position is being improved under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the standardisation which is taking place in the Bill, a standardisation of a welcome character, the <Col N="275" /> benefit is increased to 24/- a week for the man himself, 12/- for his wife and 7/- for two dependent children.  May I say that I think Deputy Cogan completely missed the point of the photograph which appeared in the little brochure which depicts the children in the home?  The people who prepared the brochure had obviously made up their minds that there was provision for children under the family allowances after the second child.</P>
    <P>An improvement also takes place in the case of the unemployed man.  It is precisely the same with the man who has the misfortune to be unemployed. Deputy Cogan made the point that there would be no need, or should be no need, for benefit of this particular character, and he is supported by some evidence outside the House, based on the argument that the State should make the necessary provision by way of work.  That is a delightful conception but, as a colleague of mine remarked, we are not yet living in the perfect State, and what is the unfortunate individual to do if he does not get work and no provision is made for him?  There is an improvement in the Bill in respect to unemployment benefit, which is raised from 35/- a week for a man with a wife and two children to 50/- per week under the Bill.  There is a substantial improvement, too, in the case of widows.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to be able to say that there is agreement on the left of this House on the main lines which a social security measure should take.  As outlined by Deputy Dr. Ryan the Party on my left did indicate disagreement under two main heads.  One is that in Deputy Dr. Ryan's scheme there would be no retirement pension at the age of 65.  The pension would operate only from the age of 70.  His second main contention, speaking for his Party, was that the scheme should be financed out of taxation.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes precisely a different line.  As its title indicates, it is a Bill based on the insurance principle.  It is one which, I think, will meet with the approval of this House as against the proposal in regard to taxation.  It will mean this, that a man will have <Col N="276" /> associated with his pension a sense of dignity on the one hand and of stability on the other.  He will feel a measure of independence, derived from the fact that he has made a serious contribution towards the pension which he receives. It is really only on matters of detail that there is a difference between our friends and ourselves.  There is, however, that very serious defect to which I have referred in the statement that was put forward by Deputy Ryan. His appeal for the adoption of his case was that he could bring into operation practically the same benefits as are outlined in the Bill without the addition of contributions.  The Deputy, I am sure, is not so simple as to have completely ignored the fact that this Bill, and the terms incorporated in it, are based largely on actuarial calculations. These calculations were prepared, I understand, by a very able staff, and the Bill, under the Minister's guidance, is standing the test of what they produced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, as I say, made the point that he could introduce his scheme, with some additions, but with no increased contributions.  He based his argument on the fact that he would not have to give retirement pensions until the age of 70.  On this question of retirement at 70 as against 65, Deputy Dr. Ryan made the point that the expectation of life to-day is much better than it has been over a period of years.  That is true.  It is gradually improving under better social conditions. The Deputy made the point, and there will be some who will agree with him, that people over the age of 65 are in a position to give a contribution towards the national pool and so would prefer to be in the position to earn their regular wages rather than be depending on a pension in the form of 24/- a week at that age.  But it was not just enough for the Deputy to leave it at that, to base his calculations for financing his scheme in that way because to do so was to ignore the fundamental fact that the tendency with employers over a number of years past in this country has been to lay off their employees at the age of 65.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan spoke as if men, in the ordinary course, went on earning <Col N="277" /> after they had reached the age of 65. There are members of this House who can vouch for the fact that some employers, in any case, have been only too eager to seize the opportunity of dispensing with their workers about that age.  I have had some experience of that, and I can speak on it with some little knowledge.  Over many years it was my duty to pay men in a very large concern in this city.  Speaking out of that experience, I can say that the most dreaded years in a railway man's life were the years between 65 and 70.  Men were thrown out at 65, very often on a meagre 16/a week, reducible by 10/- when they reached the age of 70, because at that stage the State took over a certain amount of the pension liability.  As I say our difference with Deputy Dr. Ryan, and it is fundamental to this Bill and to this whole question, is that in his proposals he makes no provision whatever for men when they reach the age of 65.  I personally&mdash;I do not know what my colleagues may think about it&mdash;would be prepared to say that, provided a man wanted to stay on after 65 with the consent of his employer, I would see no objection to that course&mdash;that is provided he had the protection afforded by the terms of this Bill when he retired at the age of 65.  I would see no objection to that so long as the man was protected against an employer who wanted to put him out or, on the other hand, if the man himself wanted to retire voluntarily at that age.</P>
    <P>There might be an inducement to consider that if we were discussing this Bill in a different atmosphere&mdash;that is, that so long as a man was entitled to his pension at 65, he could remain in employment with the consent of his employer for one, two or three years, as the case may be, and so save the State fund the amount of pension that he otherwise would normally take in those years.  As I say, if we were discussing the Bill in a different atmosphere, that is a suggestion which might be worth while examining, as well as the point as to whether or not he should get a bonus when he retired at, say, the age of 66 or 67 to compensate him for the years during which he had not been paid the retirement pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> Suppose he got an extra 2/6 for each year over the 65&mdash;that might prove an attractive proposition, and might be worth while considering.  All that would be subject to the basic proposition that there must be provision in the Bill for the man when he retires at the age of 65.  Having said that, may I say that the Fianna Fáil plan, in my estimation, completely crumbles at that stage.  It crumbles also on the question of finance.  Deputy Dr. Ryan's case right through was based on the fact that he could cover all this by means of taxation.  I think if he were to start with taxation to finance his proposals, he would find that the taxation would run into a figure which would probably frighten himself.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are points of agreement between us and those on the other side.  That position was possibly best expressed by Deputy Lemass, whose social outlook, generally speaking, will not be questioned. His idea was that this matter might be examined in an atmosphere which is rarely to be found in this House, in an atmosphere in which all parties might agree on an objective that was worth while achieving.  Unfortunately, we have not yet reached that stage. In my opinion, this is a good Bill.  It has been carefully drawn and its financial provisions are such as to safeguard it throughout the existence of the scheme.  There is to be a contribution from the employer, from the employee and from the State.  Some Deputies made the point that the scheme was one-sided in so far as a number of people were excluded.  May I say that it was very definitely the desire of the Minister, and I am sure all members of the House will agree on it, too, that all sections of the community who deserved to be included in it should be included, were that administratively practicable.</P>
    <P>A reference to the speech made by Deputy Dr. Ryan will show that he said that if this scheme is to be based on a contributory system then the individuals who are left out must be left out: there is no alternative.  If that be so, why, therefore, should there be any necessity for a violent opposition as between sections of this House, if that opposition will be reflected in a <Col N="279" /> close division here for or against the Bill?</P>
    <P>It has been stated in this House that the incorporation of the item of old age pensions was one which, to repeat what Deputy Kissane said, was tantamount to blackmail.  As one member of this House&mdash;the various other members may speak for themselves&mdash; I can say that since the first increase was given by this Government in 1948 we have been agitating, and we make no secret of it, that the terms of a motion which was defeated in this House in March, 1946, and which was put down by members on these benches, should be implemented at the earliest possible date.  The terms of that motion were that old age pensions should be stepped up to 22/6 a week&mdash; the figure that was operating in the Six Counties&mdash;and that income to the level of £1 per week should be excluded so far as the means test was concerned. We have not reached that objective yet but I suggest that we are on the way to meeting it.  This increase brings us very near at least that particular target except that the question of the means test is not as seriously dealt with as we should like it to be.  If there is anything that makes an appeal to the members of this House as a whole it is the question of the means test.  I hope it will be possible, as a next move and stage by the Government here, to take steps to ensure that this last barrier to that £1 a week income will be removed at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on this measure and also those who were associated with him in drawing it up.  I appeal to our friends across the way to join with us in improving the Bill in the appropriate place along the lines which they and possibly we also should like in certain respects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this measure has been introduced.  When I first heard about the intention to introduce this Bill I was wholly in favour of a further improvement in our social scheme and I indicated that I would give my wholehearted support to the measure.  Any improvement in our social welfare scheme deserves all <Col N="280" /> the support and help it can get from the members of this House.</P>
      <P>Social welfare, in general, has changed very much over a great number of years.  If the people who first drew the 5/- old age pension from the British Government could be alive to-day and see the step-up in regard to social welfare generally, and hear that this Department is getting the attention which it deserves to get, I suppose they would be very surprised. Then again there is the fact that people see social welfare in a different light nowadays.  We have heard it said that the first payments of old age pensions were looked on with suspicion and that for many years people who were genuinely entitled to receive the old age pension refused to make application for it because of the dreaded fear of the &ldquo;Saxon's shilling&rdquo; as it was called at the time.  That deterred them from availing of something to which they were genuinely entitled. However, times have moved on and we now have a native Government. Social welfare is under the care of a Department of State, and it is a responsibility which the Government, whichever Government it may be, must shoulder.  While the poor will always be with us we must make provision for them.  It is only fair that those who have should share with those who have not.  It is the duty of the Government to see that there is as equitable a distribution of the funds as possible, so as to ensure that necessitous people will get the benefits to which they are entitled.  In the past 20 years there have been many social welfare advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my remarks on this measure I should like to say that I am going to speak my own mind irrespective of whom my remarks may offend or otherwise.  My honest opinion is that the introduction of the widows' and orphans' pensions was as big a step in the right direction as any step that ever was or ever can be introduced in the line of social welfare.  That may be something in the nature of a clap on the back to the Fianna Fáil Government, which was in office at the time, but I think it should be said, in all fairness to them, that it was a good move to introduce legislation to provide <Col N="281" /> assistance for a widow to enable her to get along and to provide for her children instead of her having a continuous hand-to-mouth struggle, with poverty staring in at her through the door.</P>
    <P>As the value of money has slowly but surely decreased it is only right that the amount of money payable to widows and orphans and to old age pensioners generally should be increased. As the value of money goes down, more money is made available to them.  In that way the pensions are brought to such a standard that the people receiving them will be able to purchase to the same extent as they were able to purchase previously with the lesser amount of money which was made available some time ago.  I am glad that, under this Bill, the Minister, amongst other things, is providing for an improvement in the old age pension and that it will be increased to 20/- per week.  One of the ten points of the programme which this Government decided to implement when they came into office was to improve the old age pension.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to his desire to get the old age pension raised to 22/6 per week.  I suggest that the £1 a week is a step in the right direction and that before much longer our hopes that it will be increased to 22/6 may be realised.</P>
    <P>We know that contributory and non-contributory pensions differ very widely.  We know that it is impossible to ask any Government to provide out of taxation the same pension on a non-contributory basis as the pension which is paid on a contributory basis. Nevertheless when an effort is made to increase old age pensions I know that Deputies must find it very much against their conscience to disagree with it or oppose it in any manner whatsoever.  We know that a certain amount of political propaganda can be made&mdash;there is no use in saying that it will not&mdash;and that a certain amount of votes can be collected because of an improvement in the condition of old age pensioners.  To announce an increase in old age pensions is a great catchcry from every political platform, but no matter what political manoeuvring may be done not one should in justice oppose giving an increase in <Col N="282" /> pensions or allowances to old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>What is perhaps of greater value to old age pensioners than the increase is the modification of the means test and above all, the almost entire removal of that section of the 1908 Act which was a real barrier to many genuine applicants for the old age pension, that section which provided that when a person, on reaching the age of 70, transferred his property to his children, it was still assessed when he applied for a pension, although he did it in a genuine and honest attempt to settle his family affairs.  In this country, where the family circle is held so closely together, it is a very difficult problem, even at the age of 70, for a man or woman to settle the affairs of the family overnight.  Where a genuine honest applicant for the pension has settled his affairs by transferring to his children whatever he has saved by hard endeavour during his life he should not, at the age of 70, be deprived of a pension, but up to now that has been the case.  Deputies who from time to time must approach the Department of Social Welfare or the Minister on behalf of those people find that the sympathy of the Minister, of many officials in the Department and even of the investigating officer who investigates their means is in all cases with the old age pensioner, but nevertheless the barrier existed in this section of the 1908 Act, and no matter what good intentions were in the minds of the people concerned, the old age pensioner was left and nothing could be done for him.  Even when an appeal was made a year or two afterwards, it was found that the means he had transferred to his children were still assessed as his and neither the Department nor the Minister could do anything to help.  The removal of that barrier is a greater revolution than the advancing of the pension from 17/6 to 20/-.</P>
    <P>We know that all this advancement of pensions means extra taxation because money cannot fall like manna from the heavens and that, in itself, is a difficult problem for the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole.  They must try, on the one <Col N="283" /> hand, to hold taxation level, because everybody admits that it is going slightly beyond the bounds at the present time and, on the other hand, to make life a bit easier for the poorer classes in their struggle to exist.</P>
    <P>Increased allowances are made to persons who are contributing.  The ex-Minister for Social Welfare and even the present Minister have admitted that a genuine comprehensive social insurance scheme whereby all people in the State would benefit is something very hard to bring before the House and enforce.  When I speak on that matter I speak for quite a large percentage of the people who put me here, the self-employed industrious small farmers who never can benefit from a contributory scheme because it would be absolutely and entirely impossible to collect contributions from them.  Very often their income is not weekly; such a person may go through three or four months without a £1 note coming in on a Saturday night and then for a month or two a fairly substantial amount may come in.  Self-employed people have at least a certain amount of freedom and can say that they are under no obligation to anybody to pay any contribution to anything so as to get an allowance when they come to retiring age.  The small landowner or shopkeeper is as well able at 65 to work or supervise his business as he was ten, 15 or 20 years earlier.  Because he has that independence and freedom such a man feels that it would be unfair to ask him to pay any contribution whatsoever to any scheme.  While in all fairness to them we must admit that they are as valuable to the State as those who are employed they could not possibly benefit to the same extent as people who over a large number of years had been contributing week in week out to an insurance scheme.  I had hoped that a scheme might be considered where you would take a very low land valuation and say that irrespective of everything else the means test would be entirely abolished and that anybody with a holding of land under £10 valuation would become automatically entitled to an old age pension when he or she reached the age of 70.  That would be as revolutionary <Col N="284" /> for the countryside for the non-contributors and for the rural population as the contributors find the Bill before us to-night.</P>
    <P>All these things have to move very slowly.  Social welfare of all types has moved slowly enough in past years, yet still when we look back over a short space of time we find that it has moved rapidly, as rapidly as the country could afford.  The people who have to pay must be considered as well as those who have not to pay.  The beneficiary as well as the contributor in any social scheme must be taken into consideration, when the Government decide to introduce a measure to assist people in need.  We have some sections in the Bill for which extra demands will be made on taxpayers, ratepayers and others.  I speak for some of those who will have to pay. The ordinary local authority or county council in every county is a very large employer of men, and has on its books a larger pay roll than that of any firm or industry in the county concerned. The increased contribution of 3/6 per week, which the local authority will have to pay as its share towards the pension, must come entirely out of the rates.  Ratepayers must realise now that, if they themselves or their sons or daughters who work for the county council on road schemes, drainage schemes or in offices are to benefit by increased pension, by sickness benefits and so on, the father, or perhaps the person in the employment of the local authority, will have to pay not only his own 3/6 per week but, through the rates, the little extra which helps to meet the local authority contribution of 3/6 which must be paid every week for every single individual employed by that authority.  However, when one is balanced against the other, the ratepayers who have to meet this extra charge will not complain or grouse, because of the benefits which will accrue to those people who are employed.  There are sickness and maternity benefits which come at a time when money is most needed to help the weak and needy.</P>
    <P>At the present time we have a national health insurance scheme. Personally, I think it needs an overhaul of some kind.  To my mind, it is <Col N="285" /> at present something of a racket, as a person may be a genuine contributor for a good many years, then fall off because of unemployment and then start again as a casual worker making casual contributions and then fall off again; yet when that person is ill and applies for sickness benefit he will find that the many hundreds of contributions paid genuinely and honestly over a long number of years will be of no use to him.  They will be ruled out because there has been a lapse of a few weeks or a few months when he was unemployed.  It would be hard to expect that he could pay when he was not working.  When he was employed, if he did not pay his contributions he was guilty of an offence, he was breaking the law and could be prosecuted.  Yet when the scheme is boiled down and he comes to look for benefit, it takes a lot to drag even the slightest benefit out of the pockets of the National Health Insurance Society. That is to be overhauled to a certain extent in the Bill and I am glad of that, as the national health scheme was not working out as satisfactorily as we would have liked.</P>
    <P>It is pointed out in the Bill that the liability for the contributions rests primarily on the employer.  That may be right or it may be wrong.  I am in full agreement that an employer must stamp the card for the employee, but I still think that a certain amount of the liability should also rest on the employee.  We know of cases, particularly with farm workers, where the employer has to meet the entire cost at present of both contributions.  It is an easy-going system between the agricultural labourer and his employer. The farmer provides the stamps at the end of the week and just does not bother to make deductions.  He says: &ldquo;You have given service to the value of the contribution and I will pay the whole lot.&rdquo;  I know from my personal experience that that is carried out in many cases, though not in every case, and the entire contribution of employer and employee is paid by the employer.  That was all right when the amount involved was small, but when you have a 7/- per week contribution, which is to be collected now&mdash; 3/6 from the employer and 3/6 from <Col N="286" /> the employee&mdash;it would be very unfair not to put a certain liability on the employee just as well as on the employer for the stamping of the card.</P>
    <P>If an employer pays his 3/6 per week, week after week, and the employee does not, I do not think there is anything in the Bill which will give credit for the contributions when the employee has not paid up.  Therefore, I would suggest, in all fairness, to the Minister for Social Welfare that it should be as much of a liability on the employee, who is the beneficiary, to stamp his card each week as it is on the employer.  To make the job simple, perhaps there could be some double stamp or a card with a double section, leaving room for the employer's stamp and the employee's stamp.  That would make it plain to the officials of the Department who was the defaulter in the case.  If the employer had put on the stamp for 20, 50 or 100 contributions and the employee was down by 20 or 30 sections, it would be easy to see who was failing to keep up to scratch.  Something will have to be done with regard to that.  If this entire burden is thrown, in the present free and easy manner, on the employer to pay the entire contribution, the burden of 7/- per week will be definitely too heavy.  I expect that all that will be handled by the Tánaiste when he comes to make whatever ministerial amendments may be necessary. I am putting the suggestion genuinely, that it would be better for both employer and employee to have some such scheme, that it would make for easier administration and for more friendship and better companionship between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a whole is a welcome one.  The introduction of social welfare is a move which I will support and back up and will definitely recommend to the people of the country. Anywhere I have gone, I have pointed out the many benefits that will be derived from this Bill.  There are many other things yet for the Government to tackle so as to provide a really comprehensive scheme.  I am not finding fault with the many advances made in social welfare in the past, in fairness to the Opposition.  As I said at the <Col N="287" /> outset, I regard the widows' and orphans' pensions as one of the best social welfare schemes introduced in this country.  It was even a more valuable and a more necessary piece of legislation than the Children's Allowances Bill which was introduced at a later stage.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and, while it may not be up to the standard we would like to provide for the poorer paid classes and the less well-to-do classes, it is an advance in its own way.  Just as other schemes have advanced in the past, social welfare is advancing now, and I hope it will be found possible at some future time to make further advances.  One which I would suggest is that people who are self-employed and whose incomes are small because they have not a way of making a bigger income should be considered even though they are not contributors. Later on it might also be possible to modify the means test still further or to abolish it altogether.  When the children's allowances scheme was introduced the question was considered whether it was wise to leave it without a means test.  That was done and it has been proved beyond a shadow of doubt that its administration has been made much easier and that the little extra cost has been more than made up for by the absence of the host of officials which it would take to administer it if there was a means test. When the means test can be abolished for old age pensioners everybody will welcome its abolition no matter what Government may introduce it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Tánaiste will bear these things in mind.  I know it is his intention to try and go even further than he has gone in this Bill.  I know he admitted when introducing the Bill that he would like to see even greater benefits bestowed.  There are however, certain difficulties with regard to collecting contributions from self-employed people which makes it difficult for him or any Minister to do for these people what he would like to do. However, this Bill is a welcome one. I hope it will be passed and implemented as quickly as possible, particularly with regard to old age pensions. <Col N="288" /> We have been told: &ldquo;Introduce a separate Bill for old age pensions and it will go through the House in 24 hours.&rdquo;  I know it would go through the House in 24 hours.  But there are benefits in this Bill, such as maternity benefit, unemployment benefit and many other benefits for the workers, which deserve to be considered as much as anything else in the Bill.  The Bill also provides for the abolition of a section of the 1908 Act.  It was high time to get rid of that section by which people were debarred from what they were genuinely entitled to.  I think this Bill should satisfy everybody.  I am well satisfied with it, but I hope the step that is now being taken will not be the final step with regard to social welfare, because there are other things to be done before everybody in need is looked after.  I hope that before long a further effort will be made to try and look after everybody who is in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion moved by Deputy P. D. Lehane.  I propose to discuss the Bill from the viewpoint of the small farmers of my constituency and, I am sure, of the country.  One point stands out at the very outset.  The introduction of this Bill does nothing to increase the national income.  The benefits that are to accrue to the people who will benefit from it must come through lessening the share of the national income of those who will not benefit but will have to meet the cost.  That being so, as a small farmer and a representative of a constituency of small farmers, I propose to point out how it will adversely affect agriculture.  To my mind, social justice must precede social welfare.  If it is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, then it certainly offends against social justice.  I could not do better at the outset than read a comment by Very Rev.  Felim Ó Briain, of Galway University, when the White Paper outlining the proposals in the scheme was first published, I think at the end of 1949.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Three tests which could be applied to any scheme were: would it really ward off distress where it was most felt in a comprehensive <Col N="289" /> way; would it help the common good and the total economy of the country; and would it favour or impede the development of human personality?  It is regrettable that on these three counts the White Paper fails.  The scheme is not at all comprehensive.  It is difficult to see how the terms &lsquo;security&rsquo; and &lsquo;welfare&rsquo; can be applied to a scheme which explicitly omits all who are too poor to contribute to it and makes no alternative provision for these unfortunate people.  A craftsman with £10 a week or a business manager with £10,000 a year, if they had a wife and two children, would get 50/- a week unemployment benefit if deprived of their jobs, but a poor casual labourer with a wife and six children must prove that he had no more than 15/- a week before he got a dole of 29/- a week.  The £12 a week tradesman would get 24/- a week at 65, but a worn-out agricultural worker at 70 would not get 17/6 if his income was more than 6/- a week.  A million and a quarter persons were excluded from the scheme and these would include almost the whole agricultural community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking on the 23rd January last, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Adjustment of the mal-distribution of national income was one of the first duties of our statesmen. The Minister for Social Welfare proposed to accentuate unfairness by the Insurance Bill now before the Dáil.  Those who had long been the victims of economic discrimination would be forced to contribute to the social security of those who enjoy permanent jobs.  The Bill took a few timid steps in the right direction but the steps were so feeble as to be of little benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of a person who could have no personal interest in any particular section of the community. I think those words should bear weight with our legislators before they enact further laws which will, as he says, increase the unfairness that already exists.</P>
    <P>The only thing that can be said in favour of the present measure of social <Col N="290" /> justice is that this State has gone so far in the direction of providing social security for a particular section of our people that it might now come as a bit of a jolt if it tried to go into reverse. If we were starting from scratch, I would question the wisdom of the State assuming responsibility for providing for all its citizens.  In my opinion, the command of God to Adam after the Fall&mdash;&ldquo;In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread&rdquo;&mdash; holds as much force to-day as it did then.  So far as the records of time are available to us, 4,000 years later God's Divine Son came on earth to redeem us from that Fall; He came and dwelt in the simple home at Nazareth where His foster-father worked as a carpenter, assisted by the Son of God, and His Mother did the household chores.  There was no State security there.  There was no social welfare.  From that we have tangible evidence that the Divine Plan was that man should provide for himself by the sweat of his brow.</P>
    <P>I may be branded as a reactionary for making that statement.  It will not be the first time.  Nevertheless, I suggest that the world, and our own country with it, has strayed far from the point where the breadwinner is expected to provide for himself and his dependents unaided by the State. With all our State interference, with all our State assistance, with all our State insurance and all the rest of it is humanity to-day more content than it was?  Have we ever had at any period of our history such unrest rampant throughout the world?  Have we ever had at any period in our own lifetime such unrest in our own country despite the measure of social security that operates in the country at the present time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there more contentment to-day than there was at the beginning of this century when there was no State insurance for anyone? To that question I do not propose to give an authoritative reply, but I think Deputies should consider deeply whether it is not a fact that no matter what measure of State security we <Col N="291" /> provide it will not give our people peace and contentment.</P>
      <P>We will come to a point when our people, trained to look to the State to provide for all their needs, will feel that they can never get enough out of the State.  I do not pretend to be well versed in international affairs, but I can see that over vast areas of the world to-day where the State assumes complete responsibility for all the needs of its people the point has been reached where there is nothing left except an inordinate desire to eliminate God completely out of the lives of the people.  Let us consider then whether in pursuit of this ideal of discouraging the individual to provide for himself and his dependents&mdash;a natural obligation laid first upon the shoulders of our first parents&mdash;we shall not reach the point eventually where we too may imitate the Russian methods of eliminating God.</P>
      <P>In relation to the burdens that will be placed upon the State to provide this measure of security for a section of our people I want to point out that in discussing this Bill we are discussing a Bill in which no mention is made of increased pensions for the old and the blind.  Not a word appears in the Bill on that subject.  As recently as last February the Minister, in reply to parliamentary questions, could not then say that there would even be an increase of 2/6 per week.  It was only when the present Bill was actually introduced that the Minister promised some amendments would be made on the Committee Stage to make an increase available for old age pensioners. It is obvious that that promise was made because of the uncertainty that existed that the Bill, as drafted, would go through the House.  That proves conclusively that it was the firm stand taken by the Independent Deputies that compelled the Minister to make that promise.  The fear of those Independent Deputies voting against the Bill and defeating it induced the Minister to promise an extra 2/6 per week for old age pensioners.  The provisions in the Bill are merely to provide for wage earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> There was a suggestion that farmers who are members of co-operative societies may be taken in, but there is so little about it, even in the explanatory memorandum or in the Bill itself, that we have nothing definite to go on. The implication appears to be that those members of co-operative societies will pay a weekly contribution and that the co-operative society will pay the employer's contribution.  It has not been mentioned what that contribution will be, nor is it indicated what benefit those farmers who are taken in will qualify for.  Since the contribution of employees and employers as mentioned in the Bill is 3/6 a week, until some other figure is specified in respect of farmers who may be taken in, we can only assume that they will pay the same amount.  If that is the case, the farmer will contribute 3/6 a week and his co-operative society will pay out of his money another 3/6 a week, making a total of 7/-.</P>
    <P>I have made some calculations as to the effect of that on small farmers in my own constituency, or at least a section of them, because I have not the foundation on which to make a calculation over the whole constituency. An area of the county, considerably less than half of it, probably not more than a quarter of it, is covered by the co-operative society of which I am a member.  The contributions which would be collected from the members would amount to £20,000 a year.  The society would have to contribute another £20,000, making a total of £40,000, which would be taken off the small farmers in a small section of the County Cavan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Until we get a figure indicating the contributions and the benefits, we have nothing to go on. If one or two members of a farmer's family are taken in&mdash;and it is only natural to expect they should be, since they are working on the farm&mdash;we can double or treble that figure of £40,000, so that I do not think the co-operative societies will be enamoured of the scheme.  As a matter of fact, I had a resolution sent to me, dated 5th March last, from a conference of co-operative societies of the Counties Monaghan and Cavan, and the terms of that resolution are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That farmers oppose the proposed scheme of social welfare in so far as the Bill is unjust in imposing the total burden on the agricultural classes who cannot pass on the expense, as can the other sections of the community, its principal beneficiaries.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is clear that in so far as there is a suggestion to take in farmers who are members of co-operative societies&mdash;and bear in mind all suppliers to a creamery are not shareholders, probably onethird of them are not&mdash;the position is that for this small section that will be taken in, the figure I have given of the contribution they would make, and that the society would make out of their money for them, would amount to this very big sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The burden, in the main, must come on taxation.  To begin with, the statement has been made by Deputy Dunne that as regards any contributions organised labour will be called upon <Col N="294" /> to make, their organisations will insist that they get increased wages to cover them.  Then again, the employers, in so far as they are in the industrial line, will have their manufactured goods sold, in the main, in this State in circumstances where they will be enabled to add on the employers' portion of the cost.  So, if Deputy Dunne says the workers will get increased wages to cover their contributions, the industrial employers will add the two contributions together, put it on to the cost of the manufactured article and send that out to the people of the State who must buy it unless they can import articles from other countries free of quotas and free of duty&mdash;and that is not likely to take place.</P>
    <P>Let me now quote another statement made by the Very Rev. Dr. Phelim Ó Briain:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the fleeced farmer and the underpaid worker must continue to emigrate; while profits soared and well-organised groups of workers could secure terms that tended to impoverish further the vast majority of the underpaid, they could not claim that social or distributive justice existed in this country.  About one-fifth of the nation's breadwinners were in registered trade unions.  By using their organised force in strike action they could force the community to concede a disproportionate share of the national income that was meagre enough even if fairly divided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point I was making was that, owing to the sheltered position of our industrial producers, they are in a position to add to the cost of the manufactured article, which must be purchased by the people of the State, the amount of both the workers' and the employers' contributions.  I quote from another quarter.  The present Minister for Finance speaking in this House on the 23rd May said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the British case the industrialists were faced with the difficulty of export in the face of great competition, whereas here they were only manufacturing for the home market in conditions when the home market was never more fortified for them as regards quotas and tariffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> That statement by the Minister for Finance has not been challenged, so far as I know.  Therefore, I think it gives proof positive of my contention that the industrial manufacturers, since they have not to export their products and face international competition, are in the position that they will not be one penny the poorer by reason of any contribution they may have to make either by increased wages to workers on account of their contributions or on account of their own contributions.  It would simply be added on to the price of the article.  When that article is sent down the country it will go to different sections of distributors, business people and so on.  It will even go to different sections of the community. Industrial workers down the country, when they buy that article, can make a point that it will increase the cost of living since clothing, footwear and so on form a big item in the cost-of-living index.  They will seek for a further increase in wages against this additional burden.  Ultimately, the burden will fall on the farming community and on whom will they shift that burden? Could they stand up and say to the British Minister of Food: &ldquo;Twopence an egg is not enough for us with the social welfare cost added on to us.&rdquo; The British Minister of Food will snap his fingers and say: &ldquo;I do not care.  If you are not prepared to supply us with eggs at a less price than any other country I do not want your eggs.  We can get on without them.&rdquo;  That is only a small item.  The price of the bulk of our produce is regulated by its export value, but there are many instances where the export value of our produce is much higher than could be realised for it on the home market.  The export is limited and the price is kept down so that the farmer is crushed between the upper and nether millstones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to point out that the industrial sections of the community are cushioned against any of the charges that will be imposed as a result of the Bill before the House.  The agricultural community will not be in a position to recoup themselves and in the ultimate the agricultural community will probably bear anything up to 90 per cent. of the entire cost of the scheme.  Such a state of affairs, to my mind, is not a step forward.</P>
      <P>A nation of small self-employed people is fundamentally much sounder than a nation of employers and employees. If employers and employees are divided there will be a continual tendency towards class warfare.  While there is class warfare, we certainly cannot have contentment.  The more we can do to encourage self-employed sections of the community to provide for themselves, the better.</P>
      <P>Even before the introduction of this Bill, I could see quite a number of small farmers whose families were reared in the early years of this century and who grew up at the same time as I was growing up myself, and I can see a tendency on the part of the present owners of those small farms to neglect the farm and go out and become wage-earners.  The reason for this is, first of all, the unequal distribution of the national wealth, whereby the agricultural producer is so penalised and, secondly, on account of the security provided through insurance against ill-health, unemployment both for themselves and their dependents.  If that tendency continues long enough, it will cut across the whole national policy of developing rural Ireland and having contented smallholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen farms on which families of seven, eight and nine have been raised in the early years of this century being left more or less in grass under the present owners.  A few cattle have been put on them to eat up the grass but no attempt has been made to work them as an economic unit.  That is the result of the unequal <Col N="297" /> distribution of wealth, the burden of all State schemes and the inducements held out to self-employed people to desert the farms and go in and become insured and take up employment preferably Government employment or county council employment.  If we proceed along those lines, we will reach a point where we will have anything but contented people.</P>
    <P>The only point that could be made in favour of the extension of State schemes is that we have gone so far in a certain direction that it might cause a serious jolt to go into reverse. We can proceed along the lines we are going and ultimately, probably not in my lifetime or in the lifetime of any member of this House, we may end up in the conditions that have led to the setting up of the totalitarian States behind the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see encouragement to the individual to observe his natural obligation to provide out of his own effort and trust in God for himself and his dependents.  No one will object to providing for the aged, who, having given a lifetime of service to the State, are entitled to retirement benefits such as old pensions, but even with that system up to the present, there is a means test.  We have a penalty on thrift, but in so far as the State guarantees to provide for all the needs of the family, it relieves the breadwinner of his natural responsibilities and furthermore it trains the children to lose respect for the parents.</P>
    <P>The children can well say, when they grow up, to the father and mother: &ldquo;You have no authority over me. You did very little to provide for me. You got half-a-crown a week when I was a baby until I reached the age of 16.  You got free boots, free milk, free school meals and many other things of that kind and it is the State rather than you who brought me up, so that I owe allegiance to the State rather than to you.&rdquo;  We strike directly at the authority of the parents and we attack the family at its vital source which everyone agrees is the one point in respect of which the totalitarian States made most headway.  Let us beware lest we increase still further the tendency in that direction.  Its consequences may not overtake us in <Col N="298" /> a year, a decade or two decades, but, as the years go on, we may reach that point.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is all that it claims to be by its protagonists, without the sugar coating which has been put on it by the mention of the half-crown a week increase to the old age pensioner&mdash; which is not yet in the Bill&mdash;why should there be any hesitation about submitting it to a referendum, so that the people will have a chance of expressing their views on it?  I am quite sure that there would be a very considerable volume of opinion, even of those who are to benefit, against it. One thing is sure&mdash;any person of an industrious turn of mind, who is inclined to work, does not like the idea of making contributions and bearing the burden of providing funds for people less willing to work than himself. I am not saying that there will not be hardship at all times which could, and should, be provided for from State funds, but to make the principle as general as the Bill envisages appears to me to be a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Tánaiste to accept the amendment tabled by Deputy P.D. Lehane and to agree to the suggestion made by the four Independent Deputies in their memorandum to the Taoiseach and the Government to implement the increased old age pension and blind pension by a short Bill and then to put this Bill before the electorate for their views.  Nothing will be lost by the delay in submitting it and it will be a useful pointer as to whether the country believes that it is wise or not.  If a majority of the electors decide in favour of it, I will support it.  If they do not, why should it be imposed on the country?  I earnestly appeal to the Tánaiste to accept the amendment and put the question to a referendum.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Reilly treated us to a rather doleful review of the situation in the country in a sincere and honest fashion, as is his custom.  If one really believed the country to be in such a state as he indicated, I have no doubt that one could find very strong and urgent reasons for resisting the Bill, or, on the other hand, for being overpowering in one's support of it.  The contributions of the Opposition to this Bill have been most disappointing.  There have been so far but two contributions of any serious content, that of Deputy Ryan moving his amendment and that of the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lemass, who approached this question in a very realistic manner.</P>
      <P>This question is of such tremendous dimensions, is so huge in its application and covers such a wide field that one can be forgiven, as Opposition Deputies must be forgiven, for not attempting to break a lance with the Minister on it; but, the Minister is to be very highly commended for having introduced the Bill and more important, for having stood up to every challenge against it and having seen to it that it did come before the House for discussion, and, we hope, for enactment.  The fact that the Minister in charge is a Labour Minister would undoubtedly induce me, as a Labour Deputy, to speak in his commendation. Yet, as I stated on another occasion, I cannot say that this is the most important achievement of the inter-Party Government.  It will rank, possibly, as the second most important achievement.  Probably, the other measure to obtain family security and family welfare, the mother and child scheme, which should be taken in conjunction with this scheme, will also rank high amongst the achievements of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, the background of the Social Welfare Bill and the thing that makes it possible is the most magnificent achievement of this inter-Party Government and that, as I said on the <Col N="300" /> Vote on Account, is the achievement of political peace for the last three years.  That is an attainment of which every member of the inter-Party Government, and every individual Deputy who has had any hand, act or part in bringing about the formation of this Government should be proud. Without that political peace, this social peace, the foundations of which the Minister intends to lay in this Bill, would be impossible, would be a fantasy and a farce.  It is on that background that we must consider the whole question in its general aspects.</P>
    <P>Several of the speakers, starting with Deputy Dr. Ryan, have gone into great detail in asking what certain sections of the community will get from this Bill.  They have treated us, as Deputy Ryan did, followed by Deputy O'Reilly, to an elaborate dissertation on the difference between the manufacturer and the farmer, as to how one is enabled to pass on the costs of this scheme to the consumer, and how the other is not.  They find a criticism, which they would believe to be valid, in calling that discrimination against the poor farmer.  Reality is achieved only by considering the title in its true context.  I do not believe that has been done by any contributor to this debate, not even by the Minister.</P>
    <P>These are Government proposals for social security.  This is a Bill for social welfare.  Most of those who discussed the Bill seemed to regard it as a measure providing some social security for the individual, to insure him against certain risks and contingencies but, in fact, that is merely incidental to the Bill.  The real purpose of a Bill of this type, of any Social Welfare Bill, is to provide security to society, to provide security to the State, to the community. It is to provide social welfare, not so much to the hapless individual, the under-privileged, the brother by the wayside, who has to be helped by his better-off brethren, as it is to secure that the fabric of society should continue to exist, should continue to be secure against attacks which threaten to undermine it.  I submit that that is the correct perspective in which to examine this Bill.  We should consider <Col N="301" /> whether or not it will promote that social peace and security for the community, in the sphere of economics and industrial relations, which this Government has been able to secure in the political sphere; whether security of that type is settled in this Bill; whether attempts are made to lay the foundation for a better state of affairs than has hitherto existed.  We should consider it, not with so much emphasis upon whether it has improved the position economically of the old age pensioner, the widow and orphans, the unemployed, the invalided, but as to whether the community as a whole will benefit from the contributions that the Minister has made in this Bill to social security.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies characterised parts of this Bill as being revolutionary in intent.  One might dwell, perhaps, upon that matter, particularly in view of the very widespread, vicious, ignorant and uninformed criticism there is of the Bill.  It was thought at one time that a proposal such as this, holding out palliatives to the under-privileged or the workers, was of the nature of throwing a crust of bread to the starving man to keep him from revolt, trying to keep the proletariat from some revolutionary advance, and, in so far as that theory was considered correct, all these amelioratory measures were regarded as being counter-revolutionary rather than revolutionary.</P>
    <P>Times have changed, however, and now, when we have a better grasp of the essentials of things, we can understand the real impact of proposals of this nature and their effect upon society as a whole.  The number of times that we have heard it stated that proposals of this nature would rob workers of all initiative, would deprive them of a desire to earn their daily bread, would corrupt them and make them dependent on the charity of the State, would seem to indicate that those who say these things believe that, by continual repetition, they may convince the uneducated or the unthinking that these criticisms are valid.</P>
    <P>But they give no indication of the basis of their belief.  They have no evidence from a sociological point of view to prove that any measures of this <Col N="302" /> sort, brought forward with a view to ameliorating the conditions of the under-privileged, have ever actually had the effect which they so glibly talk about.  The experience of the last war, as Deputy Desmond has pointed out, shows that Irish workers, and I am sure workers in any other countries, are not to any extent of the type that can be criticised as shirkers. They are not likely to shirk work just because they are asked to accept, as part of the social structure of this State, the possibility of receiving certain contributions during periods of unemployment.  That basis of criticism has been exploded quite thoroughly in this country and in every other country but still it seems to persist when no other real sound criticism can be thought out by those who are opposed to this scheme.</P>
    <P>The social security that I mention as being the real target of this Bill, the promotion of a social consciousness, would to my mind act as a very energetic stimulus to the worker to increase his productivity rather than to lessen it.  When he feels a sense of security for himself during sickness, a sense of greater security for himself when he reaches retirement, a greater sense of security for his wife and children under the provisions of this Bill, he is bound, I submit, to become a better citizen. He is bound to act in a greater degree for the best interests of the country as a whole and that argument, I feel sure, will appeal to thinking people to smash the type of propaganda which has been rampant against this Bill since it was introduced.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lemass, would require some consideration, particularly as the statement he made was welcomed by Deputy Davin as the leader of the Labour Party, who went so far as to salute him for his declaration of a point of view which evidently ran counter to that of the other members of his Party or, at least as far as we have heard those who followed him, received no endorsement whatsoever from these other members.</P>

      <P>He gave no indication of it.  It appeared to me as one who listened to him that it was under stress of the discussion that this idea of appealing to the Minister sprung fully-fledged from his mind.  There was no indication that I have read of &mdash;and I have taken care to read over Deputy Dr. Ryan's opening statement in proposing his amendment&mdash;or no scintilla of evidence that he was thinking along the lines indicated by Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Lemass gave as his view that the whole question of social welfare arrangements should be taken out of the field of party politics, and this he proposed should be done by meeting the proposals of Deputy Dr. Ryan, but he could hardly expect, as an experienced Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that the Government of the day, no matter how much it might or might not be enamoured of the alternative propositions of the Opposition, would withdraw its own considered line of policy as incorporated in the Bill and take into consideration the rather tenuous proposals of Deputy Dr. Ryan, not fully thought out or elaborated, and present them as an agreed measure to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all, I am sure, particularly the Deputies in the Labour Party, wish that some of the other suggestions of Deputy Dr. Ryan could be implemented. We would all wish that, in contradiction to the terms of his own amendment after he criticised the Bill for not providing a comprehensive section for the needs of all sections of the community, any suggestion of his which broadened the basis of the Bill and extended social security to other sections not covered by the Bill could be implemented by the Government; but it would hardly be the correct procedure for the Government to accept a suggestion of that type, not backed by the other members of the Opposition as far as we can ascertain, because it was carefully noted that <Col N="304" /> Deputy Derrig spoke in a very dissimilar, if not in an antagonistic voice, to that used by Deputy Lemass. Others who followed him adopted the same attitude.  If the Opposition were anxious to facilitate the Government they could avail of other means to secure the rapid passage and implementation of the Bill as a whole.  They could, for instance, as has been the custom in this House on quite a number of occasions, take off the Whips from the Party and have a free vote.</P>
    <P>If that had appealed to Deputy Lemass, perhaps he might have considered it.  If, as Deputy Little suggests, they did seriously consider this in Party caucus after their opposition to the Bill had weakened and after they had seen the strength of the arguments in support of it on behalf of the Government, they could, I am sure, have found accommodation with the Government.  I am sure they realise that in the Tánaiste they have a Minister who has the greatest sense of accommodation and that he would be willing to facilitate them without in any way violating the principles which he hopes to enshrine in this Bill.  If they were serious in that idea of helping the Government to bring forward this measure of social security, then I suggest they leave themselves open to the charge of having this attitude, or this appeal, of the Deputy Leader of their Party being considered as a political trick, a trick to get themselves out of the difficult situation in which they found themselves when they began to understand how the tide was flowing in the country&mdash;when the great realisation came to them as to the full meaning of the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Now, before examining in detail some of the criticisms made by Deputy Dr. Ryan, and before taking into consideration the scheme that was summarised so hastily by the Fianna Fáil headquarters and office, I would like to go over some thoughts which I have in respect of this Bill.  In considering it, it is, as I said at the beginning, important to bear in mind the background against which it is introduced, a background of political security which I hope will be strengthened by the scheme of security <Col N="305" /> which the Minister proposes in the Bill.  As well as that background, the Bill can be examined from the narrower background of the three main insurance schemes which we have at present in operation.  Each of these finds a place in one form or another in the Bill.  The two oldest are those governing national health and unemployment.  The third, and the most recent, which was so highly commended by every Deputy who has spoken so far, is the widows' and orphans' contributory pension scheme. As Deputies know, these three schemes cover widely different groups of people.</P>
    <P>The widows' and orphans' scheme is the widest in scope.  The legislation governing that scheme shows that it covers all persons, with some exceptions, who were employed under a contract of service, the main exceptions being persons in receipt of salaries of more than £500 a year and certain State employees.</P>
    <P>The next one that is widest in scope is the national health insurance scheme, and the third, the unemployment insurance scheme, which is the most limited of the three.  As regards scope, the last one covers some 200,000 people fewer than are covered by the widows' and orphans' pension scheme.  This lack of uniformity in scope has given rise to many anomalies, some of which were referred to by Deputy Dr. Ryan and other Deputies.  It is one of the important functions of this new Bill to wipe out these anomalies by providing a uniform scope for all the benefits.  That aspect of the Bill has rightly been commented upon by Deputy Dr. Ryan, while the advantages of it have been made plain by several Deputies.  It is only when the Bill is actually in full operation that the advantages and effects of that pattern of uniformity will become clear.</P>
    <P>An example of the advantages of this endeavour of the Bill may make this point clear.  Under the present arrangement or system, if a man becomes unemployed for a long period, he loses his insurance under the national health scheme, and if, subsequently, he falls sick or if death occurs, no benefit is payable on account <Col N="306" /> of the lapsed insurance.  It will be seen from this that the occurrence of one contingency, which is supposed to be insured against, can have the effect of destroying the insurance for another contingency which, when it arises, is uncovered.  Now, under the new Bill, as Deputies know who have examined it and its contents, and who have studied the White Paper and run through the explanatory memorandum, that state of affairs, which is so disadvantageous to the beneficiary and so unjust without being purposely so&mdash;unjust due to the lack of uniformity in the three main systems of insurance&mdash;will be impossible. When a man is sick, for example, his insurance is carried forward by way of credits.  These credits are valuable in the event of some later mishap, such as the mishap of unemployment or death.  Of all the provisions in this Bill, it would be difficult to overestimate the value of this particular provision.  In fact, were the Minister to introduce a Bill containing that provision alone it would be a very noteworthy step along the path to better social security in this country.</P>
    <P>The next obvious advantage arising from the new measure is the simplification and the rationalisation which it brings about.  Instead of the three different insurance schemes with three different scopes, with different rates of benefit and different qualifying conditions and so on, we now have, under the Bill, a uniform scheme covering all those who can be covered under the terms of the Bill and dealing administratively with them by means of one stamp and one central record department. One Deputy who spoke went as far as to envisage the type of card that might most profitably be used for assessing the legal liability of the different parties, the employer and the employee, to carry through their obligations in regard to payment of the contributions. Whether it is necessary on the Second Reading to go into such details is a moot point but the fact that Deputies are thinking along those lines is significant of the interest in this whole question of social security, as put forward by this Bill.  That interest is evident not alone in the destructive aspects of the criticism but also in the <Col N="307" /> constructive approach which members of this House are applying to the consideration of the Bill.  The advantages of this one-stamp-one-record idea hardly require to be stressed.  The administrative expenses which will be saved by this rational method of unification and simplification will be of real value to those who are most concerned under this Bill, namely, the beneficiaries. That method of rationalisation will leave just so much extra money which will go in benefits instead of in administrative expenses.  In other words, the Minister proposes to make social insurance in this country, under the terms of this Bill, an efficient instrument&mdash;an instrument which has been so simplified that it can be understood by the man in the street, so that it does not require any great legal mind to interpret his duties and obligations under it.</P>
    <P>The next improvement which the Bill brings about is the making uniform of the existing benefit rates in which, needless to say, we are interested. There is to be a substantial improvement. For example, at the moment, under the national health insurance scheme, allowances are payable for dependents. But, under the unemployment insurance scheme, no such allowances are paid.  Again, the rates payable under both schemes bear no relation to the rates payable under the other scheme I mentioned, the widows' and orphans' pension scheme, which latter are determined both by the place of residence of the widow and by the type of employment in which her husband had been engaged.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to say that these different and differing rates did discriminate sharply against the rural worker and his widow.  However, under the new scheme, all this will be wiped out.  There will be a basic benefit rate, that anyone can understand, of 24/- for the main beneficiary plus 12/- for the adult dependent, plus 7/- for each of the two dependent children.  This means, to make comparisons with the present set-up, that a man when sick or when unemployed will receive for himself and his wife and two dependent children 50/- a week.  That is a round figure which is easily remembered <Col N="308" /> and easily understood&mdash;and I am sure that it can easily be grasped by the people who are to benefit and who are only too impatient to have the scheme implemented.  Compare that position with the present rate of 22/6 which a man would receive under the national insurance scheme or 35/- which he would receive under the present unemployment insurance scheme.  No comparisons can be made as regards the retiring pension.  The retiring pension and the death grant provisions of this new scheme cannot be compared with any existing scheme because, as Deputies know, at the moment no similar benefits are provided by any form of State insurance.</P>
    <P>The next point which requires consideration&mdash;it is a point to which Deputy Dr. Ryan devoted some time and in regard to which he seemed to disagree very completely with the attitude of the Minister&mdash;is the division of the insured population into two groups (1) those who are in what may be termed the normal wage group, and (2) those who are earning less than a round figure of £3 10s. a week&mdash;in the White Paper this latter group is referred to as the low-wage group.  I should think that it would be of benefit to the House if the Minister, in his concluding remarks, would give some reasons why he hit on this level at which the division is made.  With the fall in value of money, which has been stressed, and with the rise in wages&mdash; particularly in the rural community&mdash; the figure of £3 10s. appears to me to require consideration and it could be considered with advantage to apply at a higher scale.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies may wonder at my raising questions about the conditions which exist in the Aran Islands seeing that I do not represent that constituency and have nothing to do with it.  So I would like to make my position quite clear to the House. It is not my intention to interfere in the affairs of constituencies in the West of Ireland but when the <Col N="309" /> grievances of these constituencies are brought to my notice I think I am entitled, as a Deputy of this House, to do what I can to have them remedied. For a long time past I have been receiving communications and have spoken to people who are very familiar with the conditions in the islands and they have repeatedly asked me to raise certain matters in the House. I did not do so, I must confess: I decided that I would not until I had an opportunity of visiting these islands and seeing for myself what conditions there were like.</P>
      <P>Most people visit the Aran Islands in summertime and it cannot be denied that in summertime they are at their best.  The people there seem to be quite happy and contented and so are the visitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, however, took the opportunity of visiting these islands not during the summer months but at Easter and, as a result of that visit, I decided to put down on the Order Paper some questions to the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture. I am glad to say that the Minister for Lands gave a favourable answer to one question about land division and said that his Department were about to take a step which should have been taken years ago, namely the division of a large farm on the main island of approximately 260 acres.</P>
      <P>I was not, however, satisfied with the answer to the other question.  The question I raised was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands whether he is aware of the appalling conditions under which the inhabitants of the Aran Islands are living <Col N="310" /> at present and that the services provided under the Vote for Gaeltacht Services are entirely inadequate and have failed completely to remove the primitive conditions under which the islanders are compelled to live and, if so, whether his Department have any concrete proposals for the general betterment of life on the islands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first part of the Minister's reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Conditions on the Aran Islands are not as represented by the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was in order to disprove that statement that I asked permission to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  I propose to prove to the best of my ability that conditions are not as the Minister and his Department would have us believe: that the islanders are living in the lap of luxury.  In my opinion, they are living under the most primitive conditions possible, and it is only in the winter months or the spring season that people outside the islands can appreciate those conditions. I propose to tell of things exactly as I saw them.</P>
    <P>On my way to the main island I went by fishing trawler from Rosaveel. The boat I travelled on had just arrived there and on it was a child who had been transported from Inishmaan first to the main island and then to Rosaveel.  That child had broken a leg eight or ten days previously, and because no transport was available it was impossible to get that child into Galway Hospital.  For eight or ten days that child was left with a broken leg unset and without proper hospital attention until this fishing trawler took it to Rosaveel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I mention that is to prove that conditions on the island are primitive, for if that is not a primitive state of affairs I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is transport primitive but the provisions of the Gaeltacht Services Vote are anything but satisfactory on the islands.  It is a sad commentary <Col N="311" /> that conditions on the Aran Islands and the living of the inhabitants were to a great extent far better under the British régime than under a native Government.  It is well known to the House and the Minister that Kilronan was the centre of a great fishing industry.  To-day that fishing industry is no more.  A pier was built under the Congested Districts Board in Kilronan and storage was made available to the fishing industry, the finest type of storage you could see.  That pier and that storage are lying there to-day no longer used in the industry which should be the main industry of the West of Ireland.  To make things worse, to add insult to injury, not alone is the fishing industry dead in the Aran Islands but the islanders have the sorrowful sight of daily watching the British, Spanish, Belgian and Portuguese trawlers fishing off the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to pin on to the Minister for Lands what he is responsible for.  Local government seems to come into portion of the statement and then agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the major industry there, which is fishing, has disappeared and that the alternative industries provided are not at all sufficient to make up for the loss of income or wealth that the islanders had when the fishing was flourishing. In order to lead up to that picture, I took the opportunity of giving the House an idea of how well-off the <Col N="312" /> people on the islands were prior to native Government.  It is only for that purpose that I deviated from the actual subject matter of the question.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Lands, who is also the Minister in charge of the Gaeltacht services, is serious about the job of providing suitable and permanent industries for the western seaboard, which includes the Aran Islands, the key industry that should come under his control in order to improve conditions is the fishing industry.  I regret that the Minister himself now maintains that he has no responsibility for the fishing industry, and as far as he is concerned, and as far as I can ascertain now from him, he is mostly interested in the setting up of toy industries in the congested areas.  I am afraid that toy industries are a very poor substitute and hold out very little hope of permanent employment for the people that he describes in his answer to my question as &ldquo;a hardworking, healthy race, who are, as always, taking advantage of Government schemes to improve their housing conditions&rdquo;.  I thoroughly agree with the Minister that the islanders are a hardworking healthy race, but I want to go further and say that they are a very patient race to have put up with conditions as they have done for some years past.</P>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for the small industries, such as the seaweed and kelp and the sea-rod industry.  If the lot of the islanders is to be made easier in connection with these industries, if they are to make any money at all, it is the Minister's duty to see that suitable piers are erected on those three islands.  Surely the Minister cannot dissociate himself from the responsibility of providing piers in connection with these industries?  The plain fact is that on two of the islands there are no facilities for landing. On Inishmaan there is what is described as a slip, but which is really a breakwater, and it is placed on the wrong side of the island.  It is impossible even for a fishing trawler to get within less than a quarter of a mile of the shore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every landing that has to be made on Inishmaan or Inis Thiar has to be made by a currach&mdash;and I am sure <Col N="313" /> I need not explain to the House what a currach is.  It would be interesting for some members of the House to see for themselves the dangers which these islanders have to undergo in making a landing on these particular islands. The best way I can describe it is that when any of those currachs are coming in to the shore the men have actually to count the waves before they land for fear they would be dashed against the rocks.  All credit is due to those hardy and healthy islanders for the courage that they display under such primitive conditions. If the Minister is really keen on the development of rural industries there, he must see first of all that proper piers and landing places are made available on the islands.  Otherwise, the transport system itself will fail.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that the actual question of transport to the islands is not the responsibility of the Minister for Lands or the Minister in charge of Gaeltacht services, but in order to prove my point that conditions are primitive on the island, I think I am entitled to say that at least every family there should have at their disposal the means of warming themselves during the winter months and cooking their food over a decent fire. The position over the winter months there is almost unbelievable.  Were it not for the fact that some 300 tons of fuel was made available recently, I shudder to think what conditions might be like at the moment.</P>

In conclusion, I should like to point out that until the Aran Islands.  Connemara and those areas where the Irish language is preserved and treasured are made the responsibility of one Minister in regard to fuel, food and transport communications, etc., there is no good in tackling it in the piecemeal manner in which it has been tackled in the past, with one Minister saying &ldquo;I am not responsible&rdquo;, and another Minister passing you on to someone else.  Until a particular Minister is made responsible for these areas nothing very useful can be done.</P>

A great deal of the material for it has been created during the past three years.  The Deputy spoke about turf to-day.  We know the Aran islands always got turf from the bogs of Connemara until this year, when the turf was not available because of the very deliberate and positive policy of the Coalition in stopping turf production.  That cannot be denied.  If any denial is to be made, let it be made in Connemara, and I hope we shall soon have an opportunity of hearing it there.</P>

      <P>Most of the case put up by Deputy McQuillan and the few random remarks made by Deputy Bartley which have no bearing on the question dealt with matters that do not come under my Department and for which money is voted in the Estimates for other Departments, particularly the Office of Public Works and the Department of Agriculture.  So far as the Gaeltacht Services division of my Department is concerned, we have always done our best for the people of the Aran Islands. Deputy McQuillan harped on one thing that I resent, that the conditions there are primitive.  Conditions there are very different from what they are in Dublin and most parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. When I was explaining why I thought the conditions were primitive you, Sir, ruled me out of order on the ground that it had nothing to do with the subject matter of the question which I intended to raise.  I could show that the Minister's knowledge of the Aran Islands is primitive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The location of the islands, the fact that they are 11 or 12 miles out from the mainland in the <Col N="316" /> open Atlantic, is the primary cause why transport is, not alone bad, but most hazardous.  That cannot be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No Government can throw a bridge across to the Aran Islands.  Even with the best possible boat service, at times it will be hazardous and the islands will be cut off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not have a store of food and fuel on the islands?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a conspiracy against the Minister on this occasion.  The Gaeltacht Services Section have done all that is humanly possible towards giving employment on the islands.  We can actually give more employment than we can get people to take up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The toy industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that we were developing the toy industry there. The toy industry has its own place in the Gaeltacht Services, but it will never become a huge industry here, at least there is no prospect of it.  It is not the toy industry that has been established in the islands.  It is the knitting industry, which is suitable for girls.  Some 23 are at present employed and we have work for more.  For Deputy Bartley's benefit, I may say that long before the very sad death of the late Deputy Mongan an order for 40,000 pairs of socks was arranged, most of which is to go to the Aran Islands if the people will take up the employment.  All we can do is to offer the employment.  We do not propose <Col N="317" /> to go on with whips or guns to make them work and improve their conditions whether they like it or not.  At present 17 new houses are under construction there.  All we can do is to offer these things to the people and let them take them if they like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Divide the land and build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is not much land in the Aran Islands to divide and that there was a large amount of local opinion against the dividing of the farm mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the individual concerned got people to make representations not to have his land divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  However, that is outside my control. It is in the hands of the Land Commissioners and, if it brings relief to a group of families there, I will be only too pleased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should have been done long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The wishes of the people on the islands must be taken into account.  Although there is a Government Department to do the best it can for the people, it has no authority to compel people to improve their conditions according to what the Government may think.  We might think that it would be a good thing if they had this, that or the other and the people on the islands might not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the people do not want the land divided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had representations from a large body of people not to divide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that people were asked by this individual to make representations not to have his land divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter beyond my control.  It is an excepted matter which is the function of the <Col N="318" /> Land Commissioners.  If the commissioners think they should take up that farm and divide it, they will do so.  If they do not, there is no power that the Minister or the House can bring to bear on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it right for one man to own practically all the arable land on that island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to leave that to the commissioners because the House has given the power to the commissioners.  If the commissioners, after examination, see fit not to acquire that land, nothing can be done about it, because the authority to acquire and divide it is solely theirs. Deputy Bartley raised a matter outside the question altogether, namely, turf.  He tried to back up what he said behind closed doors, that this Government were responsible for closing down the turf industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scandalous for Deputy Bartley to try to raise a storm here.  If he had been half as vocal during the last three years as he is now when his Party is getting uneasy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
