    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few <Col N="932" /> brief observations.  I do not want to go into the heat of controversy as to whether it was right that there should be fuel dumps in the Park in 1947 or 1948.  I want to look at this from above the heat of controversy which is inseparable from day to day Party politics.  Looking at the whole situation in retrospective, I think it is clear enough to any intelligent mind that if you accumulate a large quantity of any kind of commodity in a time of scarcity and store it under conditions which do not tend to preserve its quality and then have to sell it in circumstances in which its original value is not present, you inevitably suffer losses and you have to sell the commodity at a price often substantially below that which you paid for it.</P>
      <P>Complaint is made that the Park dumps of fuel were sold at less than the price which they cost.  That was inevitable in the circumstances.  What Deputies have to remember is that Irish turf is not like French wine, that Irish turf does not improve with age. To imagine that you could clamp it in the open in the Phoenix Park, leave it there under snow and frost for a few years, allow it to become sodden and to moulder and then sell it for the price which you paid for it, is just sheer nonsense and bears no relationship to the realities either of turf production or of commercial transactions in the years 1948 and 1951.  A lot of the Park turf was simply rubbish, mouldering rubbish.  Anyone who inspected it&mdash;as I took the precaution to do on a number of occasions&mdash;would realise that you could not possibly ask the consuming public to buy that turf at its original price, and no sane member of the community would have dreamt of paying for it anything more than we charged.  In fact, some people were highly sceptical as to whether it was worth the reduced price at which we offered it in order to prevent it resolving entirely into a heap of turf mould.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applied to a considerable extent in respect of the coal.  The coal which was imported and dumped in the Phoenix Park had been transported over a long distance.  All the evidence shows that even when loaded <Col N="933" /> for this country the coal contained a substantial slack element; and transporting coal a long distance inevitably adds to the slack content, with the result that when it was dumped in the Park it had a substantial slack element within it and by years of storage that slack content increased.  The only way in which you could have sold it without loss was to fix a price for it equivalent to the price at which it was purchased and insist on the coal merchants selling it at a high price to the consumer.</P>
    <P>It would obviously be a fraud on the consumers to ask them to pay for the Park coal, with such a high slack content, the high price which was originally paid for it on importation.  In fact, in our time, it was not easy to induce the coal merchants to purchase the Park coal.  Every one of them complained that it was not a suitable household coal.  They complained, too, that it had a high element of slack and that they frequently had to riddle the coal in order to abstract from it a substantial amount of its slack content.  To imagine, therefore, that coal could have been sold in 1948 or 1949&mdash;when imports of better quality coal were available &mdash; at the price originally charged, is to expect the impossible.</P>
    <P>Therefore, having regard to the deteriorated condition of the turf, to the deteriorated condition even of the timber, to the fact that the coal was not of the best quality and had a high slack content, it was inevitable that losses should have been incurred in selling fuel of that kind.  If we are now going to store American coal in the Park and if British coal subsequently becomes available, we are bound to lose in selling the American coal&mdash;unless we are going to say to the public: &ldquo;You must continue to pay a high price for the American coal, even though other sources of coal are available to us and a quantity of coal can be sold at a lesser price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, looking at the thing as objectively as I can.  I say that this or any other State which resorts to the device of buying a scarce commodity of a somewhat perishable or deteriorating character and dumps it against a possible greater danger will always have to face the possibility that, <Col N="934" /> if the supply position improves, the stored commodity will have to be sold at a lesser price.  That has been the experience with regard to the fuel in the Park and that was the experience for the past few years.  It is the experience of this Government to-day, which is selling Park coal at less than Park coal cost and that, I suggest, will be the experience of the Government when it comes to sell from dumps American coal bought and imported at a higher price than that at which British is available.  I do not think we can help that.  It is just one of the risks we have to take in an emergency, one of the things we cannot avoid. While one tries to aim at a certain element of balance, my own view is that I would prefer to overshoot the target rather than under-shoot it, because, though you will be forgiven for having too much, you will probably never be forgiven for having too little.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise the whole question of the storage of American coal and the British responsibility in respect of fuel supplies.  Under the trade agreement negotiated with Britain by our predecessors and under the trade agreement which we negotiated in 1948 with the British Government, Britain undertook to supply 1,500,000 tons of coal. On the other hand, we for our part agreed to supply Britain with certain commodities which were scheduled in the trade agreement.</P>
    <P>So far as we were concerned, we kept that agreement and we felt that so long as that agreement existed&mdash;and it was authenticated by no less a signature than that of the British Prime Minister &mdash;we had every reason to believe that Britain would honour her bond and continue to supply this country with 1,500,000 tons of coal; but for reasons best known to herself&mdash;certainly reasons which were never explained to me sufficiently to justify her attitude&mdash; the British Government defaulted in the matter of supplying coal to this country.  I do not believe the default was necessary because at the time Britain was declining to fulfil a solemn trade agreement with this country, she was supplying coal to overseas countries with which she had no form of <Col N="935" /> trade agreement whatever.  Britain was supplying customers overseas to whom she had a right to refuse coal supplies while defaulting on her coal treaty with this country.</P>
    <P>We discussed this matter early this year with the British Government and at these discussions, as I think the Minister will admit, we urged that Britain was morally, and, in so far as there was any international law recognised in these matters, legally bound to supply this country with 1,500,000 tons of coal.  The British Government representatives never disputed that there was a moral responsibility on them to provide coal for this country, and we then urged that, as the quantity of coal provided for in our agreement was not large, having regard to Britain's total output, and the fact that she was supplying overseas countries, Britain should continue to honour her obligations under the trade agreement. The British Government, however, asserted that they had not sufficient coal for themselves and this was being asserted by Britain when she was supplying overseas countries with coal, although she had no obligation to these countries.</P>
    <P>We then urged, and, I think, with every justification, that, as Britain was importing American coal and as our trade agreement with her obliged her to supply us with coal, she ought to avail of her access to other markets to buy coal there so as to enable her to supply our requirements either from her own deposits of coal or from coal secured in these other markets.  Britain at the time had, and still has, of course, a most substantial mercantile marine.  Her ability to find ships to transport coal could not be questioned and her standing in the world commercial market was such that she could quite easily have imported coal, either for her own requirements or to satisfy our needs under the trade agreement into which she had entered.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of our discussions with the British Government, they agreed that they would find additional coal for us in the third quarter of 1951 and that the whole position would be <Col N="936" /> reviewed before the end of the third quarter, with a view to seeing how Britain then stood in the matter of the availability of coal supplies and what steps she would take to fulfil her obligation under the trade agreement of 1948.  At that time, we urged that, even if Britain found it necessary to import American coal for her own requirements, she ought to do that in order to supply us with the coal which she had contracted to supply, and at the stage at which we left the discussions with the British Government, the whole question was open as to whether we would get American coal from Britain at British prices or whether Britain would supply us with coal as she was bound to do under the trade agreement of 1948.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with what happened since then.  I take it that our representatives who went subsequently to negotiate with the British Government are aware of the memorandum which was prepared following the previous talks with the British Government and I hope that that question of Britain's liability to provide us with British coal or alternative coal at the British price was again raised with the British Government.  It is true, of course, that the trade agreement of 1948 and the trade agreement of 1947, the latter having been negotiated by the then Government, did not provide for the price at which coal was to be sold to this country, but I think that, reading the trade agreement, it was clear that the coal was to be supplied at approximately the British price, and, while one could understand Britain being unable to fulfil her obligations under the treaty, if Britain had no coal, we felt that it was a bit thick that Britain should default on her coal obligations to this country, pleading that she had not sufficient coal for herself, while at the same time supplying coal to other countries in respect of which she had no trade or treaty obligations whatever.</P>
    <P>I still think it is reasonable, even at this stage, to expect the British Government to fulfil their coal obligation under the trade agreement, that that obligation should be fulfilled by the British either making their own <Col N="937" /> coal available to this country up to the limits provided for in the agreement, or by finding for this country, at the British price, the coal which our people were entitled to under the agreement.  We pointed out to Britain that we had previously an obligation to supply Britain with a certain quantity of potatoes and when it became clear that these potatoes could not be supplied from native sources, we then undertook to the British Government that we would buy these potatoes outside this country at a higher price.  We offered to sell them to Britain at the higher price because we felt, having contracted to supply Britain with potatoes, there was a moral obligation either to get the potatoes at home or elsewhere in order to fulfil our obligation under the trade agreement with them.  I am quite sure that the importance of these facts is appreciated by the Government.  I hope the point of view which was put up earlier this year that Britain has an obligation to continue to supply us with coal so long as the treaty runs will be put forward and that that obligation cannot be waived by Great Britain morally on the plea that she has not sufficient coal, when, at the same time, she is supplying coal to countries with which she has no treaty obligations.  I should like to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, his view as to Britain's responsibility in that matter.  I hope, at all events, that Britain will not be allowed to imagine that we consented in any circumstances to her defaulting on her coal agreement though supplying coal elsewhere.  All this happened at a time when we were fulfilling in the spirit and the letter our obligations under the trade agreement with Britain.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer and that is the question of the development of our native peat resources.  I am an unrepentant believer in the value and the potential use of Irish peat.  I am satisfied that properly organised, through an institution like Bord na Móna, we can win substantial quantities of peat from our bogs, making its cultivation and use an economic <Col N="938" /> proposition and providing expanding opportunities for employment for our people in areas where there is no other employment available.</P>
    <P>In many of the large and valuable turf areas of this country there is no land capable of being used efficiently for agricultural purposes.  In these areas, where turf abounds, there is no other potential employment except in the exploitation of our turf deposits. It is for that reason that I think it behoves the State to insist on the development of these peat deposits either by burning the peat on the bog, converting it into electricity or by encouraging, through Bord na Móna, machine-won methods of turf production and encouraging the local people to cut turf even by hand methods in order that they can provide fuel for themselves and, at the same time, make a living by marketing that fuel in the neighbouring towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I think the Bord na Móna programme is a creditable one and I think their time-table in the matter of production is running according to schedule.  Bord na Móna ought to be given the maximum encouragement to push ahead with all enthusiasm and vigour its machine production programme. Not only is that the best way of winning turf for commercial purposes, since it enables you to sell it at an economic price, but the extension of the board's activities will provide a substantial measure of expanding employment in areas where there is no employment available.  I am glad, therefore, that the board is pushing ahead vigorously with its programme. I hope that, so far as this House and the Government are concerned, the board will get every possible encouragement to continue along that road.</P>
    <P>So far as cutting turf by hand is concerned that is a craft known to our people for very many generations.  It is not the best way of cutting turf in order to sell it at a low price, but it is the best and only method so far open to the small man who has to depend on his slane and his knowledge of turf cutting as a means of earning a livelihood for himself and providing fuel for his household.  I think, therefore, <Col N="939" /> that Bord na Móna should be asked to encourage those who cut turf by hand to do so under the best possible conditions.  The board should be asked to facilitate the private turf cutter by endeavouring to make bogs available to him under conditions which will give him a fair chance of cutting this turf without having to encounter the heartbreaking difficulty of working in an undrained or improperly drained bog.  The more we encourage, in the turf areas, the man who cuts turf by hand to continue to do so, the more turf we will get into the national pool and the more we will help that man to depend on his own efforts to provide for his family.</P>
    <P>I think it is even preferable that the hand-won turf should run side by side with the machine-won turf rather than that the hand turf cutter should be swept into the Bord na Móna machine. I think the continuance of the craft of cutting turf by a slane has still something to commend it.  I think it will preserve for future generations a source of fuel production, perhaps, long after Bord na Móna has moved from the local area of operation.</P>
    <P>One thing I plead for at all events is that, in those areas where bogs exist and where the sole means of livelihood for the local people is the production of turf, the State, in every possible way, ought to encourage the production of turf, firstly, because it is an Irish fuel, secondly, because properly cut and saved, it is a good fuel and, thirdly, because it helps to render our people more independent of foreign fuel imports.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  I am very sorry that Deputy Norton's colleague, Deputy Dillon, was not in the House this morning to hear Deputy Norton giving his point of view on the muck in the Park, as they referred to it the other night.  All in this House, as well as the Government, were collectively responsible for the amount of fuel that was stored in the Park in 1947.  I was a member of the House at that time when urgent motions were put down by the Opposition to go in for fuel storage.  One Deputy after <Col N="940" /> another on the Opposition Benches urged the Government to go in for stockpiling in order to prevent a recurrence of the conditions that existed during the bad winter of 1946.  The weather that year was exceptionally bad.  It is all right to play politics. That stockpiling in the Park was the result of weather conditions, the very bad harvest, spring and summer, and the Government which was in power at the time took the necessary steps at the unanimous direction of the whole House&mdash;it was not a Government scheme but a unanimous decision of Dáil Éireann&mdash;but directly God in His own good time brought good weather again the turf which had been stacked in the Park to save the people from undue hardship was misrepresented by speakers on the other side of the House.  That is playing politics to a high degree.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Norton's contribution this morning.  It was a change from the speeches to which we have been listening.  I am sorry, however, that he did not use his influence with the Government with which he was associated.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has to face a position caused by the neglect of his predecessor and the other members of the inter-Party Government.  A number of those Ministers were the Deputies who asked the present Minister for Industry and Commerce to get coal no matter where, to get turf and to get wood.  Then just because they thought that they might get some political kudos they decided that it was all a Fianna Fáil racket, as Deputy Dillon told us the other night.  They say that it was wrong to have that turf in the Park; but the coal was bad and the timber was bad and that turf would not have been so bad if there had been a very bad harvest and winter in 1948 as there was in 1946 and 1947.  If you meet insincerity of that type it is very hard to know where you are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-Party Government should have honoured their obligations during their time in office instead of handing us on a legacy.  They knew well that weather conditions and other things beyond the power of this Parliament were responsible for that state of affairs and that anything the Fianna <Col N="941" /> Fáil Government did was done in the interests of the country as a whole. They do not even say that they will face up to it now or go as far as making a contribution like Deputy Norton made this morning.  Are we ever to get away from that insincere political quibbling which we hear in this House from people who go in for political slander and misrepresentation of facts and who say that everything which Fianna Fáil did during their years of office was wrong?</P>
    <P>We must face the position and, given an opportunity, we will.  We will try to rectify some of the misrepresentations of the past and face the position as honestly as possible.  The inter-Party Government should be ashamed of themselves for leaving such a state of affairs behind them that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must ask the House to do something which should have been done during the last three years.  I am also delighted to hear of Deputy Norton's recent conversion to the turf scheme.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that your colleagues in the inter-Party Government were not so much in favour of it when they went into power.  It was very hard for the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Bord na Móna and the Government to build up turf production.  You cannot build up these things overnight and it took Fianna Fáil a long time.  It was a slow process to drain bogs, get in machinery and try to encourage people to cut turf and all that was destroyed in one year, 1948.  Why?  I will be honest enough to say that as British coal was coming in the inter-Party Government decided that there would be less demand for turf, but we now find that we have not British coal.  Deputy Norton explained that England had broken her agreement.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and Bord na Móna, however, find it very hard to get workers to go on the bogs to the same extent as they did prior to 1948.  A number of these people have left the <Col N="942" /> country while others will not place their trust in turf.  When you build up a form of economy and it gets a setback it is very hard to rebuild.</P>

No other policy will survive because if we depend on foreign imports of <Col N="943" /> things which we could produce here ourselves our country will not go forward. I hope the Minister will continue the good work.  He has a difficult task to do in trying to rectify some of the mistakes of the past.

      <P>Nobody could have expected that the reserve stocks of fuel which were held in the dumps at the beginning of 1948 could have been dispersed without loss, once British coal became freely available again.  I have no criticism whatever to offer of the action of the previous Government in disposing of those stocks as opportunity offered and at the price that they could realise.  Any criticism to which they are open turns entirely upon the fact that they failed to meet that loss as it arose. I know that in this matter Deputy Morrissey, if he were free to speak his mind, would agree with me.  The loss to the country in unnecessary interest payments, because the Coalition Minister for Finance struck out of the Estimates prepared by my predecessor in each of three years, the provision proposed for the payment of this sum, amounts to about £375,000.  That amount of money went down the drain for no other reason except that it was desired to keep the figure upon the cover of the Book of Estimates down below what it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey in the course of this debate gave a very fair and very objective account of the circumstances in which that reserve stock came into existence.  I should, perhaps, add to it in one or two respects.  We emerged from the war period with certain reserve stocks of coal, certain iron rations, which were held intact until the war was over but in the winter of 1945-46 these stocks were put into use in the expectation that the emergency was over and that in the year 1946 fuel supplies would again become fairly normal and, may I say, with the intention of minimising the probable loss to the Exchequer if these stocks were held for a further period.  But the <Col N="944" /> winter of 1946-47 was the worst in living memory, as Deputy Morrissey said.  For three months this country was ice-bound but, far more important from the point of view of coal supplies, so was Britain, and coal production almost ceased in Great Britain. So limited was the trickle of coal which came into this country that not merely were gas and electricity supplies very severely rationed but rail transport practically stopped.  Deputies may not now remember that for a long period in the beginning of that year rail services were reduced to two main line trains per week.</P>
    <P>There was considerable hardship suffered by the public by reason of the fact that not merely were fuel supplies scarce but, because of the abnormal weather, the turf available was of a very, very poor quality.  Anybody who chooses to turn to the Dáil Debates of 1947 will find that there was no subject we discussed more frequently in that year than fuel supplies and there was a continuous demand from every section of the House and from every public authority in the country that the experience of the winter of 1946-47 should not be repeated in the following winter.  We set out to build up reserve stocks of turf, firewood and American coal.</P>
    <P>The American coal was purchased as obtainable.  It was, I think, the first year in which America shipped coal in any quantity to European countries. There was not merely a certain reluctance on the part of American coal producers to enter into the trade, which they did not think would be permanent, but there was an absence of harbour and transport facilities as well, and we had to take the coal on a &ldquo;run of the mine&rdquo; basis as we could get it.</P>
    <P>The reserve stocks accumulated during 1947 would not, however, have been more than enough to carry us through the winter of 1947-48 if conditions during that winter had been as we had anticipated.  I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, went to Britain towards the end of 1947 for the purpose of entering into trade negotiations, and the one thing I was striving to get out of these negotiations was some increase in British coal deliveries or at least some promise of an improvement <Col N="945" /> in their deliveries during the following year.  I got that promise. It was a promise to increase deliveries to approximately 20,000 tons per week, which would be 1,000,000 tons per year, commencing in April of 1948.  No amount of pressure by me secured from the British Government any promise to expand deliveries earlier than April of 1948.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which had caused the anxiety here, which induced us to exert ourselves to build up these reserve stocks, had been, of course, duplicated in Great Britain.  The British Government was determined, if possible, not to have a repetition of the experiences of the previous winter during the winter of 1947-48.  They also were building up reserve stocks.  As it turned out, they accumulated more stocks than they required.  The winter was particularly mild.  Coal production was maintained at a higher level than had been estimated and just about Christmas of 1947 I began to receive reports that coal was arriving in far greater quantities than previously from Britain and that coal merchants here were receiving offers of coal from Britain in very substantial quantities. In fact, British coal was then on offer in unrestricted quantities, three months prior to the time which the British Government had anticipated.  So much so that, in order to avail of the situation, to give the advantage of the cheaper and better fuel which these supplies represented, we derationed coal at the beginning of January, 1948, and permitted its unrestricted purchase for household consumption. Prior to that, coal for household consumption was not permitted at all and even industrial supplies were rationed.</P>
    <P>That meant that we at the same time took a decision that these reserve stocks which had been accumulated against the winter would be held as reserve stocks and, in fact, they were no longer drawn upon for either industrial or domestic purposes during the remainder of that winter and were there when the change of Government took place.</P>
    <P>There may be some criticism of me in this, that when these abundant supplies of British coal began to <Col N="946" /> arrive and rationing of coal for domestic purposes was withdrawn I did not at the same time shut down upon the deliveries of firewood and turf to the dumps.  If I say there was an election in progress, I am not pleading that it was political considerations that produced that decision.  It just meant that I realised that there was going to be a problem associated with the transition from that emergency fuel production to the normal circumstances which then appeared likely to be at hand, that the handling of that transition problem in a manner which would be fair to the individuals who were engaging in that fuel transport business and the associated activities would be difficult and that it would take some time to taper off that emergency activity to the requirements of normal times.</P>
    <P>That reserve stock was there and was disposed of.  It is practically all gone now.  What we are doing with this Supplementary Estimate is repaying to Fuel Importers, Limited, the loss they incurred in selling these stocks at less than it cost them to accumulate them.  That loss occurred in each year, and it should have been met in each year.  Instead of the provision proposed by my predecessor as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Coalition Minister for Finance merely put in a token figure of £5 against the sub-head in the Estimate each year.</P>
    <P>I have been asked why we have to pay it now.  The answer should be obvious.  First of all, I think it is very desirable that this unnecessary payment of interest should cease.  Most of us could think of a lot more useful things to do with £375,000 than paying it out in interest unnecessarily to a bank.  Secondly, and more important, we now have again the task of building up a reserve stock.  Fuel difficulties have been acute this year and it was decided to resume the importation of American coal and to build up another reserve stock.  That has to be financed.  When, early this year, my predecessor discussed this matter with Fuel Importers, Limited, and they went to their bankers to secure assistance in financing the importation of substantial quantities of American coal <Col N="947" /> and the accumulation of reserves, their bankers naturally referred them to the fact that they had paid nothing off the old debt for three years.</P>

My predecessor thought they should be paid, but they were not paid. When the question of getting new and more substantial bank finance to facilitate the importation of American coal and the accumulation of reserve stock arose, there was an arrangement with the bank under which the amount due in respect of 1948 and the subsequent period would be repaid.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment should have been made.  Deputy Dillon, Deputy D. Costello, Deputy O'Higgins and some other Deputies chose to misinterpret what I said concerning the decision of the Government&mdash;that they are not going to try to pay this £3,000,000 in this financial year by imposing supplementary taxes for the purpose.  Perhaps it is no harm that I <Col N="949" /> should say a few words to relate this Estimate to the Budget position which was under discussion previously. Every Deputy knows what a Budget is.  There is a list of services upon which the Government propose to spend money and in the Budget statement the Minister for Finance announces the Government proposals for getting money to pay for these services.  The Minister for Finance segregates these services into two classes, what he calls the above-the-line services, the cost of which is defrayed out of tax revenue, and the below-the-line services, the cost of which is defrayed by borrowing.  We might criticise the segregation of particular services into one or the other class, but that was the practice and it was what Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, did in May this year.</P>
      <P>The point I want to get clear is that, taking Deputy McGilligan's Budget as he prepared it, we find the estimated expenditure on the above-the-line services will exceed by approximately £4,000,000 the tax revenue which will be received.  There will be a deficit on these services to that extent and that deficit will have to be defrayed by borrowing.  We have decided not to meet it by a supplementary Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that is only an estimated amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Over and above that deficit on Deputy McGilligan's Budget as he prepared it, we have to add other expenditure against which he made no provision either above the line or below the line.  This is one of them.  He knew at the time of the Budget that this amount would have to be paid out during the year.  He knew there would be a loss incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann which would have to be met during the year.  There were some other expenditures for which we have introduced Supplementary Estimates which were not referred to in the Budget statement and which were not provided for in either category of expenditure, either as normal services to be met out of tax revenue or as capital services to be met by borrowing. <Col N="950" /> The total amount of additional money which the Minister for Finance must find is approximately £10,000,000. Deputy Costello and Deputy O'Higgins spoke as if it was merely a matter of saying that it should be added to the national debt.  The money has to be raised.</P>
      <P>The point I was trying to make in the speeches I delivered on the Supplies and Services Bill was that, if we raise the money for that purpose, we cannot have it for other purposes as well.  I mentioned that the total amount which Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, was able to raise by borrowing during his whole period of office averaged £15,000,000 per year. That £15,000,000 per year was far below the amount required to finance necessary and desirable capital development on housing, electricity development, turf production, hospital construction and other things which we want to see done.  If we revert to borrowing for purposes of this kind, then, of course, there will be nothing at all available for other desirable developments we want to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that this will be met out of current revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously not.  The revenue will be short by £10,000,000 of the amount necessary to cover the Budget deficit and these Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we get this clear as it is very important?  We had a figure of £10,000,000 thrown around by the Minister, by the Minister for Finance and by the Taoiseach. Subsequently, we had a figure of £5,000,000.  We had some other figure given on the third occasion.  Now we are back to the £10,000,000 again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the Budget as Deputy McGilligan prepared it, there will be a deficit of between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He left out of the Budget altogether this payment to Fuel Importers, Limited, the losses on <Col N="951" /> Córas Iompair Éireann, and other charges.  Now, whether these should have been properly charged against tax revenue or could legitimately be borrowed for does not affect the position.  As far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, he is £10,000,000 short.  We always met this charge out of tax revenue and I think that was good, sound financial practice.  However, I will not argue the matter.</P>

The British Government has decided in similar circumstances, and, may I point out, with the agreement of the Labour Party there, deliberately to restrict credit and they have instructed the banks to do so, by raising the rate of interest on advances, and to restrict new capital issues for industrial purposes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I want to say in relation to the disposal of these 1948 stocks.  Deputy Dillon, as usual, made a personal attack on a member of this House, Deputy Briscoe.  From my own knowledge of the situation that attack was completely unjustified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947 we were buying American coal.  Various people came and told us that supplies could be got from South Africa and even from India.  It was duly announced that Fuel Importers, Limited, would not themselves organise <Col N="953" /> the purchase of coal in any country other than America but that they were prepared to buy delivered at the quayside in Dublin coal brought there from these other areas by any private company at the same price as they were paying for American coal.  Various people entered into the business of organising shipments from South Africa to sell to Fuel Importers.  I do not think those who entered into that business made much money out of it. The quantity they could bring in was limited.  The firm with which the Deputy mentioned was associated did participate in the business and in my opinion did it largely out of a desire to help the country in a difficulty as well as a normal commercial venture.</P>
    <P>In relation to our present reserve stocks, if there is to be criticism of a Government for taking financial risks in maintaining reserves the effect will be wholly undesirable.  As Deputy Norton said, the reserve stock of American coal which we are now building up will, if there is no intensification of the present difficulties or no world war, at some stage involve the Exchequer in a financial risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true of any insurance premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That coal is costing £8 per ton.  It is our intention to build up a reserve dump of 200,000 tons, and that dump will be held intact until the need for it has disappeared, until the price of coal falls and supplies at cheaper prices are freely available.  At that stage presumably the responsible Government will decide to get rid of this reserve stock, and that Government will have to sell at whatever price they can get, and there will be some financial loss.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, there is another emergency and a curtailment of coal supplies that stock will involve no financial loss but, as Deputy Morrissey has said, nobody can ensure against these dangers of building up reserve stocks without facing the risk of financial loss.  I submit that it is both unreasonable and unfair to criticise in retrospect a Government that takes that step when that financial loss has to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> I realise now that I dissipated the reserve stocks that were held in the winter of 1945-46 in order to avoid a financial loss to the Exchequer.  I made a mistake.  It would have been far better to have incurred financial loss and held those stocks into the following winter.  I assumed that 1946 would see the end of war-time scarcities. Nobody could have foretold the abnormal circumstances of the following winter.  But Governments will hesitate to take risks involved in organising precautionary measures of this kind if the only reward they get for their precautions is a criticism of the kind Deputy Dillon expressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, and it was quoted, that there was a reserve stock of fuel, that it should be sold for whatever price could be got for it, and the loss added to the national debt, and decide that we had got out of the war situation cheaply.</P>
      <P>I have been asked about future fuel prospects.  According to recent pronouncements by the British Government they will have further fuel difficulties there this winter.  They say their reserves, including those in London, are far below the target figures.  They are arranging to import American coal to supplement their own production.  I think I am safe in saying that there is no present prospect of improvement in the coal situation during the next year which should discourage private turf producers from continuing their activities during that period.  So far as it is possible to foresee the future it can be said that the need will continue for all the private hand-won turf that can be produced in the next season.  The Government will take measures to assist that production through the provision of funds for the construction of bog roads and other facilities, and by organising, where required, marketing arrangements through Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the position may be after 1952 I do not know.  I have had two completely contradictory estimates from people who are both entitled to <Col N="955" /> be regarded as authorities.  One authority told me to make our plans for the future on the assumption that British coal would not be available to us at all.  The other said he thought that British coal production difficulties were likely to be resolved, and that their position in the future would be easier.  Obviously, the wise course for us to take is to organise our own fuel resources so as to minimise the degree to which our industrial and commercial activities are dependent on imports from abroad.</P>

      <P>The imports to the end of the year will be about 450,000 tons. Other purchases have been made if shipment is possible, but there will be enough American coal to supplement the British supplies to meet all requirements, plus the 200,000 tons, in addition, for reserve purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the British trade agreement.  I do not think I should say much about it.  At <Col N="956" /> least, I do not want to appear to be arguing against the case which I may, in an official capacity, have to make. It is true, however, that the trade agreement of 1948 did not contain any arrangements regarding the price at which British coal was to be sold, as it was not contemplated at any time that price would be a problem.  It is also true that under the terms of the agreement either party was entitled to request a conference to reconsider its provisions, if circumstances changed. The conference which Deputy Norton attended indicated that that step had, in fact, been taken by the British Government when they found that they were unlikely to fulfil their contract. As I said here on my return from London in July last, the attitude of the British Minister for Fuel and Power was clearly and frankly stated in the words which I then quoted: &ldquo;We are defaulting on our contract and we are ashamed of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey referred to complaints which he had received that wet turf was being delivered by merchants in Cork.  I want to make it clear that Fuel Importers, Limited, are not engaged in turf sales.  There is no official organisation participating in turf sales. The turf that is being produced by private turf producers is being bought by individual fuel merchants, and there is certainly no obligation on those merchants to buy turf from anyone if it is not of first-class quality.  Anyone who accepts inferior turf from a fuel merchant has only himself to blame. If there are fuel merchants in Cork selling wet or inferior turf, then I think the sooner the people in Cork make up their minds to transfer their custom to other merchants who are making a better effort to meet their needs, the better it will be for themselves.</P>
    <P>The circumstances are entirely different now from what they were during the war years.  During the war years, a State organisation was set up for the purpose of taking all the turf it could get, and all it could get, good, bad or indifferent was still far short of the total requirements of the cities in the eastern areas.  Admittedly, there was no very close check on the quality <Col N="957" /> of the turf purchased, and many turf producers did not act fairly with the country at that period.  But there is certainly no situation now which justifies any fuel merchant buying inferior fuel from a producer, and less justification for any citizen accepting inferior turf from a fuel merchant.  I do not think there is any other point that I have to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given consideration to the serious position which has developed and is likely to develop in regard to the production of anthracite coal here?  The consumption has gone up enormously.  The question is, can production be increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether home production can be increased is a subject on which I would not like to give an opinion.  I think that the operators of the coal mines here have every inducement to expand and get production up to the maximum.  Coal mining, however, is not like the manufacture of sausages.  You cannot get more by making the machine run faster.  I think it is probably true to say, having regard to the number of skilled coal miners&mdash;those who work on the coal face&mdash;available and other limiting factors, the production of our own anthracite is at the maximum.  We are getting some supplies from Great Britain, and we have to supplement these by American supplies which are being imported at in or around £11 a ton.  The result is that the average price of the anthracite available is extraordinarily high.  The development of anthracite production at home is something which we wish to encourage.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,300 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1952, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-in-Aid, Compensation and other Payments in connection with Injuries to Property (No. 24 of <Col N="958" /> 1941) and payments of Compensation for Death or Personal Injuries.</P>
    <P>The title of this Estimate may be somewhat misleading, since neither death nor personal injuries are involved, but rather the destruction of property arising out of the fire which took place on the premises of the National Theatre Society in Abbey Street in July last.  The purpose for which the money is required is to enable the National Theatre, or the Abbey Theatre, as it is more properly called, to be carried on and to be maintained until the premises are rebuilt, as we hope will be done in due course.</P>
    <P>I do not wish the House to assume from what I have said that the £4,300 will be sufficient to tide the Abbey over until the theatre is rebuilt, but it is the sum which the directors of the National Theatre Society have estimated will be required to enable them to continue for the balance of the financial year.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,683,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come <Col N="959" /> in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1952, for Increases in Remuneration of Civil Servants, Members of the Garda Síochána and of the Defence Forces, and of Teachers.</P>
    <P>The amount of this Estimate which is ascribable to increases in remuneration to the Civil Service is £1,875,000.  This represents the cost during the present financial year of implementing, on the one hand, the awards made by the Civil Service Arbitration Board which was set up last year and, on the other hand, certain settlements made by our predecessors through conciliation.  These awards and settlements were made during the trial year of the scheme, which ended on 31st March, 1951.</P>
    <P>By far the greater portion of the sum required for the Civil Service remuneration is due to the award made by the Civil Service Arbitration Board in May, 1951, on the claim for a general increase in Civil Service pay arising out of the increase in the cost of living.  As I indicated in the House last June, the cost of this award, together with the concurrent settlement of the claims of the higher Civil Servants, is estimated at £1,395,000 annually.  In view of the fact that retrospective payment is being made to 15th January, a further sum of £290,000 is necessary to meet the charge which must be met during this current year.</P>
    <P>The amount of the Supplementary Estimate, which represents awards and settlements under the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration machinery, apart from the general revision of Civil Service pay, is £190,000.</P>
    <P>The other Civil Service arbitration awards&mdash;there were only two&mdash;were the award on a claim for steeper increments for Post Office manipulative classes and the award on a salary claim made on behalf of forestry inspectors in the Land Commission.  The first-mentioned of these awards amounts approximately to £25,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Among the principal conciliation settlements I should mention the large-scale reorganisation of the Post Office engineering classes, estimated to <Col N="960" /> cost £48,000 in the year, and the settlement of a salary claim by officers of the Customs and Excise Branch, estimated to cost £34,840&mdash;approximately, of course&mdash;together with a settlement of a salary claim from the preventive grades in the revenue service, which will cost £21,600, also approximately.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Report of the Civil Service Arbitration Board, it was decided that a revision of pay and allowances of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces should be settled on the basis of the arbitration findings in the case of the Civil Service.  I stated last June that the upward revision of pay and allowances of these groups would have to be provided for and, accordingly, in the Supplementary Estimate provision is made for an increased amount of £399,000 to cover the increases granted, with effect as from 15th January, 1951, in the pay and allowances of the members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also includes provision to the extent of £339,000 to cover the increases granted, similarly with effect as from 15th January, to officers, N.C.O.s, and men of the Defence Forces, including the First Line Reserve, the F.C.A. and Sluagh Mara.  With certain minor exceptions, designed to remove anomalies, the increases granted to the officers of the Defence Forces were calculated on the same basis as the increases granted to civil servants.</P>
    <P>The provision for increased remuneration to teachers includes the cost in the present financial year of increases in the salaries and allowances of national teachers payable under the terms of an agreement recorded in July last by the National Teachers' Conciliation Council, which had considered and examined the claim for increased remuneration made by national teachers.  Provision is also made in the Estimate for the additional contribution payable towards the cost of the increases in remuneration of vocational teachers which were granted on the same terms as the increases allowed to civil servants, and these likewise became effective as from the 15th January last.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Provision is also made for increased remuneration to meet the claim which was made by the secondary teachers. This claim has now been satisfactorily dealt with.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the total cost to the State of the increases in remuneration granted to national and vocational teachers will not, for various reasons, mature in the current financial year.  In the next few years the cost to the State of the increases granted to these teachers will be of the order of £1,000,000 a year.</P>

I do not want to go into it at any length. The Minister did assert in the House that his predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, deliberately decided to refuse to make any provision for this amount when he was framing his Budget in May last.  I do not see how any Minister for Finance, even Deputy MacEntee, if he was Minister for Finance at the time, could have made any provision in the Budget of this year seeing that the award was not received by the Government before the Budget was prepared.  Would the Minister please give me the dates I have asked for? I am sure he has them at his fingertips and that he will give us the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise Deputy Davin not to arouse me if he wants the House to adjourn before 12 because I would open a very wide field on this Supplementary Estimate.  The position is the report was dated 24th May, 1951, but it was well known to my predecessor that the arbitration board had been set up weeks before and that the claim was to be heard.  It was known what the claims of the Civil Service were and would amount to.  I assume, when the then Minister for Health and the Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, issued a circular letter to the health authorities on the 4th May, 1951, the date let me point out on which the forthcoming dissolution was announced, and when the Minister for Local Government issued a similar letter to local authorities dealing with local authority employees and when the Minister for Social Welfare issued a circular letter on the 7th May to the social welfare authorities, that they did not do all this without previous consultation with the Minister for Finance.  They were acting, I assume, as a Government with collective responsibility and with a co-ordinated policy and surely the Minister for Finance did not agree that these actions should be taken without being informed, first, as to what they were likely to cost and what were the probable reactions on the Civil Service and on the claim which was being made by the civil servants for increased remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the Minister for Finance could have certainly made a very close estimate as to what was likely to emerge from the arbitration proceedings which were about to commence and for which the date had been fixed before his Budget speech was made here in the House.  As a man of great intelligence, I think he could not have been unaware of what the reactions on the arbitration award would have been of these circulars. Surely he would have assumed, as in fact, turned out to be the case, that the civil servants would base their claim largely upon the action which had already been taken by certain members of the Government in regard to remuneration and that they would enforce that point of view on the arbitrator <Col N="963" /> and that the arbitrator would have to give very great weight to it.</P>
    <P>On the basis, therefore, of what was likely to be the consequence of the action which had been taken by his colleagues, the Minister for Finance was, in my view, in a position to make a very close estimate indeed as to what additional sum would require to be provided in this year's Budget to meet the cost of the arbitration award.  That is all I want to say on the matter at this stage.  I would not have mentioned it if Deputy Davin had not raised it because, as I said, I understood it had been the desire of the House not to prolong the business unduly this evening. I was as modest and placatory as I possibly could have been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very early after this Government came into office.  I just want to make that clear.  I have not the precise date.  The previous Government decided on the 8th June to accept the award.  I announced on the 20th June that the Government would accept the award, but there was no formal Government decision.  We were merely aware of the decision which had been taken by our predecessors and decided to honour it.  I should say that, in view of the fact that the arbitration board had been set up, we would have accepted the award in any event even if the matter had been left to our independent decision.  That does not necessarily mean that it would apply in the case of a new arbitration. It is quite clear from the amount of this Estimate that the power to impose charges on the revenue of this State should be very jealously safeguarded by this House and by the Government responsible to it.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,230,000 be granted to defray the <Col N="964" /> Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1952, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1947, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933); for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); for expenses in connection with the issue of Medals and Certificates; and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
    <P>In order to give Deputies an explanation in simple terms of how the total of the Estimate was arrived it, I think I had better begin by quoting certain figures.  It is anticipated that the operating losses of Córas Iompair Éireann in the present year, including expenditure on renewals and replacements, will amount to £1,236,560. Fixed charges, excluding the interest on transport stock which in the present year will be paid out of the Central Fund but which will be due for repayment to the Central Fund by Córas Iompair Éireann later, will amount to £224,522, these fixed charges being contributions to pension funds, £180,000, and interest payable in respect of the Fishguard and Rosslare Harbours Company, £44,522.  Repayments to the Central Fund of interest on transport stock advanced by the Central Fund in July, 1950 and January 1951 will amount to £433,000.  In addition, the company estimates that the cost of replacing certain materials used during the current year because of higher prices will involve an increased charge of £204,000, and they have in their minds a figure of £241,000 as the cost of certain exceptional stocks of essential materials built up in anticipation of supply difficulties.  Against the total of these sums, which is £2,339 082, there is a credit of £66,372 in respect of rent and interest receivable, so that the total amount required is £2,272,710 which, for the purposes of the Estimate, has been rounded off to £2,250,000.</P>
    <P>In August last, the board of Córas Iompair Éireann requested financial assistance.  It then estimated that the deficit for the year ending March <Col N="965" /> 31st, 1952, without taking into account interest on transport stock, would amount to £1,400,000, and it stated that the sum of £600,000 was urgently required to enable the board to meet its current needs.  As there was no possibility of getting that amount voted by the Dáil before the Dáil reassembled for the present session, and as there was no provision in the annual Estimate for any payment to the board, the board was authorised by the Minister for Finance to borrow up to the limit of £500,000 in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of the Transport Act, 1950.  That sum was borrowed and represents the total amount which the board can procure in that way.  It is consequently necessary to put them in funds at once in order to enable them to meet current outgoings. A Supplementary Estimate is necessary because there was no provision for payments to Córas Iompair Éireann in the main Estimate of the Department for the year.</P>
    <P>The theoretical ground upon which provision for advances to Córas Iompair Éireann was deleted from the Estimate was that the board was expected so to increase its fares and charges during the year that no loss would in fact result.  The board stated that they did not think that would be possible, and early in March last they estimated their requirements for the financial year to be £1,997,000 and they did not themselves propose to attempt to recover more than £1,000,000 by higher fares.  They estimated then that a subsidy of £1,000,000 would be required.  For reasons of which I am not fully aware, fares were not, in fact, increased until September 10th.</P>
    <P>The board estimate that the additional fares which came into operation on September 10th will in a full year yield an additional £1,179,000.  It is clear, therefore, having regard to the experience of this year, that even that increase in fares will not allow Córas Iompair Éireann to break level if their experience next year is the same as it has been this year&mdash;that is to say, if the traffic available to them remains unaltered, or if their operating costs remain the same.  That increase in revenue would allow the board to break level on operating costs, but it would <Col N="966" /> not provide anything over and above operating expenditure to meet fixed charges or interest upon transport stock.  The board has, however, expressed to me the view that the present rates and fares are as high as the traffic will bear, and that any attempt to deal with the situation by increasing them further would not, in fact, bring in additional revenue because the loss of traffic would offset the effect of the increase.</P>
    <P>I met the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann shortly after I resumed office and I discussed the position with the undertaking in some detail.  I asked the board to furnish me with information as to the steps which they had already taken to reduce the operating costs of the various services and as to the effect of these measures, and for information about any further proposals which they had in mind to achieve economies.  I asked them to give me their plans for the future reorganisation of the undertaking and, particularly, to report upon the possibility of expediting the re-equipment programme which they have prepared and which is an essential part of any reorganisation scheme.  The board had previously proposed to me, as I mentioned in the Dáil at the time, that their problem should be relieved by imposing further and quite drastic restrictions upon private transport&mdash;by that I mean the transportation of goods by private lorries.  I asked them to submit these proposals in detail.  I have received the observations of the board in that regard but I have not had an opportunity of examining them in detail or of coming to any conclusion on them.</P>
    <P>I think that the House will agree that the aim should be to make the public transport services provided by Córas Iompair Éireann pay their way, that is, to give them the support necessary to secure the volume of traffic that will permit of economical working, subject to practical measures being adopted to achieve efficiency and economy in operation.  If, arising out of the proposals which the board has made to me, any decisions are required from the Government, and particularly, of course, if any proposals for legislation should emerge, the matter will come before the Dáil.  However, I <Col N="967" /> cannot say yet whether that will be the case.</P>
    <P>Over and above the money required by Córas Iompair Éireann to meet the deficit in its revenue, the board have asked for authority to raise new capital to the amount of £2,500,000.  It is estimated that of the new capital required, approximately £600,000 will be expended before the end of the financial year mainly on the purchase of diesel rail cars and on the building of additional omnibuses, lorries, wagons and carriages.  The measures to be taken to provide that additional capital to the board are under consideration. There is likely to be some problem for the Minister for Finance to solve in that connection.  It is recognised, however, that if it is the aim of the Government in relation to transport services to provide efficient services capable of earning revenue to an extent that will avoid calling upon subsidies from public funds then quite substantial capital expenditure upon reorganisation and re-equipment may be required.</P>
    <P>We need this Vote now, before, the end of this year, so that the Exchequer will have authority to pay out money, as needed, to Córas Iompair Éireann. The full amount will be needed before the end of the financial year but the amount immediately required will be advanced at once.  There is no other source from which Córas Iompair Éireann can get money except from the Exchequer.  It has already secured bank accommodation to the full limit permitted by the Act and unless this amount is provided the company will find itself in immediate difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the Minister when he says that the money has to be provided if the services are to be kept in operation. I am also in agreement with him though he did not, as I can understand on an occasion like this, travel very far with it, that we are not going to put the national transport undertaking on a profit-earning basis or even in a position to break even without some very drastic changes in the whole transport set-up in this country.  I do <Col N="968" /> not see how we can expect the national transport undertaking to operate on strictly commercial lines if we ourselves here in this House prevent them from doing so because we have compelled the national transport undertaking to provide services that no commercial undertaking would provide on a purely commercial basis.  For national reasons we have insisted that the national transport undertaking, even, as a matter of fact, when it was in private hands, should maintain and operate&mdash;and even where they were not operating except on very rare occasions, maintain in a workable way &mdash;the many services in this country on which they were losing heavily.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows and I know that if this company is to be put in a position to pay its way, if it is to be put in a position so to operate that it will not be necessary to come to this House for sums of money to keep the services going, somebody will have to have sufficient moral courage to come before this House with proposals which will put them in a position if not to operate on a profit-earning basis at least to break even.</P>
      <P>The estimated operating loss of Córas Iompair Éireann in the period we are discussing is approximately £1,250,000.  I think I would be correct in saying that increases in wages and salaries and increases in the price of coal and some other purchases which Córas Iompair Éireann as a transport undertaking had to meet in the last 12 months would account for more than the £1,250,000 in itself.  I am speaking now from recollection but I think that the increases in wages and salaries alone would run somewhere between £600,000 and £750,000.  Everybody knows that the increase in the price of coal in the last 12 months has been very substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would perhaps be able to give us a closer figure than I can at the moment of what that means to an undertaking like Córas Iompair Éireann.  I think Córas Iompair Éireann purchases and uses somewhere in the neighbourhood of 250,000 tons of coal per year.  It will be realised that an increase of £1 or of a few pounds per ton would mean a very <Col N="969" /> substantial additional burden on the company.  Then there is the matter of renewals and replacements and repairs. I do not know what it must have cost this transport company over the past five, six or seven years to try to keep on the road, whether it be the macadam road or the iron road, stock which should have been scrapped many years ago.  The cost of repairs to wagons, old lorries, carriages and so forth that have long passed the stage of economic operation is an important consideration.  I do not want to go into any of that at the moment because this is not the time to do so.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, also, that this transport undertaking, for some reason or another, has been subject to more industrial disturbances in recent years than, I think, any other undertaking in the country.  I am not going into the merits of any of the strikes or disputes but, undoubtedly, every strike, particularly if it is a major strike, means not merely immediate loss to the transport undertaking but a permanent loss.</P>
    <P>If the services are to be dislocated from time to time, then those engaged in industry and commerce and whose goods have to be transported through the State will naturally, in order to ensure the continued operation of their own business, cease to rely upon an undertaking which is so often disturbed and dislocated and will resort to their own transport.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that a considerable amount of the loss that we have to make good is due, like many other things, to the war period, when it was not possible to get replacements or renewals.  Even though it may be said that renewals are not being met out of anything like this, the repairs and replacements, the efforts to keep existing rolling stock in a usable condition, add very considerably to it. However, I feel sure that the Minister agrees with me in this&mdash;I know the solution to it is not easy and that the solution, when it comes, will not be very popular&mdash;if this House wants to have a national transport undertaking operating on a commercial basis, then there must be a drastic change.  The <Col N="970" /> extraordinary thing is that those who clamour most about any reduction, much less the abolition, of an existing rail service are very often the people who resort to it least.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the directors &mdash;some of them, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but the fact is that we have to maintain a rail service and that if the House would face up to its responsibilities it could be maintained and operated on a commercial basis.  The transport situation is absolutely chaotic and the cost of the chaos is reflected not merely here but also in the road charges of every local authority. There are vehicles on our roads of a size and a weight for which our roads were never built or intended and for which our roads cannot be maintained, and the cost of them to the taxpaying and ratepaying community is very heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, perhaps, opening the door a little now, but when we are criticising Córas Iompair Éireann and saying that we must provide a couple of million pounds to straighten its accounts over 12 months' operation, I often wonder whether anyone has ever tried to calculate the cost to the community of the wear and tear on our roads.  I know we are met with the answer that those who use the roads pay for them and pay tax.  It is not adverted to as often as it should be that the tax paid by some of the heaviest vehicles would not pay the wages of one surface man for 12 months.  I do not want to deprive either the owners of commercial lorries, those who have plates, or the private lorry owners of any of their rights, but these people insist on carrying on their own lorries the goods which they can carry on a basis remunerative to themselves, while they want the railways, and even Córas Iompair Éireann road transport, available to carry for them the goods which they do not want to carry themselves or which it will not pay them to carry for themselves, or which their own vehicles are not constructed to carry. It is well known that the general practice is to foist on to Córas Iompair Éireann the goods that are least profitable <Col N="971" /> from the point of view of transport.</P>
    <P>Also, it has to be recognised that Córas Iompair Éireann has to maintain its own roads&mdash;I am talking about the iron road&mdash;and pay for that maintenance, while they also pay fairly substantial rates to the local authorities. However, perhaps I am going a bit too far into this at the moment. It will have to be tackled some day by somebody and this House will have to make up its mind as to whether it wants the service to try to continue operating under the difficulties under which it has been forced to operate in recent years, or whether it is to be given a chance to compete with other transport and to pay its way.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles&mdash;I think the Minister will agree with me&mdash;is that we have far too much transport in this country.  We have about three times as many commercial vehicles as are required to transport the country's merchandise&mdash;at least three times as many.  People talk about Córas Iompair Éireann having a monopoly. Córas Iompair Éireann have no monopoly except a monopoly of the least profitable merchandise that has to be carried.  People talk about Córas Iompair Éireann having a monopoly of road freight.  I do not know what the position is at the moment, but my recollection is that when I was in Industry and Commerce, Córas Iompair Éireann had something in the neighbourhood of 400 or 450 commercial vehicles, out of something like 10,000 registered commercial vehicles. Then we talk about a monopoly.</P>
    <P>I can only express the hope that the Minister&mdash;or whoever may be sitting in his chair in 12 months' time&mdash;will not have to come to this House for as large or a larger sum than we are faced with here to-day.  I want to say quite frankly, from what I know and what I anticipate for the future, that unless this transport question is tackled in a realistic way, there is no use in our thinking we will not have a similar Estimate next year&mdash;whether by way of Supplementary Estimate or by way of provision in the Budget&mdash;and there is no use in thinking for one moment <Col N="972" /> that we will not be faced year in and year out with a subsidy of this size. If it is necessary, as it has been considered necessary up to this, that uneconomic services should be provided in the interests of the country by the national transport undertaking, the people will have to make up their minds that they will have to pay for them.  That is the position so far as I see it.</P>
    <P>I have perhaps wandered a little from the actual Estimate, but I do not think I really have, because the matters I have touched upon are the matters which are responsible for the fact that the Minister has to come here this morning to ask for this Supplementary Estimate.  I know that it is a difficult problem and a very complex problem, a matter for which a solution cannot be produced overnight, but we are perhaps in a better position now to appreciate what the difficulties are, what they are likely to be in the future and what has to be done to remedy them than we were at any time up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an appalling thing that this House and the taxpayers should be called upon to make such a heavy contribution to the cost of transport. It is even more disquieting to feel that this demand will be repeated again and again in the future.  While, as Deputy Morrissey has said, if we want a national transport system, we must pay for it, it is necessary for us to ask ourselves whether this national transport company is as efficient as it could be.  We are called upon now to vote this sum in order to meet losses, and the House and the country are entitled to know, if it can be ascertained, where exactly these losses have occurred.  I am not suggesting that the losses are avoidable, but it is necessary to know in what particular branch of the transport service these losses have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operations of Córas Iompair Éireann may be divided in two main sections&mdash;the conveyance of passengers and the conveyance of goods&mdash;and it would be desirable to know whether these losses have occurred in respect of the conveyance of passengers or goods. If they have occurred under both these <Col N="973" /> headings, we might go further and ask ourselves whether the losses have occurred under the headings of rail or road transport.  We might find that they have occurred under both headings, and we might then try to break down the figures still further and find, if losses have been incurred in the conveyance of passengers, whether they have arisen in the City of Dublin and the immediate area or in the rural areas.  It is necessary to find out at what particular points the losses have occurred.  We might also try to ascertain whether the losses have been more severe in road freight services or rail freight services, or whether they have been more severe in road passenger services as against rail passenger services. It is desirable that the House should know where the most severe losses have occurred, and having ascertained that, to decide whether anything can be done to mitigate or reduce these losses.</P>
    <P>There has been a recommendation made to the Minister, as he has indicated, for more drastic restrictions on private transport.  Everyone will agree that that is a very far-reaching demand and one which the Minister will not accede to without very careful consideration.  Before any further restrictions are placed upon private enterprise in transport, a public inquiry into the whole system and operation of transport should be held. The Minister may not feel very favourable to such an idea, because so many investigations and inquiries have been carried out over a number of years and so many drastic changes and reorganisations have taken place that one does not feel anxious to open up the whole field of operations again, but we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the community generally feel that the operations of Córas Iompair Éireann are not, in all fields, efficient. Every businessman will tell you that he sees evidence of inefficiency and waste in regard to road transport.  They will tell you of lorries underloaded and taking a very long time to travel from place to place, losing time in order to build up claims for overtime. All these complaints are frequently made and it is very often difficult to substantiate them, but they are so <Col N="974" /> widespread that they deserve to be investigated.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the operation of a fleet of road transport lorries is a very difficult matter.  Any businessman with even three, four or five lorries on the road knows how hard it is to keep these lorries fully occupied and carrying loads in every direction and so to organise operations that they will pay their way and work to their fullest capacity.  How much more difficult is it to organise hundreds of lorries operating all over the country, and, as Deputy Morrissey said, having to comply with statutory obligations? The Minister should undertake some kind of investigation into the matter and the people who complain about the transport system, about inefficiency, should be given an opportunity of making these complaints at a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is the question of the diversion of an undue amount of traffic to the roads and the cost to the taxpaying and ratepaying community of maintaining these roads.  In addition, there is the question of overloaded or over-weighted lorries operating on road surfaces that are unfit to carry them.  Coming to the city, I notice a portion of the road from Blessington to Dublin on which enormous sums have been spent over the past few years in an effort to keep the surface intact.  Notwithstanding the fact that a large portion of the road was resurfaced within the past year, that road has broken up again because lorries of 15 and 20 tons weight carrying gravel and other building materials travel over it.</P>
    <P>I think that both Córas Iompair Éireann and private lorry owners should be compelled to operate with a maximum lorry weight.  There again, you come up against the question of the higher cost of lorries.  You have got to decide whether it is better to save at the cost of the servicing of the road or try to save on the privately owned lorries.  Whatever way the money is spent it will be a heavy expenditure. I think there is no justification for putting on a road surface transport that it is unable to carry. Possibly the road surface could be put <Col N="975" /> in a position to carry it, but the road could not carry it except it was laid down with reinforced concrete.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to think very carefully before imposing further restrictions on the private lorries. Before doing so, it might be desirable to consider whether it might be possible for Córas Iompair Éireann to restrict its own operations.  In other words, to transfer to private enterprise certain work which is at present being done by Córas Iompair Éireann.  I have frequently expressed the view that road freight transport could be done more efficiently by private enterprise than by a national company.  At the same time, private enterprise could and should be required, if carrying on a service of that kind, to pay the same rates of wages as are being paid by Córas Iompair Éireann.  I think that would be accepted.</P>
    <P>A firm operating a limited number of lorries can exercise greater supervision over them.  It can, perhaps, run them more efficiently than can a large public-owned company with huge fleets to look after and a huge area to cater for.  I sometimes feel it would be a good idea to sell some branches of the railways to a smaller private company in order to run them, perhaps, as subsidiary bodies to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not think of leasing them to a county council.  Let us imagine that there is a 40 to 50 mile stretch of railway leased. It might be possible, by using rolling stock, exercising supervision, and having regard to the needs of the particular area, to make the project pay. There is need for closer linking up and <Col N="976" /> co-ordination between road transport and rail transport.  Something more could be done than is being done to utilise the railways as a sort of background for the general transport system and to make the roads act as feeders to the railway.</P>
      <P>That suggestion has been put forward again and again, but somehow or other, it does not seem to be adopted to any great extent.  As a matter of fact, we see the Córas Iompair Éireann freight transport services drawing traffic from the railways instead of acting as feeders for them.  We see the bus services competing to a great extent with the railways, attracting passenger traffic from them.  We should have some information as to how this system is operating at the present time and how it will operate in the future with a view to cutting those losses.  I should like to have the losses figures broken down so that we could see exactly in what particular sphere the losses occur.  Having ascertained that, we ought to find out whether some alternative method could be devised to overcome those losses.</P>
      <P>We all know that the basis of the whole trouble in regard to transport is the maldistribution of population. We have been talking about the congested districts, but everybody will admit that the most congested area in Ireland is the area around the mouth of the Liffey.  The fact that we have such a large proportion of our population concentrated in and around the City of Dublin and such a sparse population in the rural areas makes for a difficult traffic situation.  If my suggestion were adopted in regard to the breaking down of the losses figures, it would be found that there is no loss whatever in the city area either in regard to passenger service or traffic service.  I would be inclined to say that in the immediate vicinity of Dublin City there is no loss either in regard to rail or road transport.  It is in the more sparsely populated areas that the losses are occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my suggestion that some of the functions of Córas Iompair Éireann should be delegated to a subsidiary company operating, perhaps, in the rural areas was adopted, it might give <Col N="977" /> better results.  My other suggestion that Córas Iompair Éireann, subject to some regulations and reservations, should transfer its entire road transport service to private enterprise is worthy, I think, of consideration.  I do not think that we ought to agree to have for all time a transport system which has got to be subsidised by the State.  I could understand some branches of the service having to be subsidised.  The service, as a whole, should be self-supporting.</P>
    <P>After all, I think that is only right. If the Minister can see no prospect of avoiding losses in the future without further drastically restricting the use of private cars and lorries, before taking any step in that direction there should be a public and searching inquiry into the whole transport system. That, of course, would include not only the operation of Córas Iompair Éireann and other companies operating on the roads but the cost of construction and maintenance of the roads and canals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This sum asked for by the Minister for Industry and Commerce looks a big one, but when Deputy Cogan looks back a little on the past he will recollect that he himself voted, on November 30th, 1949, for the provision of a much bigger sum, £4,091,000, to clear up the mess created under the operation of the Transport Act of 1944.  I will not go into the history of what happened between January 1st, 1945, and the coming into operation of the nationalised concern on June 1st, 1950, but he will agree, having voted for that huge sum, £4,091,000, on November 30th, 1949, some improvement has taken place in the meantime.  I am certain that Deputy Cogan has not studied the history&mdash;and I am not going to go into it now&mdash;of the collapse of the transport system of this country which took place previous to and even since 1924, when the first Amalgamation Act was introduced and passed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous to 1924 we had 27 public transport concerns operating all over Ireland.  The smaller companies were being wiped out by the bigger ones that existed at the time, the Great Northern Railway and the Great <Col N="978" /> Southern Railway, as they were then known.  They had to be brought under the umbrella of the bigger concerns created by the passing of the Act of 1924.  Even that Act, as the Minister knows, did not meet the situation because there was a gradual increase from year to year in the number of uncontrolled privately owned commercial lorries in the country.  At that period the number was not worthy of consideration as compared with the number of privately owned lorries in the country to-day.</P>
    <P>From what I see of the present position I am convinced that the only way you can create a paying concern in this small portion of the transport world is by establishing a unified system of controlled rail and road transport all over Ireland.  The quantity of traffic available will not provide, no matter what Deputy Cogan thinks, for the continuance of the rail and associated road transport concerns, the Great Northern Railway and Córas Iompair Éireann, and a large number of privately owned commercial lorries.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether Deputy Cogan has ever considered from the community point of view the services, if any, given by these uncontrolled privately owned lorries.  Does he know what I know: that these people buy one lorry or may be more under the hire purchase system, and run them without any idea about the profits derived from them from year to year so long as they can pay the hire purchase annuity and get a few pounds for themselves from week to week?  That is all they are concerned about.  A privately owned lorry can travel from Dublin to Portlaoise, Portarlington, Mountrath or Mountmellick, and carry goods at a cheap rate.  The owner does not know whether he will make a profit or incur a loss, but he will carry the goods more cheaply than they could be carried by Córas Iompair Éireann or the Great Northern Railway.  But what does the community derive from the lower rates?  They may carry tea, sugar, tobacco, flour or any essential commodity, from the mill in the case of flour, or from the port in the case of the imported article, to the door of the trader in any town you like.  The lower rates certainly give a great advantage <Col N="979" /> to the trader, but is that benefit passed on by way of lower charges to the community which does business with that retailer?  Certainly not.  We must therefore consider the benefit conferred on the community generally by the services of these privately owned lorries.  I will not go into that now. It is not the occasion.  We may have another opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an economic transport system it must be a unified system for Ireland, with, naturally, associated auxiliary services feeding the railways north and south at the junctions.  I am sure that the Minister has that in mind.  To the extent to which the Minister completed the recent agreement with the Great Northern Railway Company and the people associated with the Six Counties Government and to the extent that his predecessor initiated these negotiations, I congratulate both of them on having made a very big contribution to the ultimate solution of the whole transport problem.</P>
    <P>I suppose that Deputy Cogan reads the figures furnished by Departments from time to time and reads the answers to parliamentary questions. Does he realise the difference even between the beginning of 1947 and to-day in the number of lorries in this country?  It has doubled.  He is sane and sensible and knows that there are tens of thousands of motor lorries owned by Córas Iompair Éireann and the Great Northern Railway and the amount of traffic to be handled in this country is limited.  Any sane and sensible man who has given any consideration to these matters would agree that that is the position.  We have had innumerable transport commissions and inquiries and have on record their recommendations, their unanimous reports in some cases, and majority and minority reports in others.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Estimate I want to raise a bigger problem that faces the Minister.  I think it is pertinent to this Estimate.  The Minister, when he was speaking at a function in the city some time ago&mdash;and he repeated it here to-day&mdash;appears to have requested Córas Iompair Éireann to balance their <Col N="980" /> accounts.  Córas Iompair Éireann, on the face of what we have before us to-day, is a semi-bankrupt company. The Great Northern Railway Company is in the same position and Ulster Transport Authority, another seminationalised or nationalised concern in the Six Counties, is in the same position. When the Minister puts a pressing request to the members of the board that they should balance their accounts, does not he know how that will be done in existing circumstances? The railway engines that may be taken into the shops and scrapped and the railway wagons and carriages that may not be required will not suffer.  It is the human element that will suffer in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is rumoured freely in railway circles and transport circles&mdash;and the rumour should be nipped in the bud now, if the Minister will do it, if he does not believe that it is correct&mdash;that Córas Iompair Éireann has been studying this matter at the request of the Minister.  Economy commissions have been working in the various departments of Córas Iompair Éireann and it is freely rumoured in railway and transport circles that 2,500 of the existing staff are going to be paid off, with or without compensation.  I am reliably informed that in the case of one department alone in Córas Iompair Éireann as many as 800 persons have been put on a waiting list to be paid off.</P>
    <P>That should not be done and it will not be done, with my approval at any rate, until the Minister has made up his mind on the basis of the proposals that have been put before him by Córas Iompair Éireann.  I think he should give an undertaking to this House that until he and his colleagues in the Government make up their mind as to what is to be done with the proposals submitted to them by Córas Iompair Éireann none of the existing staff should be dispensed with.  His predecessor gave an undertaking and carried it out that from a certain date none of the staff of Córas Iompair Éireann would be paid off.  I want the Minister to nip in the bud, for the moment at any rate, this rumour that has been widely circulated in regard <Col N="981" /> to the paying off of as many as 2,500 members of the existing staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues in the Government must make up their minds as to what is to be the future of the branch line railways.  It is about time that that was done.  That, as Deputy Cogan said, involves the question of the future of the roads and the condition of the roads in the areas now served by branch line railways. If the branch lines are scrapped, in many parts of the country new cement roads must be built to carry the heavy traffic that is now carried, at uneconomic rates, over our main and branch lines.  Big questions are involved in all this.  It is about time some Minister had the courage to take a decision.</P>
    <P>Political considerations come into this, without doubt.  As Deputy Cogan had clearly in mind, without reference even to the provision of an economic transport system, political considerations have to come into the picture when you talk about the position of the increasing number of private lorry owners.  As one of the friends in this House of the private lorry owner, I would say that it would have been far better for some of them if they had never bought their lorries.  They are not making money on them.  They are just working for the people who manufactured the lorries and gave them out on the hire-purchase system. Many of these good citizens who bought private lorries on the hire-purchase system five or ten years ago are very sorry that they ever had anything to do with them.  In any case, the Minister knows probably better than anybody else that the country cannot afford the existence of such a large number of privately and publicly owned lorries and at the same time expect to have a railway system that will pay its way from day to day and year to year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite correct in that.  That happens every year during the beet season, but when <Col N="982" /> the beet and the wheat have been carried to their destinations, the Deputy will be surprised to know, Córas Iompair Éireann cannot get fulltime weekly work for its own limited number of motor lorries.  It is a most unfortunate fact, and the Minister will tell the Deputy that what I say is true, that Córas Iompair Éireann railway section is still competing with the road freight section.  Is it not a ridiculous state of affairs?  I do not want to go into this.  I am pestered with these cases.  In some of the cases that have been handed to me I asked the individuals to furnish me with documentary evidence.</P>
      <P>Imagine the rail section and the road section of Córas Iompair Éireann carrying racehorses from Dublin to a race meeting in County Mayo on the same day.  The same thing happened in the case of racehorses that were carried to a race meeting in County Kerry.  These things have been happening this year.  The man who was booking the racehorses to be carried by rail from Dublin to County Mayo did not know and did not care whether a colleague of his, paid by the same nationalised company, was making arrangements to carry racehorses by road on the same day to and from the same race meeting.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Deputy some information regarding the competition that is carried on between two sections of the same company.  The Deputy is quite correct in saying that the same kind of competition goes on in regard to fairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider these things during the Recess.  I would appeal to the Minister particularly to consider seriously the proposals that apparently he has in his possession from the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann and to give an early policy decision to the members of the board so that they will know what they are supposed to do in future.  If you close the branch lines, then take a decision and take the consequences of that decision but do not keep coming to this House thinking that you can provide traffic on an <Col N="983" /> economic basis for all the motor lorries owned by Córas Iompair Éireann or privately owned and at the same time maintain a railway service without providing a subsidy year after year.  It cannot be done and you had better make up your minds that it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Courageous decisions must be taken on this matter in the near future if we are to avoid a repetition of the request which the Minister has made to this House this morning.  I do not believe in the policy of putting your hand in the taxpayer's pocket to pay indefinitely a subsidy to the transport service.  An economic transport service can be provided.  We all know that that can only be done by an all-Ireland railway service fed by a suitable auxiliary road service at the main points.  No board of any nationalised traffic concern can make up their minds definitely as to how they can reasonably comply with the Minister's request that they should pay their way unless they get policy decisions as to what is to be the future of the branch lines.</P>
    <P>I do not want to indulge in a lengthy discussion on this matter.  The Minister and his predecessor have made a big contribution to what I hope will be an early solution of the transport problem by getting the Six County Government to agree with them in regard to acquisition of the Great Northern Railway Company and I hope that the next time that there is a discussion in this House as to a possible solution of the transport problem the Minister will tell us that there has been agreement with the people in the North to have a unified transport system, road and rail.  In my opinion, that is the only way you will avoid a repetition of the request that is before the House to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us what I am sure every Deputy knew already, namely, that if we do not provide this colossal sum to subsidise Córas Iompair Éireann the company cannot continue.  That is a very serious matter from the point of view of the taxpayers.  It seems to me that there is something wrong with the <Col N="984" /> management of Córas Iompair Éireann. The company has been losing money over a period of years.  It was nationalised for the purpose of saving it from bankruptcy.  Because it was nationalised, like everything else that is nationalised, the management feel, I am sure, that it is no serious worry of theirs whether the company pays or not.</P>
      <P>I travel quite a lot of the roads of this country, and I have often observed Córas Iompair Éireann commercial vehicles operating in various parts, going to and fro, very often with little or no load.  It is quite a common thing to see a six or eight-ton railway lorry going to remote areas with a parcel on which they collect 3/- carriage.  Any sensibly minded person must know that it cannot pay the company to operate such a service.  As I said, this company is now nationalised, and there seems to be no worry on the part of the management as to whether it is paying or not.  The taxpayers have to meet whatever deficiency there is.  In my part of the country, there is really a good road commercial service.  It is true that the taxpayers have to pay for that, but in regard to that service we really have no great grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also true that some years ago Córas Iompair Éireann took up a branch line running to Achill.  Having taken up that line, they deprived the people of that Gaeltacht and very thickly populated area of any proper or satisfactory service.  No Government since has seriously considered that matter or considered the people of that area.  The people of Achill felt when this line was taken up that a proper road service would be provided for them.  As a matter of fact, I was told by the Achill Development Association that at that time assurances were given that when the line would be taken up a proper road service would be provided.  This is a thickly populated area, and is mainly a migratory area.  The bus services provided for that area are inadequate.  The hours at which the buses and trains run are wholly unsuitable and unsatisfactory for the people of the Achill district. When migratory labourers, boys and girls, come to Dublin from across the <Col N="985" /> water they board a train or bus and they find when they get to Westport that there is no connection whatsoever for them for the remaining long distance. They are obliged to engage hackney cars, and that is wholly unjust and unfair to these migratory workers. In reply to a question which I put down some days ago, the Minister told me that that was a matter for Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is a matter, however, for the people we represent, that they must subsidise Córas Iompair Éireann.  I put it to the Minister that he should impress upon Córas Iompair Éireann the importance of restoring at once an adequate service for the people of this Gaeltacht and thickly populated area.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question which was referred to by Deputy Morrissey&mdash;that very heavy commercial vehicles travel on our roads in different parts of the country carrying loads up to 15 and 16 tons in many instances. The unladen weight of some of these vehicles is, perhaps, seven, eight or ten tons as well.  Our roads were never constructed for carrying these vehicles, particularly in bog areas where the foundations are weak.  They are daily breaking up our roads and, accordingly, making the rate-paying public pay very dearly for restoring them to a proper state of repair.  If a considerable amount of this heavy traffic were sent by rail, I believe Córas Iompair Éireann would be in a healthier financial condition, and in all probability they would not be looking for this colossal sum of money, although they might be looking for some money.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put forward by some Deputies that private hauliers should not be allowed to operate on the roads, that they do not know whether their business is paying or not. I know a number of them in my area and they have always made a success of this business.  In the course of their operations they have built up big businesses.  It was because they took such a personal interest in the operation of their businesses and effected economies where they felt they should be effected that they have succeeded in running their businesses on efficient lines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> If Córas Iompair Éireann adopted similar tactics in order to run their business on efficient lines transport would pay.  I think it is wrong that a young man who buys a lorry should be deprived of the opportunity of making a living out of that lorry in hauling goods for his neighbour, let it be farm produce, turf or anything else. So long as he complies with the law laid down in relation to insurance and so on he should not be deprived of that opportunity.  I cannot see how he could injure anybody.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would make up his mind to tell Córas Iompair Éireann that they must cut down on the size of the company and allow private hauliers back on the roads, the burden the taxpayers would have to bear would be much less than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>The West of Ireland is far removed from the City of Dublin, but there, too, we have a serious transport problem. The local papers, particularly the <i>Western People,</i> which has a big circulation throughout the country, have been harping on the problem over a long number of years.  We have been very badly treated in the West from the point of view of transport.  If there is any scrap bus or scrap railway car Córas Iompair Éireann invariably sends it down to the West.  To look at them, one would really think they were making their last journey instead of being pressed into service in Mayo and elsewhere.  It is the old story: anything is good enough for the West.</P>
    <P>There are considerable delays in the rail services, so much so that people have almost forgotten that it is still possible to go to Dublin by train.  It is painful to watch the outmoded methods the staffs have of dealing with traffic.  It is no wonder the railways are not paying.  It is no wonder the travelling public have turned away completely from that mode of transport.</P>
    <P>We now have reason to believe that the eyes of the Government are turned at long last to the West and to the hardships endured by the people there. We have a serious grievance in relation to transport.  We have been very badly treated.  We are being called upon like every other citizen to subsidise <Col N="987" /> this company.  We are not begging for anything.  We are looking for fair play and justice in relation to our transport as well as in relation to everything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be very bad policy to come in here year after year and vote away such a large sum of money.  No businessman worthy of the name would keep a business going if he ran it in a similar fashion to Córas Iompair Éireann.  As Deputy Morrissey stated, the time will come when some Minister occupying the position the Tánaiste is in to-day will have to make a move which may be unpopular.  I hope that eventually someone will have the decency and courage to do it.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the heavy lorries using our roads.  Members of local authorities are hearing nothing but the weary cry of the ratepayers: &ldquo;What are you going to do about our roads?&rdquo; We cannot afford to keep our roads in order.  Not only is the wear and tear on the roads as a result of these lorries &mdash;some of them double deckers&mdash;very heavy but the lorries are themselves a danger to the public.  We have a railway and heavy goods should be transported over that railway.  Deputy Davin does not seem to be in favour of private lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>He said they were merely carrying on for the sake of getting a few pounds.  I can assure the Deputy that extensive work is done by these private lorries and in many cases they are the mainstay of the owner, his wife and his family.  Private lorries to-day are hauling wheet, beet and turf.  They are entitled to some protection.  I certainly would not like to see them put out of existence.</P>
      <P>The cry at the moment is to curb extravagance and overspending.  It is unfair to the taxpayers that we, the representatives of the people, should come in here year after year to vote millions of money for a concern that is not paying its way.  I appeal to the Minister to institute some kind of inquiry into our transport system to find out what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="988" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter I want to raise in connection with this Estimate and that is the position of Córas Iompair Éireann employees.  It is generally rumoured in Córas Iompair Éireann circles that the board has made up its mind, or is being pressed to make up its mind, to discharge between 2,000 and 3,000 men from the service of Córas Iompair Éireann. Córas Iompair Éireann employees are gravely perturbed at this information, the accuracy of which nobody will deny, because they see before them the prospect of being thrown on the scrap heap after having given a lifetime of service to the transport system of the country.</P>
      <P>Last year, when the inter-Party Government decided, in the public interest, to take over Córas Iompair Éireann and operate it as a national concern, that announcement was accompanied by a declaration that so far as the Government was concerned it would deal with the problem of redundancy on the basis of allowing workers to retain their employment, and the redundancy would be dealt with through the medium of deaths, retirements and wastages of every kind.  In other words, the declaration of public ownership of Córas Iompair Éireann was accompanied by a guarantee to the staff of Córas Iompair Éireann that they would not be thrown on the industrial scrap heap.  They, therefore, had every reason to believe that if, as a result of reorganisation or nationalisation, Córas Iompair Éireann found itself with a redundant staff, some effort would be made to provide work for the staff in Córas Iompair Éireann, and that the redundancy would be allowed to work itself out by means of the normal wastages in a big undertaking such as Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, however, the whole atmosphere appears to have changed.  If you talk to railway men, whether at Inchicore, the Kingsbridge or at any station along the line, they will tell you of the grave fears which they have that a number of these workers, who are alleged to be redundant, are to be paid off.  Some of them may get compensation and others may get no compensation <Col N="989" /> at all, but, even in the case of those who get compensation, that compensation, at best, will represent but a very small fraction of the income which they receive from their present employment.  In my view, it can be grossly unfair and even inhuman, to throw men of 50 or 55 years of age out of a class of employment, with which they are familiar, on a small weekly pittance, and expect them to be able to rehabilitate themselves in other employment in a country where there are at present 61,000 unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I would sooner see the State face up to underwriting the annual losses on Córas Iompair Éireann due to the retention of persons who were temporarily redundant, than see the State swing in the other direction, in the harsh direction, of throwing men out of employment on a pittance which is incapable of sustaining themselves and their families.  It is all right here in this House, if we do not get down to the facts of the situation, to imagine that we can terminate the employment of people and give them as compensation a small fraction of their normal earnings.  When one examines that home, one finds that you can be capable of doing a gross injustice to ordinary working people whose ordinary pay would be insufficient to sustain them each week.  A fraction of that pay will impose on them very grave hardships indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the State is entitled, either in the interests of progress or in the interests of organised transport, so to arrange its transport policy as to cause the grievous hardships which would be inflicted on railway workers if they are thrown on the scrapheap with a miserable pittance as their compensation.  I would urge on the Minister in this matter to take the House into his confidence and to let the House know what is to be the policy of the board in respect of employees who are stated to be redundant. Are they going to be thrown out of the railway service and, if they are, what compensation is going to be offered to them?  I do not think that the offer of compensation is adequate. I think the problem should be dealt <Col N="990" /> with by retaining those people in employment and by endeavouring to adjust the staffing requirements of Córas Iompair Éireann by means of not filling vacancies, or not recruiting new staffs, thereby allowing whatever redundancy that may exist to fill in the blanks caused by ordinary requirement.</P>
    <P>Already, there is some evidence that Córas Iompair Éireann have started on a policy of reorganisation.  At the Kildare railway station there is a locomotive shed which has been in operation for, I think, more than 50 years. A number of railway workers who have been employed in that shed for many years have now been told that the shed is to be closed, and that the workers will probably be transferred to Dublin. Think of what that means.  There are eight or ten families involved.  It means that these workers will have to give up the houses which they have locally and take themselves and their families to Dublin.  One has only to know Dublin to realise how utterly impossible it is for any married man with a wife and children to secure housing accommodation in Dublin.  The Dublin Corporation would not offer accommodation to persons who have so recently arrived in the city.  The unfortunate railway worker, who would thus be uprooted from Kildare, would have to try and get into a single room or into a double room, if he was lucky.</P>
    <P>One has only to be familiar with the housing problem in the city to realise that to get that there would, firstly, be the normal difficulty of getting any accommodation where there is a family with children, but even if the accommodation could be secured, the rent of it would be completely outside the ability of the railway worker to pay. What is the alternative proposed?  The alternative is to leave the family in Kildare and for the man to work and live in Dublin.  But what railway worker to-day could afford to keep a family in the country, paying rent and sustenance for them there, and keep himself in digs in Dublin, and all this on the rate of wages paid to ordinary railway workers?  It just cannot be done, except one is prepared to inflict <Col N="991" /> unbearable hardships on the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>Now, it is quite true that there may be a need for a reorganisation of the services of Córas Iompair Éireann.  It may be that there is a need for better methods and improved organisation, but we cannot allow these things, urgent though they be, to cloud our responsibility of ensuring that, so far as railway workers are concerned, we are not going to cause for them the grave hardships which will be involved if they are uprooted from one place and transferred to another, or if they are thrown on the scrap heap and given a miserable pittance as a means of sustenance.</P>
    <P>I plead to-day for the adoption of a line of policy which will keep these men in employment, even if the State has to continue to underwrite Córas Iompair Éireann losses, because I do not think that either the position of the railways or our financial position is such as to justify us in imposing on railway employees, who have given a lifetime of service to the transport undertakings of this country, the intolerable hardships which would be caused to them and their families by throwing them on the scrap heap with only a miserable pittance between them and the workhouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that it is very difficult for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to know what line to take.  One statement has been made in favour of private lorry owners. Some said that the expenses were too high and that the taxpayer was paying too much.  We would all like to see the company running well.  I would like the Minister, in his reply, to give the House information as to how our railway system compares with the railway systems of other countries.  As far as I know, though my information may not be very accurate, there are very few countries in which the railways are paying to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a shocking lot of hypocrisy in this debate.  I heard Deputy O'Hara condemning the railway system.  Then he said that he wanted to keep the private lorry owner <Col N="992" /> going.  He should remember that he cannot have it both ways.  The Transport Act of 1944 went a long way towards saving the railways.  Deputy O'Hara has made an attack upon the management of Córas Iompair Éireann. This is a very wrong attitude to adopt, and I do not agree with it at all. Nobody should be attacked in this House, when it is known that he is not in a position to defend himself.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure, or perhaps the displeasure, of making representations about the preservation of branch lines. I found, in a number of cases, that the people who came on the deputation were businessmen who never used the railways.  Not so long ago, I went on one such deputation to Córas Iompair Éireann.  There were seven men with me and they did not even use the railway; they came in their own cars and still they wanted a particular branch line to be kept going.  The Tánaiste can tell the House that he has long experience of people coming up on these deputations who are hypocrites, because they have private lorries.  Still they come along and say: &ldquo;Do not cut off this branch line because it is our life line.&rdquo;  Perhaps nine or ten of these very people who come on the deputation to the Minister or to Córas Iompair Éireann have not been using the branch line for ten years previously. I wonder will Deputy O'Hara tell us if the people who are criticising the railway travel from Mayo in any one of the bad carriages, or whether they travel all the time by road.  We cannot have it both ways.  The private hauliers cannot be allowed to carry on <i>ad lib</i> if the railways are to be preserved.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Norton in his views about railway employees.  A number of them live in my own constituency.  I look on the Tánaiste as a Minister who supports the workers on all occasions. I know that a number of people are afraid that something may happen because there are rumours to the effect that the railways may have to be organised.  If the Minister were to take a cue from the House this morning, he would sack half the people on the railways and make a lot of other changes as well so that the railways could be kept going.  However, the <Col N="993" /> people who have given service to the railway over 20, 30 or 40 years deserve consideration from the State.  If the people who are criticising the State for subsidising the railways were to ask the public to discard their cars and lorries as far as is humanly possible to do so and, instead, to travel by rail it would be very desirable.  It would be a good thing also if they were to tell those coming on a deputation pleading against the closing of a branch line to make sure that they are using that branch line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <P>When facing this bill we have got to have regard to the fact that a considerable amount of the taxpayers' money was paid out in the first instance by Córas Iompair Éireann to encourage private lorries throughout the country.  I am one who is definitely opposed to any further interference with private lorries, because I know the real state of affairs.  I know that none of those so-called organised haulage manæuvres which are going on can in any way take the place of the work which the private lorry does.  The private lorry-owner goes, for instance, to three or four districts in my own county for the purpose of taking 20 pigs to the market or to the bacon factories.  He has to collect two or three pigs from one farmer and two or three from another and so on all along the road.  Where does the Córas Iompair Éireann lorry fit into this picture?  They would not do it.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the attitude that has been adopted by the Department of Industry and Commerce, where, if you want to get a number plate changed from one owner to another, you might as well fly up to heaven. Indeed, you would have a better chance of hopping on a boat than you would of getting that plate changed.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Norton here to-day bemoaning the fact that these workers were going to be thrown out of employment.  Deputy Norton, while in the inter-Party Government for three and a quarter years, played a part in driving these workers out of employment by taking away their employment from them.</P>

If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will bear with me for a few minutes I will give him the reason why. The transport of 1,300,000 tons of beet, coal, coke, limestone and sugar beet pulp would be required if we had our full acreage of beet in this country. The total tonnage of goods carried by Córas Iompair Éireann in 1948 was 2,209,000 tons, and 1,300,000 tons of that was the responsibility of the four sugar companies.  That leaves you with 900,000 tons.  If Deputies opposite succeeded in their object in giving employment to the Formosan and the Cuban, I think it is clearly enough related to the present Estimate.</P>

    <P>I am not so worried about this Estimate because the first step in wiping out the need for this subsidy was taken last Friday when provision was being made for the enlargement of the four beet factories and for the transfer of <Col N="995" /> this dead weight to useful production in the line of the haulage of beet.</P>

What I am quoting is the statement made by the general manager of the Irish Sugar Company on this particular problem of the subsidy that has to be paid to Córas Iompair Éireann due to the reduction in the acreage of beet and the reduction of the work in the sugar factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us examine that a little further, and see how that will affect all this unemployment that Deputy Norton is talking about.  There are only two ways in which we can get rid of that subsidy and get rid of the danger of unemployment, by providing sufficient work for the railways to keep them going and to wipe out that subsidy. I say that the provision of 200,000 extra tons of beet will get rid of a lot of that problem, and that is the only manner in which you can deal with it.  Here, you have in one industry alone three-fourths of the freightage that Córas Iompair Éireann are carrying now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now, Sir, to deal with other matters that I consider are problems as regards Córas Iompair Éireann and as regards the building up of these subsidies and the necessity for subsidies.  We are placed in a position in this country where you have either too much or too little in one area.  At one time you had only about two trains running up from Cork in a day.  At present trains travelling from Cork to Dublin are tripping one another and carrying nothing.  You have trains at 8 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock. tripping one another up along that line.  Anybody who travels by that line can easily see that there are only one or two passengers in every carriage.  Surely there is no justification <Col N="996" /> for that.  I could quite understand the necessity for three trains a day from Cork to Dublin.  but I see no necessity for six.</P>

      <P>What about all the single tickets up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the single tickets are taken downwards.  If you go into any industry in Cork they nearly knock you down with Dublin accents if they are not Scotch.  My first complaint is that this thing is overdone. Apart from my own experience, I have heard comments from others on that line.</P>
      <P>Then you have the extraordinary position still prevailing in which you have buses leaving Cork City for outside areas and running side by side with the trains, always taking very good care that whoever prepares the time-tables prepares the one time-table for both and has the bus and the train leaving Cork together for Youghal at the one moment.  Surely there is something wrong about that.  I have spoken in this House before in connection with ridiculous things that I have seen on that line.  If we intend to keep the railways going then, in Heaven's name, let us keep them going and let us not have the railways endeavouring to break out into road transport as well.  The whole position is ridiculous, particularly in regard to road transport. It is the ordinary farmer who is paying the piper in some of the instances I have given you.</P>
      <P>I have seen down in my own constituency this season some 20 or 30 lorries employed by Córas Iompair Éireann for the haulage of beet to the railway stations.  Now some of those lorries come from North Cork and from Kerry.  A Kerry man who is working in the Shanagarry area in East Cork told me that Córas Iompair Éireann pay him so much but Córas Iompair Éireann get so much more.  In plain language, that unfortunate individual is only working in order that his profits may be divided with Córas Iompair Éireann and used.  If he is paid 5/- per ton for hauling beet to the railway station, Córas Iompair Éireann comes along and collects 6/6 per ton for that haulage.  These are facts that nobody can deny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> A system apparently crept into this country a number of years ago under which you have one fellow sitting back looking at another fellow working for him while he draws the loot.  I can see no justification for a system under which a private haulier is compelled to pay Córas Iompair Éireann for permistion to haul beet from a particular area to the railway station.  That is what is happening.  I have investigated that matter fairly closely and I find the facts are as I am giving them here. There is no justification for it, not even the lightening of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>If it is against the law for that Kerryman to come up to East Cork to haul beet to the railway station in one way, it should be against the law for him to haul it in another way.  These are the facts in regard to what is happening all over the country.  You have a duplication of services.  On the one side Córas Iompair Éireann have to maintain the permanent way on the railway line, but it is the unfortunate ratepayer who has to maintain the road alongside it.</P>
    <P>Faced with a problem of that description, I say that what you want in Córas Iompair Éireann is efficient organisation.  If you can find another Costello or another Fitzpatrick and put him in charge of Córas Iompair Éireann, then you will make a good job of it.  That is the one way to do it and get rid of duplication of services. You have a definite and scandalous duplication of services particularly along routes where the railway runs side by side with the road.  You have a train leaving Cork at 6.15 for Youghal, and side by side with that a bus leaves Cork at 6.15 for Youghal&mdash; both travelling side by side on the one route for 30 miles.  I might be blamed by my constituents for trying to deprive them of an extra service, but at the same time I am not a believer in duplication.  I think it should end. If you have a train and a bus running along the same route at the same time, you have to pay the piper for it in subsidies here.  These are the things I should like the Minister to attempt to straighten out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that everybody in the House is in agreement as to the <Col N="998" /> necessity for keeping the railway services as efficient as possible and, with that end in view, of providing them with the necessary funds to keep them going.  Listening to Deputy Corry, one wonders on what side of the fence he stands or whether he supports this Vote at all.  He opened his remarks with the statement that Deputy Norton had been responsible during the three years while the inter-Party Government was in office for a considerable amount of unemployment amongst railwaymen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry must be aware that that statement is not in accordance with the facts.  I think everybody in this House, irrespective of Party should have due regard to the seriousness of the position of the railways and should be prepared to contribute their best efforts to secure the eventual success of the undertaking.  The inter-Party Government showed their in terest in the matter by taking steps for the nationalisation of the railways and by seeing that there would be no redundancy or unemployment amongst railwaymen except such as was caused by deaths and retirement.  Prior to the inter-Party Government coming into office Deputy Corry must be aware that a scheme was in contemplation to sack 2,500 railwaymen plus 1,000 shopmen. That did not take place during their period of office.  It is difficult to understand why Deputy Corry on an Estimate of this kind should introduce a contentious argument of that kind which is not in accordance with the facts.  It is the desire of everybody that our railway undertaking should be put on a successful basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge Deputy Corry's right to speak with authority as to how the railways should be run. He may be a successful farmer and I believe he is a very competent authority on matters with which he is conversant, but I challenge his right to dictate to the railway authorities as to how the system should be run.  If they find it necessary to popularise their services against competition&mdash;and <Col N="999" /> Deputy Corry suggests that they have been running unnecessary trains and running them side by side simultaneously with buses&mdash;these are matters I suggest that are best left to the competence of the people appointed to take charge of the undertaking.</P>
      <P>If they are running buses side by side with the trains, they must have some reason for doing so.  I believe they have sound reasons for doing so. Some of the buses which seem to run parallel with railways serve districts which the railways never touch.  We must have regard to the geographical lay-out of the country and we know that in many cases these buses serve villages and towns along the route that are not touched by the railways at all. If you withdraw these bus services you are going to withdraw services that the people have enjoyed for a considerable number of years and you will cause them considerable inconvenience.  The company must have regard to that fact.</P>
      <P>In my opinion bus and train services should be staggered so as not to have them running at the same time.  It is not desirable that buses and trains should run along a parallel route at the same time.  I think it would serve the best interest of citizens if the services were staggered so as to have them running at different times.  I think it is generally the rule to have staggered services where trains and buses are running along parallel routes. I would suggest that Deputy Corry is not strictly serious, that you must have either a rail service or a lorry service, but that you cannot have both.  I think it is necessary to have both.</P>
      <P>We must also have regard to the fact that, when the railways were originally constructed, they were not built for the convenience of the people as a whole.  They were built by the people who controlled this country at the time with an eye to the necessities of war and defence.  They were built away from the centres of population in many instances but, nevertheless, they constitute a very valuable investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot permit the scrapping of the railways which are as essential to us as an army and navy.  They must be maintained for heavy traffic and to <Col N="1000" /> meet the necessities of any emergency which may arise.  If they happen to be running in places that are awkward or inaccessible for the bulk of the population, the best solution to my mind is to link the bus and lorry services with the railway lines.  I believe that with a proper co-ordination of these services there is a useful role to be filled by both the lorry and the railway.  There are places where that co-ordination of services has not taken place to the extent that it should, but it must be remembered that some years ago we found in operation a rather unchartered lorry system of which nobody was in control.  I think that with a proper co-ordination of the services, you would save long hauls and you would be working a system under which you would know exactly where the end of the road was going to be. That would result in a saving to the community at large.  I do not think you can contemplate a system under which the railways would be wiped out.  It must also be remembered that we have a meagre population in this country.  I am wholeheartedly with Deputy Corry in saying that we want to build up industries which will make stuff available for the railways but we must have regard to the present limitations of our population, an agricultural and industrial population, and not eliminate any route or scrap any part of the transport system, but give it all the assistance and cooperation possible until a better day will come.</P>
    <P>I trust that with the other steps which will be taken by the Government in connection with the development of the western counties&mdash;and with the development, I hope, of the underdeveloped areas as well as the undeveloped areas&mdash;there will be more haulage and traffic for the transport system.  In the meantime, we want to keep that system in as prime a condition as possible.  Should there be redundancy, I trust that the appeal which has been made from both sides of the House will be borne in mind. We should not forget the services which the railwaymen have rendered to this country.  They have spent all <Col N="1001" /> their lives at that type of work and it is practically a trade and an industry in itself.  The great majority of these men would not now be fit to be changed to other industries, and for that reason I fervently hope that, in any reorganisation that may take place, the human element will be considered and that these men will not be transferred from pillar to post.</P>
    <P>I know that they do not mind being shifted around because railwaymen have, in their day, been shifted to different parts of the country.  They cannot escape some of that in the future just as in the past but we must not forget that they are human beings and that they must be given the consideration which is due to human beings.  I hope the company will have regard to the convenience of the men who have loyally obeyed its dictates in the past and who are prepared in the future to work harmoniously for the success of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I believe that there should be more co-ordination between the lorry service working in conjunction with the nationalised system which we ought to preserve.  That is the approach which will yield the maximum results, with the least dislocation, from both the rail and lorry service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the figures for the losses incurred during the present year I should, perhaps, explain that the higher cost of wages and materials during the present year was no more than offset by the increase in charges which came into operation in September last.  The board of Córas Iompair Éireann anticipates that the revenue which these higher charges will yield in a full year will be equivalent, and no more than equivalent, to the cost in a full year of the higher wages and salaries which came into operation this year and the increased cost of stores, materials and fuel.  The losses which the company suffered during the year 1950, which amounted approximately to £1,000,000, remained untouched by the increased charges and will continue throughout next year if circumstances remain otherwise unaltered.  In fact, the board's estimate, presented to the <Col N="1002" /> Department of Industry and Commerce in March of this year, that their losses would amount to £1,900,000, that they proposed to increase charges and fares to recover £900,000 and that they would require a subsidy of £1,000,000, proved completely accurate.  There is the difference between the sum of £1,000,000 and the sum of £1,250,000, which I mentioned when introducing the Estimate.  That is attributable to the fact that the board provided in its books for depreciation in the present financial year amounting to £1,165,000 but actually propose to expend on replacements and renewals some £235,000 more than that in an effort to overtake certain arrears.  Perhaps it is right to mention that the board are experiencing considerable difficulty in developing their repairs and renewals programme because of scarcity of materials at present and that they cannot do as much work in that direction as they would wish on that account.</P>
      <P>We have the position in which the transport services operated by Córas Iompair Éireann are producing substantial losses, and that it is not possible to offset these losses by any further increases in charges, because the board have given us their view that further increases will not, in fact, expand revenue, and we have to consider what can be done.  I do not think any of us would wish to contemplate the prospect of these transport services continuing to lose money.</P>
      <P>Most of us will agree that the £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 which have to be provided for this purpose every year could be put to far more useful purposes if a method could be secured. by reorganisation or otherwise, to bring the cost of providing these transport services into line with the revenue which they yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in complete agreement with the view expressed by Deputy Morrissey that the most important factor which has resulted in a loss of traffic to Córas Iompair Éireann, and to the development among industrialists and traders of the present tendency to organise their own transport service, has been the recurrence of trade disputes leading to stoppages of work on the public services.  No more than he, I do not want to go into the merits of these disputes. <Col N="1003" /> The very fact that they happen and the sense of insecurity which the possibility of a sudden interruption of public services creates in the minds of business executives, whose own businesses may be ruined by any prolonged interruption of deliveries of their goods, induces them to undertake what very frequently they do not want to undertake, namely, the capital investment and the organisational problems associated in the creation of their own transport services.</P>
    <P>Nobody expects that disputes between trade unions and railway managements about rates of pay or conditions of service will cease.  So long as human nature remains as it is, these disputes will recur again and again.  However, it should not be beyond the competence of the leaders of the trade unions and the management of the company to devise methods of resolving these disputes which will obviate stoppages of work.  I am certain that if that cannot be done, that if continuing stoppages of work on the transport services are to be anticipated in consequence of disagreement about conditions of employment, all the efforts we are making to preserve the railways will prove fruitless, and that ultimately they will have to disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not occur to the Minister that we ourselves are promoting such disputes by failing to determine that our preparedness to provide subsidy for the transport company shall be subject to some overall limit&mdash;that we should determine that, say, £1,000,000 is the roof so far as the Oireachtas is concerned and that the company had better arrange their affairs within that limit?  After all, the trade unions naturally feel bound to fight in order to get out of the Oireachtas as much as they can for their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can fix any limit with the hope that we can stick to it, but we can make it clear to the management of the company and to everybody else concerned that there is not a bottomless purse out of which they can draw.  That is not a matter solely for decision by any <Col N="1004" /> Government.  In my view, it is a matter which will be taken out of the hands of Government by public opinion unless the situation is improved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan asked for a segregation of the losses between the different types of services.  It is estimated that in the financial year to 31st March next the rail services will lose £1,436,000&mdash; there will be that deficit between their operating expenditure and the revenue realised.  The road services will bring in a credit of £460,000, the hotels a small credit of £5,530 and the canals will lose approximately £31,000.  Deputy Cogan suggested that we should have a public inquiry into the management of Córas Iompair Éireann and also into the wider aspects of transport policy. He, however, anticipated my answer to that suggestion: we have had so many inquiries into transport in the last 20 years that it would be useless to hope that another would give us any clearer picture of the position or any clue to a solution of its problems. I will agree with him in this, that if the proposal of the Córas Iompair Éireann Board to impose drastic restrictions upon the operation of private lorries were to be adopted and made the subject of legislation, the public and the Dáil would be entitled to get, in justification of the proposal, a great deal more information than is available at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The means by which that information would be procured would be a matter for consideration then.  Let me turn now to the main questions raised in the debate.  Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin referred to the reports that are in circulation, that requests have been made to the Córas Iompair Éireann Board to balance their accounts and if necessary to reduce considerably the number of workers employed on the railways in order to secure that result.  In the course of my speech introducing this Estimate, I stated that the board of Córas Iompair Éireann were asked to furnish me with information as to the steps already taken to reduce working <Col N="1005" /> costs, the effect of these measures, any further proposals they may have for economies, and their plans for reorganisation. I do not know if it is true that the board has, as Deputy Davin said, an economies commission working.  I hope they have; I regard that as a normal function of management. They have certainly given me no indication of any intention to effect substantial dismissals of employees.  In fact, in the report which they gave me, they rather suggested that their inquiries to date had not revealed any substantial redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They were forbidden to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin went on to say that no economy investigation should be begun and no Córas Iompair Éireann workers laid off for reasons of redundancy, until the Government had decided on the board's proposals for a reduction in the number of, or the elimination of, private transport lorries.  I think that is putting the cart before the horse.  I gathered from the speech of Deputy Davin and a somewhat similar speech by Deputy Norton that there is in the minds of the Labour Party an idea that a transport worker employed by Córas Iompair Éireann has got under statute or on some other ground a right to continue in employment which a transport worker employed in the operation of a private lorry has not.  If the Government decided to adopt the proposal of the Córas Iompair Éireann Board, a proposal which would put out of employment some thousands of transport workers now engaged in the operation of private lorries, I am quite certain that both the Dáil and public opinion would demand evidence that that was not being done for the purpose of keeping in employment in Córas Iompair Éireann workers who were redundant there or that it was not being done for any others reasons but the belief that, as a result, a more efficient transport organisation would be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to decisions made by the Córas Iompair Éireann Board affecting the engine-running shops at Newbridge and certain other changes of that kind.  I do not propose <Col N="1006" /> to interfere with the Córas Iompair Éireann Board in the discharge of its management function.  I have under the law no power to do so, but even if I had the power I would certainly hesitate to exercise it.  Any executive administering an organisation of that kind must have the right to make the changes which they think will promote greater efficiency.  That applies particularly in this case, where greater efficiency may mean a reduced call upon public funds for subsidy purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin, a Deputy from Mayo and other Deputies have criticised the management of Córas Iompair Éireann. Those criticisms put me in a rather difficult position.  When my predecessor announced here the names of the present Córas Iompair Eireann Board, I made some critical, even derisive, comments upon his choice; but I have not changed the board.  I have, in fact, no adverse observations to make upon any member of the board as an individual.  Whether as a team they have got all the qualifications necessary for the management of the organisation and for the solution of its problems is another matter.  I feel that it is unfair that the members of the board should be subjected to criticism here without somebody saying something on their behalf.  They cannot speak here for themselves and, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have at least the obligation of putting forward on their behalf the defence which they themselves made to me in reply to similar criticisms.</P>

I can conceive circumstances in which that might be a desirable practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain, however, that Córas Iompair Éireann are not doing that for any reason except the belief <Col N="1007" /> that it will enable them to give a better public service and discharge their responsibilities in that regard in the most efficient way.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin said that, big and all as this bill is, it is much less than the bill presented in 1949.  In 1949, the Dáil was asked to vote a sum of £4,091,000 for Córas Iompair Eireann.  I know that Deputy Davin fought the last election campaign on the basis of the speech which he delivered here on this very subject and I would hate to destroy that speech on him because, at his age, he would find it difficult to get a new one.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the Estimate submitted in 1949 was of an entirely different character.  Of the £4,091,000 voted then, no less than £2,264,000 was for capital works then in progress or about to be undertaken by the Board of Córas Iompair Eireann.  In fact, it met the capital needs of the board right up to July, 1950, when the present board took over.  Of the balance of £1,600,000, £771,000 was paid back to the Exchequer in discharge of obligation arising out of the payment of debenture interest. The balance of £857,000 was provided, not merely to meet losses incurred up to that date, but losses anticipated in the period to the end of the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin asked about the future of the branch lines.  There are two classes of branch lines, those on which the services have already ceased and those upon which the services are continuing.  When I met the Córas Iompair Éireann Board after my reappointment, I told them that so far as the branch lines on which services have ceased are concerned, I wanted no more humbug.  I said that if they have any intention of restoring the services on these lines they should go ahead and do so.  If they did not intend to restore the services, I told them to put in train the necessary measures to enable them to abandon the lines.  There might be some <Col N="1008" /> political advantage to me in leaving in existence the branch lines over which no services are run and on which Córas Iompair Éireann never intend to run services just to hold out in the localities concerned the vague hope that at some time they may be restored.  Personally, I think there is nothing doing the prestige of Córas Iompair Éireann so much harm as the existence in so many parts of the country of these old lines, with rusted rails overgrown with weeds running through derelict railway stations.  At the present time the financial cost of abandoning the lines on which Córas Iompair Éireann never intend to run a service again can be more easily offset by the sale of the resulting scrap than might normally be the case.  In any event, that addition to our supply of scrap iron would be very welcome at present.  I have, therefore, set up the Transport Board contemplated in the Act of 1950 and I understand that Córas Iompair Eireann intend to make application to that board for the necessary orders to abandon certain of these lines upon which they do not ever intend again to run a rail service.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keyes, I think, must have been referring to some Labour Party propaganda rather than any data that came to him as a member of the former Government when he referred to an intention in 1948 to dispense with a number of railway employees, including shopmen.  I think the intention then was quite the contrary. It was to expand activities in <Col N="1009" /> the railway shops as rapidly as the improving supply of materials permitted and to undertake considerable expenditure upon the extension of the shops. That expenditure was dropped as an economy measure during the period of the Coalition Government.  Might I remind Deputy Keyes that one of the extensions in contemplation was the construction of new shops at Limerick for the production of all-steel wagons.</P>

The present board say: &ldquo;We will have either to increase fares, get a subsidy or reduce staff.&rdquo;  They have increased fares, they have got the subsidy and they say that up to the present they have been unable to find any substantial scope for the reduction of staff on grounds of redundancy.</P>

A number of objects on which State debt has been incurred yield either no direct return or a return which is not sufficient to meet the service charge on the relevant borrowing but, as the deficiency varies in degree, the best way of indicating the extent of dead-weight debt in the sense already defined is to compare the <Col N="1016" /> total charge for the service of State debt with the total return received by way of interest, dividends and capital repayments on the corresponding assets.</P>

Dead-weight debt in their case might be defined as that part of gross debt the service of which is an unrelieved charge on the ratepayer.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (1) the number of Civil Service pensioners who were denied any benefits under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950, by reason of the penal provisions of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929; (2) the number of such persons relieved under the recent British ex-gratia grant and (3) the amount of such grant payments sanctioned for (a) Civil Service pensioners; (b) Dublin Metropolitan Police pensioners and (c) all other pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950, did not apply to persons in receipt of compensation under Article 10 of the Treaty, and payments under that Act could not accordingly be affected by the provisions of the Civil Service (Transferred <Col N="1017" /> Officers) Compensation Act, 1929, which governed the grant of compensation under Article 10 to certain civil servants.</P>
      <P>Under paragraph 13 of the agreement scheduled to the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929, the British Government agreed to supplement the compensation payable under Article 10 of the Treaty to civil servants who, before the 1st March, 1929, were discharged from or who gave notice of their intention to retire from the service of the Irish Government. The British Government have also agreed to supplement, on an ex-gratia basis, the compensation payable under Article 10 to civil servants who on or after the 1st March, 1929, were discharged from or who gave notice of intention to retire from the service of the Irish Government provided that service terminated before the 1st November, 1946.  They have also agreed to supplement the compensation payable to members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  These ex-gratia supplements are calculated on the same basis as the increases provided for other pensioners under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950, and are payable as from the 1st April, 1951.  The annual amount payable in the year 1951-52 is estimated at £9,610 in respect of 245 former civil servants (including Petty Sessions clerks) and £10,250 in respect of 414 former members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police (including widows).  No other pensioners are affected.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial increases, costing <Col N="1018" /> £3,683,000 in the current year, have already been granted this year to public servants generally, and provision for meeting these continuing charges from taxation has yet to be made. Further increases to public servants would involve yet more taxation and a consequent further rise in the cost of living for all sections.  This would be felt with particular severity by the large body of taxpayers and their families who would not benefit under the Deputy's proposals.  The answer to the question must, therefore, be in the negative.</P>

      <P>The Hospitals' Trust Fund is the only source available to me as Minister for Health for the allocation of capital grants for hospital works.  Unfortunately, the balance remaining in the fund and the probable accretions to it over the next few years will be inadequate to meet the existing <Col N="1020" /> commitments of the fund.  In these circumstances, although I can assure the Deputy that very sympathetic consideration was given to the application of the authorities of the institution mentioned by him, I found myself unable to promise any grant from the Fund for the rebuilding scheme at the Auxiliary Orthopaedic Hospital, Baldoyle.</P>

In other words, if they stayed in Cappagh patients awaiting entry would never get in there.  Baldoyle relieves that position.

Irish was not an essential qualification.

      <Col N="1024" /> The scheme is a departmental one and is not governed by Statutory Regulation or Order.  Provisions in Emergency Powers Orders, No. 108 of 1941 and No. 310 of 1944, enable county councils and urban authorities to acquire and dispose of timber and turf fuel and these powers are used in the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>This scheme was initiated during the emergency period and advantage was taken of it by the urban authorities as already indicated.  Local authorities are not entitled to operate the scheme without obtaining the approval of the Minister in the first instance.  There has been no general demand for an extension of the number of authorities operating the scheme.  Figures are not available which would enable a reply to be given to part (d) of the question.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that it is open to a public assistance authority to supply fuel to necessitous persons under the Public Assistance Act, 1939.</P>

      <P>The Minister states that there was no general demand for the operation of this scheme, but these councils have the power, if they wish to use it, to put the scheme into operation. If these councils, as a result of pressure from the old age pensioners' organisation, agree to put a scheme into operation, will the Minister agree to sanction it?</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 13, to add the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and where the undertaking is in existence at the passing of the Act assistance provided for it, by the board, shall not be by way of grant, but in lieu thereof, by way of loan, repayable in annual instalments without interest over such period of years and in such annual instalments as the board with the consent of the Minister, shall prescribe&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that it has been necessary to give the House such short notice of this amendment is that the need for this amendment arises from the adoption by the House of the amendment moved by the Minister on the Committee Stage to Section 2 which added to that section the words &ldquo;industrial undertaking includes an undertaking in existence at the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  As the Bill came before us originally, as I understood the Government case, it was to provide grants for the creation of new industries in those parts of the country where it was unreasonable to anticipate that persons dominated by economic consideration could reasonably be expected to establish there a <Col N="1032" /> new enterprise.  That was interpreted by certain Deputies of the House as an indication that the Minister meant to promote the establishment of these industries in the Gaeltacht.  Yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce told Deputy Dr. Browne that not one penny under this Bill was to be expended in the five or six parishes that constitute the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and they must be provided for from some other source.  The Parliamentary Secretary was very angry with me when I suggested to him at the Second Stage of this Bill that that was the case, that the Gaeltacht was being sold down the drain.  Now we have it that this Bill is designed to promote industry in Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, Clare and Kerry.</P>
    <P>Here again the case could be made that even though those areas were relatively accessible if you are building a new factory it was highly probable if economics only were present to your mind that you would opt for the vicinity of Cork or Dublin in preference to one of those western counties. But then a new principle was, I readily acknowledge, with reluctance accepted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the request of Deputies on all sides of the House who made such representations, I understand, on the Second Stage&mdash;I did not hear them but the Minister, of course, did&mdash;and rather against his own better judgment he determined to extend the benefit of the Bill to an undertaking in existence at the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think the House realises the implications of that position.  The Fíor-Ghaeltacht gets nothing under this Bill.  That part of the country which lies outside the congested areas gets nothing under this Bill.  But picture the situation if the Minister for Industry and Commerce adheres to the decision which he expressed on the Second Stage of the Bill that the only form of assistance he is prepared to give is by way of grant to the intending <i>entrepreneur.</i>  Picture the situation which will thereupon arise in the congested areas in the light of the amendment.  You would have a parish in the County Mayo in which there was a small mill operated, from the <Col N="1033" /> point of view of James Rank, as a miscroscopic unit and the property of a poor man.  But it is not from that angle that man is habitually regarded.</P>
    <P>Picture the position of that man from the standpoint of 10-acre farmers, who bring him in a bag of oats to grind for them.  From their point of view he is the strongest man in the parish.  He comes to the Minister with perfect propriety and says: &ldquo;My own mill is pretty near the end of its tether.  It will probably see me out, if I let it grind itself out, but I could undertake to grind other cereals, I could do another useful job by setting up a little compound feed establishment here if I had the capital to re-equip the mill, to buy the mixing machinery and put up a little building.  I would like to get a grant of £6,000, and I will undertake to the board that I will employ permanently not less than four men in addition to whoever is working with me already.&rdquo;  That might be a very attractive proposition from the point of view of the development of employment in that area.  Suppose the board decided to give that man £6,000, can Deputies imagine the feeling of a ten-acre farmer whose Poor Law Valuation is £7, and who all his life has looked on the mill owner as a prosperous and strong man, when he sees him getting a free grant of £6,000?  Will any Deputy think it unfair if this neighbouring farmer is stirred by envy and indignation and if he says: &ldquo;My gracious me, if that man is entitled to get £6,000 as a present what am I entitled to get?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the worst.  Take, for instance, a relatively substantial firm operating in Galway, Sligo or Ballina, I am thinking of one firm which, unhappily, has met with some drawbacks, which, I hope, it will rapidly overcome. I am referring to Hygeia, Limited, Galway.  They set up a chemical factory in Galway and they did extremely well.  They produced admirably a number of modern, selective weed-killers. The Minister will remember that I mentioned that one of the purposes to be served by this Bill could be the establishment of the manufacture of antibiotics, lest we would be left without them in time of <Col N="1034" /> emergency.  I can well imagine Foras Tionscal saying: &ldquo;We will manufacture antibiotics here if you give us the choice of where to put the plant. We will let you do it, because we want the thing manufactured.  You could extend your premises and give additional employment in this highly specialised business.  The bulk of the finished product is so small that whether you are a distance from the centres of consumption or not does not matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They will reply: &ldquo;We understand the position.  We are in this business. We do not intend to ask for a grant or any charity from the public purse for the purpose of operating this industry.  While we appreciate, however, that that is being made to us, we do not want to proceed along those lines.  Frankly, we have no capital. You had better go and get somebody else&mdash;somebody with capital to throw about.&rdquo;  The Ministers hears an eminently suitable firm saying that they do not choose to accept a grant from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Now comes the third question.  A relatively large firm has been conducting an old substantial family business in one of the towns we have in mind here.  That enterprise may be operated as a family concern.  They have never achieved the highest point of industrial efficiency, simply because they did not want to.  They kept the old chaps who grew old in their employment rambling around the job and drawing their wages.  From many aspects, you would say that their business was not run on the very highest pitch of efficiency because it was run more as a social institution.  There are many such businesses in the West, and I think they have great merit.  If it is put up to them that their business is one which is peculiarly susceptible to adaptation and that if they build a wing on to it they could most conveniently add a new process and give extra employment, they would say: &ldquo;If that is what you want us to do we will do it, but it means an investment of £12,000 in buildings, machinery and so forth.  This is an old family business and we desire to hold on to it.  It is out of the question for us to put up <Col N="1035" /> £12,000 but we would be able to advance £2,000.&rdquo;  The board says: &ldquo;That is a fair contribution from these people and we will give them a grant of £10,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I beg Deputies to consider the justifiable scandal which is thereby given to reasonable people.  In that small town that family business and its proprietor have been looked upon as the rich people of the area.  Of course, from the point of view of Dublin they are not rich or considerable, and they are ranked economically as shaky. From the point of view of their neighbour they are rich people.  Their neighbours behold the richest man they have ever seen applying to the Government for, and receiving, a grant&mdash;a free grant&mdash;of £10,000 for the apparent purpose of doubling the size of the business out of which he has already made a very comfortable income, as have his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather before him.  I feel that if Dáil Éireann did this that the people would be shocked, and not only that, but that they would begin to suspect our sanity.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was probably right in meeting the requests made to him to bring within the scope of the Bill established industries, and to envisage the possibility of providing extra employment by expanding that rather than by putting in a completely revolutionary new trend.  There is nothing wrong in my statement, and there is nothing shocking in saying to any one of the persons in the various businesses I have described: &ldquo;We are not going to give you any free grant at all, but if you require £12,000 to make the necessary addition to carry on this operation, you can have it on interest free loan, to be repaid out of profits; it would be folly to start it at all unless you can make it pay.&rdquo;  The Minister has emphasised that his whole purpose is to make one initial contribution to start the project under way, and that, thereafter, it must stand on its own feet.  That is the very basis of his whole plan.  Therefore, it should be made known to the relatively rich <i>enterpreneur</i> that there is no free grant.  It is most salutary to be able <Col N="1036" /> to say to neighbours who would entertain justifiable envy if they thought he was getting a grant, that there was no question of offering a grant, and that all that was happening was that the capital to extend was being provided to this man, so that he does not start out with a load of inescapable interest payments hanging around his neck.</P>
    <P>Now what brings down an enterprise in these rural areas is that having put £12,000 into it, you start out at once with the first £720 you earn going down the sink and after you have paid £720 every year in interest, you owe just as much, after 20 years of paying interest, as you owed the first day.  What we say to this man is: &ldquo;If you are going to embark on this venture, nobody is going to jump on your neck in the first year if you pay only £10 or £50 but whatever your annual contribution is in the initial stages, it is a reduction of the sum due.  If the thing turns out well, and you make a good profit out of it at an early stage, then let the matter be reviewed and let the annual instalments be £200 or £300 but whether it is £5 or £1,000 you are paying on the debt, every £1 you pay is reducing your liability.  At the end of the term agreed you will have the business and no debt, and no one will have it to say that you had out of the Exchequer one penny piece by way of a free gift or that you had out of anybody one farthing that you did not earn.&rdquo;  That leaves us in the position that we can say to everybody else: &ldquo;If you are prepared to do as much in a similar enterprise, get to it and we shall all be delighted.&rdquo;  I understand the Minister's intention in putting in this amendment yesterday but I think you would be in grave danger of doing very real and great damage, if you allow the House to go forward on the basis of giving grants to establish an enterprise.  I would urge on him that that decision should be reconsidered and that the procedure which I here submit be adopted in its stead.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go further into the incalculable value to the country of the experiment of seeing how interest-free money might fructify in the hands of free enterprise.  I think that that might be a revelation to the world, were it but tried.  I think <Col N="1037" /> interest has always strangled the greater part of the efforts of mankind to bring human wants, wealth, manpower and raw materials together into fruitful collaboration.  Here are conditions in which we may rightly justify the suspension of that accursed infliction on human endeavour for the last seven centuries.  If it were only for that reason, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, not with much hope, but I cannot but believe that the Minister must agree with me that the procedure of giving grants to establish relatively prosperous persons in industry would be quite a shocking development, were those grants, in fact, to operate to increase the size of their already not inconsiderable property, looked at from the viewpoint of their neighbours.  I am certain the adoption of this amendment would make the Bill function more satisfactorily in the dwindling remnant of the congested areas where it is now to operate.</P>
    <P>I await at some later stage of our discussion on this Bill for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture to tell us what has become of the benefits he so confidently prophesied for the Gaeltacht under this Bill.  Is he still angry with me for telling him on the Second Stage of the Bill that he was being taken for a ride and that, like the young lady of Riga, who went for a ride on a tiger, he would return from the ride with the Parliamentary Secretary inside and a smile on the face of the tiger?</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon put his finger on a very big problem in connection with this Bill in relation to the humanity which exists already in the Bill, from the point of view of geography.  Section 3 provides that the areas to which the Bill applies are the congested areas and it indicates seven whole counties that can be regarded as counties which will benefit under the Bill.  I am quite sure that it would outrage all of us, and outrage the spirit of the Bill, if it were applied to certain areas within any of these counties because in most of these seven counties <Col N="1038" /> you will find certain areas that are quite as prosperous, if not more so, than many places in counties not mentioned there at all.  I think it is reasonable to expect that the provisions of the Bill will not be applied to the rich spots in these counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say, if that is so, I should be glad to hear the point discussed further, and it was worth while putting down the amendment in order to discuss it.  It certainly would be news to me if it were stated that industries were to be established under this Bill in certain spots of the seven counties mentioned here, which are very well able to look after themselves, both from the point of view of industry or the point of view of catering for the employable population living there.  As I understand Deputy Dillon's amendment, he looks at the humanity of these seven districts as if they were equally liable to benefit under it.  I do not regard the geographical areas expressed in the form of these seven counties as being areas, each part of which is equally worthy of having the benefits of this Bill applied to them.  I take it this Bill is applicable to areas which have a definite economic problem arising out of the condition of these areas and that they are not definable in terms of counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my impression is correct, the amendment which Deputy Dillon proposes seeks to try to do a job in relation to the humanity of these areas that it has been found impossible to do by legislative definition of geographical areas.  But, if the amendment was accepted, then I would be greatly disappointed in respect of what I hoped might happen under Sections 6 and 7. Section 6 proposes that &ldquo;the board may make grants for the purpose of providing machinery and equipment, provided the board is satisfied that the undertaking would be likely to provide or maintain employment in such area&rdquo; When I found the word &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; there, I had my mind directed to small industries which have existed for a <Col N="1039" /> long time, very often struggling with ups and downs, in some of the Gaeltacht areas and which the Gaeltacht Services organisation assisted by marketing some of their wares.  I thought it was to be expected that under this Bill in some of these cases it would be possible by way of grant to strengthen the foundation upon which these industries rested so that the basis could be made more secure and that this Bill might be of use to strengthen the permanent hope of keeping them there and extending them.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of my hopes, as I read the Bill originally, and of the fact that such slender foundations as there might have been for any such hope on my part would be completely blighted and blasted if the Minister were to be expressly prevented from doing that by any inclusion in this Bill of a provision that no existing industry of any kind in the Irish-speaking districts had any chance of being assisted because it had struggled to its feet on its own initiative.  Therefore, one of the main things for which I welcomed the Bill in connection with Section 6 would be cut out of the Bill.  Section 7 states that &ldquo;the board may make grants, on such terms as they think proper, for the training, either in the State or elsewhere, of workers in skilled processes of an industrial undertaking in an undeveloped area if the board are satisfied that the undertaking would be likely to provide or maintain employment in such area.&rdquo;  I contemplated also that it would be <Col N="1040" /> possible under Section 7 for the board to make a grant to an existing industry in the Gaeltacht which would enable it to send some of its workers away to get training in their particular class of work so as to improve their technique and widen their horizon generally with regard to the possibility of developing that industry.  That section would provide that, for the purpose of sending such a worker for training, an advance could be made and the grant would not exceed the actual amount of the wages paid by the undertaking to workers during their period of training.  Under Section 6, the grant would not exceed more than half of the cost of the machinery or equipment and the industry would have to provide the other half of the cost.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of an amendment like that would definitely secure that no existing industry in the Gaeltacht could get assistance by way of grant to a maximum of 50 per cent.  of the expenditure and that none of them could be assisted under this Bill to send their workers away for training by means of a grant.  If that is passed, it would prevent that.  If the Minister has made the suggestion to which Deputy Dillon referred, that also would make it impossible to hope for anything for them.</P>

      <P>I am asking Deputy Mulcahy to give way for a moment before he concludes.  Will he consider my amendment in the light of the Minister's statement as reported in the <i>Irish Press?</i>  It was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass said that Dr. Browne had raised a specialist problem. He (Mr. Lemass) did not think that that measure would benefit the half-dozen parishes which constituted the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  He did not think it desirable that they should try to attract industrial development by private enterprise into those areas.  It would only have an <Col N="1041" /> Anglicising effect.  If there was to be industrialisation in those areas, it must of necessity be done by State organisations which must have instructions to subordinate commercial success to the preservation of the language and the Gaelic character of those areas.  He had discussed the matter with Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaelige and they would prefer industrial employment to be developed around the Fíor-Ghaeltacht so that those who desired to leave it would not wander too far and would still be in contact with the home atmosphere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was in the light of the knowledge that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht was cut out of the operation of the Bill and that the Gaeltacht was cut out of the operation of the Bill, that you are left with Roscommon, Sligo, East Donegal, East Galway and East Kerry, that I said: &ldquo;Surely you are not going to distribute the grant in Ballina and Tralee?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the loan is free of interest, from what source will such a loan be obtained?  I did not know there was any banking institution in the country willing to lend money free of interest.  I know the State can always provide money free of interest by voting the necessary money.  Likewise, an authority set up by the State can provide money free of interest out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas. This amendment is the same as the original Bill.  It is to provide grants for these people whom Deputy Dillon represents as being excluded.  I think the principle of the amendment raises a very important issue.  Deputy Dillon says it is better to give a loan free of interest rather than give a grant.  I have been in considerable agreement with Deputy Dillon on that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think there is something to be said for the principle underlying this amendment, but I fail to see the necessity for it.  It seems to me that the annual grants could be provided under the Bill as it stands.  It is desirable that the method of assistance envisaged in the amendment should be considered.  It may have some merit in particular cases.  Once in 10, 15 or 20 years Deputy Dillon can put forward a constructive suggestion and there may be a constructive idea in this amendment.

I want to be put right on this.  Unlike a lot of Deputies, I do not pretend to be an authority on the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, but I have knocked about the Gaeltacht and the western counties a bit.  For a long number of years, believe it or not, I have had some interest in them.  That was one of the reasons why I welcomed this Bill, particularly in its application to the more remote areas where the struggle for existence is keenest.</P>
      <P>We are now told that industries which may be developed under this Bill will not be given to the most remote and purely Irish-speaking areas.  Why?  Because it might Anglicise them.  We are familiar with the saying &ldquo;To Hell or to Connaught.&rdquo; What is this?  We will not put an industry in a purely Irish-speaking area because the people there might be Anglicised if we did so.  But they can go to Britain, to Birmingham, Sheffield and Leeds, or to New York and be Anglicised or Americanised. Are those people going to be told that industries will not be placed in their areas, and that the facilities provided under this Bill will not be given to them to enable them to provide themselves with a livelihood in their own districts because they are Irish speakers, because if an industry was provided for them in their home districts they might learn how to speak English?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that the situation?  I think that <Col N="1046" /> the Minister, in fairness to himself and to the Bill, ought make that position clear before we go any further.  This measure has been approached and discussed in the House in an entirely non-Party way.  It is a measure which, I think, has received the benediction of Deputies on all sides of the House. It got the good wishes of every member of the House on Second Reading.  I want to know from the Minister, are there certain areas which are going to be blacked out on the map, inside which no industry can be placed, or will not get any of the benefits which the Bill sets out.</P>
    <P>I think that, before we go any further, the Minister ought to tell us exactly where we stand in that regard. As far as I am concerned, I am not going to vote for any further stages of this Bill until that position is clarified. I want Deputies, whether they come from Donegal, Galway or Mayo, to get up here and state publicly whether they agree with the Minister, or with any outside body which claims to speak and give directions to the people who live in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, that, because they are in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, the benefits of this particular measure will not flow over the border to them.</P>

Remember, it is all right to say that it is in the Bill, but the Bill gives the Minister a tremendous discretion.

      <P>The Minister ought to read the Bill himself.  Take, the board, if you like.  The board will have to be given some sense of direction when it is set up.  I want to know where exactly we stand.  Is what I say true or untrue?  Are we to interpret the Minister's statement as being a declaration that, inside the Fíor-Ghaeltacht the warrant of this Bill will not run?  I cannot read anything else into it&mdash;that no person or group of persons within the Fíor-Ghaeltacht can apply for and obtain the advantages and benefits which are set out in this measure.  If that is the position, then I think this Bill ought not to be passed by the House as it now stands.  It is not the Bill that we thought it was when we were asked to give it a Second Reading.  There are other Deputies who have a bigger personal responsibility in regard to this than I have, the Deputies representing the areas concerned. I am just giving the House my view of the position as it now emerges from the statement made by the Minister. If the Minister can controvert that I will be very pleased indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am equally against Deputy Dillon's amendment because I think it would be unfair.  What it means, in effect, is this, that where somebody on his own initiative, and out of his own funds and without any assistance from the State, and as we know in many cases out of a pure love to do something for those poor areas, started an industry, struggled along and kept it going over a number of years, as we know many did, he will not be allowed to take a grant under this to get new machinery, <Col N="1048" /> to improve existing machinery or to extend existing buildings, while some person who has never made any effort up to now to do anything in the Gaeltacht or western areas is going to be allowed to come into competition with that person who has been working there for years and to do that fortified with substantial grants under this Bill. The person who has been working there for years is to be deprived of that. That seems to me to be the purport of Deputy Dillon's amendment.  I certainly would be very strongly opposed to that amendment.  I think it would be unfair and unjust to those people in the western areas, many of whom have given the best years of their lives to the running of little industries there, industries which provided employment for boys and girls, but principally for girls.</P>
    <P>I can throw my mind back to my first visit to Achill.  It is nearly 30 years ago.  There was a lady there at that time&mdash;I hope she is there still&mdash; who had started a knitting industry. She used to go to London to get the latest designs.  She started absolutely on her own and trained and gave employment to quite a number of young girls.  The articles which were turned out were a credit not merely to the designer but to the operatives whom she trained.  I give that as one example. Is she to be deprived of all benefit under this Bill?  Is she not to get a grant or help of any kind under it, whereas another individual, or group of individuals, who never gave two hoots about the Gaeltacht and never tried to do anything prior to the passing of this Bill are to get the full benefits and grants which it proposes, merely because they were not in existence at the date of the passing of the Act?  I certainly would not vote for that amendment.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the question is much more serious.  I ask the Minister, for the sake of the measure and in order to help the House, to make the position clear to us now.  None of us wants to be pursuing this if we are going along a wrong trail.  The Minister, I think, ought not to sit there and allow us to draw those conclusions if we are wrong.  The Minister should clarify the position in <Col N="1049" /> fairness to the House and to the measure itself.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was told several times across the floor of the House that he had a Dublin outlook and that the Gaeltacht was a pain in the neck to him.  As a matter of fact, I was challenged about my confidence in the Bill.  As a result of the Minister's statement, my confidence has gone up almost unbounded in the efficacy of this measure from the Gaeltacht point of view.  Everybody who reads the Bill will notice that the Gaeltacht was not specifically mentioned at all in it.  That very fact gave rise to apprehension in the minds of a great many friends of the Gaeltacht who thought that the Gaeltacht was going to suffer irreparable damage as a result of this measure.  Why do I say that this Bill is a better one than seemed to me at first flush?  I say it because, implicit in the Minister's statement, is this practical guarantee that whether private enterprise rose to the occasion or not the Gaeltacht is not going to be let down, and that the Government is going to see that special suitable industries will be undertaken there.</P>

It is that part of the country which is well cherished as our last heritage and to which a great deal of lip service is given.  I would like to put this question to Deputy Mulcahy and to Deputy Morrissey: would it help young people from the Gaeltacht to live in urban conditions or if Galway City or Carraroe are to be the location of these urban conditions, would it help?

      <P>I am satisfied that the State will see that not alone will industries be provided but that they are going to go further in relation to the Gaeltacht and that the industries that will be provided there will be as suitable as possible.  Does Deputy Mulcahy <Col N="1051" /> suggest that the ordinary industrialist who would establish a line in any area of the Gaeltacht, let us take for argument sake, Inishmaan, which is 1 per cent.  Fíor-Ghaeltacht, would be able to secure accommodation for a rising population in such a place.  Why, they would not have standing room there after a generation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been going to Birmingham and to America and Australia.  They have emigrated to these places and have come back in 40 years after and have been able to speak their native tongue as good as when they left Ireland.  Does the Deputy suggest that if they go in to Galway City they are going to lose the language?  This Bill is designed to establish industries in certain regions of the West coast that will minister to the needs of the migrating section of the Gaeltacht.  If I had my choice and if I had the power to save the Gaeltacht the solution would be quite obvious.  Take the whole entire Gaeltacht and place it in the middle of Ireland where the people can live under good agreeable conditions.  That would be the best way of solving the problem but it is not possible.  We have done that to some extent and the people have neither lost the language nor deteriorated in any other way.  An instance of this is the Rathcarna Gaeltacht in County Meath.  I spoke to a number of County Meath people who have learned the language from the incomers from the Gaeltacht.  I would recommend to Deputy Giles that he should follow the example of some of the people in County Meath and come in here and deliver Gaelic speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Gaeltacht is going to get very special consideration as a result of the Minister's statement. Those who had doubts on this point simply because the Gaeltacht was not specifically mentioned can put their minds at ease.  I have read a memorandum from Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and I understand fully the apprehension that induced them to mention this matter.  If we are to save the Gaeltacht and to preserve it as a <Col N="1052" /> well from which the rest of us are to acquire a fluent knowledge of the language, then the plans, advice and suggestions contained in that memorandum should be carried out in so far as it is possible to do it.</P>
    <P>The people who think this Bill is going to do damage to the Gaeltacht do not understand what is going to be done.  We see boys and girls going to the far corners of the earth every year. There has been absolutely no concern about their loss to the language or otherwise.  As a result of the industries established under this Bill they will not have to cross the Shannon and yet people are afraid now that they are going to lose the language, an anxiety which I think is ridiculous.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was making his observations regarding this Bill he said he had a greater measure of hope rather than confidence in its success, but in any case that it was worth the trial and that he proposed to go ahead.</P>
      <P>I want the House to realise, in connection with this amendment, that there is a big difference between a grant and a loan, especially when you take into consideration the mentality it creates.  Many a person will say: &ldquo;We will take a chance with regard to getting this grant.  We cannot lose anything anyway, and it is something for nothing at the expense of somebody.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> On the other hand, the loan actually does what the grant is designed to do. If you want to invest money either in building or equipment, whether it be a loan or a grant, it is finance which enables you to get whatever you want. There is an inclination to accept a grant when you know that you are not going to be at a risk but in the case of a loan you will avail of it if you realise that it is really going to be useful to you and I think myself that something should be done with regard to the issue of these loans to ensure that it will not be just a waste of money, that there will be some return got and that it will be more than just a matter of taking a chance on giving out the grants in the hope of success.</P>
    <P>It would be a much better idea if we could have arrangements in this Bill, whereby, under certain circumstances, a loan would be made and under other circumstances that a grant would be made.  The loan implies some kind of obligation on the person who gets it but the grant certainly does not put any obligation on anybody once he has accepted it.  I believe the loan will encourage enterprise and encourage an effort to make a success of whatever the project is.  I was very much surprised at the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding the Anglicisation that this Bill may bring about in the Gaeltacht areas.  It is a consideration that should not arise if we can improve the economy of these districts by means of this Bill.  The Bill should be extended in order to create that measure of prosperity in other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment because I think it creates difficulties which would not justify its inclusion.  What I like about the Bill is that it sets out to assess what was very aptly called the competitive disadvantage that private enterprise would be at if starting industries in these areas and that it sets out to neutralise or to make amends for that competitive disadvantage by the making of grants towards the setting up of the industry or by giving other assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that if a loan were used, it would be much more difficult and <Col N="1054" /> would be very hard to administer in a general way.  If a loan were used, it would be necessary for the board to review the whole trading position of the industry each year.  It would be necessary for them to take into consideration things like bad management and high costings.  Co-ordination would be very difficult if you had some industries on grants and some on loans. It would be frightfully difficult for the board to adjudicate fairly between those two industries.  I support the suggestion made by Deputy Morrissey in connection with the industry which had already been in existence and which had struggled on in very difficult circumstances, that it would be unfair if it was forced by the amendment to take a loan instead of a grant.</P>
    <P>As far as the Gaeltacht position is concerned, I understand that the Bill did not exclude the areas of the Gaeltacht and that the Gaeltacht was given an additional guarantee that where private enterprise could not be depended upon to do anything for them, the State would initiate such industries. That is the impression I got. I do not think it is very unlikely that successful business men would go down to form industries in the Gaeltacht areas and I think the State will be ready to give them additional benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever Deputy Dillon's intention was in pursuing this amendment, I think it would, to some extent, emasculate this Bill.  That is the first difficulty in regard to it.  Then, if one looks at it from Deputy Rooney's contribution, you will find this older, conservative approach of not providing money at all unless you could prove that the industry does not need it. That, I think, would be the position if we were to follow up that line of argument.  I am all for the provision of a grant rather than a loan as set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey very quickly took up the hare that was started by Deputy Dillon.  Undoubtedly it was a hare started by Deputy Dillon to convince the people living in those undeveloped areas, particularly in the Gaeltacht section, that the Bill is to be no use for them at all.</P>

      <P>That seems to me to be part of the essentials to the establishment of an industry that is going to give employment to a certain number of people and I can visualise under this Bill an industry being started in Clifden, in Galway or in other areas such as those under the Bill where there would be facilities with regard to power, water and sewerage and into these particular places persons will be taken and employed. If people are employed in Clifden or somewhere else like that, it is much better that they should be employed there than, as has been said, in Birmingham. That is the purpose of the Bill as I see it, to start industries in those areas, give employment convenient to the homes of the workers rather than off in Birmingham, Manchester or somewhere else in Britain or, for that matter, over in America. It depends on the type of industry in which employment will be given.  Certain industries will give considerable employment for a considerable radius or distance from the factory.</P>

That would give employment to quite a considerable number of people a long distance away from the factory where the fish are tinned, processed or dealt with in some other way.  That is the sort of thing I visualise happening under this Bill, that industries will be started in suitable centres in the undeveloped areas and that employment will be given. That direct employment may create indirect employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief and I hope to relate my remarks to the amendment.  Whatever hope there is of this Bill doing good in its present form I believe, if this amendment were accepted, that that good would be taken from the Bill.  I have welcomed the Bill and I am not going to repeat what I have already said.  I have welcomed the Bill as a gesture towards a solution of the problems that exist in the undeveloped areas, with particular reference to the <Col N="1060" /> Gaeltacht areas.  I am glad that the Bill has gone so far, if only to prove that this gesture, as I shall describe it, is a gesture that will fail because private enterprise&mdash;and this is a Bill dealing with private enterprise&mdash;is not fit to tackle the problem of the undeveloped areas.  For that reason I welcome the Bill which will prove once and for all that nibbling with the problem of want of development in the West of Ireland through grants and private enterprise is a waste of time. The sooner that is proved the better. For that reason I welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>So far as the amendment is concerned, whatever little chance the Bill has of being successful&mdash;and I hope it will prove of some benefit for the sake of the people in those areas&mdash;there will be none if the amendment is accepted. I do not know how serious Deputy Dillon is about the amendment, because he was Minister for Agriculture for three years and during that period he was concerned with a body known as the Agricultural Credit Corporation and, if ever there was a body in the State that should give loans without interest, it is that particular concern. I would not go so far as to say that farmers when they need a loan should get it completely free of interest, but the rate of interest charged by this corporation to my mind is fantastic. Yet we have a man, who was a Minister and who is a prominent personality in this House, putting down an amendment that there should be a loan repayable in annual instalments with interest over a period of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Two problems are raised in connection with this amendment. One is what is to be the position of development in those areas which could be described as Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.  It is clear now from what the Minister said last night and repeated to-day that, so far as this Bill is concerned, it will not provide any <Col N="1061" /> private industry in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Every time I hear Deputy Cogan speaking or interrupting in this House, I am reminded of what Cicero said.  Deputy Cogan approaches everything with an open mind.  Cicero had the view that, while his tongue was bought, his soul was unsullied.  Deputy Cogan approaches everything with an open mind, but the final word is that he is opposed to every amendment which his masters frown upon.  Therefore, he is frowning on this amendment and on my remarks which he thinks will be in support of the amendment.  However, I want to come to the points raised and the raising of which has been permitted in this debate.  Some confusion exists as to whether this Bill will permit industries to be established in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>

If the Minister had intervened an hour and a half ago, this House would be on the point of adjourning.  But the discussion has been allowed to get muddier and muddier.  I want to see where we are being asked to go in this whole situation.  The Minister stated last night, and stated by way of interjection in this debate, that, so far as this Bill is concerned, it does not make any special provision for the establishment of an industrial undertaking under private auspices in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.  The Minister expressed the view, which he said is his own view&mdash;and, mark you, he will control and direct the board&mdash;that if there are to be industries in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, those industries should be State industries, not industries set up under this Bill, but special kinds of industries which the Government will select.</P>

Deputy Bartley was allowed to say that his enthusiasm for this measure was now unbounded.  Up to yesterday it was measurable; to-day it is unbounded.  It is not possible to plumb the depth of his enthusiasm as a result of what the Minister stated in respect of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for that enthusiasm, he said, was that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht was being specially selected, so dear was it to the heart of the Government, and the special selection consisted of picking out special industries which would be started, not under this Bill, but at some time in the sweet by-and-by in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas. That is what caused this astronomic rise in Deputy Bartley's enthusiasm for this Bill.  The Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas are to be dealt with specially in a Bill which we have not yet seen; but which may be introduced some time in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House had accepted last night the amendment moved by Deputy Desmond, we could tie in the two types of development at one time; we could utilise private enterprise, in so far as it went, to develop the undeveloped areas and the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and, at the same time, utilise the amendment and, consequently, the Bill for the purpose of promoting a special kind of State enterprise in any of the areas where it was felt, for one reason or another, it was undesirable to allow a private company to commence operations. Last night that encrusted socialist, Deputy Cowan, as he was a <Col N="1063" /> few months ago, abandoned that great depth of faith which he has shown on other occasions in the socialist cause and concept and walked into the Lobby on the side of private enterprise as against State activity which would help the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come to the amendment.  As I understand it, it seems to me a reasonable amendment. We are now engaged in passing a Bill the object of which is to make £2,000,000 available to promote private enterprise in the undeveloped areas. That £2,000,000 does not belong to private enterprise.  It is £2,000,000 of public money which has to be raised from the pockets of the taxpayers and which may be raised in such a form that every citizen, and particularly the lowly section of our community, will have to contribute.  As custodians of the public interest, we ought to concern ourselves with how this public money will be spent.  While it may be necessary, in order to encourage industry in the undeveloped areas, to give grants in special cases where no other method of inducement will encourage the establishment of an industry, we ought to be careful I think when it comes to giving a grant to any person, firm, or corporation which in fact may not need a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And is already established and working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Let us take a specific case: it may be necessary, for example, in an undeveloped area to come to the aid of an existing industry and say: &ldquo;If you can expand your activities this board is prepared to give you the facilities set out here in Section 5 of the Bill.&rdquo;  But under Section 5 of the Bill the only thing you can do for the company already in existence is to give the body a grant.  The company may not, in fact, need a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Circumstances may not be such as to justify a grant and, as we are dealing <Col N="1064" /> with public money, is there anything wrong in saying to the undertaking which is already in existence: &ldquo;You expand your activities; you employ more people and we will be willing to give you a loan free of interest, the repayments to be determined in any way we agree with you.&rdquo;  It will be possible in an arrangement of that kind to give an industry £5,000 or £10,000 to help it to extend its activities and not to charge the industry a single penny interest on the £10,000.  But it is not unreasonable I suggest to say to the company: &ldquo;Well and good, if you can repay that money in the ultimate future free of interest, as the money has come from the public purse it is not unreasonable to ask you to do so and the money will go back into the kitty and be used to help other people in similar circumstances or to create new industries in undeveloped areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there anything onerous in that? So far as the man who wants to extend his industry is concerned he gets all the money he wants.  He gets the £10,000 and goes and buys equipment worth £10,000.  He knows he will not have to pay a penny interest on the £10,000 and he will know also that he is only expected to repay the actual money given to him if at any time he is able to repay it without impairment of his industry.</P>
    <P>I do not regard that as an onerous condition at all.  I am quite sure that if this Bill extended to other areas you would have large numbers of people queueing up in order to take advantage of the facilities offered.  As this amendment only relates to an industry already established and has nothing to do with industries we hope to establish, what is wrong in saying to the industry already established: &ldquo;We will give you the money free of interest; pay it back when you can pay it back and let it go back into the kitty to repeat the good work again which it has done for you by our giving it to you free of interest, repayment provisions at your leisure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that is an unreasonable provision.  I do not think the acceptance of this amendment would cause any hardship to potential beneficiaries or in the slightest degree impair the Bill because in my opinion the <Col N="1065" /> Bill has swung too far, perhaps, in one direction in making it possible to give an annual grant to existing industries. If we know the financial circumstances of the company we should have a chance of deciding that we will give them a loan free of interest if that is all they need.  They may not need a grant.</P>
    <P>I want to argue this purely on its merits irrespective of who introduced it.  As we are dealing with public money, we ought not lightly to fritter away the public's money in making substantial grants towards private enterprise when we are not satisfied that private enterprise needs such grants and when, in fact, a loan would be sufficient for our purpose, namely, to expand the industry and absorb our people into employment.</P>

      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle allows me to chase the red herring or the hare, whatever you like to call it, I think I can dispose of it once and for all.  I do not think it will get very far.  When this Bill was announced the executive of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge asked to see me.  I met the representatives of the organisation. They professed anxiety lest the effect of the Bill would be to attract private industrial firms into about half a dozen parishes in the country which they <Col N="1066" /> described as Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  There may be a use of that term in the Department of Education, or elsewhere, which has a wider significance than that body gave it in the course of my discussion with them.  Deputies have used the term Gaeltacht here as applying to practically any place west of the Shannon.  They however, had in mind, and I had in mind, when speaking last night, about half a dozen parishes in which Irish is still the normal everyday spoken language of the people.</P>

      <P>They expressed the view that there is no means of getting private industrial enterprise into these areas without the risk of introducing an anglicising influence.  They said private industrial concerns would naturally be established for the purpose of making profits and would not be deterred from that course to the extent of bringing in outside technicians or managers if required.</P>
      <P>I asked them what safeguards they thought should be inserted in the Bill and they said no effective safeguards could be devised.  I expressed the opinion, I still hold it, that in respect of these outlying Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, no assistance we could give would, in fact, be likely to induce ordinary private commercial enterprise into them.  They accepted that view but indicated that they would prefer industrial development to take place in the surrounding areas where there was still sufficient Irish in use to create the right type of atmosphere for Irish speakers and, at the same time, little danger of damage being done in the limited area where the Irish language is still the normal everyday language of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They urged strongly that industrial development or any other development in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, as they defined them&mdash;and they did not confine this to industrial activity; they referred <Col N="1067" /> also to the development of afforestation and fisheries&mdash;should be entrusted to a State organisation so constituted that there would be no risk of an anglicising element being introduced. State organisations which would be under orders from the Government to subordinate the commercial success or the economics of what they were doing to the primary task of maintaining the Gaelic nature of the areas.</P>

      <P>When introducing the Bill, I said that the word Gaeltacht was not mentioned in it.  I said that this was not a measure designed to handle the special problems of the Gaeltacht.  This measure is designed to handle the economic problems of a wide part of the country known as the congested areas, and within the congested areas there is the Gaeltacht.  National policy has the dual aim of stopping emigration from the Gaeltacht, of improving the economic conditions in it and of preserving its Gaelic character. Now, the task of preserving its Gaelic character is not discharged under this Bill.  I personally agree with the view of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge that, in the limited area they have in mind, the two tasks could be combined in one organisation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can argue that point with those who hold that view.  I take their view as representing the considered opinions of those who have given themselves the primary task of developing and restoring the language, and I try to relate that view to my own responsibility which is entirely economic as I see it.  I would not take it on myself to argue that their view is wrong.  It seems to me that there was sense in their contention, that if we have to undertake economic tasks in these areas, and are to fulfil those tasks without damaging the language, that we need specialised organisations for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let me turn to the amendment. I have said since I introduced the Bill on Second Reading&mdash;I have said it again and again until those listening to me must be sick from hearing it&mdash;that the aid that will be given under this <Col N="1069" /> Bill will be designed for the purpose of ensuring that industrial enterprise in the West will be at no disadvantage in competition with similar enterprise in the East.  I said that if there was, in fact, no competitive disadvantage in a western location that there would be no aid given.  I said that the responsibility of An Foras Tionscal would be to relate the aid given to their assessment of the competitive disadvantage of the location.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy says that he objects to help being given under the Bill to industries established in prosperous centres like Galway and Sligo.  The answer to that is that if an industry started in Galway or Sligo is deemed by this board to be under no competitive disadvantage at all, it will get no aid.  Aid will be given only to the extent that there is a decision, on a review of the facts, that that industry, if economic conditions alone were to decide its location, would have gone to Dublin or to Cork, and that there is a disadvantage in going to Galway or Sligo.  It is only in that case that aid will be given to it.</P>
    <P>When I, in response to pressure from Deputies opposite, agreed to put in this provision extending the Bill to existing industries, a provision which I am quite prepared to take out if there are any doubts as to the wisdom of having it here, I emphasised as one of the reasons why, in framing the Bill originally, I did not put in wording which would permit of the extension of aid to existing industries, that existing industries already located in the western areas by the voluntary decision of private enterprise must be deemed to be at no competitive disadvantage. When I moved the amendment, I made it clear that its aim was not to enable private enterprise, already established in the western areas, to get special aid, but only to help them if they were extending their activities.  I used the phrase if they were entering into a new development such as might have been undertaken by a new enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To the board.  The point that I made in that regard was this, that I thought it desirable that the amount of help to be given to a new enterprise starting in those areas should be determined before it began and determined finally at that stage, and that those about to undertake it would have to remember that from that point on they would be on their own with no further right of continuing assistance.  I think we are more likely to get development in that way than in any other way because, as I have repeated on every Stage of the Bill, nothing will happen under it unless private enterprise rises to the inducements held out, and unless people who have got the know-how in relation to the technical processes of an industry, the capacity to manage it and some financial resources to put into it, come forward with propositions for the consideration of An Foras Tionscal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's amendment proceeds on the assumption, apparently, that this Bill represents all the help that is going to be given to industrial development in the congested areas.  I say that this Bill provides for helping industrial enterprise in those areas over and above all the help that is now available for industrial enterprise anywhere. Amongst the forms of help available to industry at the present time are loans under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the interest is the least part that concerns those who choose to finance their enterprises in that way.</P>
      <P>The Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts have not been functioning very successfully. That fact has been already recognised in this House.  A number of concerns were helped under them and succeeded in developing satisfactorily. Some of them were not able to pay back the loans which they got.  A high proportion of those which were helped under the Act failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  That was <Col N="1071" /> not the problem.  The fact is that the worst way of financing industrial enterprises is by repayable capital. Money invested in a factory or machinery or in any physical asset of that kind should be invested permanently. It is asking too much of any industrial enterprise that they should be able to remunerate capital and repay it at the same time.  That is a bad thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not remunerate it.  That is the particular thing I am not asking. I am only asking them to repay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest on the loan has never been the worry.  Work it out for yourself-2½ per cent. on £10,000 works out at £250 a year.  Let me tell you what the circumstances attaching to the trade loan guarantee are.  A loan given under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts is secured by the mortgage on the property in the interests of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Firms that got capital in that way were debarred, in fact, from getting additional financial accommodation when they required it, because nobody was going to lend them money, not even a bank, with a prior charge in favour of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on their assets.  That is the worst way to finance industrial development, and our own experience has shown us that. We do not have to rely upon theory in order to reach that conclusion.  Any Deputy who chooses to look up the reports under the Trade Loans Acts will see it proven.</P>
      <P>There is also the Industrial Credit Company established under statute of this Dáil for the purpose of giving help to an industrial firm which requires share capital.  There are ample means available to help an industry in the West as in the East.  The only thing that we propose to do under this Bill is to give particular help over and above any other form of help which is available elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that 2½ per cent. would pay the loan off in 40 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view this is of <Col N="1072" /> no importance at all.  In any event it brings into this discussion what I wanted to keep out of it.  The proposal is to give loans free of interest.  Every year there would have to be voted by the Dáil an amount required to meet interest on the sums already loaned out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a continuing charge and a need to keep in existence indefinitely the organisation managing these loans.  There would be some moral obligation on Foras Tionscal, or there might be pressure on them, to supplement the loans if concerns were going badly.  Inevitably, arguments would be advanced, if £10,000 was invested in a concern, that it was getting dicky, and that another £5,000 or £10,000 might save it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the intention as far as this Bill is concerned. The amount of help to be given will be assessed before anybody embarks on an undertaking.  They will know beforehand what they are going to get.  Once they have decided to proceed on the basis of that help, they are on their own, and they cannot come back again to An Foras Tionscal.  If they need help again they must go, as any other enterprise in the East goes, under some other statute to the appropriate Government Department.  That is why I think this amendment would be unwise and I ask the Dáil to reject it.</P>

      <P>I want to quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of Thursday, December 13th, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" />&ldquo;Mr. Lemass said that Dr. Browne had raised a specialised problem.  He (Mr. Lemass) did not think that that measure would benefit the half-a-dozen parishes that constituted the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  He did not think it desirable that they should try to attract industrial development by private enterprise into these areas as it could only have an Anglicising effect.  If there was to be industrialisation in these areas it must of necessity be done by State organisation, which must have instructions to subordinate commercial success to the preservation of the language and the Gaelic character of these areas.  He had discussed the matter with Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and they preferred to see industrial development developing around Fíor-Ghaeltacht so that those who desired to leave it would not wander too far and would still be in contact with the home atmosphere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can those observations be reconciled with what the Minister has said just now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Well I am blowed if I know at this stage where this Bill is going to operate or for whose benefit it is intended.  Deputy Major de Valera is a fair-minded man and he read, I take it, or he even had a hand in composing, the paragraph which I have quoted just now.  Let him cross his heart and hope to die Does that paragraph not mean to any reasonable and literate person (1) that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht amounts to about six parishes in the country, which is in itself an astonishing contention, and (2) does it not mean that this Bill is not meant for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht?  If there is to be employment available there it has to be created by other methods than under this Bill.  I do not want to misrepresent what was reported in the paper but I think it did mean that and I can get no other meaning out of it.  If Deputy Major de Valera can get another meaning out of it I am quite prepared to change my mind, but I do not think I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am labouring under this embarrassment.  That is what the Minister in charge of the Bill said, but his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture on an earlier occasion expressed fierce indignation because I suggested that this Bill was not going to apply to the Gaeltacht and that the Gaeltacht would be used as a shabby alibi to get this Bill through Dáil Éireann.  Having repudiated most energetically that allegation as a cruel slander on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture listened to the Minister making that statement which I read out.  He then got up and said that he was confident that this Bill would shower blessings on the Gaeltacht, and was more firmly convinced of it than he had been heretofore.  I frankly confess that I have reached the stage that I do not know what the Dáil is doing.  I do not think anybody in the Dáil knows what it is doing.  I am shocked to think that we are in the process of passing a Bill the exact effect of which nobody in Dáil Éireann understands.  I have not heard anyone in the House give me a complete example of what he expects to happen under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy like to get one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I adumbrated the possibility under this Bill of an old-established business, the property of one of the wealthiest families, coming to the Exchequer and getting a free grant of money.  The more I reflect on that, the more shocked I am.  I do not think that there is any precedent for that proposal; I think it is almost wicked to go down to your neighbours, knowing their financial circumstances and the struggle many of them have to make to meet their ordinary <Col N="1079" /> domestic charges, and expect them philosophically to contemplate somebody, whom they have always known to be an affluent person, receiving as a free grant from the Irish Exchequer a sum of money in the order of £5,000 or £10,000 which, to them, is beyond their wildest dreams of ever saving even by the longest and hardest lifetime of work that anyone can do.  I think it is a dreadful thing to do and that we really should be ashamed of ourselves.</P>
      <P>As I say, in the light of what the Minister said, that is the only thing of substance that is going to be done under this Bill.  We will find that the number of persons prepared to put up a substantial sum of money for an industry which has never been functioning in the West of Ireland heretofore because they are going to get a grant of money will be few and far between. If they have capital which they are going to put at risk, I do not think the promise of a grant, no greater than is sufficient to balance nicely the economic disadvantages of going west, will induce the average possessor of £10,000 or £20,000 to put his personal fortune in jeopardy.  I think the best way would be to get an old industry, which possibly got run down but was capable of development in ancillary fields, to employ 200 where heretofore it employed 100, or to employ 40 where heretofore it only employed 20.  I think the Bill, as amended, is one that no responsible Government will long operate in its present form.  I should like any Deputy to tell me how he can support a grant of £10,000 to any proprietor of any substantial business in any part of the West of Ireland and justify it to the hard-working people who live around him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I feel absolutely bewildered in regard to this Bill.  I was prepared to support it.  I hoped it would be at least a start in the right direction towards doing something for the Gaeltacht, but, from the assurance given by the Minister during the course of the debate on the amendment, I feel absolutely at sea.  Deputy Bartley has <Col N="1080" /> kindly offered to explain it to the Dáil and I hope he or somebody else will. The Minister has repeated practically word for word what he said last night, that he did not think this Bill would benefit the half-a-dozen parishes which constitute the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  The Minister has extraordinary power under the Bill.  I do not agree that it is limited to half-a-dozen parishes.  I believe it covers more than half-a-dozen parishes in Mayo and Galway alone, not to speak of Donegal and other areas.  I do not agree that the language is dying so rapidly as is suggested.</P>
      <P>In case Deputies may think that this board which is to be established will have the sweeping powers, for instance, that the Land Commission have, I can tell them that is not the case.  The board will be appointed by the Minister and it can be removed at will.  The Land Commissioners cannot be removed except by a very complicated procedure.  It takes a vote of this House to remove them; they must be impeached, because they have the same tenure of office as High Court judges. I will not say that the members of the board will be completely at the mercy of the Minister, but I believe that they will not have the same freedom as the Land Commissioners or the Revenue Commissioners.  We cannot conceive any board which will be established under this Bill running counter to the Minister's wishes.  If the Minister expresses a wish or desire to the board that a particular industry should not be established within the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, I cannot see the board giving a grant towards it.</P>
      <P>The Fíor-Ghaeltacht is out of this Bill.  The Minister has assured us that places like Galway and the towns in Donegal, Mayo, Kerry and Clare will not benefit, that there would be no purpose in establishing industries in these towns; that they would not be of much help towards the real spirit behind the Bill.  Even any industry which has not a competitor in the East will not be given a grant under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, I am asking myself what kind of industry will get a grant. <Col N="1081" /> I do not know of any.  I am completely, bewildered by the Minister's reply in the last half hour.  The most damnable part of the Minister's statement, in my opinion, is where he revealed a conversation which took place between himself and some members of Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge regarding the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I want to tell Deputy Bartley and Deputy Lynch that the people in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht are just as well informed as anybody in the City of Dublin, through the newspapers, the radio, etc., and they cannot help feeling to-night that they are very much in the same category as the Indians in the reservations in America.  I think the most damnable blow ever struck at the remaining portion of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht is the Minister's admission now.  If that is the attitude that Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and the Minister and the Government are adopting, then I say to blazes with the Bill.  The people of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht want none of your charity.  We will not accept it.  We have a right to live.  We do not agree with the statements made by Deputy Bartley and by the Minister for Lands a short time ago that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht should be depopulated and the people pushed out to some other part of the country.  That will never be tolerated. <i>(Interruptions.)</i></P>
    <P>I think it is a damnable thing that any elected representative should stand up here and cold-bloodedly advocate the depopulation of that part of our country which rears the best and finest of our people.</P>

This Bill as it leaves this House tonight <Col N="1082" /> does not exclude from the areas that can benefit under the operation of the Bill the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or any other Gaeltacht.  It does not in the form in which the House will agree to its passing exclude the Irish-speaking districts.  If the Irish-speaking districts are deprived under the operation of the Bill of any of the benefits that are provided in it, that will be solely as a result of the manner in which the Bill is administered.

      <P>Perhaps I was hoping for too much from this Bill and the Minister's douche of cold water has come as an unpleasant surprise.  The Minister repeated his statement that he did not intend to allow the benefits of the Bill to flow into the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I am very disappointed because of that.  The board under this Bill has no special protection from the Minister in the same way as Land Commissioners have.  The worst blow ever struck at the Irish language has been struck by this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement horrified me.  He seemed to regard the custodians of our language as a species of tame animal that must be guarded against themselves.  If that is the attitude of the present Government, this Bill is doomed to failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put one proposition to the Minister: if a group of individuals are prepared to sink money in land for afforestation purposes in the Gaeltacht in order to give employment there, is there any guarantee that the Forestry Department will not move in on them? I did want to ask a few other questions <Col N="1083" /> which might help the Minister in administering the Bill but I am too disappointed now and too disgusted to put them.</P>

      <P>I do not think any Deputy who has spoken on this matter has been so muddled in his approach to it as Deputy Blowick.  If one suggests taking the people out of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and giving them good agricultural land elsewhere, Deputy Blowick will immediately accuse us of depopulating the Gaeltacht.  If one suggests improving the land there, he says it is only fit for planting trees. He would not let the people into Maam Valley.  He would not let the Rahaigh who are living on miserable patches of land in there.</P>

Did he ever take note of the young men who are leaving the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and going to Coventry, Birmingham and other English cities?

      <P>I want to demonstrate how the Bill will both revive and preserve and extend the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I think some Deputy referred to the case of a man coming along with a proposal for a grant of £10,000 for an industry on the fringe of the Gaeltacht. Suppose you select the town of Oughterard and that a man comes along and says: &ldquo;If you give me £10,000, I will start such-and-such an industry here,&rdquo; and also says that he will recruit men for the factory from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, men who are now going to settle in Coventry and Birmingham. We will assume that 50 men <Col N="1084" /> are required for the factory.  It is only a short distance across the mountain from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht to Oughterard. Assume that these 50 men get permanent employment there and that they settle down and get married, is it not quite obvious that you are, in fact, spreading the Fíor-Ghaeltacht out on its own fringe, that it is not only going to be preserved, but extended?</P>

If we assume that all the people who, over the last 30 or 40 years, went to Birmingham or Coventry, all of them Gaelic speakers, had settled in the town of Galway, is it not quite obvious that Galway would now be a Gaelic-speaking city?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been talk about an Indian reservation.  That is an idea that we on this side of the House have always opposed.  We have heard it here continuously down the years.  We have heard complaints from people in the Gaeltacht that the use of English is being forced upon them more and more by people of all classes, those who do business with them and others.  We have seen to it that the causes of these complaints have been reduced to the minimum.  Is it not quite obvious that, if the Gaeltacht is spread in extent, the causes for these complaints will be removed, and the Gaeltacht will become a much more numerous as well as a much more influential entity, especially if the people there have their sons and daughters living in contiguous areas earning good money and having constant contacts with their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not far better to spread the Gaeltacht out to Oughterard and give the young people a living there where there is, in fact, better land than in places like Carraroe?  Surely, no one would suggest that, because the youngsters in the Carraroe area could <Col N="1085" /> get permanent employment in Oughterard, simply because an industry was located there, that this Bill was neglecting and ignoring the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. This Bill is designed to keep at home in Ireland young people who have been looking for employment in English cities.  If it does that for the people west of the Shannon nobody here can make the claim with any justification that it is neglecting the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. This Bill will enable those young people to keep in easy contact with the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and will also help to ease the terrible pressure in the economic sphere which exists in many of those places.  Deputy Blowick knows better than I do&mdash;he was a former Minister for Lands&mdash;that there is a rearrangement problem there which he was unable to solve because he could not find any land there for the purpose.  He was unwilling to find land for them in the middle of the country.  This Bill is not going to be misunderstood in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I make this challenge to Deputy Blowick that I am prepared to go to any place in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht which he selects so that both of us can put our case before the people.</P>

      <P>This Bill was introduced with great pomp, but I am afraid it is going to leave us all rather bewildered, due not to the Bill itself but to the explanation given to us this afternoon by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I was surprised to hear the statement of the Minister that it would not operate in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. That position has not been cleared up by anything said later by the Minister or by any speaker from the Government side of the House. The Minister's statement was published in the <i>Irish Press</i> and repeated here this afternoon.  It is that statement which has created all the trouble.  I, and I think every Deputy on this side, understood that the Bill was intended mainly for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the congested areas.  We are now told that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht <Col N="1086" /> is limited to six parishes. Mayo is not included in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I can tell the House that, in quite a number of parishes in Mayo, and particularly West Mayo, the people speak their native language.  It has survived there.  Mayo is as much a part of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht as any part of Galway,</P>

      <P>I want to say that I am dissatisfied with the explanation given by the Minister to the House, to the effect that the Bill will be limited to a certain area in the County Galway, namely, six parishes which are known as the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I want to submit to the House that that limitation which is put on the Fíor-Ghaeltacht is unfair.  I regard the Fíor-Ghaeltacht as being a much wider and larger area than that described here this afternoon. If the Bill is going to be limited in that way then I want to say that I am gravely dissatisfied.  It is because of that that I am asking for an explanation.</P>
      <P>In connection with the amendment tabled by Deputy Dillon, I want to say that I am not in agreement with the giving of grants to certain industries which have been established over a number of years in the West of Ireland.  These have been protected by quotas and tariffs and it is quite obvious and quite reasonable to assume that, notwithstanding the fact that they have got certain protection and certain assistance over a period of years they will seek that assistance which will be paid for by the taxpayer who has been obliged to provide a considerable amount of money for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that amendment, the Minister indicated that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht would not benefit under this Bill, and that, on <Col N="1088" /> the other hand, industrialists within the Fíor-Ghaeltacht would be open to apply for grants.  These two statements are not identical.  Either the Bill is going to operate in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or it is not; either industrialists in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht will be in a position to apply for these grants and get them or not.  That is what we want to clear up. I am not opposed to the principle of the Bill.  As I indicated in the course of the Second Reading, if the Bill did no more than focus the attention of the Government on the problem after being asleep for 30 years, it is doing a good day's work.</P>
      <P>I do not expect a great deal from the Bill.  I do not believe, as I said, that private enterprise will solve the problem but I do say this, that in the last day or two the speeches that have been made from the Government side of the House, particularly from the Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries, indicate that the whole thing is most paltry.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to support the final stages of the Bill but I want to register a very strong protest against the exclusion of any area in the course of the administration of this Bill.  I think that you will not injure or endanger the Irish way of life or the Irish language in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht by promoting the establishment of industries within the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. If you expect the citizens of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht to come out into the Breac-Ghaeltacht, into parts of Mayo or Galway, to secure employment, you <Col N="1089" /> are endangering them in that way as much as if you erected industries in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>You can take, for example, the tourist industry.  The Fíor-Ghaeltacht is one of the places where that industry is promoted and encouraged. The people who visit those places are not Irish-speaking people; most of them are foreigners.  If we assume that the erection of industries in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas is going to endanger the Irish language or the Irish way of life we are entitled to assume that the development of tourism would do likewise.  That argument produced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not carry sense and we must agree with Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick that the whole Bill is eyewash, that it is being introduced for a certain purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in agreement at all with the giving of grants to industries that were in existence on the occasion of the passage of this Bill into law.  I do not see why the taxpayers should be called upon to help them to continue for nine or ten years fattening and battening at the expense of the taxpayers, which is a deplorable state of affairs.  I have no objection at all to the encouragement of the establishment of new industries and to assisting people who wish to come together and who are prepared to invest money. But I would object strongly to the provision of money secured from the taxpayers for the expansion of industry or for the purchase of machinery or any other ways or means to continue these industries that are in existence and have been in existence over a period of years and have received considerable protection from the various Governments in office.  They have failed and they are now coming back to the taxpayer for further assistance. I think it is wrong and indicates bad management on the part of these industries. If they have failed to make ends meet and to prove their worth over the years, I do not see why the taxpayers should be obliged to help them out.  It would be more appropriate to develop State enterprise than to provide the taxpayers' money for industries of that kind in which this Dáil <Col N="1090" /> is not permitted to question their activities nor the expenditure of that money.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I discovered that we are unable to secure information as to how the money granted is used or what has been done with it.  I am opposed to that.</P>

      <P>I want to express my amazement at the amount of confusion that appears to exist in the minds of certain members of the Opposition.  I think they must thank their leaders for the existence of that confusion.  This is an Undeveloped Areas Bill, and if there are any undeveloped areas in this country which demand immediate development they are the brains of some of our ex-Ministers.  The extraordinary lack of logic, lack of common sense, that has been shown in the arguments put up against this Bill amazes Deputies on this side of the House. We have here an objection being raised by Deputy Blowick and Deputy Cafferky on the grounds that it has not gone as far as they would like it to go.</P>
      <P>Yet the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have both made it clear that they are going to go much further than the Bill in regard to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas inasmuch as they are going, by private enterprise, to develop industries in these areas.  The objection raised by the Opposition is that the Government propose to do more for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas than has been included under the Bill.</P>

      <P>Is it not clear that this Bill is setting forth to do one thing, and that is to promote industrial development in western areas which can compete with industries in the rest of the country?  In addition to that, the Minister, in the course of the discussion, as also did the Parliamentary Secretary, made it clear that the utmost that could be done by way of providing public enterprise, particularly <Col N="1091" /> in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, would be done.  There is a lack of logic on the part of those Deputies who oppose the Bill because it seeks to promote private enterprise and then finds it cannot because the Minister has indicated that he is going to develop Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas by public enterprise. There seems to be complete confusion of mind on these two conflicting lines of argument.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy Dillon protesting strongly against a proposal to promote the expansion of existing industries in the areas specified in the Bill.  Surely, if it is desirable to help a new industry to be established in the undeveloped areas it should also be desirable to help an existing industry to expand there if there are strong reasons why that industry is unable to expand by reason of its location and the disadvantages which it suffers as compared with other industries.  I think Deputy Dillon mentioned a specific figure of £10,000 which an existing industry might obtain under this Bill.  I am sure that a very strong case would have to be made on behalf of an industry to secure a loan of that nature. It would certainly have to prove, first of all, that it was at a disadvantage when competing with industries in other parts of the country.  It would have to prove that it would, when expanded, be able to give considerable employment.  Having proved that and having justified its claim under the very rigid provisions which are contained in this Bill, I think there could be no objection to securing the capital which it requires, any more than there would be any objection to a new industry securing the necessary capital in order to assist it to get established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said, of course, that there are no precedents for such a large grant.  First of all, the grant does not go into the pocket of any individual but is used to purchase the plant and equipment which are necessary for the extension of an existing industry or for the establishment of a new one.  Indeed, there are precedents for large sums of money being given to people who are regarded as having considerable means.  For example, <Col N="1092" /> under the land rehabilitation scheme, lords living in demesnes within walls got substantial amounts of money in order to drain and reclaim their land. I have no objection to that; the money will not go into the pocket of the lord or whoever may be the recipient.  It will be used towards the ultimate benefit of the nation, in so far as the land will be improved.  Deputy Dillon himself when he was Minister for Agriculture established a precedent by giving assistance of that kind and I am not objecting to that.</P>
    <P>It is a pity there have been so many wild, confusing arguments expressed against this Bill by people who have proclaimed all along, and are still proclaiming, that they intend to support it.  Why can they not see in this a reasonable attempt to do something to help this country to develop industries, and to do something which is not in conflict with, but complementary to, everything else that is being done by other Government Departments, such as the Forestry Division?  These people should realise that what is being done now is an addition to what has been done and what will continue to be done by State Departments which are already in existence and by other ones which will be established both in the country generally and in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In company with other Deputies, I welcome this Bill.  It is, I feel, clear for the first time to many, such as myself, what the limitations of this Bill are.  It will occasion a certain amount of disappointment in many areas in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht because its scope is so limited&mdash;that the pattern of development following this Bill will be around the larger towns in the West of Ireland.  Everybody will welcome, I feel sure, any development which brings an industry across the Shannon to the West.  I would like to know what the present position is in view of the limitation of this Bill to the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would let us know what propositions there are, if any, for the development of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. The hope of many people was that this Bill was to be directed to the development of these areas, and <Col N="1093" /> it is hoped that it may be possible to get an extension of the areas mentioned in the Bill.  I feel that the recommendations of Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge need not, nor should not, be taken so fully into consideration and should not be accepted as valid reasons for keeping the Fíor-Ghaeltacht outside the province of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, and many other Deputies in this House know Connemara better than I do and realise that it is the most undeveloped and underdeveloped part of the whole of Ireland. It is from these areas that there is the greatest incidence of emigration. In fact, if one were to start an industry in Lettermore, Carraroe, Lettermullen or Carna it would be very difficult to find people to employ.  The reason is that there are only three grades or sections of people residing in these districts at the present time&mdash;the very old, the very young and the small landholder. The young adult boy and girl have to get out of these areas.  They are getting out of them and have got out of them during the past 30 or 40 years.  It is, I think, unfortunate that this Bill does not intend to put a stop to emigration.</P>
      <P>We profess to attach a tremendous amount of importance to the sanctity of the family and to the preservation of home life.  It does seem to me to be rather a contradiction of those professions that we should accept that these families in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht must continue to have that broken pattern of existence, and must continue to emigrate to Birmingham, for instance. That is bad enough but they must even move away from their own home areas to some other part of the country if they are to eke out an existence.  It is a shame that every family in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht must continue to be broken up until all that remain are the very old, the very young and the small landholder. The small landholder educates his five or six children to get rid of them to other countries.  I think that is a very serious consideration, and one which I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider in his administration of this Bill.  I feel that he must realise how serious the question is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> The fact of the matter is that the recommendations of Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge are retrograde.  I do not think that we should be unduly worried or frightened about the incursion of new industries into the Gaeltacht and I am quite certain that our industrialists are not so completely anti-national as to be incapable of providing an industry which would be supervised by Irish speakers and if possible, native speakers.  I think there must be very many first-class technicians in Birmingham, and other places, who have an excellent knowledge of Irish.  There are many in Glasgow, particularly, who might be persuaded to come back and provide the technical knowledge and assistance for industries started in the Gaeltacht. I think that is a policy which might be energetically pursued.  I do not think it fair to leave people living there in the conditions in which they are at present living, but it appears as if the Government considers that there is nothing open to them except to evacuate the people to areas where they can live under reasonably good home conditions.  The Cómhdháil has assured the Government that there is no necessity to establish industries controlled by private enterprise in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and that any effort in that direction should be carried out under the different existing Government Departments.  It is obvious that these Government Departments have been in existence for the last three decades but yet there has been a greater exodus from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas during that time than there ever was prior to that.  These Government Departments have really done nothing effective to stop emigration. I should like to know if there is any evidence that they will make up for their very considerable deficiencies in that regard in past years, at any future time.</P>
    <P>From my own knowledge of their activities I was very disappointed indeed. It is of interest to note in relation to the factories which the Government Departments did start&mdash;there was one factory in Carraroe and another in Rossaveel&mdash;that the managers of these factories who had <Col N="1095" /> been appointed by the Government could not speak a word of Irish.  That created the impression in the area that it was necessary and a prerequisite for appointment to a position under any Government Department that one must have English, and that Irish was not acceptable.  I shall not develop this point beyond saying that the contribution which Government Departments have made to the solution of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht problem has, up to the present, been a hopeless failure and that the factories promoted by them have been the silly, pin-money type of factory which could not possibly provide a man or a girl with sufficient income on which to marry and rear their own family.  A wage of £2, £3 or £4 a week is not sufficient to enable a man to stay in the Gaeltacht and found his own family there.  The industries to be established, if they are to be established at all, have to be of sufficient extent to enable a man to earn up to £5, £6 or £7 in order to justify his getting married and supporting a family in the area.</P>
    <P>I think the progress which has been made, such as it is, has been very disappointing to many people who had hoped, because of the Taoiseach's considerable interest in this problem, and because of his statements in the past, that the language could only be revived by an extension from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht to other parts of Ireland, that this was an attempt to deal with this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>In fact, it appears to be a Bill calculated to attract people away from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and to evacuate from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht all the people who can speak the native language which is, in the view of those competent to judge, the only language which can possibly survive rather than the manufactured language which nobody is anxious to speak.  I would draw the attention of the Government to that particular point.</P>
    <P>It has, nevertheless, been a source of considerable pleasure and satisfaction to many people that this Bill has been introduced.  As was pointed out by <Col N="1096" /> Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, it is a pilot scheme which will, presumably, give a certain amount of experience to the Government in relation to the future handling of these terribly difficult problems.  At the same time, I think there is considerable disappointment in these areas which have been neglected by successive Governments, amongst people who are anxious to cling to the way of life of their fathers and forefathers and who see no sign or hope of an improvement in their lot.  To them there is nothing left but emigration.  It may help that they may have to migrate only to the Breac-Ghaeltacht but the pattern of life to which they have been accustomed is already thrown overboard and in relation to these people that is more precious than it is to people in any other part of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a shock that Deputy Dr. Browne feels that the rest of us do no more than lip-service to the principle of family life, as a matter of vital interest to well-ordered society.  I hope he can be assured on that score, but I know of no philosophy of family life, consistent with well-ordered society, which envisages men and women raising, in Deputy Dr. Browne's words, six, seven or eight children, educating them and regarding the family as disrupted if, in their maturity, their children should fare forth into the world and, deserting their parents, take unto themselves, in their prime, wives and husbands to found Christian families of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always felt that one of the tragedies of rural Ireland was the tragic feature of the house of old bachelors and old maids, men waiting for the girls to marry and girls hoping that the men would marry&mdash;the girls waiting for their brothers to marry, cliamhán isteach, so that they could marry themselves and the men waiting for their sisters to marry, cliamhán isteach, so that they might marry.  I see nothing wrong, nothing to be deplored, in a family reared in dignity and decency, dispersing in maturity to repeat the process again and again. That is what I want to see.  The difference in the approach of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for <Col N="1097" /> Agriculture from the view expressed by Deputy Blowick and myself, is that I think the disease which people are prone to acquire in Leinster House and in the capital city is to look upon our people in the West of Ireland as a kind of problem race apart from us, as I would have said on another occasion, as a pain in the neck.  If Parliament gets that idea into its head, it can appropriate all the money that ever circulated in Ireland and the more it spends the more damage it will do.</P>
    <P>My sole desire in regard to the Gaeltacht is, where the people's holdings are so small as to be uneconomic and irremediable, to try and make holdings available elsewhere, but not to tell the people to go.  That is what I can never understand.  What right does this Parliament claim, because persons live in Connemara or the Rosses, to tell them to go, when no one would dare to go to Laois, Offaly, Tipperary or Westmeath and tell the people to change their place of residence from there?  You have the right, I think, to go to a rundale estate or a very congested area and announce that you have in hands five, ten or 20 holdings of an attractive character in Meath or Westmeath or Longford or Galway; that there is a problem here the solution of which would be made easier if some holdings were surrendered for distribution amongst neighbours and, if there is anyone willing to step forward to apply for a holding here or elsewhere, he will have his preference.  But I repudiate the approach to this problem that this Parliament has, or ever will have, the right to go down and order the people of the Gaeltacht to clear out.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of families in the Gaeltacht at present whose circumstances may appear to their affluent neighbours to be unbearable, but they are the best judges of that and they do not want to change it. They do not want to give up their homes.  They want to have, and they have the right to ask this Parliament to provide, an opportunity of earning their own living by hard work on their own holding.  They have the right to say: &ldquo;In asking that, we are asking nothing more than the rest of the <Col N="1098" /> people in the country have without feeling themselves under any obligation to anybody for enjoying it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The preservation of family life in this country is, I believe, the fundamental aim of the present Government, as it was of the previous Government and of every Government elected in this country since 1922.  If any Government does something inimical to that institution, it is done by inadvertence and certainly without any desire to injure the foundations of such an institution.  If there is someone in this House so foreign to the way the minds of men and women work in Oireachtas Éireann as to imagine that it is accurate to speak of legislators in Ireland as giving lip-service to the family institutions, he would be well-advised to take a lesson in the fundamentals of Irish life.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage he made certain observations which it is extremely difficult to reconcile with the observations of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture.  It is obvious that the technique adopted by the Government is that they put up their Minister to say one thing and they put up a junior Minister to say another thing. They have achieved the additional astonishing progress with the busted flush of political life, our spoiled five, inasmuch as they have been induced to rush into the arena and say: &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes&rdquo; to three diametrically opposite propositions and to glory in their achievement.</P>
      <P>I can propound three propositions that are diametrically opposed in truth: that Fianna Fáil is efficient; that Fianna Fáil is honest, that Fianna Fáil is in any sense desirable. Each of these propositions is diametrically opposed.  It is significant that some of the rank-and-file of Fianna Fáil had some rag of decency to drape around them and crept away one by one.  There is not a mutter out of any of them.  But the four survivors of the busted flush rose like valiant men to say that to their mind conviction was carried that this Bill did apply to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and that this Bill did not apply to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht; and they congratulated the Minister on having brought to the House a Bill which wrought such a wonderful miracle.  Then they too crept away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened to us all?  There is not a single representative of the Gaeltacht in the Fianna Fáil Party who would get up at this stage and say one word of remonstrance to his Leader for having brought them into the Lobby to take powers to develop the Gaeltacht when they now learn, on this last stage <Col N="1101" /> of the Bill, that there is one part of Ireland where this Bill will not be allowed to function, and that is the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I think the Gaeltacht Deputies of Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry were persuaded on the Second Stage to believe that this Bill was primarily designed to serve the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I think that loathsome fraud is one ground for rejecting this Bill.</P>
    <P>The second ground is provided by a development that transpired yesterday. I do not upbraid the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter. I think the Minister stumbled into this situation without perceiving its implication. The House accepted the provision that we should give grants to initiate completely new industries which would be labouring under a handicap because of their geographical location in the West.  It was against his own judgment that he agreed to make provision for existing industries. That proposal to make provision for the expansion of existing business in the West of Ireland by way of grant guarantees that no decent, honest business man will avail of the Bill and that those who are prepared to avail of it and take grants for extending their own business are pretty well guaranteed in advance to be outside its scope and incapable of getting accommodation under it.</P>
    <P>An honourable business man if he has capital available to him to expand his business will not dare to borrow capital because under the existing tax structure a borrower who borrows capital to expand a business can never hope to pay it back because taxation takes such a large section of the profit earned the balance is barely sufficient to pay the interest on the capital raised.  I think any business man might with perfectly honourable consistency say: &ldquo;If the Government are prepared to put at my disposal capital free of interest I will gladly give them any profit on it for ten or 15 years in redemption of my loan because I am acquiring a property for those who come after me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a way of saving.  Deputy Seán Flanagan knows the West of Ireland and knows the business traditions <Col N="1102" /> there.  Can he imagine any self-respecting business man who is relatively well-off as compared with his neighbours availing of that and taking a grant to extend his own business?  I do not know any respectable man who would do it?</P>

      <P>There may be a business the expansion of which would give extra employment by the owner adventuring into a new and ancillary branch of business.  Knowing the traditions of our people, can Deputy Seán Flanagan believe, particularly in relation to the neighbourhood where he and I live, that any man relatively prosperous would take from the Government a present of £10,000 to expand a business which in the eyes of his neighbours already appears to give him a pretty good living?</P>

      <P>Their capital may be all tied up in the existing business.  These people are slow to borrow in the fear that they will never be able to pay back, and that they will have a load of loan debt tied around their necks forever. Why should we not say to them: we will offer you a loan and hereafter if you pay 5 per cent. interest at the end of 20 years there will be no debt; we will apply that 5 per cent. to the reduction of the principal.&rdquo;  I think any honourable business man would cheerfully accept that principle and I believe that proposition might achieve the development of industries in provincial centres because those who could engage in such developments would not have to carry this burden of interest that they have to bear if they set out to do it through orthodox methods of finance.  I think that the more Deputies come to reflect on this the more they will be shocked at the decision which the House has taken to-day on the grounds that it is a fraud and an imprudent decision to give public money to those who have no right on God's earth to receive it <Col N="1103" /> in the capacity of grantees.  I think this is a Bill which is rotten and that it should not pass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention whatever of speaking on this stage of the Bill until I heard such complete nonsense, particularly from Deputy Dillon.  I represent the same constituency as Deputy Cafferky, and I hope to make the first attempt over several hours to bring the debate down to earth.  Indeed, there has been so much nonsense spoken that I had almost come to the conclusion that the House had accepted the suggestion made last week by Deputy Cowan about poteen. I think I have never heard so much nonsense spoken as I heard this evening on this Bill.</P>
      <P>The congested areas are defined in the Bill as the Counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  There is no suggestion about a Fíor-Ghaeltacht or a Breac-Ghaeltacht in these counties. The Minister for Industry and Commerce made the position clear arising out of questions which were put to him by Deputy Morrissey.  I believe that Deputy Morrissey accepted the Minister's statement.  Deputy Morrissey asked if he was to understand that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht was not included in the Bill.  He was given the assurance by the Minister that he was not to understand that.  It is rather significant that Deputy Morrissey, who raised that question, has not been chasing that hare since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, common sense, or as Deputy Dillon would say, the plain meaning of language means nothing to the Deputies opposite. Who is going to tie the Minister if he says there are six parishes in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  It is disingenuous of any Deputy to claim that the Minister is using a figure that he wants to be tied to.  If it is self-evident that there are seven, when he says six, the former surely will be the accepted figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any logic in the attitude <Col N="1104" /> adopted by the Deputies opposite.  If they now claim that they were tricked or, to use Deputy Cafferky's expression on the Second Stage, that they were &ldquo;kidded&rdquo; and make absurd remarks about what is going to happen at the next election as a result of this Bill, well, the people will decide that. The Deputies opposite should make up their minds as to whether they welcome the Bill or not.  I appreciate that to some extent grants given to undertakings which are successful, could give rise to questions such as Deputy Dillon referred to, but, surely, the Minister or this House does not envisage a situation in which money would be given to people merely for their own advancement.</P>
    <P>This Bill is perfectly clear about that.  Section 5 provides for the development and maintenance in a congested area of an industrial undertaking where its establishment would be likely to provide or maintain employment. There is provision for financial assistance.  The various things which the board may do are set out in the section.  It may acquire land, permanently or temporarily; it may construct, adapt and maintain buildings. It may make grants to aid persons to acquire lands or to construct, adapt and maintain buildings.  Surely, financial assistance is not necessary for the maintenance of a business which is already working profitably under its own steam.  No responsible body of people is going to give grants to the directors or owners of such an undertaking, whether they do or do not apply for them.</P>
    <P>At this stage we should decide either to vote against the Bill or to do everything we can to make it a success. There may be special difficulties which industrialists in the West will have to face.  We do not know in detail what those difficulties will be.  The board will deal with them as they crop up in accordance with the powers given to it in the Bill and what, in the circumstances, it considers proper.  It has been suggested that the Bill is going to be difficult to work out in practice. I think it is recognised that there are going to be difficulties which we cannot foresee now.  We cannot say with <Col N="1105" /> any certainty what the board will do when it meets with some new situation. It will be our duty to act as watchdogs over the activities of the board and to make sure that we will bark loud and long if it does not discharge its functions properly.</P>
    <P>I think it is nonsensical for the Deputies opposite to be suggesting that this thing or that thing may happen.  Their attitude, in my opinion, is evidence of the attempt that is now being made by the Opposition to discredit this Bill in the eyes of the people, particularly those Deputies who talk about an Indian settlement in the Gaeltacht, and say that a certain area of Mayo, for instance, which they describe as an Indian settlement is going to be cut out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I refuse to believe that this is anything but a cheap attempt to discredit this Bill, to make political capital out of nothing and that it is also illogical and improper inasmuch as those very men are agreeing that the Bill should be passed into law.  I do not want to detain the House which I know very well has formed ideas on this subject. I repeat that I had no intention at the beginning to speak, but I was more or less pledged to give my views on this subject.  Therefore, I felt obliged to speak.  Anyhow, I was driven almost to distraction when I heard Deputy Cafferky arguing about something which may have had some relevancy in some other debate but which had nothing to do with the Undeveloped Areas Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy S. Flanagan has made a contribution which he says he had been invited to make.  I want to express the hope, having listened to what he has just said, that he will not so readily accept invitations of a like character in future.  The Deputy has accused those on this side of the House of discreditable and illogical conduct, of a lack of decency, of an attempt to make political capital and of a cheap approach.  My reply to Deputy S. Flanagan is to read his own speech, only just delivered, in the Official Report when it becomes available. I will leave it to himself to put a label on his speech.  If ever there <Col N="1106" /> was a Bill introduced into this House which was approached in a non-Party spirit, it was this Bill under discussion.</P>

      <P>I am not denying the Deputy any rights whatever.  If, however, he accuses this side of the House of being discreditable and of having a cheap, illogical approach and of being lacking in decency and in consideration for the Bill, surely he will not whinge if one tries to suggest that his own speech has not been entirely helpful to the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill was welcomed by all sides of the House.  I think I am safe in saying that on behalf of my own colleagues and certainly on behalf of myself.  I welcomed it, wished it God speed and said it was a step in the right direction.  There was no attempt by anybody to make political capital out of it nor is there now. Deputy S. Flanagan referred to Section 3 of the Bill, part of which I will now quote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  This Act applies to each of the following areas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the congested areas;</P>
      <P>(2)  the congested areas are</P>
      <P>(a) the Counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Under that section, as it stands, there is no qualification and there is nothing whatever in it to say that any particular parish, area, district or any part of those counties is to be excluded from the benefits that are provided or from the inducements that are provided under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate yesterday on the Bill the Minister said, in reply to Deputy Dr. Browne, as quoted in to-day's <i>Irish Press:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass said that Dr. Browne had raised a specialised problem.  He (Mr. Lemass) did not think that that measure would benefit the half-a-dozen parishes which constituted the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  He did not think it desirable that they should try to attract industrial development by private enterprise into these areas, as it could only have an anglicising effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If there was to be industrialisation in these areas it must of necessity be done by State organisations, which must have instructions to subordinate commercial success to the preservation of the language and the Gaelic character of these areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The quotation goes on, though there is nothing about this in the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He had discussed the matter with Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, and they had preferred to see industrial employment developing around the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, so that those who desired to leave it would not wander too far and would still be in contact with the home atmosphere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know that some of these people may have to wander 50 miles to a particular factory, maybe to Galway.  They would hardly be kept in contact with the home atmosphere because one will hear as much English spoken in the City of Galway as in the City of Dublin, and Deputies know that as well as I do.  I have heard as much English spoken in Kilronan as in Tramore.  All that I am asking is to do what was right and proper.  Is this Bill right? It contains the congested areas of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Kerry and certain <Col N="1108" /> districts in County Clare and in County Cork.  Is that right or is what the Minister said yesterday right?  It is not I who am making the qualification. I did not say it but the Minister did.</P>
    <P>I appealed to the Minister before this developed at all.  I asked him to clarify the position and he refused to do it.  There is nobody against this Bill, except one aspect of it.  If it is found necessary and desirable and if there are people who are prepared under the inducements offered in this Bill to put industries within the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and to operate them, they ought not to be prevented from so doing.  I want to make my position quite clear on this, because I know I am open to misrepresentation.  If the only reason against putting an industry within the Fíor-Ghaeltacht is the fear of anglicisation, then I say that that is not good enough.  I would prefer to see people employed and talking English in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht than in Birmingham or even in Galway City. Everybody should realise that, unless we provide employment for the inhabitants of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, neither they nor the language will be in existence after a short period of time.  This is the concern of all of us.</P>
    <P>It is not right or proper that Deputy S. Flanagan should say: &ldquo;Go and vote for or against the Bill, whichever you like, but vote one way or the other.&rdquo; That is not the attitude we should adopt&mdash;to vote one way or the other. We ought to have our minds clear on the matter and to know for what we are voting.  I have no doubt what way I am going to vote.  Whether I get the explanation to which I am entitled or whether I do not, I am still in favour of the Bill.  I am still prepared to give it a chance and hope it will succeed.  Some Deputies expressed the fear that enough money was not being provided in the £2,000,000.  My only fear is, and it is a real fear, that advantage will not be taken to the extent of the £2,000,000.</P>

      <P>As I say, I am rather anxious to see this Bill operating and operating successfully but I think any Deputy in the House, I do not care who he is, who approaches this matter with an open mind will realise that there is no one trying to score points.  I only want to clear up the point that there is no qualification in the Bill as to any district within the congested areas where an industry cannot be established in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht but it is in the Minister's speech.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that there is a conflict there.  If I am told that the administration of this Bill is going to be directly in accordance with what is laid down here in Section 3, that there is going to be no black areas, no areas inside which the Bill will not operate, in the congested areas, then I am satisfied.  But if we did not draw attention at this stage to the Minister's speech yesterday in his reply to Dr. Browne, and if subsequently we raised any point we would be very soon asked: &ldquo;Why did you not raise that when the Bill was going through the House,&rdquo; and nobody would be more quickly on their feet to put that point than the Deputies on the other side, and they would be perfectly right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> The point is this, and Deputies will have to remember it, that when the Bill is going through the House, that is the time to ask questions, to get your mind clear on it.  That is the only time you are in a position to try to extract from the Minister what he really means.  Like other Deputies, I do not want to prolong this debate.  I have the feeling that if the Minister himself were clear as to where exactly he stood between the Cómhdháil and the Bill he could have resolved this matter two or two and a half hours ago and we would be nearly ready to walk out of the House and wish each other a happy Christmas.  Still it is not treating this House fairly and it is not fair to the Bill itself if it has to go through its final stages without a clear explanation as to the difference between the Minister's speech and Section 7 of the Bill, as it stands at the moment.</P>

      <P>Of course the Gaeltacht is included in the Bill&mdash;as Deputy S. Flanagan pointed out&mdash;like all other areas.  I presume that proposals from the Gaeltacht will be considered on the same basis as proposals from any other areas that are scheduled under the Bill.</P>

The area, as I pointed out on the Estimate for the Parliamentary Secretary's Office, is a small area.  You have a small area in the West of Kerry, a larger area in West Galway and you have a large area which is not entirely homogeneous composed of three or four smaller areas not connected geographically with one another, that is to say, they are not all one unit; there are English speaking areas intervening.  The areas are small in extent and there are also areas that have not urban communities or facilities within them.  You have places like Dingle and Galway City, which are not specifically in the Gaeltacht but are so near to the Gaeltacht that industries started in those areas would be regarded as benefiting those areas.  I do not know what area Deputy Morrissey has in mind in Galway that people in the Connemara Gaeltacht area would have to travel 50 miles to find employment in Galway City.</P>

      <P>I have some authority to speak on this matter, as I was responsible for introducing a scheme for the payment of money to Irish speaking households.  That scheme was in operation for a number of years and was one on which scrupulous investigations were made by the inspectors in the Education Office as to whether the households were Irish speaking or not.  I am not in the position of Deputy Dillon who speaks from his abysmal ignorance of the matter.  I know the parishes that are really Irish speaking and I say they are much smaller in area than might be pretended.  It cannot be argued here that the Gaeltacht area consists of large territory or anything resembling even what it was supposed to represent when the Irish Government started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to face the situation that it has shrunk very considerably and the Tánaiste was quite right in pointing to the fact that the number of parishes, which could be described as completely Irish speaking, could very easily be counted.  If you pass from the parishes that are completely Irish speaking and include those that are partly Irish speaking, I do not know where you are going to stop.  On that basis, the parish of Clontarf could be considered as a Breac-Ghaeltacht area. When I speak of the Gaeltacht, I mean areas where Irish is the living language and is spoken by the people in their ordinary lives.  There may be certain areas in Tirconaill where the people have English as well as Irish. But we know that they can speak in Irish as well as in English and probably prefer to speak Irish.  I do not agree with Deputy Morrissey that if industries are started in Galway, Dingle, Glenties, or in any other urban or semi-urban area adjoining a Gaeltacht area, the people of the Gaeltacht area are not going to benefit or that the people are going to be deceived by any pretence that if the factory cannot be planted in Carraroe or Rannafast, then the people of those areas are not going to benefit.  We know <Col N="1113" /> that if a factory is planted within any reasonable distance of the Irish speaking areas, people from the Irish speaking areas can find employment there.  We remember when Deputies on the other side told us that Irish speaking people should be deprived of home assistance if they were not prepared to work down in the turf camps in Kildare.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that if a factory is started in Galway, Dingle or some area adjoining the Gaeltacht, the Irish speaking population in these areas are not going to benefit?  I think the Tánaiste was quite right in calling attention to the fact that the State, for a very long period of time, has established industries there itself, has carried on industries that were there more or less under State auspices, and has founded new industries in connection with products of the sea as well as of the land.  We established, for example, the tomato industry in the Gaeltacht area and if, at any time, a similar scheme which would benefit smallholders in the Gaeltacht comes along, there is no reason why the Government with the example of that scheme before it, should not, if it considers it necessary, establish it there as a State enterprise rather than wait for some person to come along with private capital to make a proposal under this Bill.  I see no reason why such a person or body of persons, if they come along with a proposal for the Gaeltacht, should not have these proposals considered.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to the opinions of Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge. Their opinion was that it would be very necessary to safeguard the position of the Irish language by not having large industries suddenly established in those areas.  If they were completely English speaking, in a very short time in their view they would completely eliminate the Irish language or at least effectively eliminate it although it might continue to be spoken.  In their view there would be a loss in prestige to the language that could not easily be made up.  That is a point of view that I think should be considered very carefully.  The question <Col N="1114" /> then arises as to whether, if a proposal for the establishment of an industry in Carraroe or in Rannafast comes along, it will be possible to secure the necessary personnel as regards management and technical control who will be able to do the work through Irish.  The Tánaiste thinks&mdash;and it is quite a reasonable assumption on his part&mdash; that it will be difficult to secure such people and, therefore, he may be faced with the position that, rather than establish a completely English speaking concern there, he may have to devise some other way of dealing with the situation, by either a State enterprise or through the Gaeltacht industries, or by getting his own Department to deal with it in another way.</P>
    <P>It is quite natural that this is a matter upon which it is difficult to give an opinion.  I would find it very difficult myself to give an opinion; I should like to know exactly what the particular proposal was.  I should like to know before English speakers were introduced or before a completely English speaking industry was set up in Gaeltacht areas, that every possible step had been taken and every possible safeguard made to reduce the loss to the Irish language in the area that would be occasioned by that step.  It is naturally a matter upon which there can be a legitimate difference of opinion &mdash;whether the question of preserving the language in these districts, if a particular step of that nature would seem to mean its extinction there or on the other hand the question of bringing about an improvement in the economic conditions of the people to the uttermost, should be paramount. One thing is quite certain and that is that when we speak of the Gaeltacht we mean the Irish language.  When we speak of the State doing certain things for the Gaeltacht, and when we want to justify a demand that the State and the Government should come along to provide industries for the Gaeltacht, what are we thinking of?  Are we thinking merely of the social and economic conditions?  Are we not thinking rather of the fact that these areas are the last stronghold of the Irish language and are we not thinking that the measures we are taking for the improvement <Col N="1115" /> of social and economic conditions there should be associated, as far as possible, with the great task of preserving the language in those areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one observation that I should like to make.  I do not represent any of the areas specified in the Bill and I have not taken any part so far in the debate but now that the Bill is about to pass, I think I should make some remarks on the development of the debate here to-day.  It is correct as Deputy Mulcahy told the House that this Bill has had our support and will have our support because it gives power to the Government or to the board that is being set up, to carry out certain work in the different congested districts.  That is clearly set out in the Bill, and for that reason it has our support.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, on the Committee Stage also, the Tánaiste gave voice to an expression that the Bill should not under any circumstances extend to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  The Tánaiste said that yesterday and repeated it to-day in clear terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave an account to the House of an interview which he had with a deputation from Cómhdháil Náisiúnta and he stated that he accepted their view that the introduction of an industrial effort in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht would cause some anglicisation and should not be started.  I think that is a scandalous expression of opinion.  In effect, it is saying that the speaking of Irish so far as we in this Oireachtas are concerned is to be a perpetual badge of poverty.  It is an approach which, quite understandably, produced protest from Deputy Blowick, Deputy Cafferky and other Deputies.  It is, in effect, creating the idea that an Irish Parliament wants to have some form of reservation in which unfortunate persons are to live and to be labelled, &ldquo;These Irish speaking, do not go near them.&rdquo;  That point of view, whether it comes from Cómhdháil Náisiúnta or from the Minister, is <Col N="1116" /> something that does not convince me that it contains in it any real hope for the preservation of the language.</P>
      <P>We can all see that the introduction of some new business drive into the Gaeltacht, if there is not some care or planning attached to it, may result in the spreading of English.  But surely it is not beyond the ability of the Minister and the board to be set up under this Bill to provide against that contingency. We all understood from the Minister's statement here that activity under the Bill will not be extended to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  Owing to the fact that the Minister for Lands spoke a short time ago, every Deputy appreciates that the Government realise that the Tánaiste made a first-class bloomer and a message was sent out to bring the Minister for Lands into the House to try and undo the damage.  If the intervention of the Minister for Lands means that the views expressed by the Tánaiste are not to be carried out, then I am satisfied.</P>
      <P>We can at times allow our interest in the cause of the language to obscure our ordinary intelligence when we find Deputies or Ministers stating that we should not do certain things in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht for fear we might cause the people to speak English. That is wrong.  Our first concern must surely be for the unfortunate people in these areas who have a desperate struggle to exist, who, with all the neglect of the past, are faced with the results now.  It should not be beyond the ability of the Government to achieve their economic betterment without in any way interfering with the language or the Irish culture which flourishes there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the passage of this Bill into law should be marked by that expression of view by the Tánaiste.  I hope that the speech of the Minister for Lands and the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary after the Tánaiste's speech indicate that the Tánaiste, perhaps unwittingly, made a mistake and that the Government does not now share his view.  It would be very serious if the undoubted benefit which can come from this Bill should be kept far away from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. It would certainly kill once and <Col N="1117" /> for all any chance of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht surviving, because it would undoubtedly mean that any people living in these areas would have no encouragement to continue to live there and to follow the Gaelic way of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech made by the Tánaiste yesterday and the further contributions from the Parliamentary Secretary to-day, coupled with the criticism from the other side of the House, seem to put us in a more complicated position than we were in before the Bill was introduced.  I realise that what the Tánaiste said was very complicated.  Having listened to the contribution of the Parliamentary Secretary to-day, I must say that it added to the complication.  Mistakes may have been made and words may have been spoken which gave the impression that there is a danger of industry not being established in the particular parishes mentioned as being truly Gaelic.</P>
      <P>From what I heard, I do not believe that the Tánaiste meant that there would not be industries established there.  I gathered from his statement that the industries there would probably be established by another board or under another Bill.  I may be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the impression I got.  But when the Tánaiste made that statement, Opposition members who complained about that statement had an opportunity, and so had the members of the Government Party, including Deputy Briscoe, of putting that right.  They had a chance last night of seeing that it would not be necessary to introduce another Bill in order to give to those parishes in the Gaeltacht the advantages which are being offered to the others.  I condemn the attitude taken both by the members of the Government and the Opposition Parties who had an opportunity last night to vote for an amendment which would give these advantages to the people in the Gaeltacht and the six parishes which have been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill could have been made more <Col N="1118" /> perfect last night if Deputies were farseeing enough to realise that.  Even, the Tánaiste has admitted&mdash;it may be unwittingly, but it is quite clear from his statement&mdash;that the danger is that in these parishes about which we have heard so much to-day there may not be sufficient local capital to start industries.  The Minister pointed out that it might be disadvantageous to have outsiders coming in in case those outsiders might bring with them technicians or employees who would not be Irish speakers with the result that the Saxon tongue might creep in.  The Minister has openly admitted that the only hope is to provide industries by some other means in these areas.</P>
    <P>Time has now been wasted in bringing this Bill to a conclusion.  Deputies had a chance last night but in their narrow-minded, conservative way they failed to realise they had that chance. It was a chance which would have helped the people in the Gaeltacht so far as provision could be made for State enterprises which the Minister openly admitted would probably be the only means of providing employment in these areas.  The opportunity was there last night.  Deputies failed to grasp it.  Let them now take the responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very bad fog outside but the fog inside is nearly as bad.  Knowing the Fíor-Ghaeltacht very well I ask myself will it ever be possible to set up industries there through private enterprise or otherwise? I believe none will ever be set up through private enterprise.  I do not agree with the Minister that there are only five or six parishes which are purely Irish speaking.  I know several areas that are not in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht at all where Irish is the spoken language of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to see some Bill introduced under which something will be done specially for the people in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.  I hope the Government and the Minister have something better than this Bill in mind.  The view seems to be that this Bill will not do any good in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas. Private enterprise will be useless.  How <Col N="1119" /> long must the people in these areas wait?</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, if our Irish speakers are to be deprived of a way of living until such time as something can be done I would prefer to see them at work and speaking English rather than idle and on the dole speaking Irish.  I am looking to the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bartley, to do something for Galway City.  I hope there will be some developments there into which the people along the seaboard, Spiddal and Carraroe will be taken.  Even though English is spoken there, there is quite a lot of Irish spoken too and I do not agree with Deputy Morrissey on that.  If industries are started in Galway I hope the people in the outlying areas will get a preference in the matter of employment. It would be better to see them in Galway City than returning to Birmingham. Then, we hear the doleful tale of the Taoiseach about their conditions there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what may be said about this Bill when it becomes law, it will inevitably be suggested that the Government has beaten a hasty retreat in relation to the Minister's remarks as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> and repeated by the Minister here to-day.  I heard what the Minister said last night.  I subsequently heard it read no less than three times. The Minister felt that this Bill would not prove sufficiently attractive to help the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas and, if the attractions were not sufficient, some more direct action would have to be taken by the Government.  He also reiterated the opinion expressed to him by Cómhdháil Náisiúnta, with which he said he agreed, that the introduction of large scale industry into the Gaeltacht might have an anglicising effect. I am by no means in complete agreement with that opinion.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a very simple Bill.  It is a clear Bill.  The areas to which its scope will extend are clearly defined in Section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most relevant speech made on the Fifth Stage of the Bill was the <Col N="1120" /> two-line speech contributed by Deputy General Mulcahy.  It is clear that this Bill does not exclude the Gaeltacht areas.  There is no suggestion in the Bill to exclude those areas.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Bill will be entrusted to a board called Foras Tionscal. Irrespective of any impression any of us may have here about the provisions of the Bill, Foras Tionscal will operate the Bill according as they interpret it when they see it in print before them as an Act.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has any experience of practising in the courts knows that it will serve no useful purpose for a legal practitioner to tell a judge that he was in the Dáil the night the Bill was passed and he heard the Minister or someone else say such and such a thing.  A judge can only administer the law as he sees it before him.  Foras Tionscal will administer this Bill as they see it before them in relation to the different districts laid down under Section 3.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Government I am charged with a task of the co-ordination and initiation of schemes designed to develop the Gaeltacht economically and otherwise.  A number of people have come to me with industrial proposals. They have asked me where I thought they should establish their industries.  I took the precaution in a few cases of asking them if they had any particular area in mind.  Before ever this Bill was passed in one particular instance I suggested to some industrialists in Dublin who were anxious to set up in Donegal that they should take a look at the Gaeltacht areas there&mdash;Rannafast, the Rosses, Gweedore and Glencolumbcille.  I told them that in these areas they would find a standard of cleanliness and industry amongst the people that would augur well for the success of any industry they would set up.  I do not know to what extent they have pursued that particular suggestion.</P>
    <P>In another case a well-known industrial concern in Dublin wrote to me informing me of their intention of setting up in some area 20 miles west of Galway which must of necessity be a <Col N="1121" /> Gaeltacht area.  From my point of view, I have no fears whatever with regard to the preservation of the language if a certain amount of industrial expansion is effected.  Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge have expressed these fears in the interview they had with the Tánaiste and in the publication they issued when they saw the text of this Bill.  I believe their point of view is worthy of consideration and of respect because those people are appointed to whatever positions they hold in Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge because of their intensive knowledge of Gaeltacht conditions and of the people there and particularly with regard to their knowledge of how the language might be preserved.</P>
    <P>It is a point of view worthy of consideration, that, should industries be set up in the heart of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, there is a danger to the language in so far as that those setting up the industries might tend to spread the use of the English language and so anglicise those areas.  Personally, I believe that in these areas the language would be strong enough to withstand any anglicising effect that the type of industry that would be introduced under this Bill in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas would have.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House except to refer to the remarks which were made by some speakers on the other side when they suggested that the Government, in the administration of this Bill, will want to black out the Gaeltacht areas and create in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht conditions like those under which the Indians lived in North America over a number of years&mdash;in reservations&mdash;or, as someone else suggested, as prisoners of war live, confined behind barbed wire.  There is no truth whatever in suggestions of that kind.  Personally, so far as I am charged with the administration of the office which I now hold, it will be my intention to bring a way of life to the residents of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht area as attractive as that enjoyed by any of our other citizens.  I hope that I will endeavour to ensure that they will be given the same amenities with regard to the provision of electricity, roads and water supplies as the people <Col N="1122" /> in the areas outside the Fíor-Ghaeltacht enjoy, and in no way to try and create out of the residents of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas a kind of museum show pieces.  I do not believe that is the best way in which we can preserve the language.  I believe what some Deputy said here to-night, that to create or maintain a condition of poverty amongst the residents of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas is the surest possible way to kill the language.</P>
    <P>I am sincerely convinced of this, that unless these people get a decent way of living within the confines of their own Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas they will be justified in abandoning those areas, and if they forget the language, as a result of that, it will not be their fault. I do not want to follow many of the other speakers in the course which they have set for themselves except to say to Deputy Dillon that the fact that this Bill immediately followed the introduction of the Estimate for Oifig na Gaeltachta agus gCeanntar gCúng, was in no way connected with any political tactics whatever.  The Estimate for the office of which I am in charge was placed on the Order Paper just about the same time as the Supplies and Services Bill.  That Estimate would have been discussed weeks in advance of the time it was discussed were it not for the fact that the Supplies and Services Bill took such an inordinately long time.  Deputy Dillon suggested that he was told during his contribution to the debate on the Estimate that he was to lay off his criticism of the Estimate since the Bill was likely to follow soon.</P>
    <P>There was no such impression conveyed to Deputy Dillon.  He was told, in his references to the Undeveloped Areas Bill, while discussing the Estimate for my office, that he was being irrelevant and could use any remarks that he had to make in the course of the debate on the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  I want to deny categorically that there was any suggestion whatever of trying to create that impression in the House, that since my office was alleged by some Deputies to be primarily concerned with the Gaeltacht areas, this Bill which was immediately to follow to which reference was made in the course of the debate on the Estimate, <Col N="1123" /> was designed primarily to help the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.  There is nothing further from the truth.  Deputy Dillon knows very well that by its very title&mdash;Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeanntar gCung&mdash;the area within the purview of my office not only embraces the Fíor-Ghaeltacht but the Breac-Ghaeltacht and the congested areas. So this Bill also by its Title&mdash;the Undeveloped Areas Bill as defined in Section 3&mdash;embraces Fíor-Ghaeltacht as well as Breac-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I want to assure any Deputy who may have any feeling that there is going to be a ring drawn around the Fíor-Ghaeltacht districts in order to exclude the possibility of any industrialist or potential industrialist coming into those areas to set up worthwhile industries to create employment such will not be the case.  So far as I can ensure it side by side with the interests of the language the way of life of Gaeltacht residents will be advanced by the setting up of those industries. I will use all my endeavours to see that such industries will be set up and means provided for giving employment to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht residents.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House longer except to repeat that this Bill is a start.  As Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll has described it, it is a pilot Bill.  The Tánaiste has made no extravagant claims for it.  He has said that he hopes it will achieve a certain measure of success.  If it does not then we will have to consider some other means of bringing about the conditions which he hopes this Bill will create.  I want to say to the House, now that the Bill is about to pass, let us give it a trial and if it fails to succeed after a number of years then will be the time to criticise it.  Then will be the time, whatever Government is in power, to see what other measures can be introduced to try to solve the problems that this Bill has been introduced to try to solve in present conditions.</P>

      <P>The continued increase in the price of all kinds of essential commodities, coupled with the restriction of credit and the increasing unemployment caused thereby, is the cause of widespread misery and what in many areas at the present time.</P>
      <P>I do not want, in anything I say, to exaggerate the position but I will rely on the figures that were given to us recently in regard to the registered number of unemployed and I rely much more so upon what I know to be the position in my own constituency so far as employment and unemployment are concerned.  The latest return furnished to members of the House by the Minister for Social Welfare gives the figures for the week ending 1st December, and even since that date the position in my area has become much more serious from the point of view of the number of persons thrown out of employment both by firms that employed large numbers of persons and also by local authorities; many of the local authorities in the two Counties of Laoighis and Offaly have dismissed employees.  The figures furnished to Deputies giving the number of registered unemployed for the week ending December 1st disclose the fact that in 1950 the number of registered unemployed was 56,790, whereas for the corresponding period of this year the number had increased to 61,070, showing that there has been an increase for the week ending 1st December this year compared with last of 4,280.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to tell the Minister&mdash;but I daresay he is quite well acquainted with the position&mdash;that we have <Col N="1125" /> thousands of workers throughout the country who are working only on part-time employment.  I have here before me a list issued recently by the Dublin Trades Council in which it discloses that about 2,400 employees of firms in the clothing manufacturing industry, the overwhelming majority of them, are on short time and some have been paid off for reasons I am not too well acquainted with but which must be known to the Deputies representing the areas concerned in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Apart from this particular return affecting one industry in the City of Dublin, I am reliably informed that 75 per cent. of the 4,000 workers employed in the boot and shoe industry are at present working on a halftime basis, and unfortunately in the case of one firm in the boot and shoe industry&mdash;I say unfortunately because the firm happens to be in my constituency in Edenderry&mdash;the owner, instead of putting the workers on short time as has been done by other firms throughout the country, in spite of protests and appeals by the workers, thought fit to pay off about one-sixth of its employees.  In that connection I would like to inform the Minister that included in the large number of persons paid off by this particular gentleman&mdash;he is the dominant individual in the particular company concerned, which is a family company&mdash; are some of the most experienced men who have been employed by that firm since it was established.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, and I take the liberty of saying that my appeal will not be ignored, to make representations to the head of the firm concerned that if he has a case to make to show that there is not a sufficiency of orders coming in, and if there is a question of the workers having to suffer, he should line up at least with every other firm and pay his workers on the same basis and recall the men who have been paid off, including those who have been in the service of the firm since it was founded. I hope that is not an unreasonable request.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go away immediately <Col N="1126" /> from the case of the boot and shoe industry.  It has been asserted in this House that the unemployment that has recently arisen in the clothing manufacturing industry, including firms in my constituency&mdash; this has been stated locally by some of the people associated with the Minister's political Party&mdash;was due to the action of the Minister's predecessor in letting into this country a large quantity of manufactured clothing during the year 1950.  In the case of the boot and shoe industry that case cannot be made.  There have been no imports of boots of any importance into this country since 1946 and 1947 and the present Minister was in office when these imports were allowed into the country.  It surely will not be asserted by the Minister or by anybody else that the slump that appears to exist in the boot and shoe manufacturing industry in this country should be traced to the imports that were allowed into the country in 1946 or 1947.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot, at any rate, blame his predecessor in that particular case, but I hope he will look into the position so far as it affects the boot and shoe manufacturing industry and use his good offices, as I know he can whenever he decides to do so, to see that if sacrifices have to be made one firm will not be allowed to dismiss one-sixth of its employees while all the remaining firms in the industry regulate their working arrangements by putting their employees on short time.</P>
    <P>About a week ago in my own constituency the Laoighis County Council, not because they had not sufficient work for their employees, were allowed to pay off 120 of their workers.  Those 120 workers were paid off by the Laoighis County Council at a time when there are dozens of proposals in the Department of Local Government which can be carried out.  Those workers can be retained if the necessary money can be allocated under the Local Authorities (Works) Act from whatever funds are available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I accompanied a deputation to the Minister for Local Government with my colleagues on this matter to-day <Col N="1127" /> and he told us that there were no further moneys available for the purpose of carrying out the many useful schemes that can be carried out by the Laoighis County Council if the money is provided for the purpose.  If this was any Estimate other than the Estimate provided for the allocation of money to local authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I could understand the refusal of the Minister for Local Government.  But as far as I know&mdash;if I am wrong the Minister can contradict me&mdash;there is still available in the Bank of Ireland at College Green large sums of money&mdash;Marshall Aid money or free money as it has been called in some parts of the country&mdash; available there, and all that is required as far as I know in a case of this kind is that the responsible Minister should bring forward, as he has often brought forward before in this House in a matter of this kind, a Supplementary Estimate to meet the requirements of the local authorities to carry out the schemes that have been already approved by the Department under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession a telegram which I received, not at my own request, from the local Secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union at Birr.  It informed me of what I was already aware, that representations were made by the Birr Urban Council to the Department of Local Government for the usual Christmas relief grant.  A scheme was sent in to the Department some time ago so that the Christmas relief work would be started, and this telegram was awaiting me when I went home last night:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No Christmas relief scheme started here yet.  Held up by red tape.  Try and cut some with the Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What amazed me most of all in connection with this matter was that the scheme submitted by the Birr Urban Council was turned down.  It was one with a very high labour content&mdash;the clearance of sites.  This scheme has a labour content which would absorb 85 per cent of the total sum of money <Col N="1128" /> allocated.  However, it was turned down, and the scheme which is under consideration by the Department is one for the making of footpaths which would absorb 60 per cent of the money for the purchase of cement.  Whenever there is money available for the establishment of schemes for the relief of unemployment in places where the carrying out of useful work is an urgent necessity, I understand that those which are generally welcomed by the Department are ones which contain the highest possible labour content.</P>
    <P>Up to this evening I have failed to get any reliable information as to whether the Christmas relief scheme will even now be sanctioned for the purpose of relieving unemployment in Birr, and we must bear in mind it is now the middle of December.  I wrote to the Minister asking him to use his good offices in this particular case and to see that a scheme with a high labour content would be sanctioned.  These Christmas relief schemes are usually sanctioned before the middle of December.  There is not much satisfaction in calling on some of the unemployed to commence work, say, next Monday under a local authority.  They find they cannot get paid, possibly, before Christmas, because the officials in the offices are not prepared to pay them except fortnightly and sometimes only after the expiration of three weeks' work.</P>
    <P>I will now come to the situation which exists in the town of Tullamore. All the employees of the firm known as Salts (Ireland) Limited have been put on short time for some time past.  Three out of five of the directors of this firm are English.  This firm has been operated locally by high officials of the firm, who interviewed representatives of the workers after they had a meeting recently with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They told the representatives of the workers concerned that they were forced to put a large number of the workers on short time as the result of the line alleged to have been taken by Deputy Morrissey when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This statement was made to the representatives of the workers concerned by the <Col N="1129" /> managing director of the firm after he had an interview with the present Minister for Industry and Commerce. As far as I know there is no genuine foundation for that statement.  Deputy O. Flanagan knows and Deputy Maher knows, if he will admit it, that that statement has been wrongly used locally by the political agent of the present Fianna Fáil Government for the purpose of plastering Deputy Morrissey with the responsibility for the short-time working of the 600 workers in Salts (Ireland) Limited. Another shocking step that has been taken in that connection is this: the supervisors in that firm are large in number, but those of them who are Irish nationals have been put on three days' work with the ordinary workers whereas the English and the Scotch supervisors are getting a full week's wages.</P>
    <P>Such is the position.  Let us be fair in regard to the responsibility for what has happened in the case of Salts (Ireland), Limited.  Every Deputy who was in this House 12 months ago and who is acquainted with the conditions existing in the country then must admit that, in that period, the workers in the factories or those engaged on local authorities' schemes were neither slack nor on short time.  It must also be admitted that the number of unemployed persons in this State was never as low as it was 12 months ago.  When Deputy Morrissey was Minister for Industry and Commerce, he invited the directors of Salts (Ireland) Limited, and the directors of other firms to a meeting in the Department to explain why it was that they were unable to supply the needs of the wholesalers and the retailers in this country.  Firms engaged in the clothing manufacturing business and in the boot manufacturing business were unable to complete the contracts which they had on hands 12 to 18 months ago.  When they were discussing this matter of their alleged inability to meet the needs of the home market with the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, they explained the position to them.  Firms like Messrs. Arnott's, Messrs. Todd's, Messrs. Clery's and other such large firms have a considerable number of <Col N="1130" /> retail customers throughout the country.  Some of the retailers in question who reside in my area wrote to me asking if I could do anything for them.  They complained that the Irish manufacturers were either unable or unwilling to complete the contracts inside a given period.  Some of us know the reason, and some of us are prepared to state the reason.  I know of one firm which has a large list of retail customers, some of them living in my own constituency, and the firm concerned could not supply the traders in my area 12 to 18 months ago.  They approached myself and my colleagues. Irish manufacturers were telling the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time that they were well able to supply the needs but the firms had to go to the officials of the Department and to the Minister and prove that the manufacturers were not actually supplying them.</P>
    <P>We all know what happened when the price of wool went up in Australia. Some of the manufacturers here&mdash;I will say the number was small&mdash;put up their prices immediately they read in the paper of the rise in the price of the raw wool in Sydney.  The raw material did not arrive here for three months after the rise in price of the raw wool in Australia and they took advantage of that period and pushed up their prices.  We are all aware of what happened last year about blankets.  A racket started and we had a number of &ldquo;blanketeers.&rdquo;  These were small in number but the Minister for Industry and Commerce could put his finger on the people concerned.  The manufacturers put up the price of blankets and in some cases the wholesalers refused to pay the price.  The result was that the blankets went under the counter and so did the towels and other essential articles which are in common use for domestic purposes.  I am acquainted with one gentleman associated with the manufacturing business.  When I mentioned this gentleman's name recently to responsible officers in the Federation of Irish Manufacturers they refused to take him into the federation.  They were quite right in refusing to do so. He entered into a contract at that particular period with certain firms in this <Col N="1131" /> city and in other cities and towns, to supply blankets at a certain price and immediately he read in the paper that the price of wool had gone up in Sidney, up went his price and he would not complete the contract unless he got the increased price.  Some of the wholesalers and retailers refused to pay him that price and he refused to complete the contract.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the people concerned at the time did not bring this gentleman into the courts and deal with him as he should have been dealt with.  I hope that I have disposed of, and I hope that the Minister will agree that we have finished with, these allegations made for purely political purposes in regard to the slump in the clothing manufacturing business and the partial unemployment that has been caused.  It has as much to do with the clothing manufacturing business as it has with the partial unemployment in the boot and shoe manufacturing business. As I say, 75 per cent. of the 4,000 persons in the boot and shoe manufacturing business are on part time.  I am certain that this increasing unemployment, to the tune of 4,280 for the week ending 1st December, coupled with the increased price of essential commodities is causing widespread hardship in many parts of the country, particularly approaching the Christmas season.</P>
    <P>I am raising these matters for the purpose of imploring the Minister to use whatever powers he has to deal with people who should be bringing down prices, now that the price of the raw materials has come down, as it has come down in recent weeks.  Is it not a fact that the price of wool is much cheaper now than it was 12 months ago, when this racket went on in the blanket business?  The gentlemen who are engaged in that section of our clothing manufacturing business and who took advantage of the increased prices of raw materials to put up their prices immediately they read about the increase in the price of raw materials, should now bring down their prices when the price of the raw materials has come down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> The racketeering section of the clothing manufacturers got the benefit of increased prices for three or four months before they were entitled to them, and surely the ordinary citizens, wholesalers, retailers and the community in general, are entitled now to the benefit of the reduced prices that should come about following the reduction in the price of the raw materials.  If the Minister can make inquiries into this matter and use his good offices, as I am sure he can, for the purpose of helping to bring about that situation, there will be an improvement in the retail side of the drapery business.  The same thing may apply, though I am not quite so sure that it would, to the boot and shoe industry.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to have money left over from the Marshall Aid Fund.  I do not know how much is lying in the Bank of Ireland, or in whatever bank it is held, of what is known as the Marshall Aid free money.  If some of that money still remains, it should be devoted to suitable schemes, and there are thousands of them according to the Minister for Local Government who met a deputation consisting of some of my colleagues and myself to-day. If the money is in the bank, take it out, bring in a Supplementary Estimate and allocate the money to local authorities who have schemes ready to provide employment for men who have been recently thrown out of employment. That would relieve the situation which in my constituency appears to be getting worse day after day.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that rising prices in the situation which we see confronting us are causing, even in the case of those who have full-time work, considerable uneasiness.  Since the Government came into office the prices of many essential commodities have been increased.  I am glad to see the Minister for Agriculture back from Rome and I hope he will give his blessing to everybody who can help to relieve the present situation.  The Minister for Agriculture, I consider, has a heavy responsibility&mdash;I suppose if I talk about collective responsibility he has only a twelfth or a thirteenth part of the responsibility&mdash;to carry for increasing the price of certain essential <Col N="1133" /> commodities.  Prior to the last general election we were attacked in posters plastered all over the country by Fianna Fáil spokesmen and candidates because we supported and were supposed to agree with the action of the inter-Party Government and the then Minister for Agriculture in putting up the price of butter by 2d. in the lb. Fianna Fáil are supposed to have squandered anything between £10,000 and £15,000 on an advertisement inserted in the newspapers on a particular day showing a photograph of the best-looking housewife they could get. Her photograph appeared in the newspapers with a funny kind of advertisement, which made a special appeal to housewives in particular and which captured the votes of many housewives, condemning the inter-Party Government for their action in increasing the price of butter by 2d. per lb.  Then when my old friend and colleague&mdash;not a colleague of the same political party &mdash;Deputy Tom Walsh, was nominated by the Taoiseach as Minister for Agriculture he marched into this House 15 days after the Fianna Fáil-Cowan Government came into existence and put up the price of butter by another 2d. per lb.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister for Agriculture in particular that many good-looking women will be looking for his blood when he faces them in the next general election.  He will not be able to go down to Castlecomer, or Kilkenny, and get the same kind of friendly reception from the women there because of what he said previous to the general election and of what he did after the election was over when he became Minister for Agriculture.  If the Minister for Agriculture were as good as his word and lived up to the speeches that he made, he should have brought down the price of butter by the 2d. which Deputy Dillon put on instead of putting it up by another 2d.  He will also have to accept responsibility for putting up the price of cheese to a figure which, I think, he will find it hard to justify.</P>
    <P>Cheese is in common use in the poorest household, particularly in certain parts of the country.  The Minister made no attempt to justify his action in putting up the price of cheese by <Col N="1134" /> 7d. a lb. after he came into office, realising that by doing so he was repudiating everything he said on this matter when seeking the votes of the people of Carlow and Kilkenny in the last election.  It was certainly a very brazen thing to put up the price of butter by 2d. a lb. after he had misled many good-looking women, married women in particular, to vote for the Fianna Fáil candidates in the last election. I hope these women will remember that for the Minister and his colleagues at the next election.  I hope they will not get away with it as easily as they appeared to get away with it in this House.</P>
    <P>Everybody must agree that this Government or, indeed, any Government cannot effectively control the prices of articles manufactured here with raw material imported from outside. No sensible citizen expects them to do so.  But, if they wish to do so, they can control the prices of commodities such as milk, butter and cheese, because the raw material for these comes from the land, which provides most of the wealth and the raw material we have in this country.</P>
    <P>I have been asked before and I may be asked again what we would have done.  I know Deputy Corry is ready to put the question to me: did we agree with the demands of the milk suppliers for an increase in the price of milk?  I do not pretend to be an economist. I do not pretend to be able to tell the Minister for Agriculture, and neither did I pretend to tell the Minister for Agriculture in the last Government, what is a profitable price for milk.  But whatever price is regarded as profitable by those who know more about that matter than I do, I am prepared to vote for the provision of a profitable price to those who supply commodities like milk, butter and cheese.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that I did not agree, and neither did my colleagues agree, that the money necessary to provide 1d. or 2d. per gallon increase in the price of milk should be found by passing the whole <Col N="1135" /> of that sum on to those who have to consume butter.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and his colleagues know that we always advocated as a Labour group that any money to be found for purposes of that kind should be provided by the taxation of luxury articles.  It was no secret at the time that this group did not agree with that policy.  Let it be clear that so far as we are concerned, we believe in providing a profitable price for those who produce butter, milk, cheese and other essential commodities in common use by the citizens of the State.</P>
      <P>I do not mind taking this opportunity to say that, so far as there is increasing unemployment in my constituency arising from shortage of suitable schemes to absorb the unemployed, that money can be made available for that purpose.  When the county engineer in Laois gave orders for the dismissal of 120 workers two weeks ago, the county council called a special meeting.  I salute every member of every Party in that council for taking upon themselves the responsibility for telling the Minister for Local Government that if the Government could not provide the necessary money out of the Marhall Aid free grant or other sources, they would provide the money out of the rates to maintain these men in employment because there were essential schemes to be carried out.  That was their justification for retaining these men for the Christmas period or up to 1st February when there was plenty of work to be done but no money was provided from central funds, as hitherto, for that purpose.  The Minister for Local Government does not appear to be willing to bring in a Supplementary Estimate.  I put it to the Taoiseach and his colleagues: if there is money left out of the Marshall Aid free grant, what is the use of leaving it lying idle when there are men without work and the necessary money to provide themselves and their families with the requirements so very badly needed around the Christmas period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Industry <Col N="1136" /> and Commerce will look into the position so far as it affects workers employed in different manufacturing industries. I appeal to the Taoiseach and his colleagues, rather than have increased unemployment at this Christmas period, to take out the money which is lying idle and allocate it to the local authorities who have approved schemes waiting to be carried out so as to bring back into employment the men who have been dismissed and carry out schemes which will improve the wealth of the country in the long run.  I am not raising this for any political purpose on the eve of the Adjournment, but many thousands of workers and their wives and dependents will wish the Taoiseach and his Ministers a much happier Christmas if some assurance can be given before we adjourn that something will be done in connection with this matter so far as the country as a whole is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the members of the Labour Party who gave notice of their intention to raise on the Adjournment the matters of rising prices and unemployment were wise in associating those two problems together, because they are associated. I hope they appreciate that fully.  I do not think that Deputy Davin showed that appreciation in the course of his remarks.  At the present time, there is in the clothing trade and some other trades a curtailment of public demand which has resulted in the reduction of orders to Irish factories and has created unemployment or short-time working.  Taking Deputy Davin at his word that he is raising this question without any political motives, it is desirable that we should give serious consideration to the cause of that development.</P>
      <P>It has been stated here that it is due to the resistance of consumers to rising prices, that prices have reached the stage at which public demand is bound to be curtailed, and also that it is due to an expectation of a fall in prices. Whatever cause is operating to reduce orders to the clothing industry in this country, it is operating everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed during the <Col N="1137" /> last few weeks reports in the Press of serious unemployment in the Six-County area.  In Derry, 2,000 out of the 5,000 persons employed in the shirt industry are reported to be wholly unemployed and 2,000 of the others on short time.  The Six-County authorities, as a consequence, have withdrawn the employment permits previously granted to Donegal workers employed in the Derry shirt factories.  Other industries in the North show, if not quite as serious a development, nevertheless a contraction in activity.  Recently, the British Trade Commissioner, who came to my Department to urge reconsideration of the measures we have taken to curtail the importation of woollen cloths from Great Britain, said that they were facing in their woollen industry in Great Britain a situation which he described as critical.  There are 40,000 workers in that industry at present unemployed.  Similar adverse reports have reached us from Italy, which has a large textile industry, and from France; and, as I mentioned here in the course of an earlier debate, bank reports from America, where one would expect a contrary situation in view of the heavy rearmament expenditure, indicate a similar situation there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin has discussed this question of unemployment in the clothing trade and expressed the view, at the same time, that clothing prices should come down.  I want him to realise the significance of bringing these two issues together.  He said that last year there was no situation such as now exists and that, in fact, traders were complaining that the manufacturers were unable to fulfil their orders.  Last year every issue of a newspaper carried reports of boom prices for wool.  Everybody was expecting that the cost of woollen garments would rise.  Individual consumers were buying upon that anticipation and traders were stocking up on that anticipation, and there existed in the clothing trades precisely the position that one would expect when there was a general anticipation that prices would go up.</P>
    <P>Now that general anticipation has <Col N="1138" /> changed.  The papers recently have been carrying reports of a fall in the price of wool and there is, I think, a general expectation because of these reports that prices may come down. It is always so; when prices are expected to rise there are trade booms and employment is brisk.  When prices are expected to fall, trade tends to contract and employment tends to diminish.  Deputies will appreciate that any forecast which I might make as to the trend of prices in the clothing trades might, therefore, influence the situation.</P>
    <P>We have announced our intention of trying to keep the price situation stable.  To that end we have imposed higher quantitative restrictions upon imports and we have raised tariffs. We knew when we imposed these tariffs that we were taking a decision in favour of maintaining or increasing employment in the clothing industries and against allowing clothing prices to fall to the extent that they might. There is no doubt that if we removed our clothing tariffs altogether and our quantitative restrictions upon imports, in view of the conditions existing throughout the world, in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Continent of Europe, we could get at the present time, deliveries of clothing at prices which would be below their economic cost and perhaps even below their cost of manufacture.  That would cause a temporary advantage in prices, but we would subsequently pay for that advantage with rising unemployment in our own clothing industries.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we would gain in the long run if we were to take that course.  The unemployment would be reflected in increased emigration and many of our industries would lose the skilled workers upon which they are dependent.  We think it is far better for us to try to get our clothing needs met from our own factories at the economic cost of manufacture here rather than that we should seek a temporary advantage by permitting imports of cheaper products from abroad.</P>
    <P>The situation which exists in the clothing trade exists in one or two other trades as well where there is also an expectation that raw material prices may come down.  There are, of course, <Col N="1139" /> some industries which are not affected at all because the price of raw materials is still going up.  I expressed the view earlier this year that by the end of the year we would have achieved a position of price stability and that view was based upon the evidence then available of the trend of international raw material prices and on the belief that by then the adjustment of retail prices to meet the higher cost of materials imported earlier in the year and the higher wage rates that became effective earlier in the year would have been completed.  I still hold that view.</P>
    <P>I said here before that only one major application for an adjustment of producers' prices was still awaiting determination by the Prices Advisory Body.  That is an application by Irish brewers upon which I have not yet received the report of the advisory body.  There are other applications for adjustments of retailers' margins which the body has under consideration, but at present there is no evidence that we are likely to receive the same flow of applications from manufacturers for permission to adjust prices because of higher costs, which occurred earlier in the present year.</P>
    <P>I realise that in the present unsettled world conditions anybody attempting to make a forecast of future price trends is taking the risk of being proven completely wrong.  I think, however, it would be unwise to hold out an expectation of any general price fall. I do not think it will occur.  I think the expectation of it occurring would upset employment.  I think it is far more likely that we will be able to secure the position of stability to which I referred earlier than handle the problem of the price level by effecting any all-round reduction in prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the position of the worsted spinning industry in his own constituency.  It is undoubtedly true that the contraction of orders for worsted yarn which that factory is now experiencing is due to the very heavy stocks of woollen and worsted cloth now held in the country. I would not have criticised the decision taken by my predecessor to double the import quota for the first half of this year to enable wholesalers and manufacturers <Col N="1140" /> to stockpile woollen and worsted cloth if a former member of the Coalition had not tried to put the blame for the resultant situation in the woollen spinning industry upon my shoulders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that in the circumstances prevailing earlier this year the Government then in office must have been concerned at the danger of international hostilities breaking out, hostilities which would leave us short of supplies.  I said, and I still say, that if the effort to stockpile had been made in time it could have taken the intelligent form of an accumulation of raw materials and that it was the consequence of the delay in taking the requisite measures that forced them to a decision to permit the stockpiling of manufactured goods instead.</P>
      <P>In the case of the worsted spinning industry, however, there was a stockpiling of raw materials.  The firm to which the Deputy referred was approached on the instructions of the Government by the Industrial Development Authority and asked to acquire, and maintain, four months of stock over and above that normally carried by them.  They did so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And they agreed that the imports would be brought in at a particular period too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands what I am saying.  That firm did, in fact, import over and above the stock normally held by it four months' additional supplies of raw material.  When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce I was approached by the representatives of that firm and told that in consequence of the heavy fall in the price of that raw material which had occurred in the meantime they were facing a very heavy loss.  The difference between what they had paid for the raw material and its market price at the time they discussed the <Col N="1141" /> matter with me represented a loss equivalent almost to the entire capital of the company.  But they had received from the Industrial Development Authority when they agreed to purchase that raw material for stockpiling an assurance that if they did so they would be protected against the danger of loss in the event of the situation developing as it did, in fact, develop.</P>
      <P>I felt that that undertaking, given formally on behalf of the previous Government by the Industrial Development Authority, had to be honoured by me, and I have taken steps to honour it. But it means this, that for some time, until that abnormal stock of raw material has been reduced, the products of that firm must be sold at a higher price than would otherwise be necessary, at prices which are slightly higher than world prices at the present time.</P>
      <P>The same problem arose for other firms which undertook to carry, or which were induced to carry, abnormal stocks.  I refer to that because I want to bring to the attention of Deputy Davin, and of the Dáil generally, an issue of policy which arose there. Deputy Davin said that certain firms increased their prices as soon as the raw material prices increased.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that it is not merely normal commercial practice, but sound commercial practice, to charge raw materials currently used in the process of manufacture at the cost of replacing them, and if that course had been permitted here, with the price control arrangements in operation, prices would have risen earlier, but we would now be able with fewer adverse consequences to adjust them downward again.  The British Labour Government, operating its price control, worked on that basis.  The firm to which the Deputy has referred in his own constituency is associated with a corresponding factory in Great Britain, and they were permitted to increase their prices step by step with the rise of raw materials, appropriating the higher revenue thereby received <Col N="1142" /> to a stock depreciation reserve upon which they are now drawing to enable them to sell their products at the world price even though the actual material going into use was purchased at the top of the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Here, the policy was followed of requiring firms to use their stocks in current production at the price paid for them and to leave the problem of replacing these stocks by higher priced stocks to be resolved later on.  That, for example, arose in the case of the cigarette manufacturers. The cost of tobacco increased in the sterling area on the day that the £ was devalued.  Here the cigarette manufacturers had a two years' supply of tobacco, and they were instructed by the Department of Industry and Commerce to continue to charge that stock of tobacco in the current price of cigarettes at the price paid for it but not to increase prices until the higher priced post-devaluation tobacco was actually coming into use.  The two years since devaluation ended in September this year, and the price of cigarettes had to be increased. That is going to mean this, that if at some time the price of tobacco falls again we will not be able to get the benefit of that fall in the price of cigarettes for two years afterwards. We got an immediate benefit last year, but we will have to pay for that benefit at some future time if prices fall.  Of course, there may not be any general fall in prices, although I think it is now safe to assume, in view of the policy which is being followed by the British Government, that the danger of a further devaluation of the £ just does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained the measures which we have taken to limit the effect of the trade recession on employment in the clothing industry by cutting quotas and increasing tariffs.  I have said already here, in the course of a discussion following a parliamentary question, that there was not, in fact, in recent months, despite the trade recession in Britain and Northern Ireland, any evidence of abnormal <Col N="1143" /> imports of manufactured goods.  But I did find, in discussions with organisations of wholesalers, traders and manufacturers, a real expectation that abnormal imports would come from British manufacturers holding surplus stocks and trying to dispose of them in any market into which they could get them.  That apprehension was primarily the cause of the reluctance of traders and wholesalers to place their orders for spring deliveries at this time, the time when they are normally given.  I felt that the effect of the announcements of reduced quotas and of higher tariffs would be to remove these apprehensions and encourage the giving of orders again.  I am glad to say that there is some evidence that that has happened and that in some branches of the clothing trade unemployment is diminishing and that workers who were laid off are being called back but not to anything like the extent necessary.  The movement, however, is in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Davin that a manufacturer who is faced with a curtailment of orders and the necessity of cutting down production, should endeavour to minimise the effect of that on his employees by adopting the system of short-time working rather than by making one section of the employees bear the whole burden by paying them off.  I would have no hesitation in conveying that view to any manufacturer who, I thought, was acting otherwise.</P>
    <P>I want to say also, in reply to certain observations made by Deputy Davin regarding the line taken by clothing manufacturers and traders in woollen goods this time last year, that when complaints were made then that manufacturers of blankets and other woollen goods were withholding supplies from traders in order to get the benefit of rising prices and were charging up in these prices the higher costs of raw materials, even before they had experienced them, the Department of Industry and Commerce, under the instructions of my predecessor, carried out at the beginning of this year an investigation of that situation.  That investigation appeared completely to <Col N="1144" /> disprove the allegations made.  There was, in fact, no evidence forthcoming to the departmental investigators that supplies were deliberately withheld from the market in anticipation of a rise, or that the prices of goods were being marked up because of a rise in the price of raw materials before it was justified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin has referred to increases in the prices of essential commodities which have occurred during the present year.  He mentioned, I think, butter and cheese.  It is true that the price rise is still continuing. The latest cost-of-living figure showed an increase of two points on the previous quarter.  At the end of the quarter before that, an increase of two points was already shown.  During the past six months, the cost-of-living <Col N="1145" /> index number has shown an increase of four points.  In the first half of the year, there was an increase of six points.  I feel, however, that it is still safe to say that the increase in prices which has been proceeding throughout the whole year is now tapering off and coming to an end and that we are in a position of price stability unless costs rise further, either because of inflation of the cost of imported raw materials or because of costs within our control.</P>
    <P>In the case of butter, however, I think Deputy Davin misunderstood or misinterpreted the political significance of the rise in butter prices sanctioned by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think that prejudiced the election of any Coalition candidate.  However, I will tell Deputy Davin what, I feel, cost the Coalition a number of votes. It was Danish butter.  I am quite certain that the Coalition candidates, particularly in this city, lost a large number of votes because of Danish butter.  We decided we would not lose votes because of Danish butter, and the decision to increase the price of creamery milk was designed to secure an expansion of Irish butter production so that we might not have to import foreign butter in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We increased the price of milk delivered to creameries, and we did so understanding that we were taking a decision without any reliable data to support it.  We felt that the general knowledge which was available to the Department of Agriculture was sufficient to justify the increase; simultaneously, as the Deputy may remember, the Minister for Agriculture announced that he was going to establish a tribunal to get reliable information as to the cost of milk production&mdash;information which we have not got at present.</P>

      <P>Deputies opposite think <Col N="1146" /> the price of milk should not have been increased.  I admit Deputy Davin was in favour of increasing the price of milk, but he said he would have met the resultant higher cost of butter by the taxation of luxuries.  I wonder would Deputy Davin tell us what luxuries he would like taxed?</P>

      <P>No matter how you tax luxuries you could not get in enough money to pay one penny subsidy on butter.  Either the increase would be so small it would yield no revenue or else the increase would be so high that the trade would stop.  As I told the Deputies opposite on many occasions there are only three taxes in operation here, the alteration of which will yield a substantial amount of revenue.  These are income-tax, tobacco tax and beer tax.  All other taxes are of little importance in comparison.</P>

    <P>Deputy Davin was rather unwise to refer to the price of cheese because this was one of the Price Orders which I found awaiting me on my desk when I resumed office in June last.

      <P>I do not think that anybody should, in all fairness, speak for any length of time in this debate.  I just want to say, in all seriousness, to Deputy Davin, that, so far as moneys for works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act are concerned or where other funds allocated for local authorities are involved, every penny provided in the Budget will be paid out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The easy money is all gone.  What Deputy Davin calls &ldquo;free money&rdquo; is all gone.  That era is over.  We have to pay our way in future.  Marshall Aid came to this country by way of loan.  It has got to be repaid.  The payment of interest on that loan becomes due next year and the repayment of the principal a couple of years later.  The amount of money which we borrowed and which we used as &ldquo;free money&rdquo; during the past year will represent the equivalent of eight years' export of goods to the United States.  For eight years all the goods we could ship to the United States would be going there free of charge in order to repay the loan.  Repayment of that loan is the equivalent of eight years' total exports to the United States.  So why describe it as free money?  I will admit that it was <Col N="1148" /> treated as free money but it certainly was not free, and the taxpayers of this country are going to realise that it was not free money.</P>

      <P>In any event, it is all gone.  There is no money in the Bank of Ireland on which the Minister for Finance can draw in order to give additional grants to the county councils. I have explained to-day that the Minister for Finance has got the problem of raising between this and the 31st March an additional £10,000,000 in order to meet the deficit in the tax revenue and the cost of the Supplementary Estimates which the Dáil passed to-day or will be called upon to pass next February.</P>

It will be difficult enough for him to do it, to discharge his liabilities before the 31st March, and it is certainly impracticable to contemplate any substantial addition to that burden.</P>

I think that is a disgraceful suggestion made by a Deputy who supports the present Government, and I trust that his views will not colour the policy of the Government in this connection, as his views have in other respects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard the Tánaiste here to-night in a far different light from the speech he would have made this time 12 months.  We heard him here starting his speech full of sweet reasonableness, full of the milk of human kindness.  Perhaps it was the Christmas season beginning to impinge upon the Tánaiste's mentality. But perhaps also he knew in relation to one of the matters being discussed in this adjournment that he had a very bad case on the question of prices and the cost of living.  In my few remarks I want to refer to that case.  If there is any subject upon which this Government stands condemned at the bar of public opinion it is on the question of the cost of living.</P>
      <P>For the last three and a half years the present Tánaiste, as Deputy Lemass, speaking from these benches here, hurled broadside after broadside at the then Government because of rising prices.  Twelve months ago he went to new heights of fury because of the level of prices then obtaining, and his side-kick, Deputy Cowan, even put down a motion of no confidence in the inter-Party Government.  It is against that background that we must consider the situation to-day.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste speaks as a Minister of the Government and he comes into the House to say this: &ldquo;I do not think it would be wise to hold out any hope of a general fall in prices.&rdquo;  The only hope he holds out to the country now is that the present increase in prices is beginning to take hold and that possibly we may see stability in prices at a higher level some time in the future. I do not want to cover again some of the ground already discussed in this session during the supplies and services debate but I think it is proper to remind the Tánaiste in connection with sentences which he uttered here to-night, of speeches which he made in the last general election when he spoke at Townsend Street on 19th May, 1951. This is the report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Seán Lemass, speaking at Townsend Street, Dublin, last night, said that Fianna Fáil could not promise that all difficulties would disappear <Col N="1151" /> if a Fianna Fáil Government was elected or that all prices would come tumbling down, but it would be able to operate an intelligent and consistent policy to solve those problems. That was what a Coalition Government could never do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a speech made by the Tánaiste. Did I hear a Fianna Fáil supporter say: &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;?  Many voters said: &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; on 19th May of this year.  Many of the Tánaiste's constituents applauded that speech.  They heard the nominal deputy Leader, the real Leader of Fianna Fáil, telling them that if a Fianna Fáil Government was returned to power he was not going to promise that all prices would come tumbling down.  But there was a clear suggestion to the Irish voters and particularly to the city voters: &ldquo;If you put us back we will bring down most prices.&rdquo;</P>

I say that that particular statement of the Tánaiste on 19th May is a clear suggestion that if the Fianna Fáil Government was returned most of the prices then being charged for goods that the people had to buy would fall.</P>

      <P>A few days later in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 23rd May this year Deputy Major de Valera is reported as disclosing Fianna Fáil's policy in relation to prices.  Here is what he said Fianna Fáil was going to do:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Coupled with the drive to increase production and secure supplies Fianna Fáil would exercise a practical price control to prevent exploitation of scarcity conditions <Col N="1152" /> and protect the housewife as far as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the end of the story.  I want Deputy Briscoe to listen to this. There was another speech made by a Fianna Fáil candidate.  He was not successful, but he is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 17th May as making this appeal to the women of the city of Dublin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Housewives of Dublin would have an opportunity on 30th May to strike a blow against those who produced a Government black market in essential foodstuffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the background we are discussing to-night after six months of the present Cowan-Cogan-Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I think it is at least permissible for us in the Opposition to describe the seats which the present Government and their fellow-travellers secured at the last election, certainly in the city, as being seats won as a result of a huge confidence trick played on the voters of this city, as a result of a campaign designed and fashioned by the present Tánaiste to secure from the women of this city votes, irrespective of any moral considerations.  The whole suggestion was that, if he were back at the helm, there was no doubt that practical steps would be taken to control prices.</P>

      <P>I want to know from the Government what has happened to the Prices Advisory Council.  I want to know why price increases have taken place in the last six months, some of them without any consultation with that body.  I know, of course, that the Tánaiste, when in opposition, declared in his usual vehement manner that one of the first things that Fianna Fáil would do would be to abolish the Prices Advisory Council.  Another thing they were going to do was to abolish the Irish News Agency, and a third thing was to abolish the Industrial Development Authority.  These three bodies are still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know why price increases have been ordered and sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1153" /> over the last six months which never went before the Prices Tribunal at all.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to know that from the present Minister, since he did not abolish the Prices Tribunal&mdash;in fact, by legislation he has continued its existence.  Since he has not abolished it we must assume that he realises the important function fulfilled by that tribunal.  Nevertheless, in relation to such price increases as the increase in the price of cigarettes and tobacco, the matter appears never to have been discussed by the Prices Advisory Council.  Does that mean that, so far as the present Government are concerned, only certain awkward matters will be sent before the Prices Tribunal while the Minister will reserve to himself the right to deal with other matters?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Davin to specific increases in the price of certain commodities and I do not want to weary the House by detailing them.  I should like, however, to make it clear, from our point of view, that we do not say to the present Government, as they said to us, that the entire responsibility for all increases in prices rests with the Government. We realise, as Deputy Davin very fairly stated, that in relation to a considerable number of commodities; no matter what Government may be in power, outside circumstances will result in an increase in prices here. That, however, certainly does not excuse the dishonest campaign indulged in by the present Government. It does not excuse the fact that, knowing the position, they endeavoured to fish for votes in troubled waters in the last election.  It does not excuse the pantomime which they conducted throughout the State.  It does not excuse the posters and advertisements which they published in relation to the harried housewife in every single paper.  Lastly, it does not excuse the price increases that have taken place in the last six months as the result of deliberate Government policy.  Butter has been referred to. That, of course, was a most discreditable episode.  In relation to butter, there were more oozy tears shed by <Col N="1154" /> Fianna Fáil candidates in Dublin, Cork and other centres than in relation to any other matter.  That has been dealt with by Deputy Davin.</P>
    <P>The House will also remember that the present Minister, shortly after he became Minister, decontrolled bacon and meat.  These are two commodities that we produce at home ourselves, commodities over which the Government can exercise complete control in relation to price distribution, etc.  The present Minister decontrolled both these commodities.  What has been the result?  In relation to bacon, the farmer gets less for his pig.</P>

      <P>We know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce established the position that industry and commerce was to be the watch dog of agriculture when the Government came into office, and he probably told the present Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1155" /> that he was going to decontrol the price of bacon.  I am sure the Minister said to him: &ldquo;Good God, if you do that the farmer will be ruined, because the bacon curer can pay what he likes for the pigs and charge what he likes for the bacon.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture, however, was not strong enough for the old war dog and bacon was decontrolled.  There was, previous to the decontrol of bacon, a pious hope expressed that decontrol would result in a lower price for rashers.  The result has been&mdash;I repeat it again&mdash;that the Irish farmer gets 25/- a cwt. less for his pigs and that the Irish consumer pays 25/- more for his bacon.</P>

      <P>If I do not cause <Col N="1156" /> another eruption from the Minister. We all know that every time a farmer gets more or is promised more in the way of price for any corn he grows, up goes the price of fertilisers.  The Minister for Agriculture's predecessor was criticised by a large concern of fertiliser dealers because he endeavoured to break a particular line of control and Fianna Fáil Deputies supported that criticism.  They are now in control. The supply of fertilisers has got back into the same hands and in a period of five months the price to the farmer has jumped from £9 15s. to £20 a ton. The Minister for Agriculture finds that amusing.  He does not mind what the farmer has to pay for fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He is amused at Deputy O'Higgins's treading on thin ice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make that protest in respect to the farmers I represent.  Although the Minister for Agriculture may consider the price they have to pay for fertilisers amusing, they certainly do not regard it as such.  One of the grounds on which the inter-Party Government was castigated by the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance in his White Paper was that we had imported into this country at £9 15s. a ton 100,000 extra tons of fertilisers.  That is now being retailed at an exorbitant price to our farmers and I hope we will get some explanation of it.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to what Deputy Davin mentioned, the position in my constituency in regard to the clothing and woollen trade.  I am glad to see that Deputy Maher is now in the House.  Deputy Maher, Deputy Davin and myself and other Deputies for the constituency met a deputation from the worsted mills in Portlaoise some months ago to discuss the situation which had arisen in the factory there and also in the mills in Tullamore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not charge Deputy Maher with this, he may have been merely used. There is no doubt, however, that an attempt was then made by the Tánaiste to convince the workers who were being put on short time that the reason for that was that the Tánaiste's predecessor had imported too much yarn <Col N="1157" /> into this country.  That attempt was deliberately made.  I pointed out to that deputation that there was a general trade recession, not merely in this country but also in Great Britain and elsewhere; that there was also growing up a consumers' resistance to higher prices.  But that would not do&mdash;the responsibility was that of the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>I said that I acquitted Deputy Maher.  I charge the Tánaiste with doing that deliberately when meeting the directors of Salts, Limited, and the allied industry in Portlaoise and sending them back with that message to the workers who had been put on short time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the facts? Last year we imported into this country some 6,000,000 square yards of yarn.  That figure is apparently being used as a reason for the present situation. The fact is that in the year 1947 over 8,000,000 square yards of yarn were imported into this country and that was the highest import figure the country ever had.  That was when the Tánaiste was the Minister.  If that import in 1947 did not cause a similar trade recession or put men on short time in Portlaoise or Tullamore, why should the lesser figure in the last financial year cause such a recession or such unemployment?  It is not the imports which have done it.  It is partly due to the general trade recession, not merely in this country, but throughout Great Britain, but it is chiefly due to the ministerial line followed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance in the last four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is chiefly due to the fact that, for a political purpose, individual members of the present Government set out from September, thinking they would never survive this last session of the Dáil, to vilify the financial and economic policy of the last Government; trying to convince the Irish people that Ireland was insolvent and bankrupt; trying to convince everyone who had a stake in the country or <Col N="1158" /> money to invest that Ireland was not credit-worthy.  They endeavoured to do that.</P>
    <P>The result has been to cause in business circles generally&mdash;Deputy Briscoe knows it well&mdash;a most acute fit of jitters.  There has been little or no business done since then.  Not merely in the woollen trade but in the drapery trade, the boot trade and a number of other trades there has been a complete standstill because the people were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance that the country is insolvent, that it is on the rocks.  Behind it all, there was the gentleman in the big black coat hinting about further taxation.  What would be the result of that?  Any hint of taxation means less trade.  If there is to be new taxation imposed in the next couple of months, the people who have money to spend are not going to spend it on what are, in fact, luxury articles.  This situation has been aggravated considerably by the ministerial line of speeches in the last three months.</P>
    <P>I say to the Tánaiste that, while he can say that any unemployment which exists is partly due to circumstances outside his control, he cannot afford to be complacent, because there are men idle in Tullamore and Portlaoise to-day who would not be idle if the inter-Party Government had been returned this year.  There are men idle in Balbriggan and elsewhere throughout the country who would be working now if, unfortunately, Deputy Cowan had not decided to vote for the Taoiseach.  I hope that the country realises that, now that they have had six months' experience of the present Coalition.  I hope that they realise that, under the inter-Party Government, they did not prize sufficiently the benefits of the policy then being pursued.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House any longer.  I was anxious to mention these matters in relation to both prices and unemployment, particularly in relation to unemployment in my own constituency, in order to answer the suggestion that was made by the Minister that that situation was the result of the faults of his predecessor.  It <Col N="1159" /> would not have been necessary to discuss this matter in this way were it not for that suggestion, and we could have excused the situation as one that developed quite accidentally were it not for the background of the past few months.</P>

      <P>I will deal, first of all, with the comments of Deputy Davin about the unemployed in his constituency, the men who are now idle because of the shortage of money under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts. The Deputy who was in charge of the Department of Local Government when the Estimate for that Department was brought in was a Labour Minister, Deputy Michael Keyes.</P>
      <P>Here is the provision that Deputy Keyes made for the unemployed in Deputy Davin's constituency.  In 1951-52 the grant to local authorities for the execution of works under the Act was £1,220,000; in 1950-51 it was £1,750,000. In 1950-52 there was a decrease of £530,000.  That sum was taken out of the pockets of the unemployed in Laois for whom Deputy Davin has been appealing here to-night, and asking us to find some money for them in some mythical fund. There is a reduction of over half a million of money passed through this House by a Labour Minister, a reduction of half a million of money for the workers.  That is the reason why you have 120 people idle in Laois to-day, begging for work and begging for bread that was taken from them by the Labour Minister in charge of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us saddle every old horse we meet.  We will saddle that horse as well.  We had a tally-ho here in relation to the price of pigs.  It would be no harm for Deputies to look at the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, December 13th, that is to-day.  Prime pigs fetched 270/-; extra lean, 275/-; heavier classes, 260/- to 265/-.  Those represent the highest prices ever paid for pigs.  Yet, these Deputies allege that pigs have been reduced in price. <Col N="1162" /> Why we never got that price even when Deputy Dillon hunted them all across the Border last year.  But the farmers want that price, and more, considering that these pigs have to be fattened on Mesopotamian barley brought in by Deputy Dillon. They could eat five tons of that stuff and the hair would still be standing up on their backs.  That is why bacon is scarce.</P>
    <P>It calls for some mental agility to nail two lies in five minutes.  I have disposed of one of them.  Deputy Davin has unfortunately removed himself but I am glad to see Deputy Dunne here. Perhaps he will explain to us how he allowed the Estimate under the Local Authorities (Works) Act to be reduced by over £500,000 this year.</P>

    <P>The Deputy was very vocal about the mills in Tullamore.  I would like to say a few words not only about them, but about the mills in Midleton and Youghal in my constituency.  I am deeply concerned about them.  We had Deputy O'Higgins talking about the 8,000,000 yards of material that were imported in 1947.  That was before Messrs. Dwyer &amp; Company started to manufacture in Midleton and Youghal. We require 10,500,000 yards of cloth to meet the needs of our people.  The last Government dumped 7,250,000 <Col N="1163" /> yards of cloth in this country last year. Our own local mills produced 6,500,000 yards.  We had, therefore, 3,000,000 yards more than we required for our needs.  Some weeks ago, I told in the House the experience I had when travelling by train from Cork to Dublin. I had a conversation with a gentleman who said he was coming up to try to get a licence to bring over from Britain material such as Salts &amp; Co. are manufacturing here.  He said that one could get that licence all right under the inter-Party Government, but that now you could not get a licence to import materials because the result would be to throw the workers in our mills idle.  That is the problem I was faced with in Midleton, and I did face it.</P>

      <P>I am well aware that he has not, and that he had to take immediate steps to end all quotas of that description.  We are not going to have a repetition now of what occurred last year when 7,500,000 yards of cloth were dumped in the country and the workers in the mills at Midleton had to walk the streets unemployed.  In that situation we have this motion about unemployment brought in to-night by the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin also spoke about milk. He assured us that, as far as he was concerned, he had no objection to the farmer getting a fair price for his milk. The Deputies who sit in this House are not fools, and they well remember, about six months before the inter-Party Government disappeared in disgrace, Deputy Davin marching into the Lobby to vote against Deputy Cogan's motion which proposed that the farmer should get an economic price for his milk.  That was Deputy Davin's attitude then.  He now says he has no objection to the farmer getting a proper price for his milk, and that it should come out of taxation.  Deputy Davin was sitting in the House when Deputy Dillon, by way of a death-bed repentance, agreed to increase the price of milk by 1d. a gallon, and did not object to the 2d. per lb. which went <Col N="1164" /> on butter as a result.  Let us be honest at least.  The late Minister for Agriculture prevented the farmers of this country who keep dairy cows from getting a fair price for what they produce. After all, there are only six or seven counties out of the 26 which are, to a large extent, composed of dairy farmers.  They supply the Twenty-Six Counties with butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not, and I make no bones about saying that.  The farmer is entitled to his costs of production as well as any other man. If a farmer's costings are increased, then he should be given a price for what he produces to enable him to meet his costs of production.  If we want to have decent production in this country something will have to be done to bridge the gap which exists between the gentlemen outside the fence who earns £5 12s. a week and the man working inside it who gets £3 10s.  That position was responsible for what occurred during the three and a half years of the inter-Party Government, when 65,000 young men left the land and went into the towns and cities or across to Britain.  It is true they had nothing to offer but the labour of their hands. Naturally, they sold that labour in the highest market.  They were not going to work for a farmer for £3 10s. when they could get from £5 to £6 10s. a week elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As a result of the walloping and the wiping out of the dairy farmers of this country, the last Government had to go to Denmark and bring in Brian Boru's butter, butter which Deputy Murphy stated here the other day would walk in the door or creep off the table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is supposed to be an agricultural country.  Let us determine then on one thing, that our own people will have first claim on the products of the land, and that they are going to be fed.  Let us see to it that they are fed decently and that sufficient butter is provided for them. <Col N="1165" /> That can be done by giving the farmer his costs of production, plus a fair profit on what he produces.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with two other little matters since we are on the subject of unemployment.  Can any Deputy on the Opposition Benches explain to me why the money guaranteed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in November, 1947, for the erection of the plant and machinery in Irish Steel, Limited, for the sheet mills was not forthcoming during the three and a half years the people over there disgraced this country by being a Government?  Talk about begging for industries!  There was an industry with nine-tenths of the machinery on the ground.  The war was over and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had gone down and inspected the place and the plant and had said that he would give the cash for its erection. Why was it that that cash was not found and that nothing was done until Deputy Lemass came back to office?</P>
      <P>It was a question of dodge, dodge, dodge, through 18 questions, as I said a fortnight ago.  I asked 18 questions as to why that money was not forthcoming and why that plant was not erected.  I was told that it was being considered, that it was a serious matter, a matter which could not be passed over lightly but which must be considered seriously.  Then the scapegoat was found&mdash;the Industrial Development Authority.  That body spent six months inquiring into it and they were still inquiring into it when they were kicked out.  Now that plant is being erected and will give decent employment to Irish people in their own country and, please God, it will be followed by other industries.  I do not want to see the workers of this country dependent on the cutting of an Estimate by a Labour Party Minister or a Labour Party Government&mdash; whether they will get the £3 10s. 0d. or £3 15s. 0d. a week on a miserable job clearing rivers or something of that description&mdash;while there is decent employment waiting for them there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then some Deputies have the nerve to get up and talk about the increased cost of living.  Who is responsible for it?  Where is the Government now that refused to give 4/6 per ton increase <Col N="1166" /> in the price of beet?  Where is the Government which dumped into this country last February 74,000 tons of foreign sugar?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told me here three weeks ago when I asked him how far the import of foreign sugar was responsible for the increase of 1d per lb. in the price of sugar to the consumer, that that import and the high price paid to the Cubans for that sugar was responsible for two-thirds of 1d. per lb. to the Irish consumer&mdash;two-thirds of a penny more than the people need have paid if Irish beet were produced and Irish factories kept working.  It is no wonder they have run out and it is no wonder that only the baby has been left on the benches opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The intervention by the Tánaiste in this debate to-night seemed to me to come at a rather peculiar moment.  He seemed to be endeavouring to anticipate arguments which might be made by Labour representatives on this motion.  He made a number of points, and one of his arguments was that, while unemployment has been developing over a period, the trend is now in the right direction and unemployment is on the down grade. That is what I gathered from his remarks, and in that connection I should like to quote the figures, the most recent figures available, to show just what the trend of unemployment is.  Last year, on 1st December, the number of unemployed registered at labour exchanges was 56,790, and this year on 1st December the number was 61,070.  In one week, as between 24th November and 1st December of this year, the number of unemployed rose from 59,800 odd to 61,070, so that it does not appear that the trend is in the right direction.  Quite the contrary is the case.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what excuses Deputy Corry or the Tánaiste may make, the people of the country realise one fact at present&mdash;and if you listen to them in the streets, in buses, or wherever they gather this will be borne out&mdash; that the cost of living is rising, that nothing appears to be done about it, and that unemployment is increasing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what stupid interruptions Deputy Burke may make in the matter, they hold this Government, just as they held the inter-Party Government, responsible for the economic condition of the country, and rightly so.  Whatever the economic condition of the people may <Col N="1168" /> be, the Government must assume a responsibility for it.  What do political Parties seek power for but to assume that responsibility?  I think it is time that the Government faced up to its responsibility in this matter.  I am not so concerned with what happened in the recent or distant past.  I think there is too much time spent in talking about what happened in the past.  The people of this country and the people I represent want to know what will happen in the future.  They want to know what the next six months hold for them. Christmas may be a season of goodwill but for a large number of working-class families in the City and County of Dublin it will be one of the worst Christmases they will experience for many years from the point of view of money being made available to enable them to purchase goods.  The Government has a responsibility in that respect. When there is any slump in trade which brings unemployment it is the duty of the Government, in my view, to take any steps that may be necessary to provide employment for disemployed workers.</P>
      <P>In Dublin County a number of workers were disemployed as a result of a depression in the hosiery trade and in the textile industry.  This happened in Balbriggan and Lucan. The help we got from the Government, which is the central authority, in putting those workers into employment for the Christmas period was negligible.  County Councils were forced&mdash;as county councils throughout Ireland are forced just at the moment &mdash;to raise money by means of levying on the rates of the county to relieve a desperate condition of affairs.  It is no exaggeration to say that the position is desperate.  Skilled hosiers in the town of Balbriggan, who learned their trade from their fathers, who, in turn, learned it from their fathers before them, have been disemployed.  The hosiery trade has existed in that town for almost 200 years, although Deputy Burke sometimes claims that he found it, but he is hardly that old.  These men, with a skill which is worth something to the country and which represents wealth for the country, are now down on the foreshore picking winkles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no dirt in it. It is common knowledge.  Everybody knows it.  Unemployment has assumed more serious proportions than it has ever assumed for a long number of years, not alone in my constituency but in rural areas throughout the country.  For the past three years 1,400 men have been employed by the Meath County Council in operations under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  There are now 700 employed and 700 unemployed, as any Meath Deputy or member of the Meath County Council can verify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same tale is being told all over the country.  Whatever chance there may be in big cities and towns such as Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford for a man to obtain some form of alternative employment when his ordinary employment ceases, it is better left to the imagination than described the chance he has of securing alternative employment if he works in a rural area miles away from any industry.  In these areas, where he solely depends on working on drainage schemes or road works for the county council, his only alternative is to turn to agriculture. Agriculture does not seek labour at this time of the year, as everybody knows. There is real hardship in the rural areas as a result of unemployment. Many unemployed workers throughout rural areas&mdash;most of them probably voted for Fianna Fáil Deputies at the last election and may do so again, except in my constituency&mdash;have <Col N="1170" /> written to me to ask me to ask the Government what is going to be done for them.</P>

I doubt whether any grant ever received before by any county council for employment purposes of that nature can compare with that particular grant.  I do not think that Deputy Hilliard or the Meath County Council have any complaint to make against Deputy Keyes. If they have, they are merely indulging in purely political bias.  There is nothing new in that, of course.  We have come to expect that from the benches opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Martin Corry inevitably makes his exit when he has attacked somebody.  He always runs away.  I think there is some other form of life, which is not entirely human, that has the same kind of habit.  I would like to say to members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are in the House that the farmers, as a body &mdash;the creamery farmers to some extent&mdash;have to thank Deputy Corry for having put the present Government in an embarrassing position, when they assumed office in June last, by forcing their hands to some extent to pay an extra penny a gallon for the price of milk.  Deputy Corry is not satisfied with that.  That increase in the price of milk meant an increase last year of 4d. per lb. in the price of butter.  Those of us who represent Dublin areas, particularly suburban or small town areas around the city, know very well how great a hardship that is on the ordinary working people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often it is suggested that the people who live in or about the city are living in luxury while those who <Col N="1171" /> live in the South of Ireland, particularly those who live in Cork, are enslaved and are holding up the rest of the country on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>In the City and County of Dublin there is a population of over 600,000 people.  Those people have to foot the bill for the increase in the price of butter.  Deputy Corry states that the farmer is not getting enough for milk and obviously intends to exert all the pressure he can to get still more for milk.  The only way that can be done is by an increase in the price of butter to the consumer.  I wonder if all the Fianna Fáil Deputies are in agreement with that policy.  I wonder if the present Minister for Agriculture proposes to bow to the will of Deputy Corry in this matter.  It is of very great importance, because it will mean that the cost of living will go up further than it has gone since 13th June.</P>
    <P>Let us refresh our memory as to the commodities that have been increased since 13th June.  I am quoting from the Official Report of the Dáil Debates on Thursday, 6th December, 1951, column 537.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no circular.  I will give the Deputy circulars very shortly that he will not like to hear about.  I am taking the figures from a reply by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was asked by Deputy Declan Costello to give a list of the items that had been increased in price since 13th June and which was circulated with the Official Report.  The following increases took place: Unrationed sugar, 1d. per lb.; condensed full cream milk, 1½d. and 2d. per tin; condensed skimmed milk 1½d. per tin; confectionery (sweets and chocolates), ranging from 4d. to 1/- per lb.; table jellies ½d. per tablet (two manufacturers); coal, various increases in different areas, ranging from 5/- to £1 per ton; gas, various increases, ranging from 1.25d. per therm to 5.4d. per therm in different areas; electricity 0.3d. per unit, 0.2d. per unit for night storage heating; bus fares, within eight miles of General Post Office, <Col N="1172" /> Dublin, ?d. per mile, outside eight miles of the General Post Office, Dublin, ¼d. per mile; tobacco, hard plug.  1½d. per oz., roll and coil, 2d. per oz., cut plug, flake, etc., 1d. to 4d. per oz.</P>
      <P>We all know about creamery butter. On the 3rd August, cocoa was increased. Fresh milk was increased on 1st August.  Then on the 29th August cheese was increased.  Peas and beans were increased on the 3rd July.  I do not suppose ale is regarded as an item to be calculated in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regarded by many people as of great importance.  Dr. Ryan recommended it at some time, and even more prominent leaders than Dr. Ryan recommended it.  I suppose we could accept it as an integral part of the diet.  The price of ale was increased on 9th August.  Soaps were increased on 22nd June; petroleum products on 27th July and on the 29th October.  Imported timber was increased on 7th November.  There is a long list of other items that were increased at column 540, to which I would refer Deputies.  The reference is Volume 128, No. 4.</P>
      <P>That is a sorry picture so far as the people are concerned, and even Deputies with the Demosthenic eloquence of Deputy Burke will have a job explaining at the chapel gates in a very short time just how this came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  As most Deputies know, I have been associated to some degree with efforts which have been made over a period to improve the wages and working conditions of agricultural workers.  When discussing unemployment and rising prices we must take into consideration and have reference to the inadequate wage rates provided for those who work on the land for employers.  I submit that these men in rural areas, to whom I have already referred, suffer greater economic hardship than any other section and their number is not small.  The number of male workers on the land is about 150,000.  There are many others in <Col N="1173" /> respect of whom no statistics are available, such as sons of small farmers who may be working on the one holding, and female relatives of small farmers and of agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I thought it opportune to ask the Dáil to express an opinion on the question of the very low, starvation level wages which are paid to agricultural workers.  A motion was discussed.  It will be recalled that the Government Party and some of its adherents voted against that motion and defeated it.  The case was made in the House by the Minister for Agriculture and by others that there was only one way of dealing with the wages of agricultural workers and that was through the wages board.</P>
    <P>It was made out to be a sacrosanct organisation whose function it was to regulate conditions and wages as between farmers and workers, and that the House would be interfering unduly if it gave a simple expression of opinion.  All it was asked to do was to say that a farm labourer was entitled to £4 a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Were not we asked to say that a farm labourer in County Dublin was entitled to more than a farm labourer in Cavan, Kerry or somewhere else&mdash;something that I would not subscribe to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be an avenue of escape for some but the simple fact is, and cannot be got away from, and Deputy Cowan knows it is correct and so does Deputy Burke&mdash;it is one of the things that he will have a job to explain away at a very early date in the constituency that he and I represent&mdash; that this House by a majority, with many absentees who apparently were not sufficiently interested in agricultural workers to cast a vote one way or the other, decided that it was better that the Agricultural Wages Board should look after the agricultural workers.  It was, I suppose, pure coincidence that on the following Sunday, the Government organ, the <i>Sunday Press</i>, had an article carrying big black headlines about the forgotten men of Irish agriculture.  The effort was then being made to retrieve what was thought might be lost political <Col N="1174" /> ground.  &ldquo;Forgotten men&rdquo; were referred to.</P>

      <P>I was referring to this report which appeared in what has been very aptly described as the kept newspaper of the Government Party regarding the &ldquo;forgotten men.&rdquo;  It was definitely suggested there that their only hope was the Agricultural Wages Board for increased wages to help them to fight rising prices and the increased cost of living and it was suggested that they should turn their eyes in that direction.  What happened? This glorified Agricultural Wages Board met on the 6th of this month and refused to give one single halfpenny to the agricultural workers by way of increase.  How are these men to face rising prices and an increased cost of living?  I ask anybody to tell me that.  The average wage of agricultural workers throughout the country is somewhere between £3 7s. 6d. and £3 10s.</P>

      <P>I want to draw particular attention to one point so that <Col N="1176" /> Deputies in this House and agricultural workers throughout the country will be under no misapprehension regarding the attitude of the present Government vis-a-vis rising prices.  It is obviously intended that the old policy of maintaining a huge mass of agricultural workers as a foundation for an economy of some kind or other is going to be pursued, and this policy means maintaining them at a very low level.  The present Government's policy is to continue on those lines, on the basis we saw it operate in other years when we had large scale unemployment. I am now talking of prewar years.  During the war, as everybody appreciates, there was artificial employment and wholesale emigration. Artificial employment was produced by forced conditions, but before the war, in 1937 and in 1938, which could be regarded as something approaching normality if not exactly normal years, we all remember the long queues outside the labour exchanges and agricultural workers getting 24/- or 30/- a week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the basis of the Fianna Fáil administration.  Indeed the people in the country, in Deputy Hilliard's constituency as well as in others with which I have contact, and the agricultural workers are anxious to know if that policy is to be pursued because from what we have seen in the last six months there is a bleak outlook from the point of view of unemployment and the cost of living. Whatever may be said, whatever excuses may be offered for this Government or whatever may be said in derogation of the previous administration, there is one fact in the mind of the people&mdash;and when this Government goes to the people it will find no method of getting over that fact or beating it down&mdash;and that fact is that during the previous Government's term of office there was the nearest thing to full employment.  This Government will not last when it gets to the polls.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin should listen to the reply, as he might be interested.  I owe thanks to a colleague of mine, Deputy Colm Gallagher, for having given me a reference I was seeking for some time, an extract from a book called <i>Down the Years,</i> by Sir Austen Chamberlain.  I am not going to read the whole reference, but I would recommend to members of the House to seek that book and read the reference.  In this reference one member of the English Parliament is saying to another in reference to an Irish member of Parliament: &ldquo;Have you ever seen a man caught cheating at cards have his hand pinned to the table with a knife?&rdquo;  I would also draw the attention of the House to Volume 126 of the Dáil Debates, July 17th, 1951, column 1787.  We have a reference from Deputy Dillon, who said in this House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance wants to know why there was no reference in the motion in this Order Paper to the action of the Taoiseach.  I shall tell him.  Because the motion was put down before I pinned the Taoiseach's hand to the desk.  The motion was put down before the printed copy of the unrevised report was issued.  You cannot pin the cheat's hand to the card table until he stretches forth his hand to play a dishonest card.&rdquo;</P>

We were told that the Fianna Fáil leaders and the Fianna Fáil Party sought the support <Col N="1179" /> of the electorate on deliberate false statements and promises. Extracts were read from speeches which were made during the general election campaign and interpretations were put on these speeches which no honourable person could possibly agree to.</P>
      <P>We heard Deputy O'Higgins to-night read a statement which was made on the eve of the general election by the Tánaiste in which the Tánaiste said that he could not hold out any promise to bring immediate or quick relief with regard to a reduction of prices. Deputy O'Higgins gave us his interpretation of that speech and put on the records of the House something which was untrue.  I wonder whether the time has not come, particularly when we have an Adjournment debate, to make reference to accusations and statements which are incorrect and without foundation.  I should like to point out that Deputy Dillon used the reference to the cheat having his hand pinned to the table notwithstanding the fact that that reference was used against his own father in the House of Commons.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when opposition and criticism and doubts and fears were referred to&mdash;I did not say it about Deputy Dunne&mdash;in regard to this Government's attempt to bring some form of industry to the undeveloped areas in the West.  Might I remind Deputy Desmond that he should read Deputy Norton's speech?  Deputy Norton was one of those who forced me to interrupt him, when he said he heard and he believed that this Bill would not bring employment of any kind whatsoever.  I suppose that what I am stating will be put down as false?</P>

      <P>There are many ways of defeating industrial development. Industrial development, which could have taken place very rapidly within the last three years, was slowed up considerably by the suggestions&mdash;again I dissociate Deputy Morrissey&mdash;of profiteering and racketeering, by statements that the people who come to open industries are &ldquo;fly-by-nights&rdquo;. Every single bit of abuse that could be poured on the heads of people was poured on those who are now being welcomed, who are now entitled to a margin of profits, and who are now going to be supported additionally if they go to an area where there are certain disadvantages from the point of view of competition.  It is a very welcome change, but the time has come when the decent members&mdash;if there are any over there, and I think there are some&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey knows that when I spoke within the precincts of this House, I spoke in no uncertain terms without privilege, and he at least had the decency not to interfere.  I believe he at least knew I was justified in the attitude I adopted in my address to Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>On the Adjournment debate we are supposed to deal more or less with criticism of the subjects which have not been dealt with, or emergency matters. However, we expect to believe each other.  I want to believe a political opponent when he makes a criticism. The suggestion was made that during the elections we made some references to the 2d. a lb. on butter and criticised our predecessors.  I represent in this Dáil a working-class district&mdash;Crumlin, Drimnagh, Inchicore&mdash;and at every meeting I addressed I put this to the public: &ldquo;Would it not be far better for you to pay more for Irish butter produced in Irish creameries, giving employment to people at home, than be faced with this rotten, stinking Danish butter?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There are only a few minutes more in this debate and I do not want to take up very much of <Col N="1185" /> those minutes in going back over the past, but when speaking here when the time was not so limited, I referred to the campaign by Deputy Briscoe, following in the wake of Deputy Lemass, as he then was, on the cost of living.  If Deputy Briscoe wants to discover my views on that subject, he can look up the debate.  I still say that it is clear and unmistakable that so far as the cost of living is concerned every member of the Fianna Fáil Party has got a most discreditable record in the way in which they started out under the leadership of Deputy Lemass a year ago to cod and fool the people. In the few minutes left, I do not intend to discuss anything about the past.  The people will judge the past when they get an opportunity and the sooner they get that opportunity the better.  What I do want to discuss is the future.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste, speaking to-night, indicated that in regard to certain aspects of industrial undertakings he believed the position was beginning to rectify itself.  I do not agree with him &mdash;particularly in respect of one undertaking that was mentioned, in my constituency.</P>
      <P>I noticed quite recently the speech made by Mr. Dwyer at the general meeting of either Seafield Fabrics or Sunbeam Wolsey in Cork, in which he made it clear that so far as that company is concerned, they were convinced as businessmen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
