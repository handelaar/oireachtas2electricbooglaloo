      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in June, 1949, the then Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare, Mr. D.J. O'Donovan, wrote to him stating that he (Mr. O'Donovan) was being pressed by the counsel and solicitor who were then acting for the Minister for Social Welfare in the civil proceedings for damages which, in his private capacity, that Minister had instituted against the <i>Irish Press,</i> to produce certain confidential documents and furnish other information also of a confidential character to assist the Minister to prosecute the proceedings; whether is was with his knowledge and consent that Mr. O'Donovan was informed by counsel acting for the Minister at a conference which he had with them on June 27th, 1949, that on the following Monday he (Mr. O'Donovan) would receive a direction from the Taoiseach to make the departmental files available and to give the evidence required, and whether any such direction was issued.</P>

    <P>In regard to the travelling allowance for 16th-18th May, 1950, I should say that the Information Officer availed of the Longford lecture to carry out, on the instructions of the Secretary, a wide survey of local offices of the Department. The Journey was also utilised to enable another officer of the Department to carry out an old age pensions survey on the same route without incurring any travelling expenses.</P>

      <P>I have examined the September, 1950, monthly return of officers serving, which was supplied by the then Secretary's office, where the relevant records are kept, and I find that it does not show that Mr. O'Driscoll was absent on any days during that month.</P>

The record of the attendance of officers in the Secretary's office were kept by the then Secretary of the Department. The return furnished from his office, an official return, does not show that Mr. O'Driscoll was absent on any days during the month in question. That is an official return.</P>

If the Deputy can make any superior proposal, I will certainly be anxious to have it considered, but I think, on the whole, that it is a fair proposal on the part of Drinagh Co-operative Society.

The necessity for proceeding with this scheme in advance of some of the other schemes which were placed in a higher order of priority by the sanitary authority in 1948 on the advice of the county medical officer has not, so far, been established.  It is for the sanitary authority to determine the speed at which they will carry through their programme of sanitation schemes, having regard to all relevant factors. It is open to them to place the Boulta water supply scheme in a higher order of priority on the advice of the county medical officer, but correspondence between the Department and the sanitary authority has not yet indicated that the county medical officer has advised the sanitary authority to do so.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the local authority to decide the time at which approved works for the purpose of grant are to be put in hands and it would, therefore, be contrary to practice for me to suggest an alteration in any order of priorities settled by a county council itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that considerable sums of money are due by his Department to county councils under the grants for health services in respect of the past three financial years; and, if so, whether he will state what steps are being taken to have the sums due paid to the county councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>No grants are due to county councils by my Department in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the year 1948-49 and subsequent years the grant payable in respect of health services is regulated by the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947.  The arrangements for the payment of the consolidated grant under that Act are that each health authority receives one-half of its total estimated grant by the end of the first quarter of the financial year, and a further 45 per cent. by the end of the first nine months of the year.  The remaining 5 per cent. is retained until the final accounts have been audited, subject to the payment before the end of the ensuing financial year of the amount necessary to bring the total payments up to 99.5 per cent. of the total grant as shown by the returns of actual expenditure as furnished by the local authorities.  The grant is, therefore, to a substantial extent paid in advance of local expenditure and considerable sums would not at any time be due to any health authority provided accurate and timely statements of expenditure are furnished to the <Col N="950" /> Department for the purposes of calculating the grant.</P>
    <P>The aggregate amounts of grant still to be paid to county councils are £9,400, in respect of the year 1948-49 and £187,000 in respect of the year 1949-50. Of the latter amount approximately £170,000 will become due and will be paid during the coming month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that owing to the fact that the final payment cannot be made on the claim of a county council until a full audit takes place each year the council will be three years in arrears in respect of receiving the final payment; that they must always continue to be three years in arrears?  Is he further aware that, owing to the non-payment of the amounts claimed by county councils, considerable sums become due to be paid by the local rates in respect of overdrafts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that 50 per cent. of the grant is paid by June and 45 per cent. after a nine-months' period; that is, that 95 per cent. of the total grant is paid.  Of the remaining 5 per cent., approximately 4.5 per cent. is paid before the audit, which leaves only one-half of 1 per cent. for the local authority to find.  We retain that so that any variation up or down may be adjusted. I think it is the most equitable arrangement that could be arrived at in the circumstances, particularly as we are not yet in a position to be quite certain as to the sum to be paid out in respect of the standard year 1947-48.  The position will right itself as the years go on when there are more accurate returns.</P>

The matters raised in these two motions are important and I feel, and I think my colleagues agree with me, that these matters should be discussed in a calm atmosphere, an atmosphere free from any heat, whatever the views may be, and that the subject matter of <Col N="952" /> these motions should be approached solely with a view to determining whether or not the matters mentioned in these motions do or do not assist an early solution of the problem of Partition.

There is no gallery there as far as this House is concerned, by the way; there are no visitors there either.  The Deputy concerned I think got a ticket; no Deputy is entitled to two tickets on special occasions.  On this occasion, the Ceann Comhairle thought it wise, after consultations, that particular care should be exercised. That care was exercised and that ends the matter.  Deputies have no privilege in the matter.  They get <Col N="953" /> a ticket.  They are not entitled to three or four, because if each got a ticket the seats would be all filled.</P>

      <P>Since dealing with this matter last night, I think that the information given to-day by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the importation of sugar is rather enlightening. This time we are going to Cuba with £370,000 in our pockets to buy sugar for the Irish people whilst our own factories are half idle, the land is half idle and there exists a condition of affairs which should bring home forcibly; if not to every Deputy on the Government Benches, at least to the Labour Deputies and, in particular, to the Minister for External. Affairs who was looking for an export market, that we are now going abroad and paying anything from £14 to £20 a ton more to the Cuban for sugar that could be produced by our own people and which we should pay our own people to produce.  Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see that condition of affairs brought to an end.  What steps are the Government taking to bring it to an end and to provide here the food and other necessaries that can be produced off the land?  Are we prepared to pay something like $19,000,000 for wheat?  I am informed by the sugar company that the first cargo of Cuban sugar to be brought in will amount to 7,400 tons for which we will pay £47 19s. 0d. a ton.  Will there ever be an end to it?  Will we continue to borrow dollars in order to hand those dollars over to the foreigner and pay him one and a half as much again as we are prepared to pay our own people for the same commodity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Tánaiste was exalted to the seats of the mighty, he was a Labour man.  Does he approve of our <Col N="955" /> factories lying idle?  Does he approve of land being allowed to go back to grass?  Does he approve of unemployment in Córas Iompair Éireann for, mark you, 75 per cent. of the freightage of Córas Iompair Éireann comes from the sugar industry here? Will all that go?  I want a definite reply from the Government on this matter.  I think I am entitled to such a reply.  I hoped that when I resumed to-day I would have some cheerful news for the agricultural community, indeed not only for the agricultural community but for all sections of our people which are anxiously awaiting news as to where their bread will come from in the next 12 months should an emergency arise.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, we had the Minister getting up here and adopting an attitude that was, to say the least of it, a disgrace to this House.  We had the Minister standing up here like a &ldquo;lepping&rdquo; lunatic, gesturing like a showman, vilifying everybody because he did not know the answer and he had no excuse for the situation as revealed by both E.C.A. chief here and by Deputies of all Parties who supported my appeal. Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Sheehan and others should appreciate the necessity for paying the Irish farmer at least a greater proportion of the price that we are at present paying the foreigner: £31 15s. 0d. per ton for wheat to the foreigner, and £25 to the Irish farmer.  The by-products of that wheat are available to the Irish farmer at £30 a ton if he takes them in six ton lots.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I have a very definite objection to a Minister of State coming in here and treating the House to ten minutes of abuse and behaving in a manner more appropriate to a common corner-boy. It is our duty to put our case as we see it.  It is our duty to protect the ordinary public.  We have the economic results of the present policy.  I am very sorry that the Minister for External Affairs has left the House because of his statement that he was looking for further industries and an export market.  If he had remained I would have told him where he will find those industries and that export <Col N="956" /> market.  If the Minister for External Affairs has any influence, surely he can prevail upon the wild-looking man he is sitting beside to give the Irish farmer a price for wheat which will act as an insurance policy in order to secure bread for our people in case of emergency.  I certainly would expect that much from the Minister for External Affairs, but I would not expect it from the Minister for Agriculture; I am quite frank about that.</P>
    <P>In the past month we have had to take this matter of providing sugar for our people out of the hands of the Government.  We have had to go directly to the sugar company and launch with it a campaign which should have been sponsored by the Government in order to secure sugar for our people in case of emergency.  We have to secure that the Irish farmer will get a price commensurate with the price paid to the Formosans last year. I admit that I would have made a better bargain if I had this £47 19s. 0d. a ton that the Minister tells us to-day was paid to the Cuban for sugar.  This is fundamentally a question of the employment of our own people on our own land to provide food for our nation. This is a question that is above politics.  It is a matter of getting down to business and seeing that this is done.</P>
    <P>I will pass now to milk.  I would like some definite statement in relation to our economic position in so far as milk is concerned.  We all know that the most uneconomic thing you can do with milk to-day is to produce butter from it.  Anything else that you turn milk to will pay better.  We are told all about the subsidy which is paid, not for the benefit of the farmer, but for the benefit of the consumer.  If, on 1st January, 1950, we had told the Danish Minister for Agriculture that we would give him 10 per cent. commission for selling our butter abroad, we could afford to pay the Irish farmer at the creamery ? a gallon for milk.  That Minister sold 281,000 cwt. of butter on the Continent at an average price of 438s.  The Minister for Agriculture can get the figures in his Department.</P>
    <P>What is the attitude of the Government towards that?  The Minister goes <Col N="957" /> over to England and meets some pals who tell him that they could not afford to pay him more than 271s.  The Minister returns to this country and tells the farmers that they will have to reduce the price of milk by 2d. a gallon, that he wants to supply Britain with butter at 271s. a cwt., and that therefore he can pay the farmer only 1s. a gallon for milk.  He carries on that game and he circularises all the creameries.  I hope he was pleased with his answer.</P>
    <P>The price of milk to-day is the price that was fixed by Deputy Patrick Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture, in 1947, although there has been a 33 ? per cent, increase in the cost of production. It is an absurd position that our Minister for Agriculture should go abroad buying butter for the Irish people, buying £19,000,000 worth of wheat for the Irish people, buying over £2,000,000 worth of sugar, as he did last year, for the Irish people, buying oats from the Argentine and bringing them to this country.  It is time that that kind of lunacy should cease and that the man responsible for it should be taken to Grangegorman or somewhere else.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to devote the whole of my speech to agricultural items.  I have indicated that the cause of this expansion in the Vote on Account is the attitude of our Government towards the agricultural community in refusing to pay a price at which it would be economic to produce and in rushing off to the foreigner and paying double the price or 1½ times the price that they have refused to pay the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with another aspect of this Vote on Account.  I am sorry that the Minister for External Affairs has gone.  The Minister for External Affairs had any amount of glib promises and any amount of anxiety for his dupes down the country, the poor fellows whom he told that the former Government were not going half fast enough and that if he had his way there would be an industry in every town and employment everywhere. For the past 24 or 25 years I happen to be representing the little seaport town of Cobh.  In 1939 we succeeded in getting an industry there <Col N="958" /> known as Irish Steel, Limited, an industry controlled by the Government. That industry is giving employment to about 380 men, decent employment at decent rates of wages, and everything else.  Only £1,000,000 of the £4,000,000 that was visualised when the industry was started has yet been forthcoming. Unfortunately, the war started in 1939, in the very week that that industry opened.  There is a blooming mill to be erected and a sheeting mill to be provided for the production of the corrugated iron that we are at present trying to beg, borrow or steal from abroad.</P>
    <P>In November, 1947, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce was in Haulbowline and he promised the requisite amount of money for the starting of the blooming mill and the sheet mill and for the conversion of the furnaces there to oil-burners, which would mean that we would not have to pay the extortionate sums for coal that are at present being paid and which would mean also that that mill could be operated at a lower cost than any steel mill in Britain.  The blue prints are still hanging on the wall, awaiting the order.  I have asked about 15 questions here at various times as to when the sheet mill and the blooming mill will be started.  I got various answers. I was told that the matter was referred to the Industrial Development Authority and the Industrial Development Authority&mdash;the new excuse for doing nothing&mdash;have been dodging this job for the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I put down a question for answer on 22nd February, 1951.  I wanted to know what progress this go-ahead Government, with the steam-pressure of Clann na Poblachta and the full pressure of the Labour Party behind it, to see that Fine, Gael did not revert to their old bad habits, were able to make.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If he will state whether he has yet received any report from the Industrial Development Authority on the extension of the factory belonging to Irish Steel, Limited, Haulbowline, Cobh, to embrace a sheet mill for the production of steel sheets and a blooming mill which it is estimated would give employment <Col N="959" /> to another 200 hands in the factory alone; and, if so, the nature of the report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I got the following reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Following a recommendation by the Industrial Development Authority, which was accepted by the Government, arrangements were made to procure the services of an expert to report on certain technical aspects of the steel industry.  These arrangements, although at an advanced stage, are not yet completed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put a supplementary question asking had the expert yet gone to Haulbowline and I was told he had not.  I do not know whether he is being brought from Korea or where he is to come from.  The fact remains that the money that was guaranteed to this industry by the former Government, in order to give employment to Irishmen in their own land and to provide us with steel products which would be absolutely essential in case of an emergency, has not been forthcoming, and every kind of paltry, miserable excuse is put forward by this Government in order to save them from the necessity to spend that money.  I waited for 12 months before I raised the matter in this House.  I waited 12 months after this Government came in, to give them a full opportunity of getting over the honeymoon, a full opportunity to start doing a little bit of business.  I thought that perhaps by that time they would be able to let us know how things were going.</P>
    <P>After considerable difficulty we succeeded in inducing the last Government to reopen Rushbrooke Dockyard. It was reopened and employment was given up to February, 1948.  During the past 12 months the men in Rushbrooke got four months' work out of the 12; during the other eight months they were either living on their fat or going on the dole.  Why was that?  We have a State controlled industry known as Irish Shipping Limited, and through the influence of this Government the ships that should be repaired in Rushbrooke under Irish Shipping, Limited, are transferred to Dublin to a private firm there.  I do not know what the <Col N="960" /> pull is.  I have endeavoured to find out, and as soon as I do I will let the House know.</P>
    <P>There must be a terrible pull when you have two State or semi-State industries, Irish Shipping, Limited, on the one hand, and Haulbowline Dockyard on the other, and the ships of the one which should naturally go into the other are sent to Dublin for repairs. The amount of shipping sent in that manner would have given employment in Rushbrooke for at least four months last year.  One of the Irish vessels, known as the <i>Rose,</i> has been transferred to the Liffey Dockyard.  If this Government intend to cater only for Dublin it would be better for them to say so.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the skilled men who, unfortunately, if this condition of affairs continues, will have to go abroad to Britain or elsewhere for employment and when the next emergency comes we will not have anybody to handle the machines.  These are the conditions in which we find ourselves to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister is looking for millions for a spendthrift Government, for a Government that collects £5,500,000 more off the man with the car and the man with the lorry and everybody else, than his predecessor collected, and he gives some £2,000,000 back to the local authority in order to get the roads that these people use and that they are paying for, put into repair.  Surely, the people who pay £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 in taxation, who pay by way of the petrol tax or in motor taxation, are entitled to have some of that money spent in keeping the roads that they use in order?  But, no, they have to pay again towards the maintenance of the roads; they have to pay for the roads again as ratepayers.  They find the rates increasing by 5/- or 6/- in order to keep the roads in repair.  The money is frittered away paying everybody double, paying every foreigner what he demands.  They are simply frittering away the money and leaving the Irish people in the lurch.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Local Government replying to a question put by Deputy McGrath.  Under an Act of the Oireachtas people who build <Col N="961" /> houses are entitled to get from the local authority a maximum of £40 per annum for ten years.  There is no minimum in this connection.  The local authority shall pay up to £40 a year. In my area there is a bunch of gentlemen who built houses and they can charge anything from £3 to £5 a week for them, and these gentlemen come along to the rating authority with their hands out for the £40 per annum. The Minister exceeds his authority and sends an ultimatum to the local body, saying: &ldquo;You shall pay Mary so-and-so £40 per house on ten houses that Mary built for £1,000 and lets for £3 10s. a week.&rdquo;  Is there to be any stop to the burden that those people are going to put on us?  Is there any limit to it?</P>
    <P>These are the matters that I wish to deal with here.  I honestly consider that the time has come to call a halt. The time has arrived when there must be a halt called to this crazy spending and attention directed to the non-provision of essentials by those people who do not care because they knew that the moment the people catch them out they are finished.  These people dare not go to the country to-day. They know that, and therefore the policy is a short life and a merry one.  They do not care what they do with the people they pretend to represent, the people who were foolish enough to vote for them and put them in the position of doing that.  We find ourselves facing a period in which the most extravagant inducements have been held out to the people to spend the money.  The people now find that the essential coal that had been bargained for with Britain is not now available. The Government had £5,000,000 worth of fuel in storage on the day they took over.  They spent the £5,000,000 worth of fuel, and when it was expended they, during the past three years, did not make one single attempt to put in any stock of fuel.  The Minister for Agriculture, I suppose, told them that mother England would supply it all. I suggest that those conditions have gone far enough.  I hope that we will have an opportunity in the near future of discussing in detail some of the matters to which I referred generally <Col N="962" /> to-day.  I hope to have an opportunity, later on, of discussing these matters, but I am very nervous that I will not have that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid that when the time for considering the Estimates arises the Minister will have gone to the country.  I was somewhat amused at some of the daft things that have been done in this country for the last couple of years.  I got a certain amount of amusement out of them. When I go down the country it grieves me when I meet a poor woman who was induced by the flamboyant Minister to invest her little savings in incubators and hoovers only to find herself to-day with a big flock of hungry hens around her looking for milo maize at £29 a ton.  A large number of farmers down in my constituency had an idea that they would be a lot better off when they would have farmers representing them in the Government instead of Fianna Fáil.  Did I ever imagine, during all my 24 years' experience, that I would see repeated in this House the Judas actions by so-called farmers' representatives who preceded the present team?  Did I ever imagine that I would see, within the past five or six months, these gentlemen, who are supposed to be representing the farmers, voting against the farmers getting increases in the price of milk?  It is remarkable the depths to which those gentlemen will sink in their wild endeavour to cling to office.</P>
    <P>Divorce proceedings are in progress on all sides.  Deputy Flanagan wants to become Minister for Lands.  He says that the heavy weight of the present Minister for Lands is preventing any movement in the Land Commission Department.

      <P>Since the Minister for Agriculture is present, I want to call his attention to the actual position of this nation as regards grain.  I want to know from the Minister if he can give any guarantee that grain will be provided or that we can get grain from abroad at any price although no emergency may exist.  The man who is responsible for saying how much grain this country is to get has told the Minister that he could grow and should grow more wheat in this country.  He has told him also that he cannot understand the paying of millions abroad for milo maize and maize without milo at £29 a ton when he could produce barley here.  He has pointed out those facts to the Minister for Agriculture.  That Minister was kind enough to accuse me last night of breaking my word.  I never broke my word to anybody.  How many times has the Minister broken his word to the Irish farmer, the Irish poultry producer and the Irish milk producer in the three years that he has disgraced that position?  Take eggs, oats, barley, wheat, milk&mdash;take the Minister's promises to each of these sections of our agricultural community and take the Minister's description of the travels of our crate of poultry leaving this country for the alternative market that he sneered at when Fianna <Col N="964" /> Fáil were looking for it.  Take also the Minister's reply to my question last week on eggs when he told us that every Ambassador, every representative of ours abroad all round the world was looking for the alternative market for the eggs in respect of which the Minister proudly assured the Irish people he had secured a five years' market from Great Britain.  A five years' guarantee!</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry expresses interest in the probably date of the general election. I should like to inform him&mdash;September, 1952, or January, 1953&mdash;then, and no sooner, save in one event: if you succeed in defeating the Social Security Bill, and you have not got the chance of a snowball in hell, you will have a general election the following <Col N="965" /> morning.  Now Deputy Corry knows and the knowledge drives him from the House life a leaf in autumn.  The Fianna Fáil theme in this debate is that everybody is spending too much money, that improvidence is the order of the day, and I want to direct the attention of farmer Deputies to this, that, under the leadership of Deputy Lemass, the Fianna Fáil case is: &ldquo;The farmers are driving up the cost of living and you have got to smash their prices down.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Some of their jackals are prepared to sell out by trotting after that caravan.  I want to expose that dirty fraud.  It has become the fashion in this country, when you do not like the truth, to take a holiday from reason and just to yell, and, when the futility of your falsehood is revealed and a rational man might be expected to withdraw and express regret, the modern practice is to put your back to the wall and yell a little louder.  Last December, Fianna Fáil determined that it was a good racket to run in this country that the cost of living was going up.  A more disreputable and dishonest racket was never run in this country and I have never seen more persons who I believed to be rational individuals carried away by it in my 30 years' experience of political life. I commend their attention to a pamphlet published by the Cork University Press, entitled &ldquo;The Official Cost-of-Living Index Number and its Critics&rdquo;, by Doctor R.C. Geary, price ?.  If they look at table No. 2, on page 25, after they have read the letterpress, they will find comparisons made between mid-August, 1947, mid-August, 1950, and mid-November, 1950 &mdash;three figures.  The price of shoulder beef in 1947 was 1/9 at mid-August, 1950, ?; and at mid-November, 1950, 1/7½.</P>

      <P>1/7½.  The figures for corned brisket are 1/6½, 1/4¾ and 1/4¾; for neck 1/6, 1/5¼ and 1/5¼; for mutton 2/7½, 2/5¾ and 2/5¾; for neck 1/9¼, 1/8½ and 1/8¼; for fresh herring 9d. per lb., <Col N="966" /> 9d. per lb. and 9d. per lb.; for eggs 3/8, 3/3½ and 3/9; for creamery butter 2/8, 2/8 and 2/8; for cheese 2/1, 2/1¾ and 2/1¾; for margarine 1/6, 1/6 and 1/6; for lard 1/2, 1/2 and 1/2; for bread 6¾d., 6¼d. and 6¼d.; for flour 3/10¼, 2/10¼ and 2/10¼; for potatoes 2/5¼, 2/3¼ and 1/10½; for tea 4/9¾, 2/8 and 2/8; and for sugar 6d., 4d. and 4d.  These figures being ascertainable by any person capable of reading, nevertheless the clamant of propagandists who want to stage a general assault on the price level of agricultural produce have managed to sell to our people the proposition that, in respect of essential foodstuffs, prices have gone sky high, and that people cannot live on the incomes they have at present.  If they look at a corresponding publication which was presented to the House yesterday, dealing with the national income, they will find that every family in Ireland is spending&mdash;if you reduce all to 1938 prices&mdash;substantially more, at 1938 prices, in 1950, than they ever spent in 1938.  The people, my people, whom I am told are being ground into the dirt by the cost of living, are manifestly demonstrated as enjoying a higher standard of living than was ever enjoyed in the whole history of Ireland before, thanks be to God&mdash;and it is the work of this Government that made it possible for the agricultural worker, the worker for wages, the small farmer, the people we used to speak of as the poor, to have a standard of living that they have never had before and that people always said this country could never afford.  We said this country could afford it and we have made it afford it and we glory in the fact that they have so high a standard of living and, with the help of God, it will be higher still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suicidal, however, as we make an ordered progress towards those objectives, for the people on the far side of the House maddened by political disappointments to try to destroy a carefully designed and marshalled line of progress, planned to abolish poverty &mdash;perhaps to abolish riches, too, but to see that all our people in their own country had a chance to live and that the vast discrepancy between the immense wealth of one and the poverty of another would be banished from our <Col N="967" /> community.  Who will deny at this time that throughout rural Ireland there is no unemployment?  When were we able to say that before?  Who will deny that in the memory of any man living in this House the farmers are better off to-day than they ever were before?  Is there anyone to deny it? None, because it is true.  Who will deny this query?  Look round the world &mdash;Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and the continent of America, is there a better country anywhere at the present time for ordinary people to live in than Ireland?  If there is, I do not know of it, and I know a good many countries. It is surprising the number of people from Belgium, Holland, France, America, and Great Britain who appear to share that opinion and who are anxious to be given the opportunity of moving in, sometimes in embarrassing numbers, to take up their residence in a country which the principal political Opposition in this House says is destitute, bankrupt, ruined and a purgatory for anyone to live in.</P>
    <P>What shall we say of a political Party who took this country over and in 15 years handed it back to their successors at the lowest level of destitution to which this country had ever sunk.  The income of farmers had never been lower; the income of agricultural wages was a by-word; emigration was sweeping the people out of the land; the population stood at the lowest figure ever recorded&mdash;when we took office.  I challenge contradiction now that the farmers are better off to-day than they have ever been before; I challenge contradiction that there is less unemployment in Ireland than there has ever been before; and for the first time in this century the population of these Twenty-Six Counties has gone over 3,000,000 and is still rising.  Does anyone challenge those facts?  That is the record, and the only fair test of policy is the result, the only argument valid in debate is fact.  That is all I propose to deal with&mdash;fact.</P>
    <P>Here is the net issue.  Is it desirable to develop our own country or is it not?  With the surplus wealth created here, we can do one of two things&mdash;we can invest it in British Consolidated <Col N="968" /> Stock at 2½ per cent. so that the British can use it to develop their country and their colonies. or we can invest it in our own country so that we may develop our own country, to employ our own people, to increase our own national income to meet the cost of the steadily rising standard of living which we have created for our own people in their own homes.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil's line is: &ldquo;You are spending too much in developing in this country,&rdquo; we will join that issue with them.  That is all right, that is a clear-cut issue.  We say we are not, and we intend to go on, and if it is Fianna Fáil policy to say that we are spending too much on the development of this country and ought to cut it down, that is an issue we will go to the country on with them gladly, and let the people settle it.  This is certain. The people put us in to do a job and we are going to do it and if they put us back in 1952 or 1953 we will go on doing it.  We put our hands to it with our eyes wide open and with certain knowledge of whither we meant to go and we have made more progress along the road which we said we were going to travel in three years than Fianna Fáil made in the opposite direction in 15.  Let us face this fact, that we could not have undertaken this programme, nor would it be physically possible to maintain it if we did not understand what we were doing and if we were not competent to take the measures necessary to avert the dangers attendant on a great policy of expansion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken launched out on his fog-bound course yesterday to deal with the finances of the country and I must say that when old Vesuvius sounded off it was edifying if not clarifying. I remember last year reminding him that in every country town in Ireland two familiar figures are to be seen.  One is the young fellow who has learned his business and has at last attained to his ambition of having a place of his own.  His shop window is bright and cheerful and he is in his shirt sleeves about his business early in the morning to meet his customers with cheerful face, with competent exterior and with optimistic mien.  Not <Col N="969" /> far down the street you will always see the respectable gentleman in the black suit that is turning slightly green and the melancholy walrus moustache which deplores the perturbation caused by the arrival of the impudent brat who has set up his shop five doors up and has presumed to take his customers away from him.  As the blue-bottles gather in his window and the cobwebs shroud his premises, clapping a black bowler turning green upon his head, he moves with gradually increasing frequency to the adjoining public house there to drown his sorrows as his business dwindles.  Whenever Deputy Aiken starts talking of the development of the country, I always think of my old friend in the green-black Sunday suit and the shiny bowler going to drown his sorrows at the neighbouring public house.  The decline is so inevitable that he does not bother to open his shop except on market days and then he only opens a couple of shutters and at last comes the market day when he does not bother to take them down at all.  After a time the old fellow does not bother to take off his carpet slippers, his boots have become broken and he does not get a new pair.  Then he dies and is buried and 18 months later somebody says, &ldquo;Is poor Pat so and so dead?  That is right, I did not see him about for a long time.&rdquo;  The man who was once the centre of his community has gone down until eventually he is a man of such insignificance that nobody notices he is gone. I can say that about Deputy Aiken. He is afraid of his life that the revolutionaries who are abroad now will upset the whole applecart, &ldquo;It is &lsquo;deshthroyed&rsquo;; it is &lsquo;schandalous&rsquo; to be upsetting it and to be thinking of these changes&rdquo; he feels when, in fact, the safety of the dead blue-bottle, the weaving spider, the carpet slipper and the broken boot is so much more comfortable for one who no longer has any desire to live.</P>
    <P>You cannot spend capital on the scale we are spending it on the development of our country without employing men and you cannot have full employment and a rise in the standard of living without coming slap up against the fact that if your own people consume <Col N="970" /> more and want to buy more you export less and import more.  Ireland is a country where if you produce 1,000,000 cwt. of butter and our own people want to eat it, it is no use telling them to ship two-thirds of it abroad and ration themselves because they will not do it.  They will do it in Denmark; the Danes are content with 2½ ounces of butter whereas our people eat 13½ ounces of butter per head per week. That is the present ratio.  But if the Danes do with 2½ ounces of butter they sell their butter abroad and that butter pays for coal and other commodities they want to bring in.  You might imagine that if our people were bent on consuming all of our own produce they would place upon themselves the self-denying ordnance of forgoing imports, so that those goods which they have consumed at home might be paid for.  But that is not their way.  Our people expect to consume all their own production and consume all they can pay for from abroad as well.  Let us face it: that cannot be done unless we are prepared to face the fact that as the standard of living of our people rises we as a people have got to learn the lesson that you cannot have your cake and eat it.  While you do not want the whole machine to burst, there is no need to resort to the antediluvian devices that used to be the golden way of repair though they might create unemployment and crush down the standard of living.  Those methods are as out of date as they were ultimately fantastically ineffective, but you must get your people to the point where instead of spending all the money that comes into their hands now they will put some of it by.  You must get them to acquire the habit of saving.  You must get them to realise in a much shorter time than most people require to learn this lesson that when your standard of living rises it is natural to save.  You must get them to realise that there has been a most dramatic change in the standard of living enjoyed by our people and that whereas in most countries the community is broadly divided into the well-to-do who save and the low wage earner who never saves, we have wrought the extraordinary achievement in Ireland <Col N="971" /> that the whole of our community is moving into the category for which it should be normal to save.  Unless they learn the technique and habit of saving, their very failure could bring disaster on all of us.</P>
    <P>It simply means getting the habit of running savings circles or buying Post Office deposit books&mdash;you do not have to buy them but simply get them&mdash;and realising that saving in itself can be a public service.  I am glad to think that the Minister for Finance will shortly put to the test the public spirit of such organisations as Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the trade unions and any other bodies concerned with the organisation of our people and tell them that they have as grave and urgent a duty at this time to help our people to learn the craft of saving as they have to do any other work which hitherto they have regarded as appropriate to their calling.</P>
    <P>If we can get drawn off the current pool of spendable money a fair margin to be put by for our children and our children's children by prudent parents, then the growing wealth of our people can continue to be a blessing, but so surely as we fail to face that, it could become a devastating catastrophe.  But that is not all we have to do.  That is not all we mean to do.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out, it is not enough to say to the individual that the Minister for Finance and the Government to which he belongs has got to and means to balance the budget.  In that context this Government has wrought something which has continually appeared to me to be in the nature of a miracle.  When we came into office, within three months, the Minister for Finance removed taxes on beer, cinemas and cigarettes, which yielded then a revenue of £7,000,000 a year, and which, were they now in operation, would yield a much larger revenue&mdash;and the following year he took 6d off the income-tax.  Yet so successful has the policy of this Government been that the expanding revenue from the reduced taxes has <Col N="972" /> provided the means to furnish increases to old age pensioners, widows, orphans and the blind, and also an increase in the salary of every public servant of the State.  All that has been done without the imposition of a farthing of the taxes which were taken off when this Government came into office.  That is a breath-taking achievement. If I am right, if all that splendid triumph is to be preserved, now is the time that we must resolve that within existing levels of taxation existing services must hereafter be financed, and that if there be any additions to the public services now provided that addition must carry with it its corresponding tax, and those who do not like the tax must forbear the new provision and those who want the new provision must advocate the tag.</P>
    <P>Lastly, if progress is to be maintained, production must expand.  We have to produce in this country not only all that our own people want but a sufficiency thereof to pay for our imports of coal, oil, tea and the hundred other things without which the standard of living to which our people have grown accustomed cannot be maintained. But we are doing that.  Our butter production has increased phenomenally. I believe there are more cattle in Ireland than there were ever before in recorded time and each one of them is worth more to-day than they were ever known to be worth before.  We have, by the intensification of veterinary services, saved in the last two years over 80,000 calves which must otherwise have died.  As a result of the intensive inoculation of our cattle against contagious abortion, thousands of cows that would give no milk this year and produce no calf this year will produce their calf and fulfil their full lactation.  We propose to build up the pig population to higher numbers than those ever reached before and to feed those pigs on barley, potatoes, fodder-beet and skimmed milk, which does not involve the importation of a £s worth though I am as much in favour than ever I was of the policy of feeding all that the land of this country can produce to live stock and, when all that has been fed, importing as much more and doubling the <Col N="973" /> quantity of live stock and feeding that too.  There are some addle-pated imbeciles in this country who can see the wisdom of bringing in cotton to weave it in Athlone and sell it for three prices to our neighbours in Ireland, but who consider it iniquity to bring in maize which grew in the same field as the cotton and use it for conversion into pigs and bacon on a farm in rural Ireland. If it is no crime to go to the north side of a field and pull the cotton and process it in Athlone, why is it high treason to take maize from the south corner of the same field and bring it to a house a mile outside Athlone and process it into bacon?  The philosopher is silent.</P>

We can sell all the bacon that this country is producing.  We want no tariff.  We want no quota.  We can sell it in competition with any country in the world, and beat their competition and make a profit on it. If we did not do that we could not pay the salaries we at present pay to all the unproductive elements in our society who do not seem to worry about anything else in the world except getting their salaries raised.  It is out of the pigs, eggs, fowl, milk and out of the land that every wage-earner in the country gets paid.  If we ever come to a time when you cannot sell pigs at a profit, or fowl or cattle at a profit let the trade unionists, the national teachers, the professional men, the lawyers and the doctors run for cover because they will lose a large percentage of their remuneration because there will be no funds wherefrom to pay them.  I advise the professional men, and the national teachers especially, to get to their prayers and pray hard that there will <Col N="974" /> be a profitable market for pigs, bacon, turkeys, fowl, eggs, butter, milk, cream and all the other things which we produce on the land for sale abroad because, if there is not, God help the teachers and the professional men.</P>

      <P>There is not the slightest danger of the experiment being made.  But that is not all.  We have to expand not only industries which are carried on on the farms of our people&mdash;we have to increase the industrial processing of materials in the popularly accepted sense of the word.  I think it is of great importance that it should be decentralised and the industry brought to the people rather than the people gathered into a vast caravanserai to serve grouped industry.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of that policy, we have the factory conducted by the firm of Miloko, outside Carrick-on-Suir, which will manufacture more chocolate crumbs from milk produced in that area than was ever produced in Ireland before.  There is the meat-meal factory in Cahir which will process suitable materials to be utilised in the feeding of our live stock.  There is an immense limestone industry springing up all round the country which, consequent on the announcement which I made in the House earlier to-day, will produce all the lime necessary to restore fertility to our soil.  There is an arterial drainage programme proceeding on a scale never before contemplated in this country.  There is also the land project which, in its own way, is an industry.  To date, the land project can boast of having 109,361 acres reclaimed or in process of reclamation. May I ask Deputies to pause for a moment to ask themselves what is the capital value of 109,361 acres of arable land?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably <Col N="975" /> praying very fervently that whatever it at present is, it will long continue to be.  What would he do if it did not? That is not all.  There are parts of this country about which it is probably true to say, in the words of an old friend of mine, that the best service you could do them, if you look at things from a coldly economic point of view, would be to knock down the cliffs and let in the Atlantic to cover these wild parts of the west coast of the country. But the people would not let you.  It does not matter how poor the country is; it does not matter how hard it is the people want to live there and stay there no matter what you say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there are two courses open.  One is to say that if they want to stay there, let them stew in their own juice. The other is to adopt the policy which has been adopted by this Government and to say that if you are going to let them stay there, the Government have a duty, not to turn them into beggars, not to have them turned into dependents on charity, but to do all that human effort can, to create circumstances in those areas which will secure for the people who live there a fair reward for hard work honestly done.  To that end, this Government proposes to carry out the reclamation of every acre in Connemara, from Galway to Oughterard on to Maam and Clifden and back round the coast through Barna into Galway again; on every acre of land where men work, to do reclamation, to generate electricity from the resources there available and supply it to the houses and the people who live there; where necessary to cut turf and use it, to plant forests on the reclaimed land or to divide it amongst those whose present accommodation is insufficient, to organise the fishing industry at Cashla so as to provide those who at the present time are competent to use them, with boats of their own, to provide means for the rest to reacquire the skill of fishing in their own waters from their own homes.  We shall open two mines in the next few months in Connemara, the minerals of which will supply the seriously wanted requirements of this country and highly valued exports to any country in the world of <Col N="976" /> lead, zinc and molybdenum.  I hope that the present system of grinding sea rods and shipping them to Scotland will be brought to an end and that suitable factories can be erected in Connemara to carry out the intermediate stages in producing mannitol and plastics.</P>
    <P>We have already completed the veterinary survey of live stock in the area and carried out the necessary dosage to eliminate cattle disease and we are now returning to estimate the consequences of our work.  We are introducing the Kerry breed of cattle into the area and are providing loans to improve the quality and the quantity of sheep.  There will be made available under the project to anyone who wants to use them, lime or phosphate in the quantity necessary to make the land as fertile as nature will permit. There are available to everybody in the area grants to bring water to their houses, and light, where that is available, to build new piggeries, new fowl houses and new cow byres.  There will be made available at suitable centres in every part of that area at regular intervals, certain markets for the produce of such activities as I have named, with the guarantee that when that produce is brought to the market, there will be somebody there to buy it.  There will be within the reach of everyone in Connemara means to earn his living.  So far as I am concerned, I am convinced that the majority of those who live there will be glad and proud to avail of these means.  For the remainder who are too lazy, and who do not want to avail of the means of living, it is a matter of supreme indifference to me what their ultimate fate may be.  It is not a bad supreme indifference to me what their ultimate fate may be.  It is not a bad programme, to raise the standard of living of our people, to develop the habit of thrift and saving, for the benefit of the individuals engaged in it and for the protection of the community from the inflationary consequences of prosperity uncontrolled, to store up fertility in the land, to encourage rural industry, to build up the parish as the natural unit of rural society and see as a result. a population of 3,000,000 for the first time in the twentieth century in this part of Ireland, and it is still rising.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> It is not a bad record for three years.  It is a record on which I would go to the country to-morrow, next week, next year or at any time.  We are going in October or September, 1952, or January, 1953.  Publicise that story and contradict any part of it you dare.  The more it is told, and the more it is canvassed in the country, the happier we will be to take the verdict of the people upon it.  Get this clear and certain: the road you have seen us travel is the road on which we are going to go all the way to the end.  The results to date, dramatic as they have been, are nothing to what we can achieve in the next two years.  It has meant an abundance of hard work of a nature which Deputies on the opposite side would never understand; but it has been worth it if we can say, as I think we can say now, that there never was less unemployment, that there was never less poverty amongst the people in our towns and that the farmers on the land were never better off.  Finally &mdash;and I think this is perhaps one of the most exciting features of it all&mdash; scan the whole world, America included, and ask yourself if any rational man, knowing Ireland, would choose to make his life elsewhere?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Lenten repast to which we were treated yesterday by the Minister for Finance who placed a very austere collation before the country, the great gargantuan repast which the Minister for Agriculture now threatens to compel us to swallow is likely to have very serious repercussions on our internal arrangements. It really requires a stretch of the imagination to believe that the same buoyant, optimistic and overflowing Minister we have just heard, is really carrying out the same policy as the Minister for Finance who indulged in so many financial maxims yesterday and held up so many warning signals, signposts and so on, to warn us where exactly we are going.  According to the Minister for Agriculture, we need have no care as to where we are going. The road is in front of us.  &ldquo;The Road to the Isles,&rdquo; I suppose, would be an appropriate ballad for us to sing, with the hills of Connemara and the Twelve <Col N="978" /> Pins in the blue distance, and we are off with the Minister for Agriculture. Is it not rather unfortunate that this lyrical romanticism, which characterises the Minister's outburst, cannot be confined to the field where it might be specially appropriate, that is in agriculture&mdash;in the bucolic field which has been the choice of poets and romancers of all ages.  But, why try to extend it into the cost of living for example?</P>
      <P>What would the Minister for Agriculture do if he had not the year 1947? The whole world and the whole era of the great prosperity which we are to see began in 1947.  Last July, when the Labour Court were examining an application for an increase in wages from the turf workers at Clonsast, they gave it as their opinion that there had been an increase in the cost of living between 1947, when the representatives of these workers were previously before them, and July, 1950.  That was before devaluation.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when trying to defend the official contention that there had been no increase in the cost of living, he was driven by the howls of execration, as I might almost describe them, which arose even from his own benches and from his own supporters at his temerity in making such a pronouncement, to try and cover up the position by telling us that since Korea&mdash;of course, since Korea&mdash; the situation had changed.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, as far as I recollect, made no reference whatever in his statement yesterday to the effect of devaluation upon the economy of the State, upon the cost of living or upon our balance of trade.  If the Minister were in the position in which I am now and I were in his position, for example, I do not think he would be quite as silent as he is, but he is now in the position that he has responsibility upon his shoulders, and it is for the House and the country to determine whether he is carrying out that responsibility adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last January, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he recovered from his illness&mdash;I am glad <Col N="979" /> that he has recovered and I hope that he will be back in his old place&mdash;and, when speaking to the Society of Advertising Agents&mdash;they had some function or other&mdash;did he deny, or could he deny in face of the legislation that has been passing through this House, in face of the feeling of public opinion and in face of the situation with which housewives in this city and elsewhere have to contend at the present time, that there had been no increase in the cost of living?  The most that he could say was that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the increases were smaller, and that living costs here had risen, perhaps not as high as elsewhere&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was since last autumn.</P>
    <P>In the document with which the Minister for Agriculture opened his speech to-day, it stopped practically at last autumn&mdash;last November&mdash;and he only took out three figures to suit himself. Surely, if we are going to be honest with the public we have to have regard to the trends.  This document was circulated yesterday.  If the statisticians who compiled it were in a position to give us the full facts in an objective way for the whole of 1950, then, of course, we could discuss this matter on the basis where we could all accept certain principles and certain figures; but it is the height of folly for the Minister for Agriculture to come in here with a document from University College, Cork, dealing with the cost of living up to November, 1950, and to quote three figures&mdash;one in 1947, and two in 1950&mdash;and try to bluff the House and the country into accepting them.  If that is the Minister's sense of responsibility in this matter, if that is the standard by which we are to judge him in regard to all his other statements, then I think it would be very easy for us to come to our own conclusions about it.  He is really a wonder worker.  G.K. Chesterton wrote a number of books about the innocence of Father Brown and the wisdom of Father Brown and so on.  If he were still alive, he would have found scope for his imagination and his genius in the miraculous transformation <Col N="980" /> of the Minister for Agriculture. Hearing the Minister talking about capital investment one has to rub one's eyes to inquire whether really we were dreaming.  Can this be the same figure, this the same personality, this the same eloquent orator who for years on this side of the House denounced the best scheme and asked: &ldquo;Why grow beet in this country when we can import it more cheaply?&rdquo; The whole criterion in his approach to that question was&mdash; let us purchase our sugar in the cheapest market.  That was the extent of his interest in the development of a crop which has been one of the mainstays of the farming community for the past generation in a large part of this State.</P>
    <P>We are not likely to forget his attitude towards wheat, towards turf and towards Rineanna.  He told us that the rabbits would be playing over Rineanna.  It is surely a miraculous transformation that on every single one of these headings the Minister for Agriculture has altered his position.  I do not know whether that is a tribute to the persuasive powers of the more nationally-minded and more common-sense colleagues in the Government and in the Parties that support it, or whether the Minister feels that, even if he were to attain a great measure of the success which he has claimed, even if we were to believe the testimonials he has been giving himself here all the evening, even if we were to take these at the value he placed upon them, he would never succeed in making himself popular among the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the debate has been taken up with references to agricultural policy and it is quite sufficient for anybody who represents a mainly agricultural constituency, as I do, to meet the farming community to know what they feel about the present price of eggs. There is not the slightest doubt but that eggs are going to disappear off the market unless something can be done to increase the price which the farmer gets.  The Minister for Agriculture must think we are very innocent men indeed if we are not able to explain to the public that we dislike very much the increased costs that <Col N="981" /> people have to pay for the necessaries of life which they are unable to meet. He must think we are very innocent if we are not able to reconcile that with the point of view that the producer, wherever he may be, should get an honest and fair return for his produce. Everybody knows that the farming community are not to blame for the high prices which the people have to pay in the retail shops.  Neither can we blame the shopkeepers.  We can blame the system of collection and distribution which adds so much to the primary cost, so that the retail price is very much greater and the margin is difficult to conceive on any reasonable basis.  How we are to get over that situation would take a long time to deal with.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera pointed out, in the course of the debate on the Vote on Account last year, that when the Banking Commission Report was published and when the Government of the day was criticised for repatriating external assets, for their policy in subsidising housing on a generous scale, and for doing other things which they considered necessary in the general interests of the country and which most people would regard as progressive, they received some support from the Fine Gael spokesmen in this House who are now the keystone of the Government. Since then the financial advisers, the members of the Banking Commission who denounced the Government at that time, because denounced is not too severe a term to apply to their pronouncements, have changed their role and have come forward with a policy of investment.  The <Col N="982" /> very same policy of investment through Government boards and State machinery which they condemned in all the moods and tenses they are now advocating strenuously and we gather from the Minister for Finance that their advice has had something to do with this policy of investment which the Government have put before the country.</P>

      <P>According to the Minister for Agriculture the farmers are better off to-day than they ever were. They would feel more secure if the Minister could obtain for them some guarantee that the prices they will receive for their produce will cover the increasing costs they have to bear, if possible over a period of years, and leave them with a profit.  One would imagine that the farmers' position was entirely hopeless until the present Minister for Agriculture took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Table I in the Tables of National Income and Expenditure covering the years 1938-44 to 1950 the income from agriculture, forestry and fishing amounted in the way of profit to £79.5 million in 1945, £76.3 million in 1946, £78.9 million in 1947, £79.7 million in 1948 and £83.3 million in 1949.  It is true that there was an increase in 1949 <Col N="983" /> and in 1950.  In this House and in relation to our national policy we are concerned with the future and, if for a number of years the farming community has done fairly well, nobody is likely to grudge them their good fortune since that is really the result of their own hard work and is due to circumstances over which the Minister for Agriculture, no matter how he may try to pretend otherwise, has really not very much control.</P>
    <P>If we read in the newspapers that for months past the British Government has failed to reach agreement with the Argentine, if we read that the Danes are so dissatisfied with the prices they are getting that they have sent two of the leading members of their Cabinet to London to discuss the matter with the British Government, in the first place we are not likely to agree that the prices we are getting are anything wonderful from the international point of view, and, in the second place, it is likely to strike us very forcibly that this question of the world's food supply is really the kernel of the situation.</P>
    <P>According to a recent interview given by President Péron, the Argentine has arrived at the stage when they do not care a great deal about the disposal of any surplus which, he says, now only amounts to 20 per cent.  That surplus can be canned and sent to Korea.  Owing to the increase in the world's population and the fact that these hitherto pioneer producing countries with their increasing populations are likely to have smaller surpluses in the future, the tide of trade to that extent has turned in our favour; Irish agriculture has at least a better opportunity, an opportunity which I hope will continue, since the war than it had in our time.  However, in this particular repast which has been prepared for us by the Minister for Finance, we have to digest first of all the expenditure and we have to remember that the Book of Estimates shows an increase over the current year's figures of nearly £4,400,000 and over the year 1947&mdash;if the Minister for Agriculture considers is a good datum line as being the last year in which we were <Col N="984" /> in office, I suppose it is not too heretical for me to take it also as a basis of comparison&mdash;the increase amounts to £24,118,000, an increase of more than 40 per cent.  In fact, expenditure is increasing by leaps and bounds.  During the Government's first year in office it went up by £5.78 million; in the second year it went up by a further £8.6 million, while the Estimates for the present year show a still further increase over 1949-50 of £5.35 million. There are some Supplementary Estimates to be added to this year's bill for £83,000,000 and in addition, as has been pointed out, there is a further additional £9,000,000, for Central Fund services.  Therefore, the total figure of expenditure from central Government sources, leaving out capital issues proper, comes to £92,000,000, or over 25 per cent. of our national income; or, if you would like to have it this way, it comes to about £32 per head of the population, which, last year the Minister, if I remember aright, described as being rather on the high side.  He indicated that he was not completely satisfied with it and if he is doing his duty loyally by the taxpayers and the people I do not see how he can be satisfied with it.  If we add to these £92,000,000 the cost of local authority expenditure, say another £30,000,000, and insurance contributions&mdash;one valuable piece of information that we get from the new White Paper on national income and expenditure is that in future insurance contributions are to go into the category of direct taxation &mdash;we need have no hesitation in adding to the £92,000,000, and the £30,000,000 another sum of, say, £4,000,000 for insurance contributions.  Apart from capital issues proper, that will bring the entire bill to about £126,000,000, which I calculate to be 35 per cent. of the national income, or £43 per head of the population.  If you were to take it on the basis of the working population, it would probably be nearly £100 per head.  In that connection we have to remember that the value of the net agricultural output per male engaged was only £229 in 1949.  Even if the figure increased to £250 in 1950, it will be seen that the charges for national and local expenditure and insurance contributions account for a very great <Col N="985" /> proportion of the income from agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to certain trends of an unsatisfactory nature.  He did not refer in sufficiently emphatic terms to the balance of trade position.  He referred to the increased personal expenditure which, he said, was not being covered by savings or earnings&mdash;I think that was the phrase used&mdash;but he could have referred at greater length to the dangerous situation we will be in if we find that drastic changes will have to be made rapidly in our economic arrangements.</P>
    <P>Last year we imported nearly £160,000,000 worth of goods and we exported £70,000,000 worth.  At the same time as we were failing to meet our commitments in that respect, even to the extent of £1 in £2, we were dissipating the external assets about which the Banking Commission were so eloquent in pre-war days.  If they were brought together again, I am sure that they would not at all agree with the Minister for External Affairs who holds himself out as a spokesman with some influence in the Government.  We need not go into the exact question as to whether he is expounding the Government financial policy or Clann na Poblachta financial policy or just some stunt of his own but, at any rate, he wants to get rid of these assets.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, yesterday, referred to the fact that some years ago it was calculated that these assets amounted to £400,000,000.  Against that had to be set £175,000,000 assets held here by foreigners&mdash;I think the Minister gave the figure yesterday&mdash; which reduced the figure for our external assets to £225,000,000.  That was in 1945.  That is not a very great figure.  If we proceed to liquidate those assets at the rate of £30,000,000 a year, in spite of our strong position as a creditor nation and the excellent state of our national credit, to which the Minister for Finance has called attention, we might find ourselves in the position of the New Zealanders who, before the war, had a primary producing country, but who got into serious difficulties and, having <Col N="986" /> expended all their external assets, had to come to London, cap in hand, asking <i>ad misericordiam</i>, for the best terms they could get.  Perhaps that is a very far fetched idea but it is one that comes to mind when one sees the Minister for External Affairs campaigning the country about the repatriation of our assets, when one realises that if the present trend were to continue those assets would disappear in a fairly short period of years and when one realises that we are piling up a debt, not perhaps very significant, but still a debt, to the United States of America and putting ourselves in the position that, through American credit, we have to get certain articles which, if we were told we would have to do without, would place us in a very uncomfortable position, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>We have to consider these matters. The Minister has merely expressed the usual regret, the usual pious aspirations one hears from Ministers for Finance.  If their advisers were not industrious in keeping these matters before their eyes, they might omit all reference to them.</P>
    <P>Let us take the matter of the investment policy which we hear so much about.  In 1945 we spent £226,000,000 on consumer goods and services.  We are now spending £342,000,000.  That is an increase of 50 per cent.  Tables 3 and 4 deal with capital formation.  I presume that that represents capital formation within Government schemes, to a very large extent.  Unfortunately there are no figures showing the extent of private capital issues or private capital investment.  Without wishing to throw too heavy a burden on the excellent investigators who have prepared this splendid document, I would suggest that, just as personal expenditure can be divided into necessary and unnecessary expenditure, the figures for capital investment could be divided into investment in Government-directed schemes and investment in schemes for which private enterprise is responsible. In that way we would get a better picture.  I venture to say, on the figures given here, that such segregation would not make the situation <Col N="987" /> appear more favourable.  Last year we expended £30,000,000 on imports and in preceding years we expended £60,000,000.  That is a total of £90,000,000 up to the present out of the £225,000,000 that I have referred to.  Of the total net national income, the figures for capital formation come to about 19 per cent. in 1947, 14 per cent. in 1948, 13.7 per cent. in 1949, and 12 per cent. in 1950.  That 12 per cent., apart from the fact that it is a smaller percentage than in the preceding years, has to be considered from this aspect, that during 1950 we had devaluation. We are paying far more for our imports of producer goods, and, therefore, the 12 per cent. of our national income that we spend on capital formation represents probably a substantially smaller volume of these goods.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have savings. The Minister for Agriculture has referred to savings.  It seems incongruous that we should be liquidating our resources on the one hand without assuring ourselves that the realisation of our resources, in the shape of external assets, is going to come here in the form of capital goods&mdash;if possible, goods that will in themselves add, when put into production, to the future wealth of the country.  It seems extraordinary that we should be asking for savings if we are not able to assure ourselves that as far as possible that process in which the Government can exercise a great deal of control&mdash;as the assets which are now being realised, the securities, come largely from Government funds&mdash;will not be pursued unless they are satisfied that the capital structure of the country and our productive powers are going to benefit.</P>
    <P>This is not a Fortunatus purse that we are dealing with, as the Minister for Agriculture might lead the uninformed to believe, Marshall Aid, external assets, liquidation and all the rest of it notwithstanding.  All Government borrowing put on one side, in the long run the taxpayer has to pay the piper. If he does not pay it by meeting all the expenditure from current revenue, he will later on have to meet it from very substantial charges which he will <Col N="988" /> have to bear in the shape of interest and sinking fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs attacked the banking institutions of this country.  He has done so on more than one occasion.  He claimed that his reason for criticising them so severely was that they failed to give credit in 1948.  If they failed to give credit in 1948, perhaps they had some reason on their side.  I am not in a position to enter into the merits of the case; I simply want to say that at the end of 1947, when we introduced the emergency Budget, not alone were we threatened with inflation, but the United States of America were also faced with it.  Their President announced his fears in that respect, that there would be such a wave of inflation as would destroy the hope of prosperity He made that statement towards the end of 1947.</P>
    <P>Whether the position had changed so completely in 1948, or whether the general situation of the banks permitted them to adopt a more generous policy, I cannot say.  I know hardships were suffered, but I think on balance there was an inflationary situation there.  Some of the inflationary taxes that we put on, the Minister has up to the present refused to remove.  Whether that is a recognition of the fact that the inflationary situation is still there, it is for him to say, but it is quite clear from his statement yesterday that this inflation bogey has not been laid.  He cannot deny that with the amount of labour in the country limited, particularly skilled labour, it means that not alone in relation to housing, but in rural areas generally, even if you have a certain supply of labour, you will not be able to get the necessary labour for all the different schemes if you are trying to do road work, land drainage, land rehabilitation, turf development, local authorities' works schemes and so on.</P>
    <P>What is forgotten in this pontificating about finances is that you can provide colossal sums for investment, but unless you have the organisation there a great deal of waste, to put it mildly, is likely to occur.  Moreover, not enough is being done to provide <Col N="989" /> trained personnel.  There is a shortage of skilled labour, a shortage of supervisory grades.  There is probably a shortage of scientific workers in our industries and in our agriculture. When the Minister says&mdash;I do not agree with him&mdash;that the increases in the Book of Estimates are due to education increases very substantially, I would like to say that I hope due cognisance will be given to the importance of training skilled workers and skilled executives.</P>
    <P>A prominent Dublin citizen who has given a great deal of attention to and studied closely this matter of our economic and financial position, made a statement recently to the effect that we would do well if we devoted more attention to our education.  I think so far as our primary and secondary schools are concerned they are doing excellent work, but I feel that so far as our apprenticeship schemes and our vocational schools and our technical institutes are concerned, we ought to do a great deal more.  If we do, then the capital investment policy which the Government have in mind will proceed in the hands of Irishmen who will know they are working for their own country and who will be able to place their talents and their industry at Ireland's disposal.  Moreover, they will have knowledge of the local circumstances and it will be an economy as well as rendering greater efficiency to the community in the long run.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Vote on Account yesterday, the Minister for Finance made a speech which, in my opinion, deserved more careful attention than it received in the course of this debate.  I think that his introduction to this colossal estimate of national expenditure stressed very strongly the fact that this country is facing a very dangerous economic and financial situation. Anybody listening to either Deputy O'Higgins yesterday or the Minister for Agriculture to-day would have been inclined to think that no such announcement was made by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance very properly drew attention to the fact that this country is liquidating too repidly her external assets <Col N="990" /> without creating internal reproductive assets.  He emphasised that the balance of trade has turned sharply against us in the past year and that the nett result is we must either consume our external assets or continue to sink into debt to the U.S.A. in respect of dollars.</P>
      <P>Our national debt has grown rapidly during the past three years and our dollar debt to the U.S.A. has increased with even greater rapidity.  At the same time, we have very drastically reduced our sterling assets.  What have we to show in exchange for this rapid eating into our resources?  What vast schemes of development have we undertaken during the past three or four years which would offset the rising burden of national debt and the reduction in our assets abroad?  I fail to see anything of sufficient magnitude to justify this deterioration in our economic and financial position.  At the same time, I fail to see any real justification for the steady and rapid rise in national expenditure each year.  If we look back over the Estimates, we will find that there is a steady upward trend in national expenditure.  It is £5,000,000 more this year than last year.  I think it was £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 more the year before and so on.  Each year, the burden of expenditure continues to increase and the ordinary taxpayer is entitled to ask when will the limit be reached or will it ever be reached.  Is there any ceiling beyond which the State will not go in wasting and squandering the people's money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that all those facts were stressed in the introduction of the Vote of Account by the Minister for Finance. I think they do not and have not received sufficient attention from the House.  The Minister for Agriculture has a tendency to talk about dirty rackets whenever he is challenged to justify any action of his, such as in the case of the cruelty to horses and matters of that kind.  I think the dirtiest racket in this country is the political racket&mdash;the attempt on both sides of the House to make political capital out of everything that happens whether it be a fortunate circumstance to the country or a disastrous one.  If there is a fortunate circumstance, such <Col N="991" /> as exceptionally good weather for an agricultural country, that is treated by the Government as something which is directly attributable to the wisdom, knowledge and foresight of the Government. If there is a disastrous circumstance, there is a tendency on the part of the Opposition to put the blame for that on the Government.  Deputies of this House, irrespective of what Party to which they belong, ought to begin to assume some sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>This downward trend in our national resources, this upward trend in our public expenditure and the upward trend in the expenditure on non-essentials by our people, must be curtailed. While we imported £160,000,000 worth of goods last year we only exported about £70,000,000 or £80,000,000 worth.  When we look at the details of those vast imports, we are inclined to ask could we not have eliminated or reduced some of them.  Was it absolutely necessary for an agricultural country to spend over £2,000,000 last year on the importation of sugar? Would not the exercise of a little more foresight, together with an earnest effort to promote home production, have eliminated that unnecessary import?</P>
    <P>I was severely criticised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last year when I referred to some of our imported sugar as having the appearance of being swept off a dirty road.  I say that a very large portion of the imports, particularly agricultural imports and imports of an agricultural origin, were immensely inferior to our own native production.  The imported sugar could not compare in any way with the sugar produced in our country.  Nevertheless, we spent over £2,000,000 to supplement our home production.</P>
    <P>Apart from what we could produce here, I have a strong feeling that we are importing too large a volume of luxury and semi-luxury products from other countries.  Those products imported into this country and consumed will not strengthen our national economy in the difficult years that lie ahead.  They will add nothing to our <Col N="992" /> resources.  It would seem that the policy of the Government at the moment is to eat, drink and be merry.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to start teaching the Minister his business as Minister.  I am drawing attention to the fact that this little country is spending far too much on imported luxuries and I think that is a dangerous trend in the grave situation facing us. We should be aiming at importing raw materials and machinery and equipment for the development of our native industries on the largest possible scale and not flittering way all our resources, all our external assets, upon imported luxuries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not being done on anything like the scale necessary, if this country is to survive.  The Minister can go down the list of goods being imported and he will see for himself how few of them will contribute in any way to increasing internal production and how few of them constitute machinery and equipment or raw material for the development of essential industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant in this connection that one of the most drastic&mdash;perhaps the only drastic&mdash;economy that has has been effected in the Estimate for the coming year has been effected at the expense of agriculture.  For the past three years, the joke, if you like <Col N="993" /> to call it a joke, though it is a sorry joke, has been sold to the public that the farmer was getting £40,000,000 for land rehabilitation.  This sum was supposed to come to the farmer in the course of ten years.  Yet we find that for the first year in which the scheme was in operation less than £1,000,000 were voted; for the second year, £3,000,000&mdash;but we do not know how much was spent&mdash;and for the present year less than £2,500,000 is being provided. Somebody has to refute the contention of the Minister for Agriculture that £40,000,000 are to be spent in ten years on land rehabilitation.  At the present rate of £2,500,000, £25,000,000 would be the limit expended in ten years.  It is interesting to ask why this drastic reduction was decided upon.  One could understand the spending of only £1,000,000 in the first year because there was development work to be undertaken and the scheme had to be built up and one could even understand our being £1,000,000 short of the target of £4,000,000 per year in the second year, but it is very difficult to find any explanation for the reduction this year of £1,500,000.</P>

I should like to say as a Deputy that the House is establishing a very dangerous precedent if a Minister is to be allowed to evade a parliamentary question by declaring that, after a time, a statement will be issued in regard to the particular matter.

I want to continue on the line which I have been endeavouring to develop, that is, that we are not doing all we can do to develop this country during what may be only a short period left to us to undertake the work.  It is possible <Col N="995" /> that world conditions may be such that it will be very hard to undertake any type of development work. In the event of war, there is very little a nation can do except barely manage to survive.  There may be one year, maybe two years&mdash;there may perhaps be more&mdash;left in which to build up and strengthen our economy and it is rather strange that in one line of development which was very strongly boosted there has been a falling off rather than an expansion.</P>
      <P>I asked a question the other day with regard to the fuel situation.  In a nation such as ours, with limited resources, fule is an all-important consideration.

For the whole 2,100 I hope that in a very short time it will be possible for the Department to communicate to each one a simple statement not only of the scheme itself but of the way in which each, in his individual circumstances, would be affected financially if he desires to come in.  I hope the Department will <Col N="996" /> be able to let every eligible secondary teacher in the country know what it would cost him to come in and gain the advantages of this scheme.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to say a word regarding the principle of the scheme, which would be the basis of the amended scheme.  The principal scheme was introduced in 1929 and catered for two main bodies of secondary teachers, the first being existing recognised teachers who were in service on the appointed day, the 1st August, 1929, and the second being those called &ldquo;future teachers&rdquo;, those who entered the service after that date.  An existing recognised teacher was then required to apply for membership on or before 30th April, 1930, but in special circumstances that date could have been extended.  A &ldquo;future teacher&rdquo; had to make application within 15 months of the date from which he desired his contributing service to begin.  In respect of service on and after the appointed day, all members were required to make a contribution of 4 per cent. of the standard salary and the schools were required to contribute 2½ per cent. of each member's basic salary.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to be clear that the salary of a recognised secondary teacher is made up of a basic portion and an incremental portion.  The basic portion is a minimum payment made to the teacher by the schools, of £200 a year minimum in the case of a man and £180 in the case of a woman.  The incremental portion consists of the additional annual increments paid by the State by way of increment pure and simple and the payment made to the secondary teacher who has an honours degree or who is doing teaching through the medium of Irish, for which an additional payment is made.  Therefore, a standard salary consists of the basic and the incremental, and the incremental consists of pure increment and the amount paid in respect of the honours degree and teaching through Irish.</P>
    <P>On the salary, then, the schools paid, in respect of a teacher who joined the scheme, 2½ per cent. on the basic portion of his salary, that is, the £180 for a woman or £200 for a man, and the <Col N="997" /> teacher paid 4 per cent. both on the basic and on the incremental parts. But in respect of service before 1st August, 1929, that service was non-contributing service.  In respect of the payments so made, the benefits were as follows, that is, the benefits which exist to-day under the principal scheme and subsequent amendments.  First, there was a retirement pension.  That was calculated on pensionable salary, at 1/100th for each year of non-contributing service&mdash;that is, service before 1st August, 1929&mdash;and an additional 1/80th for each year of contributing service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.  Secondly, there was a disability pension, which was payable after service of not less than 10 years. It was on the same basis as the retirement pension.  In the third place, there was a death gratuity, which consisted merely of a refund of the member's contributions that had been paid up to date, plus compound interest calculated on those payments at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum.  There was a fourth payment, a short service gratuity, which consisted merely of a refund of contributions made by the member who left the service without qualifying for pension or any other benefit.  That refund of pension in respect of short service gratuity was paid without any addition by way of interest.  These, therefore, are the benefits which exist at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The amendment scheme proposes additional new benefits, which I will enumerate.  First, the retiring pension under the new scheme will be on the same basis as the pension hitherto. There is no change there.  The second benefit is a lump sum payment on retirement. This is a new benefit.  A lump sum will be paid on retirement on pension and will be based on the pensionable salary and calculated at the rate of 1/30th for each year of gratuity service subsequent to the 31st July, 1929.  A member who has paid the additional contributions in respect of his service since that date will have his non-contributing service reckoned for gratuity purposes at a rate of 1/60th for each year of it.  The third benefit under the amendment scheme is a death gratuity.  This, to a certain extent, is a new benefit.  I said that the <Col N="998" /> old death gratuity consisted simply of the refund of the contributions paid up, plus 3 per cent. compound interest. The new gratuity is entirely different. If a member dies while in the service, his legal personal representative will be paid one year's pensionable salary, or a sum based upon the gratuity service, whichever is the greater.  It will be a year's pensionable salary at least, but if his gratuity service is more than 30 years, the legal personal representative will be entitled to 1/30th of the pensionable service for 34 or 35 years, or for whatever number of years the gratuity service may be.</P>
    <P>The fourth benefit is a disablement gratuity.  This is an improved gratuity. Under the scheme as it exists at present, a disablement pension is payable only after ten years' service.  The new scheme for disablement pensions will involve a member whose approved teaching service which is reckonable for pension is less than ten years; he may receive for each year of gratuity service a disablement gratuity on retirement equal to 1/12th of his pensionable salary.  This is in addition to any lump sum earned.</P>
    <P>The fifth benefit is a marriage gratuity for women teachers only, based on the pensionable salary and calculated at the rate of 1/12th for each year of gratuity service subject to a minimum of six and a maximum of 12 years.  That means that a woman who has at least six years' service will get a gratuity on marriage of 1/12th for each year of service, the maximum payment which may be made in the case of retirement in such circumstances being one full year's salary.</P>
    <P>Next is the short service gratuity which will be the same as it is at the present time.  Where a person leaves the service without qualifying for pension or other benefits, that member will have his or her contribution refunded but without any addition by way of interest.</P>
    <P>The amendment scheme as outlined involves the recasting of the contributions. It is proposed with regard to contributions that all existing members who wish to benefit under the <Col N="999" /> terms of this amendment scheme will be required to pay as from the 1st August, 1950, a current contribution of 5 per cent. of the standard salary and they may opt to have their service prior to that date reckoned for gratuity purposes and in that case they will be required to pay in respect of each year of contributing service that they desire to have so reckoned, an additional contribution equal to 1½ per cent. of standard salary in the school year 1950-51. Deputies will remember that teachers at the present time pay 4 per cent. on their basic and incremental salary, that is their standard salary.  In future, they will pay 5 per cent.  If they wish to have their previous service reckoned for gratuity service they will have to pay in respect of whatever number of years they wish to bring into their gratuity services 1½ per cent., the payment being based on the standard salary in the school year 1950-51.  That is with regard to existing members. An existing member who did not become a member upon the first date on which he was eligible to do so, may have his service antedated for pension purposes on payment for each year of his antedated service of a contribution equal to 6½ per cent. of his basic salary and 4 per cent. of his incremental salary during each such year with compound interest added at the rate of 1½ per cent.  Such antedated service may also be reckoned for gratuity purposes on payment of an additional contribution of 1½ per cent.  The scheme of contributions, as I have indicated, is that the teachers pay certain contributions on the whole of their salaries and the school pays 2½ per cent. on their basic salaries.  If any of the existing members of the pension scheme wish to bring in more of their service than they have already brought into the pension scheme, they will be required to pay the whole of the back payment that they would normally have paid to keep them in the pension scheme and if they wish additional years like that to be reckoned as years entitling them to gratuities they will have to pay the 1½ per cent. as well.</P>
    <P>With regard to teachers who are nonmembers at the present time, all recognised teachers who have not <Col N="1000" /> hitherto joined the scheme are now given the opportunity of doing so subject to their paying from the 1st August, 1950, a current contribution of 5 per cent. and paying arrears of contribution on the same basis as those payable for antedated service.  They may also qualify for gratuities for pre- 1st of August, 1950, service on payment of 1½ per cent.  In addition it is provided that members who retire between the 1st January, 1950, and the 31st July, 1950, will be treated as if they had been in approved teaching service on the 1st August, 1950, and exercised the options necessary to benefit under the scheme. Members who died between the 1st January, 1950, and the 31st July, 1951, unless they have indicated previously that they do not wish to contribute towards the gratuities, will be treated in the same way.  They will be given the benefit of the scheme.</P>
    <P>A period not exceeding five years from the 31st July, 1951, will be allowed for the payment of arrears and in the event of the death or enforced retirement of a member before he had paid the total amount of his arrears the amount outstanding will be deducted from the gratuity or pension payable.</P>
    <P>By reason of the plans to enable not only serving teachers but teachers who are not under the scheme to come in and get benefit for previous service, the scheme seems rather complicated, but I hope that it will be possible in a very short time to inform directly from the Department every teacher eligible to come under the scheme or affected by it of the implications of the scheme and what are the opportunities involved for them individually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I should like to mention concerns the marriage bonus for women teachers.  One of the conditions governing the granting of this marriage bonus or gratuity is that the teacher will subsequently be ineligible to enter approved teaching service unless she becomes a widow in which case her service prior to her marriage will reckon for pension purposes only if she repays to the pension fund her marriage gratuity plus the compound interest thereon at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum.  Widows are being excluded.  Suppose, then, that a woman teacher has paid, over a certain number of years' service, towards her marriage gratuity.  She gets married and leaves the service.  If she is not a widow she will not be allowed back unless she is a person who had not already been in this scheme.  If the woman teacher had not already been in this scheme, although she might have been teaching for years, I understand she can go back into it.  But those who have been in the scheme and who have been paid this marriage gratuity, no matter what their circumstances may become afterwards, are ineligible to become members of this scheme again unless they are widows.  Widows are very valuable in this country.  I have heard a discussion as to whether a widow between a certain date under a certain measure is not going to be more valuable than a widow after a particular date.  But is it not possible for the case to arise that a teacher may be placed in circumstances that her husband may not be able to contribute to her support?  For example, he may be delicate or he may even have taken his leave of her altogether. I understand that unless the teacher is a widow, no matter what the circumstances are, she is not allowed into this scheme.  If the reason for that is that she has already got her gratuity, I think the point is of some substance <Col N="1002" /> that she would have been teaching for a period of years before she could have got her gratuity.  With the number of social welfare and social insurance schemes&mdash;if it is a financial question that is at issue here&mdash;and considering that the number is not very great, the Minister should explain to us why he feels it is necessary to insist on this. If you are placing a certain disability on a certain class of teacher in regard to employment, on a certain type of citizen, and as the State has no control over these schools, it might be argued that you are interfering to some extent with the discretion of the managers who are willing to appoint such teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point which affects a larger number of teachers is the question of retrospective payment.  Over a certain period since 1929 teachers are expected to pay an additional contribution towards the gratuity which this scheme will confer upon its members. The Minister tells me that he is unable to state what it would cost the State if they relieved the teachers completely from this retrospective payment.  The secondary teachers feel that it places them in rather an unfavourable position in comparison with other bodies of public servants.  For example, I think a gratuity is payable to employees of Córas lompair Éireann and I do not think that, under other schemes which we shall hear a lot about in the near future, there was any question of retrospective payment for retiring. Whatever stage you have reached in the service, you pay the appropriate contribution from that period on.  You may not even do that.  You might get off lighter because you have a shorter time to go than the new entrant into the service.  There is generally a flat rate and all have to pay the same in order to get a particular benefit.  In this case the teachers who are in the service over a long period are being asked to pay this 1½ per cent. per annum.  Their salaries are now, perhaps, not ungenerous&mdash;I will not say that they are too generous&mdash;but this would impose a heavy burden on a teacher who would have to pay since 1929.  It is calculated that they would have to pay, if it were a five-year <Col N="1003" /> period, up to about £45 a year on a five-year basis.  If they have to pay any less, it would be much greater. The teachers have been granted increases and in a favourable case the increase might amount to £50 or £55. Take, for example, a man who had a long period in the service.  If, during the next five years, over the five-year period, he had to pay at the rate of £45 a year for this retrospective payment he would be paying nearly £240 altogether and the equivalent of his increase would practically be wiped out.  I take it that the five-year period will apply&mdash;or will it be extended on application?  If it is only a three-year period, of course, the burden would be much greater.  Did I understand the Minister to say that it would be for five years or for three years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Five years.  It is worked generally on a five-year basis. There may be cases in which the five years will not be available but that would be in respect of people who are close to the time of getting their gratuity.  Any amount overdue could be deducted from the gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of estimate is the salary as paid in the present year. If the present scheme of salaries had been in operation since 1929 the teacher would have got the benefit which the scheme will now give him at a much lower figure, and future teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought not to confuse the pension payment with the gratuity payment.  Where there are arrears in respect of the pension payment they will be paid on the basis of the salary actually paid at the time.  The only thing charged on the basis of the 1950-51 year is the 1½ per cent. in respect of the gratuity.  That is worked out on an actuarial approach to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that the teachers will say that the teacher who is now young in the service and who has 40 years before him on the higher salary will have to pay substantially less than they would have had to pay if this scheme were in operation since 1929. <Col N="1004" /> They claim that the future teacher would pay really £120 less and that, in fact, men on the maximum, if the present scheme had come into operation in 1929 would have contributed only £150 in 21 years, whereas it might now go up to about £235, plus £225 for the 19 years that are to go.  These are the figures with which I have been supplied, anyway.  A £150 contribution would have given a man on the maximum the entitlement to this retirement gratuity if the scheme had been in operation in 1929.  That is what he would have paid over the 21 years. The man who comes into this category of retrospective payment will have to pay roughly £235, if we take him as being at the maximum in 1929 and he will have to pay £225 for the 19 years he has to serve &mdash; that is £460 altogether, while the teacher who would now be going into the service and who would serve for 40 years would not have to pay, even if he were a married man, more than £238.</P>
      <P>The general claim is that the amount of the retrospective payment cannot be so substantial from the State point of view that to wipe it out altogether would involve any problem for the Minister for Finance, whereas if those teachers who were teaching before 1929 have to pay at the rate of £40 or £50 a year, it will be a serious burden upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point is with regard to the basis of calculation.  The Minister in the course of his statement referred to a teacher drawing his retirement gratuity at the end of 35 years' service.  I presume that the basis of this scheme is that those who become members will be entitled to get full benefit at the end of the period of contribution. Apparently, a secondary teacher could not get the full benefit because it is almost impossible for him to have the full period of service.  He cannot start teaching, under the rules, before 21. He has to retire at 65, but in actual fact, I understand that 25 would be the average age for a teacher entering the service, and some do not enter until they are 30, so that to get the full benefit of the Minister's scheme he would have to have 45 years' service, and that would be quite impossible. <Col N="1005" /> The teachers' suggestion is&mdash;I understand from the Minister that apparently he does not agree with them&mdash; that in view of the fact that they do not start teaching until they are at least 23 or possibly 25, that 42 years' service would be the maximum, and that on that basis 1/28th instead of 1/30th should be the amount they would be asked for.  If the fact is that this is based on a theory of 45 years' service, and if a teacher cannot give 45 years' service, then there seems to be a strong case for altering the basis from 30 to another figure, and taking whatever maximum period of service a teacher can give after he has gone through his university course.</P>
    <P>If it had been possible to put in amendments to the scheme to try and improve matters under these three headings I would have done so.  I should like to know from the Minister whether the burden that would have been put on the State, if the teachers' wishes in this matter had been entirely conceded, would have been so great that it would have been impossible to give way to them.  I should also like to ask him whether the marriage gratuity given to teachers will be less favourable than that of civil servants.  All these benefits, of course, are given to civil servants and as regards the retiring gratuity, I think that primary teachers got that since the beginning of the present year without any retrospective payment of any kind.  The vocational teachers, I think the secondary teachers can claim, are doing better than they are.  There is no body of public servants doing more splendid work for the country than the secondary teachers.  The basis of our cultural and intellectual life and of our higher education rests upon their work.  I would ask the Minister to consider sympathetically, before the scheme goes through the Oireachtas, whether he could not endeavour to meet them on the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>What strikes me in connection with this scheme is the lack of uniformity which is suggested in the different branches of education on the matter of superannuation.  I am sure the members of the House will be surprised to learn for the first time <Col N="1006" /> that the secondary teachers are called upon not alone to pay a contribution in the matter of superannuation, but a very heavy contribution indeed.  At this stage I should like to ask was this particular scheme negotiated with the organisation which represents secondary teachers?  I think it would interest members of the House if we had some statement of that kind because there are certain features in the scheme which suggest hardship. Would the Minister say if the organisation concerned did, in fact, have an opportunity of considering the matter with the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would.  It would not be fair to say that this scheme is accepted by the representatives of the secondary teachers, but it is a fact that there are certain things in this scheme which they did not approve of but wanted to have otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation.  Again I say that the hardship that suggests itself to me is this question of retrospective payment in connection with the gratuity. There are other branches of the teaching profession who are not called upon to make any direct contribution towards their pensions.  In the case of the secondary teachers as I have indicated, they are called upon to pay a heavy contribution and they are apparently prepared to do so.  In addition, they are prepared to pay for the new benefit which is incorporated in the scheme&mdash;that is the question of the gratuity which is to be payable to secondary teachers as in the case of primary teachers in future.  The secondary teachers, I understand, are prepared to make their contributions towards their pensions and a substantial contribution towards their gratuities in future.  I understand that they strenuously object to be called upon to make payments retrospectively in respect of the gratuity.  As was pointed <Col N="1007" /> out by Deputy Derrig, if a man on the top of his scale wants to make his contribution over the next three years in respect of the gratuity which is in arrears he will have to contribute something like £235.  I understand that what that will mean, in fact, is that the increase which was recently granted to a secondary teacher will have been not only nullified but will leave the teacher in a worse position, over the three years, than he had been in prior to getting that increase.  If it is spread over a period of five years then I understand it will mean that over that period a teacher who is at his maximum will have virtually no increase in his salary because of the payments he will have to make.</P>
      <P>The House would be interested to know from the Minister what is the amount involved in the retrospective payments in connection with this scheme.  Will the Minister say if it is serious?  If it is not, I suggest to the Minister that the House would like him to consider the removal of this question of retrospective payment.  Undoubtedly, it will be a hardship, so far as these men are concerned, over the next three, four, or five years.  That is one point in this scheme which certainly makes no appeal to me.  I understand it is the cause of dissatisfaction so far as the teachers themselves are concerned.</P>
      <P>There is the added fact, I understand, that the scheme was introduced actuarially.  If I understood the Minister aright, the basis of computation in respect of this retrospective gratuity is the salary payable in 1950 and 1951. Therefore, teachers can be called upon to pay the arrears on a salary which, in fact, they had not received at all. That surely seems to be a hardship, but that is the case which has been put to me and to other members of the House.  If the Minister could give us information as to the amount involved, we ourselves could form an idea as to whether it would be possible to remove the retrospective payment. I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position under that heading.</P>

      <P>I was hoping that <Col N="1008" /> this matter would not be completed this evening.  This scheme, which is rather involved, has been sent to every member of the House.  To me, at least, it appears to be involved, and at the moment I am actually taking certain opinions and advice in regard to it. Rather than waste a quarter of an hour in keeping the debate going, I suggest to the Minister that he should agree to adjourn this matter to another day. I certainly would like to make a reasoned contribution on the scheme. I have not had an opportunity of examining it in all its implications.  I feel that before agreeing to it the points of view that should be expressed on behalf of the secondary teachers should be expressed and placed on record.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to permit this debate to be adjourned.  He will understand that Deputies have only had this complicated scheme in their hands for a few days.  I would ask the Minister if he would be agreeable to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a scheme which has been the subject of deep consultation between the A.S.T.I. and myself on the one hand and between the Department of Finance and myself on the other.  The various points suggested here by Deputy Derrig have been very fully considered.  I have looked at the various things that could be said on both sides and, after a full and thorough discussion with the Minister for Finance in reference to the financial and other implications that are involved, I have not been able to get a scheme better than this put together.  I think it is very important for secondary teachers, at any rate for those who have retired since the 1st January, 1950, and those who will retire in the immediate future, that they would have an opportunity of getting some kind of a retiring gratuity when they go out.  I think that to hold up the present scheme for the purpose of having it re-examined to get such advice as we might be offered in Parliament would only involve delay.  After the discussions and consideration which I have given the matter myself, I could not advise the House that, to do that, would bring us any nearer to a solution of <Col N="1009" /> some of the questions which have been raised here.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputies to allow this scheme to go through.  It will help to remedy and to effect some things that have an immediate importance for a large number of teachers.  If the House wants to face up to the question of providing secondary teachers with a non-contributory scheme, then that will have to be approached in a very different way.  When the national teachers' pension fund was done away with and they were given their non-contributory pensions, that had certain reactions and on the salaries fixed for them at that particular time.  I think Deputy O'Sullivan knows that vocational teachers make a contribution of 5 per cent. from their salaries in respect of pension gratuity, and that they get no credit for any time in the past during which they had been employed temporarily or, at any rate, in a non-recognisable pensionable way. So that there are incongruities, if you like, here and there.  As I have said, the vocational teachers do make a contribution. The secondary teachers have a scheme traditionally based on particular lines.  This scheme introduces a considerable amount of improvement and there is no back payment that does not give a fairly substantial resulting benefit to anybody who comes under the scheme.  I realise that I am just answering a question which the Deputy put to me as to whether we could drop this thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>I did not put it in that way.  What I asked the Minister was this.  The position of Deputies is that they either approve of or reject the scheme; we have no power of amendment.  But the matter is rather involved, and, in view of the fact that Deputies have not had sufficient opportunity to examine the scheme and make, what one should make in a case of this kind, a reasoned and constructive case in regard to it, I was asking the Minister before I spoke at all in the matter to agree to adjourn the debate at this stage.  It will not take very long, I am sure, on a future occasion, but I certainly should like an opportunity of making a reasoned and <Col N="1010" /> constructive statement in regard to the scheme, and I cannot do that now.  I understand the position is that the House resumes the debate on the Vote on Account at 8 o'clock.  Naturally, I am so keen on putting forward the suggestions that I know will be made to me that I could talk until 8 o'clock.</P>

If we could arrange to have time, say, on Tuesday, if we are meeting on Tuesday next, or Wednesday, if we are meeting on Wednesday next, to conclude this matter, I certainly would be very glad that all the members of the House who want to speak on this subject should have an opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress on the last occasion I was directing the attention of the Minister to the position of certain officers whom a predecessor of his during the discussion on the 1923 Act described as the pioneers of the District Courts.  I should like to urge upon him, that, where these people are involved, he should deem what has been termed their part-time service prior to 1926 as full-time service for the purpose of assessing what pension they would be entitled to.  It is not a very excessive demand on either the Minister's sympathy or, ultimately, on the Exchequer that these pioneers of this new type of court should get the fullest recognition possible of their services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments which were put down to this section were, as many of us anticipated, ruled out of order.  The Chair, however, has been good enough to let us discuss the purport of these amendments on the section.  The first matter I should like to refer to is that a distinction is created for the purposes of this Bill between part-time and whole-time officials.  In order to qualify for whole time service I believe that a District Court clerk must be responsible for putting through his hands or his files 1,700 cases per year.  Any clerk who has not that number of cases on his books in a year is called a part-time official and therefore cannot qualify for establishment under the Bill.  I should like the Minister to consider the part-time men who are being left outside the provisions of the Bill. When 1,700 cases per year are mentioned, no regard is had for the fact that a clerk who has less than 1,700 may have a number of cases that have been adjourned again and again, with the result that if the actual number of appearances in his court register had been taken into account, that man would have far in <Col N="1012" /> excess of the requisite 1,700 cases.  I have not so much sympathy for the part-time official who is enterprising enough, or fortunate enough, to be able to undertake some other occupation. But I know at least one District Court clerk&mdash;I think there are many such District Court clerks&mdash;who, because he cannot reach 1,700 cases a year, is left outside the provisions of this Bill and who has no other occupation.  This man has been in the service since the establishment of the District Courts.  He was unfortunate enough to be assigned to an area in which the number of cases did not exceed 1,700.  He was also unfortunate enough not to be able to undertake any other occupation, not through lack of initiative on his part, but largely because the areas which he serves are so diverse and so far apart that they practically require his whole-time service.  I ask the Minister to consider the case of this man favourably when dealing with the Bill on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>There is another type of clerk which the Minister has not taken into consideration at all in this Section 3 and that is the assistant in a District Court office.  As the Minister is aware, there are several offices throughout the country where more than one clerk is required.  I do not think it would be true to say that these men have served for as long a period as the man to whom I have referred, but at least their services as assistant clerks will not be taken into account under the provisions of this Bill.  Therefore, men who have in the normal course, procured promotion in their posts, can only rely on the years of service in which they actually served as District Court clerks, even though as assistant clerks they have been giving almost as good service to the State as they are now giving in their present capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was interrupted, I was drawing attention to one of the gravest problems facing the country at the moment.  I refer to <Col N="1013" /> the problem of providing our basic fuel supply both for domestic use and to fill our industrial and transport requirements. I have always approached problems of this kind from a strictly non-Party viewpoint; I can see no merit in one side or the other seeking to make political capital out of the difficulties that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a country with very limited coal resources and with a very difficult problem in relation to the development of our turf resources.  A good deal of criticism was levelled at the former Government because of the manner in which they handled the fuel situation during the war years.  I have no intention of absolving that Government from all blame, but I think it must in fairness be acknowledged that many of the charges, particularly in respect of the year 1946 and the winter of 1947, were grossly exaggerated; 1946 was an excessively wet year and much of the turf was severely damaged.  The winter following was one of successive severity and fuel supplies were quite inadequate to meet the situation.  I think any supplies that had been built up were almost completely dissipated during that very severe winter.  In the following year there was an intensive drive to produce fuel under somewhat difficult circumstances since it was rather late in the year by the time turf production could be undertaken.  In addition to that there was a nationwide demand that the Government should undertake turf production.  That demand came from both sides of the House.  Some members of Fine Gael and the Independent Deputies, as well as some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, pressed the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to accumulate supplies of firing.  Supplies were accumulated and at the beginning of 1948 we had 229,000 tons of turf, 387,000 tons of firewood and 449,000 tons of coal.  Last week I asked a question as to whether these reserves were maintained or whether they were dissipated. The information I got in reply was that turf reserves were reduced to 11,000 tons, firewood to nil, and coal reserves were down to 189,000 tons.  If we accept the view that the Fianna Fáil Government made a mistake in accumulating <Col N="1014" /> these large reserves, we must also accept the view that an even greater mistake was made in completely dissipating those reserves.  During 1948, and I think this is on the records of the House, I suggested that while it was desirable to utilise the accumulated firewood and turf supplies as quickly as possible, we should at the same time accumulate alternative supplies of good quality imported coal.  I think that would have been a very wise step. Whatever reserve was there should have been increased rather than dissipated.</P>
    <P>In a matter like this a Government must always take risks.  In any form of stock piling a Government is always open to the criticism that they accumulate reserves at a high price and thereby subsequently incur a loss to the taxpayer.  But in matters of this kind there ought always to be fair play as between Opposition and Government and I think the Government is entitled, in the circumstances in which they find themselves, to do the best they can.  Notwithstanding the advice that was given and the representations that were made, these reserves were dissipated.  We all know that it would have been possible to utilise the turf and firewood that had been accumulated during the years 1948 and 1949, while at the same time building up a new reserve of better quality fuel in order to safeguard the country in the present difficulty.  I mention the matter now because it is possible that a similar situation may arise in the future.  There may still be some possibilities of stock piling in relation to certain commodities and I do not think the Government ought to be deterred from taking the necessary steps to safeguard the country's position because of possible criticism.  The Government must be prepared to take risks on behalf of the people rather than expose them to the merciless brunt of adverse circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite clear now that all the reserves of the nation must be directed towards an intensive drive to produce good quality turf.  We all recognise that in the matter of turf production, as in agricultural production, one is to a certain extent dependent <Col N="1015" /> on weather conditions; notwithstanding that, every effort should be made and every opportunity should be taken of mechanising turf production.  We can produce, and are producing, machines suitable for turf production. We should continue in that direction and produce small machines to speed up the work, since I think nobody will deny that it is possible to produce a better quality turf by machinery than can be produced by hand.  No consideration should deter the Government from pushing this policy; not only should they advance courageously, but they should plan ahead.  They should guarantee to those who produce good quality turf a fair reward for their labour plus a certain measure of security.</P>
    <P>A serious complaint was voiced against the present Opposition when they were in Government that where owners of turbary let that turbary to the county council or any other public body they were penalised by an increase in their valuations.  If it is necessary to amend the Valuation Acts in order to safeguard such people in the future, that should be done. People who give their turbary for development for the public good should be safeguarded against injury to their land in relation to its agricultural use.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is important and which should receive more consideration, that is, the method of selling turf.  We should endeavour to get away from the system of selling turf by weight.  There ought to be an alternative method, such as selling it by measure, for instance, by the cubic yard.  That is the traditional method of selling turf.  Prior to the recent emergency, turf was never sold by weight.  As long as the system obtains of selling turf by weight or charging for transport on weight, there will be a temptation to keep the turf wet and even to add moisture.  That is one of the great complaints made in respect of turf generally.</P>
    <P>It should be the policy of the Government to see that our coal reserves are developed and utilised to the fullest extent.  In many homes cookers have been installed which burn anthracite or <Col N="1016" /> coke.  It will be a tragedy for a great number of families if they cannot obtain anthracite for cooking purposes. They have incurred considerable expense in installing up-to-date cooking apparatus and it would be very unfair to deprive them of the essential fuel for that apparatus.  In installing such cookers many people have been inspired, not merely by a desire for efficiency, economy and comfort, but by a desire to use native fuel, such as anthracite.  Therefore, it should be Government policy to ensure as far as possible that they will receive the necessary supply.</P>
    <P>One of the great mistakes made by the present Government over the past few years was that they allowed themselves to be bewitched, bothered and bewildered by the Minister for Agriculture. In loud voice he told them what was sound national economic policy.  In loud voice he told them that he knew everything about agriculture and that nobody else knew anything. In the first year of the present Government's administration, he diverted agricultural policy to dependence upon what he described as unlimited quantities of cheap imported maize.  He told the people during the summer months of 1948, and even during the harvest, when farmers were endeavouring to sell their oats, in 1948, that he would make available unlimited supplies of good quality maize at a very much reduced price.  In that way, he sabotaged the harvest of 1948.  He drove many farmers, who had more or less changed their economy to tillage, out of that line of production by his action and killed the market for oats in that year.  The result was that there was a very substantial decline in the acreage under oats and feeding barley in the following years.  That was a criminal act.  It may not have been deliberate on his part.  He honestly may have believed that unlimited supplies of maize were available from outside sources but he does not seem to have weighed up all the considerations; he seems to have acted in an irresponsible manner and to have exposed those who had engaged in the production of barley in 1948 to severe loss.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> The net result of his action has been to leave us dependent to a very large extent on imported feeding stuffs over the past two years.  That policy must be changed.  The Minister now would appear, belatedly, to intend changing it but the trade statistics show that we imported over £15,000,000 worth of cereal crops from the dollar area during the year 1950, thereby adding very considerably to our indebtedness in respect of dollars.</P>
    <P>I believe that the entire policy of the Minister in this respect was completely misguided and misdirected and that he completely misunderstood the trade situation.  If he thought that we could import cheap feeding stuffs and convert them into animal produce and re-export to Britain at a profit, he was making a terrific mistake.  He found that we could not convert imported feeding stuff into eggs, bacon or pork without incurring severe loss, because the price that we had to pay for maize was too high and the price we received from the British for eggs and bacon was utterly uneconomic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had the facility to be in two places at one time, I might be able to get, perhaps, a more comprehensive view of these matters.  I am viewing the matter, logically, and I think reasonably.  Everybody realises that the price that is being offered to this country by the British for bacon is utterly uneconomic.  I think that is accepted by everyone.</P>
      <P>The Minister, the other day, talked about being able to provide a price of 210/-, dead weight, for pigs.  The fact of the matter is that the people in the Six Counties are getting 50/- a cwt. more.  He knows perfectly well and everybody knows that we could not produce for export at that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I am painting too dark or too gloomy a situation.  I believe that with courage and initiative on the part of those who direct parliamentary policy, we can well restore conditions to a more normal level.  So far as agricultural exports are concerned, many of the circumstances of the international <Col N="1018" /> situation are in our favour. While the price which has been accepted by our Minister in regard to eggs and the price that we may expect in regard to pigs is inadequate, I believe that with good salesmanship we could secure better prices for the farming community.</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to draw attention to an arrogant statement made by the Minister last week.  We all know that the price offered to Irish producers for eggs is ridiculously low, but the Minister for Agriculture said last week that he was not in any way responsible for that situation.  He claimed his predecessor made a bad bargain and, as a result, he found himself with intensive production here and a very large supply of eggs which the British did not want.  In actual fact the Minister, during 1948, was boosting egg production.  He sent a personal letter to every farmer's wife and daughter, urging them to increase egg production, and he gave a guarantee that the more they could produce the higher the price.</P>
    <P>Surely he could not hold the former Minister responsible for what he himself did in 1948.  As a matter of fact, both he and his admirers claimed complete credit for the expansion in egg production during that year and the following year.  Last week he said that as a result of the unwise bargain made by his predecessor he had to try to dispose of the eggs to the best of his ability last year.  I asked him on what date the trade agreement with regard to eggs was made last year and he replied that it was made in August and it provided for the Irish egg producer a price of 2/- per dozen from 1st February to 1st September.  He said that agreement was made after long and difficult negotiations.</P>
    <P>The records of the House show that the Minister stood up here on 15th June last, while negotiations were supposed to be going on, and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have to announce to the House that, as a result of negotiations which have recently been proceeding in London... from 1st September to 31st August, 1951, the price of <Col N="1019" /> eggs to the producer will be 2/- per dozen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say (Vol. 121, No. 13, col. 1795):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not a bad price for eggs if you grow your own stuff on your own farm....  Twopence an egg: I can remember when it was the top price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we had the Minister for Agriculture boasting of the price the Food Minister in Britain was offering for eggs, and that was at a time when the negotiations were not completed.  It seems to me that is a peculiar line of salesmanship for a Minister to take, a Minister supposed to be trying to get the best possible price for eggs.  There he was boasting about the inadequate price offered by the British Government. He said it was not a bad price, 2d. an egg, and he could remember when it was the top price.  What could the Food Minister in Britain say? What conclusion could he come to except that he was over-generous in offering 2d. an egg?  Twopence was all our Minister could secure.</P>
    <P>He had the audacity to say that he had a very hard fight to get a better price.  If we are to get a better price for our produce in the British market the Minister will have to acquire some elementary knowledge of salesmanship. There is no use in going to Britain with the intention of selling things and saying you are going to drown the British with eggs.  Equally there is no use in coming here while negotiations are proceeding and applauding the price that is being offered.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious position facing a large number of decent, industrious people who have gone in extensively for egg production.  They find themselves with a large number of hens producing eggs in considerable quantities. Those eggs cost a substantial sum to produce.  An egg selling for 2d. must cost at least 3d. to produce, and that is a very modest estimate.  Those people are involved in very substantial losses, simply because the Minister refuses to look for a better price. There is such a thing in existence as a consultative council on matters of production. <Col N="1020" /> That council has never been asked to meet since this Minister took office.  Apparently he knows so much that he cannot be advised on any subject; he spurns all advice.  The result is he has made a series of deplorable and ridiculous mistakes.</P>
    <P>Last week I had a question in regard to our tillage programme for the coming year.  I based that question on a statement the Minister made to the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  Since then a summary of that statement has been issued at public expense by the Department of Agriculture and it has been published in every paper throughout the country.  It is headed in a manner to catch the farmer's attention and it is worded very closely along the lines of the Minister's statement to the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  In that statement the Minister appeals for certain acreage targets in regard to certain crops.  For instance, in regard to Ymer barley, he demands 200,000 acres; in regard to oats he demands at least 300,000 acres; in regard to potatoes he demands 400,000 acres and in regard to hay and silage the demand is for 2,000,000 acres.  There is no reference to the crop upon which human beings depend for their bread. There is no request in this advertisement for increased acreage or any acreage at all in regard to wheat or even beet.  I think the papers carried a larger advertisement issued by the Irish Sugar Company calling for an increased acreage of sugar beet.</P>
    <P>The only reference the Minister makes to wheat is this: having asked for an additional acreage in regard to barley, oats, potatoes, hay and silage, he mentions that preparation for these crops must be undertaken now, &ldquo;in addition to such other crops as the farmer may intend sowing, such as wheat, industrial barley, beet and other root crops.&rdquo;  So far as the Minister is concerned it does not matter whether the farmer sows any wheat or beet, it does not matter what acreage he sows.  He may or may not as he thinks fit sow those crops.  The Minister issues no request to farmers on behalf of the State or the community to grow even the acreage that was provided this year.  Were there to <Col N="1021" /> be a drastic reduction in the acreage of wheat sown, would not that be a serious matter in the event of a complete closing down of imports?  Could the Minister escape responsibility in that matter?  He has indicated the target required in regard to other crops.  He has indicated that he does not care whether one acre of wheat is grown or any acreage of wheat whatever is grown.  That is a matter which ought to be seriously considered not only by the Minister but by the entire Government because I think the entire Government must take responsibility in a matter of this kind.  In addition, this advertisement is objectionable viewed as a departmental advertisement. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Compulsory tillage and all other forms of arbitrary interference with the freedom of farmers were abolished by your Government.</P>
    <P>The Government depends on farmers to do, in their own interest, all that is necessary without compulsion or penalties.</P>
    <P>Unless each farmer produces on his own land all the animal feed he requires, he cannot hope to maintain his live stock.</P>
    <P>It is for the farmers to decide whether freedom or compulsion is the better policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, there is an inference in that statement that the policy of compulsion is advocated by someone or other in the Dáil or that it was the policy of compulsion which was in force during the emergency.  The position ought to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Compulsory tillage was introduced into this House during the war period, but not as a Party measure or as a measure supported only by the Government. It was a measure that was supported unanimously.  Every Party in this House supported the policy of compulsory tillage during the war.  I have no doubt that if a similar situation arose again&mdash;if the world was engaged in a life and death struggle&mdash;there would not be any objection to compulsory tillage.  In normal peace times, however, when it is possible to produce to secure the acreage required <Col N="1022" /> of the various crops, inducement is by far the better policy.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made by Deputy O'Higgins in this debate to suggest that I was in some way in favour of compulsory tillage when I advocated an increased acreage of wheat. Deputy O'Higgins knows quite well that nothing could be further from the truth.  As a constant reader of the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i> he might have seen a report last week that a proposal recommending compulsory tillage was opposed by me.  Deputy O'Higgins did make, in the course of his speech, one constructive suggestion that the Government should appeal to the farmers to grow more wheat and that they should increase the price having regard to the costs of production. That was what I suggested to-day.  It is desirable for the Government, in the national interest, to appeal to the farmers, who are a patriotic body of citizens, to increase their acreage of wheat.  The Government ought to meet the farmers in the same way the Irish Sugar Company met them by giving a price which will compensate for the rise in the costs of production. The price of wheat has not gone up since 1947.  Wages have gone up by over 10/- per week and they are increased by the present legislation. Rates have been increased by 10/- in the £ at least and all other costs have appreciably increased.  The Minister aggressively pointed out during the week that there is a reserve of nearly one year's supply of wheat.  That, as far as it goes, is satisfactory enough but I am not prepared to admit that one year's supply of wheat completely secures the community against all danger.  If imports were stopped at this time of the year, one year's supply of wheat might be all right since we could increase our acreage, but if a stoppage occurred later on in the summer, it would not be possible to increase output for at least a year and a half.  We should not be too complacent about a year's wheat supply. It would be very dangerous this year to rely on one year's wheat supply. From the point of view of national security and of saving dollars, it is essential that we produce an increased acreage of wheat and produce the <Col N="1023" /> other cereals which the Minister in his public advertisement suggests should be produced.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech to-day, the Minister for Agriculture referred to the cost of living and had several figures to show that the cost of living had not increased over the last three years.  It was significant that he selected the prices of commodities produced by the Irish farmers which are rigidly controlled.  The price of meat, which he quoted, is very rigidly controlled for the past three years and it is now the subject of investigation. The price of milk is approximately the same to-day as it was three years ago. The price of eggs is down onethird as compared with the price obtaining three years ago.  The Minister also mentioned potatoes and a number of other agricultural products the prices of which did not increase since 1948.  He did not mention other agricultural commodities, the prices of which have increased very substantially.  The only point I want to make in regard to that is that the Minister was bearing out my contention that over a wide range of commodities there has been no increase in agricultural prices since 1948, notwithstanding the fact that there has been a very substantial increase in costs.  I might point out that the cost of living would be infinitely higher if agricultural prices had kept pace with the prices of other commodities.</P>
    <P>I must conclude on this note.  We are facing a situation which calls for a non-Party approach to our economic and financial problems.  Hurling accusations across the House and blaming Fianna Fáil for one condition of affairs or the Inter-Party Government for another is of no use to the people.  The position, as the Minister for Finance indicated when introducing the Vote, is far too serious to be made the plaything of Party politics. The very survival of this country depends on an all-out effort to reduce to some extent our consumption of unnecessary, and particularly unnecessary imported, commodities and to increase our productive capacity.  All our efforts must be directed towards that end.  Not only must all Parties, but all organisations <Col N="1024" /> must combine in that effort.  This is not a time for advancing sectional interests.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned some injustices to the farming community, but there is no intention on the part of the farming community to hold the rest of the community to ransom.  All that any farmer would expect in regard to prices is a fair and impartial investigation.  The farming community are prepared to submit their case to impartial investigation and to accept the decision of that investigation in regard to prices.  Every other section should be prepared to do the same.  Every section of the community which has demands to make in regard to salary or wage should be prepared to submit its claim to an impartial court or tribunal&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;and to accept the decision of that fair and impartial tribunal.</P>
    <P>This is a time when the law of justice must be put into operation and when a sense of fair play and justice must be universally accepted.  No section should be allowed to exploit the difficulties facing the community and public opinion should insist upon every section accepting the broad principle of fair play and justice.  The people of my constituency have shown that, in the hearts of the ordinary people, there is a strong sense of justice and fair play that can rise above Party loyalty or Party affiliations and that is prepared to assert itself, and to assert itself in a vigorous way.  That same spirit, the spirit of Baltinglass, if you like, should inspire the people of this country in this crisis and each section should be prepared to submit its conflicting and complex claims&mdash;and very often they are just claims&mdash;to an impartial tribunal and to accept the final decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into that matter because I dealt with it very <Col N="1025" /> fully and, I think, very effectively.  I believe that, in that particular matter, as in every matter, every claim put up by any section has two sides, both of which should be fairly heard, and there should be such a public feeling of respect for ordinary justice and fair play that each section would accept a fair and impartial decision.  That goes not only for the farmers but for organised workers, and even for salaried people, civil servants and so on, who have made very definite claims that they have been unjustly treated.</P>
      <P>I very rarely intervene by way of interruption while another Deputy is speaking, but, while the Minister was speaking to-day, I referred to the price of wheat.  Last week, I raised this matter of wheat imports and said that we were paying a much higher price for imported wheat than we were paying to our Irish producers.  The Minister intervened to say that that was not true.  To-day he produced figures in reply to a question which showed that the price he is paying for imported wheat is over £30 a ton, while he is paying only £25 per ton to the Irish producer.  I think it is time that Minister developed a sense of responsibility and did not make wild statements merely for the sake of proving a point, regardless of whether there is any substance or truth behind the assertion.</P>
      <P>I conclude by strongly urging the Government to exercise a little supervision over the Minister for Agriculture. It is not possible to restrain his words, but at least it might be possible to keep him under a certain amount of control, so far as deeds are concerned. Since becoming Minister, the Minister has made a statement with regard to wheat&mdash;I do not intend to quote the statements he made before he took office, because I discounted all these statements, believing they were made for the purpose of getting publicity, and that, when he took office, he would completely turn over a new leaf and live up to the responsibility which would then rest upon him&mdash;in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I hold precisely the same views now as I have always held regarding the growing of wheat on Irish land. <Col N="1026" /> In my view, it is a &lsquo;cod&rsquo; and a waste of land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made on 9th July, 1948, and, in view of that statement, it is desirable that the entire Government should take the matter in hand and see that, in the first place, the interests of the community are safeguarded; and, in the second, that the farmer who grows the wheat will get a reasonable return.</P>

      <P>The House has listened for a very considerable period to Deputy Cogan giving vent, on this Vote on Account, to his peculiar anti-Minister for Agriculture psychosis. Deputy Cogan knows as well as any other Deputy that, analysing the agricultural situation in the country to-day, the over-all position of the farmer is better than it has ever been and that he is enjoying a period of prosperity which he has never hitherto enjoyed. Conclusive evidence of that might be the fact that I notice that Deputy Cogan, a farmer Deputy, is arriving now daily in a new automobile, which is not very consistent with his lachrymose and doleful tale of the misery of Irish agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>From the moaning association.  Even though the Deputy may try to snipe with regard to individual items on the general agricultural curriculum, the fact is that the farmers he speaks about certainly are not anxious for the costs investigation about which he whines and are certainly satisfied with the over-all position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this Vote on Account, we can look back on the achievement which is self-evident in the general well-being of the community, in the lack of unemployment and in the general level of prosperity now enjoyed throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, and enjoyed particularly for the first time by small farmers, farm labourers and the people generally living in rural <Col N="1027" /> Ireland.  It is easy to snipe, and very easy at the present moment, when an ominous international situation leaves certain goods in short supply and certain raw materials rising in price in a rather erratic and sudden way.  These are matters over which no Irish Government has control.  The incidence of these rises externally may lead to increases and difficulties at home, but those difficulties cannot be related in any way to Government responsibility.</P>
    <P>Much capital has been made out of a temporary fuel shortage.  It is time that this House faced up to the real fuel problem, that an agreement entered into between this country and another has not been honoured to the extent anticipated and that the shortage would not have arisen in the acute way it did if that agreement had been honoured to the full.  The outcome of that may have meant temporary hardship, but we would do better here as a House by facing the problem in a united way, to ensure to the best of our national ability that no extraneous circumstances like that will be allowed to cause a sudden fuel difficulty in the future.  That can be done by all-out co-operation by all Parties in the drive in the coming year for machine-won turf and in encouraging individuals, as they were encouraged before, to cut good quality turf for their own consumption.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record here the general favourable advances made throughout the length and breadth of my constituency by Government effort during the past year.  We have a tremendous increase in rural electrification, with all the advantages and prequisites of the installation of electricity in rural Ireland accruing to the people in my constituency.  Fortunately, there are several other areas under development immediately.  I commend the Government on expenditure of this nature, investing Irish money in the grandest objective in which Irish money could be invested, the assurance of a more comfortable standard of life in rural Ireland, where people must be kept to increase the production of Irish farms and so that the country in the main may benefit.  Hand in hand with rural electrification, there is throughout <Col N="1028" /> my constituency an immense number of people taking advantage of the water scheme, under which there is a free grant to bring water into farm houses for the comfort and benefit of the overtaxed and overworked farmers' wives.  Again I say &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo;  to the Government, who had the courage to expend our own money on that type of development.</P>
    <P>Following out the same ideal, I am glad to be able to report to this House that through the land rehabilitation scheme there are acres and acres throughout West Cork coming back into heart and fertility.  That surely is a most commendable investment&mdash;an Irish Government looking to the future of a nation that has to develop and whose population is on an upward trend.  Surely that investment must commend itself to all and sundry here, irrespective of politics.</P>
    <P>I say, in direct contravention of all the dreary tales uttered by Deputy Cogan, that the farmers of West Cork are doing well and fully appreciate the fact that they are now masters of their own holdings, that they can decide now for themselves, that in consideration of the help they have at hand and in the interest of their conception of the economy of their own farms they are able to go ahead and farm as they think fit and not as somebody else might direct.  Though there may be talk about a fall in the acreage of wheat grown last year, I think it is time for the House to realise that, whatever the acreage might have been, there was more actual wheat from a smaller acreage than there had been previously from a larger acreage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the system of the Minister for Agriculture, to encourage the farmer to use fertilisers to build back heart into his debilitated land, has proved so successful that it will be possible with ministerial encouragement to have more and more grain won from a restricted acreage than was won under a system of compulsory tillage where wheat was grown in fields throughout this country not fit to be subsequently reaped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> I am all in favour of encouraging, in every possible way, the growing of more foodstuffs here at home for both man and beast.  I have always subscribed to the belief that the more self-sufficient the ordinary Irish farmer can make himself the better it is for the economy of his holding.  If he can grow, in the main, the foodstuffs he needs for his cattle, pigs and hens, he is growing them at the cheapest possible cost to himself.  Therefore, he can produce the finished product from the farm at the greatest possible margin of profit.  I believe that if the Minister for Agriculture can develop a proper scheme of ordinary potato ensilage and grass ensilage he will be able to relieve any of the aggravated difficulties that may have arisen with regard to feeding stock owing to the extraordinarily bad season we had last year.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the time has come, with this ominous world situation, for the Minister to direct the mind of the farming community towards that honoured and well proven policy of the late Paddy Hogan: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  It is no good to try to decry a Minister for Agriculture who has, in fact, been able through his efforts to bring back into the farming community not only prosperity but self-respect.  I feel that this is an opportunity for Deputies in this House boldly to present the story of a phenomenal achievement by a Government over a short period, a Government which faces the responsibility of making this country a better country for each and every individual Irish man and woman, irrespective of class, creed or any other consideration.</P>
    <P>It is full time that the Dáil should realise the extraordinary significance of the fact that for the first time we now have a population of over 3,000,000 in the Republic of Ireland and that the trend is upward, showing in a sound unequivocal way that things must be getting better in Ireland. Taking this Vote on Account I think that the indications are that the Government is going to pursue its policy of greater capital expenditure on the development of our country and of <Col N="1030" /> giving decent and plentiful employment at home to Irish people.  The desire to emigrate is now being killed because rural Ireland is rapidly being made a place worth living in because new amenities, a new and better standard of life and a new and better standard of profit are available to each one on the land whether he be a small farm proprietor or a farmer's man.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture will have to face a problem with regard to egg prices, but I do not think it is fair to snipe at him at a period when the price is low because there were periods, particularly around last Christmas, when the price of eggs was at a level which never had been reached before. If some of these critics were to take the general over-all price for the year as distinct from any one period, I wonder whether they would consider that the poultry industry had really got the tremendous crack suggested by weeping lachrymose Deputy Cogan.</P>
    <P>I feel proud to be able to come in on a Vote on Account as a Deputy who normally supports the Government, as a member of a Party which is an integral part of it, and say to the Government: &ldquo;No matter what your difficulties may be, in the main you have done a fine job.  Face the road and God prosper your future progress&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot but be touched by Deputy Collins' simple faith.  Politics would be a very easy game if it consisted merely of making rotund general assertions ignoring all the facts.  It must be grand to be able to stand up in the Dáil or at a crossroads and say: &ldquo;Everybody in the country is better off and if there are any troubles the Government is not to blame for them&rdquo;, and to scorn all reference to statistics, all reference to recorded facts and all reference even to the Book of Estimates which we are now discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that the rural electrification scheme is going on, but it is to be regretted that the rate of progress achieved to date is much less than what was estimated when that scheme was being discussed here in the Dáil on the legislation introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government to provide for it.  It is to be regretted that <Col N="1031" /> the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced only a few weeks ago that even the very reduced rate of progress achieved last year will be impossible this year because of some anticipated difficulties on which he did not elaborate.</P>
    <P>It is grand to be able to join in the Minister for Agriculture's brazen assertion that the yield of wheat last year was so high that from a much reduced acreage we actually secured more wheat than we gained from a larger acreage in earlier years, ignoring the actual recorded statistics.  I took the precaution, however, of asking the Taoiseach who is now in charge of the statistical service what was the yield of wheat per acre last year, and he told me that it was 17.9 cwt. per acre.  I also thought it desirable to look up the statistical abstract and I find that not merely was 17.9 cwt. per acre no record but that in the seven war years, despite the fact that there were no fertilisers, despite the fact that there was an enormous increase in the acreage under wheat, the average yield was higher than in last year, and that in only three of the seven years did the yield per acre fall below last year's yield. Does the Deputy want proofs?  They are available to him as they are to me in the Government's published records.</P>
    <P>The same is true of oats.  The Minister for Agriculture we know has a neck of brass and he would talk himself out of any political situation by assertions such as he made here concerning the cost of imported wheat in relation to the cost of native wheat even though he knew he would have to contradict it in a week.  Only last week he told the Dáil when cornered in a political discussion that the cost of imported wheat was below the cost of native wheat.  Only a few months ago he published to the country a formal report of a committee which estimated that in 1950 because of the use of native wheat the subsidy of flour would exceed by £2,000,000 the figure that would be necessary if we used imported wheat only.  But when he is nailed on the facts, when he is asked to state to the Dáil the actual price <Col N="1032" /> paid last year for imported wheat and for native wheat, we find that it was all boloney.  Not merely was the cost of imported wheat last year substantially above the cost of native wheat but, because we used more imported wheat than was originally thought to be necessary, owing to the fall in acreage, we now have a Supplementary Estimate presented to this House asking it to vote £1,500,000 more to meet the cost on flour subsidy.  That was no miscalculation.  That was no trivial error in estimation.  It was a major error in policy, for which the Minister for Agriculture, whom Deputy Seán Collins has been praising, must be blamed.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, perhaps more to Deputy Collins' heart to praise the land reclamation project.  It, after all, was something which was originated by the Government which he supports.  He told us of the good work being done under it.  He did not tell us why the Minister for Agriculture has decided to cut down on that project for this year. He did not tell us why the Vote on Account which we are now discussing provides a reduction in expenditure on that project of no less than £600,000. These are the facts&mdash;facts which any member of this House who wants to approach this discussion in any serious manner cannot ignore, as Deputy Collins has ignored them.  A beautiful theory killed by an ugly fact is one of life's tragedies.  I am sorry that my facts spoil the grand picture which Deputy Collins painted for us.  The picture would be grand if we were accurate.  Unfortunately, some of us are curious and we like to check assertions of that kind by relating them to known and ascertainable facts&mdash;and in this particular case these facts destroy the Deputy's picture.</P>
    <P>This debate is not really a discussion on agriculture at all, despite the trend of recent speeches.  It is more a discussion on the consequences on the nation's economy of the financial policy which the Government is following. One of the difficulties, in discussing this matter, is our inability to relate the statements of Ministers with the acts of the Government.  There does not appear to be any obvious relationship <Col N="1033" /> between the statements of Ministers&mdash; and I am not talking now of the Minister for Agriculture, but of any member of the Government&mdash;with the things that the Government is doing.  That is certainly true in relation to financial policy and it is obviously true also in relation to agricultural policy.  The Minister for Agriculture is always running round in circles and getting back to the point from which he started.</P>
    <P>In so far as financial policy is under discussion, I want to emphasise the inconsistency between the declarations made by Ministers of the Government's aims, intentions and policy and the actual results that they are getting.  It is not so long ago since the Minister for Finance assured the House that the main purpose of his Administration was to effect a reduction in the cost of Government&mdash;&ldquo;retrenchment&rdquo; was the word he used.  Deputies will remember how, when the Book of Estimates for 1948-49 was produced to the House&mdash;a Book of Estimates which had been prepared by the previous Government, but which, because of the change following the election of 1948, was actually presented by the present Minister for Finance&mdash;we got with it a slip, making it clear that the Minister for Finance repudiated it absolutely, and Deputies will remember how he came subsequently to the Dáil and told us he regarded the cost of government represented by these Estimates as fantastic.  The figure upon the cover of that book was £65,000,000.  The sum of the figures on the cover of this book is £83,000,000. We have to relate that declaration by the Minister, that proclamation of his intention to cut down the cost of government below the figure of £65,000,000, which it had reached in 1948-49 with the fact that each subsequent year it has achieved a new all-time record and has not stopped going up yet.  There is no Deputy opposite who will now even pretend that this Minister for Finance is pursuing a policy of retrenchment.  There is no Deputy opposite who will even suggest that the figure upon the cover of the Book of Estimates for this year is not going to be exceeded next year if the <Col N="1034" /> same Minister for Finance has still the preparation of it.</P>
    <P>Not merely was the cost of Government services to be drastically cut but, of course, the cost of living was to be reduced.  That assertion was made not merely by members of the Government but by many Deputies who support them in this House.  The cost of living was to be reduced by the creation of a more effective machinery for price and profits control and by an extension of the policy of subsidising food prices.  Again, despite these declarations which are on the record, we find that in each year since, not merely has the cost of living been higher than it was at the highest point reached during the war but it has been rising continuously and is right now again an all-time record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal with it for a moment.  We did not say that it was practicable to cut the cost of Government services.  We did not say that it was possible to devise any method by which, independent of world conditions, the cost of living could be reduced.  It was the members of the Government who said it.  It was the Deputies who support the Government who made those assertions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we at least get a declaration from some Minister that when they were making these assertions they were misled by their false conclusions as to the probable course of events?  Can we get them to admit that they were wrong&mdash;will they admit that they were wrong?  Will they admit that when they made these assertions they were either misinformed as to the facts of the position or they miscalculated as to the probable course of events generally?  Will they admit anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that there was to be a policy of repatriating our external assets.  The members of the Clann na Poblachta Party went to town on that issue.  We find, of course, that the policy has been carried out.  There has <Col N="1035" /> been a repatriation of external assets &mdash;but not for the purposes that were elaborated upon when the policy was being proclaimed.  They were to be brought back to be put to work here. Instead, we find that they are being dissipated in maintaining a level of consumption of luxury goods which the current volume of production here is incapable of supporting.  They are being dissipated: they are being wasted.  That dissipation and waste of these resources is, as I hope to prove, an inevitable consequence of the financial policy which the Minister for Finance has followed.</P>
    <P>There was to be a programme of capital investment.  Ireland suffered, we were assured, from under-investment in its natural resources, and a large-scale capital investment programme was to be a feature of the policy of the Government.  We got a large-scale capital investment programme but not in the development of natural resources.  We got capital investment, mainly in budget deficits and in Government cowardice.  Again,  want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it was not from this side of the House it was asserted that a reduction in the volume of Government spending was either practicable or desirable.  It was the present Minister for Finance and his associates who made that assertion.  It was not from this side of the House it was asserted that it was practicable, by any action taken here, to make a significant reduction in the cost of living. That assertion came from the other side, from men who have now got the power to fulfil these promises if it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I said here last year in the debate on the Vote on Account that I had gone through the Book of Estimates and that I had examined every estimate in it with a view to ascertaining whether there were any specific economies I could recommend and that, apart from cutting out some follies and fripperies, there was nothing I could suggest which would make any significant difference in the total figure. But when we come to consider the <Col N="1036" /> question of policy in this regard we have got to relate it to something more than the details of individual Estimates.  We have got to relate the volume of Government spending to the national resources, to the level of production and the means available to the people of this country to sustain that volume of spending.  When the Minister for Finance came to this House, shortly after his elevation to that office in 1948, he informed us that he was about to issue £12,000,000 in Exchequer Bonds.  I told him on behalf of the Opposition Party that he could always rely upon our support for any well-conceived programme of capital investment.  We have found, however, that although the Minister for Finance borrowed in that year £12,000,000, in the following year another £12,000,000, in the present year £15,000,000 by the issue of marketable securities and a very much larger sum, so far as we know, by Ways and Means advances, although the national debt of this State has been increased in these three short years by 50 per cent., the investment programme about which there was so much oratory, was devised apparently without any reference to the volume of savings, the level of imports or its effect upon prices and that, in its application, it has ignored the most serious deficiencies in our national economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance came here yesterday and asked the Dáil to vote him this enormous sum of money on account of the cost of Government services in this year and he thought it wise to warn the House about the significance of the deficit in the balance of payments last year, the consequences of the considerable increase in last year in the consumption of what he called non-essential goods, but he left it at that.  Apart from a futile appeal to individuals to refrain from expenditure upon non-essentials, there was no practical suggestion from him which would convey that he himself was alive to the seriousness of the warnings he was giving.  There was in his speech no recognition of the extent to which the policy of the Government was responsible for the emergence of the dangers he deplores, much <Col N="1037" /> less any indication of an intention to repent and to reform.  I think it is well known to members of this House, and probably just as well to the members of the public, that the Government was driven into its present financial practices by Party political considerations.  Deputy Hickey is shaking his head&mdash;in agreement, I hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not misunderstand me in that regard.  I hope to make myself clear to him before I finish.  I find that individual members of the public, with whom I discussed the matter, give the Minister for Finance certain credit. They credit him with sufficient intelligence and understanding of the nature of the problems with which he is dealing to enable him to realise the defects of that policy and its probable consequences.  I find that they credit him with personally disliking that policy even though they may have nothing but contempt for the weakness, if I may not use a harsher term, which led him to become the instrument of fulfilling it.  Anyway, it is generally assumed that the Minister for Finance, if he could give effect to his own viewpoint upon financial policy, would have followed a different course to that which he has taken and that he was driven to taking that course by the pressure exerted upon him by groups and sections within the Coalition.  I do not know if the Minister for Finance will accept that definition of his position.  Possibly he will not, but if it is not true that the financial policy of the Government has been dictated by the narrow political consideration of holding the Coalition together, by giving in to every demand of sections of Coalition Deputies large enough to secure the defeat of the Government, then the Minister for Finance has much more to answer for than has yet appeared.  I think that this device of his of introducing into the formal statements he makes to the House, the vague words of caution which he has put on record as his <Col N="1038" /> understanding of the dangers of the course he is proposing but which do not affect in the least the subsequent conduct of the Government, is evidence that the public assumption as to his position in relation to Government policy is well-founded.</P>
      <P>But, sooner or later, some members of the Government, or some Deputies who support the Government, will have to make a stand upon these issues. They cannot always allow themselves to be driven along courses detrimental to the national interest by any little group amongst their members that wants to put forward a sectional demand or press for some expenditure in a direction to which it is committed, irrespective of the over-all effect. At some time, somewhere, there will have to be a decision taken by those within the Coalition who appreciate the consequences of the courses they are following to stand against that pressure.  The indication up to the present is that there is nobody in the Government that cannot be pushed, even from standpoints to which they appear to be committed, provided that the push comes from a sufficient number of Coalition Deputies to threaten the survival of the Government if they resist it.  I think it is time that we took stock; it is time that members of the Government took stock, and that members of the Coalition Parties who support the Government took stock, and asked themselves: where have we got to, and where are we going in this matter of financial policy, the expansion of Government expenditure, the rise in the public debt and the consequences of these upon the future prospects of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, according to the Minister for Finance, 5/4 out of every £1 of the private income of Irish citizens was taken to pay for public services. Despite the fact that out of every £1 of private income 5/4 was taken to pay for public services, we are faced with demands and plans for a further expansion of these services and the creation of new services, all of which will add to the aggregate cost.  Despite the fact that the rise in the cost of Government services is now proceeding at a pace, and is likely to continue at <Col N="1039" /> a pace, far greater than any possible expansion in national production, we can get from the Minister for Finance nothing more serious, by way of a proposal, to remedy the position than this futile appeal to individual citizens to curtail their spending upon non-essential products.  If he has any realisation at all, and if one is to take seriously any of the precautionary phrases which he put into his formal speeches, of the course which he has been forced to follow, surely we should expect something more serious from him now than this pathetic appeal to individuals to help him out of his growing difficulties by voluntarily curtailing their personal expenditure.  I am sure he knows, and I am sure his advisers know, that any such appeal is only a waste of time.  If there is to be any such curtailment of non-essential imports, it can be secured only by Government action to that end and not by incoherent appeals.</P>
    <P>Not merely have we got this multiplication of plans and demands for the expansion of Government services but we also have announced from time to time new plans and projects for capital investment which appear to be devised without reference to the fact that the level of national savings is possibly falling and is certainly not rising.  If anybody is to secure a realistic facing of the facts by the members of the Dáil it must be the Minister for Finance.  It is his duty.  Not merely is it a matter of duty with him, but he has the status of his office and the availability of facts to enable him to do it, but he has got to talk to the people who sit behind him in this House.  It is not necessary to speak across the House to the Opposition, the members of which are fully conscious of the disastrous consequences that may follow if he continues along the course on which he is now being pushed.  But he has got to speak to the members who sit behind him not in these precautionary phrases carefully inserted in formal statements which the subsequent actions of the Government proved to be a valueless effort to control the course of Government policy.  May I say that he has got to speak here also in this House <Col N="1040" /> or in this country and not in self-laudatory articles in British magazines? It must be apparent to him and it must be apparent to other members of the Government&mdash;I am sure it is apparent to some Deputies who support it&mdash;that they cannot continue for ever to solve their Budget problems or their political problems by further resort to the policy of borrowing.</P>
    <P>We got some information supplied to us in the last couple of days concerning national income and expenditure in the past few years.  When the Minister for Finance came here last year with this new type of Budget we had a discussion, he and I, as to whether it would be practicable for him to borrow the amount of money he proposed to borrow&mdash;£31,000,000&mdash; within this country out of current savings. I expressed the view that it would not be possible to do it.  That view was not based upon any reliable statistics such as are now available to us.  It was based upon a general knowledge derived from other years of the proportion of the national income that was likely to be saved and of information published by the Central Bank concerning the amount raised in recent years by public subscription through the sale of marketable securities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was quite confident that he would be able to borrow his £31,000,000 from the public. He expressed the hope that the whole of it would come out of current savings. He emphasised in his Budget statement how desirable it was that it should, how recourse to the American Loan Counterpart Fund or the repatriation of foreign investments would have inflationary consequences which he thought it was desirable to caution the Dáil against.</P>
    <P>It appears now that in the year 1949 the aggregate of savings was £29.8 millions, £17,000,000 representing personal savings, £8.3 millions representing undistributed profits of companies and £4.5 millions representing appropriations to various funds of public authorities.  If we add to that the amount set aside for depreciation, £8.4 millions, we find that the total amount available in 1949 as representing <Col N="1041" /> savings of all kinds was £38.4 millions. The Minister for Finance was seeking to borrow £31,000,000.  Not merely did I think it desirable to express the view that it could not be done, but also to express the view that if it were done, the effect would be to stifle every other form of development in this country, to deprive industry and agriculture of the capital they needed for expansion, to curtail commercial activities and to confine all development to various Government schemes.</P>
    <P>The money which was saved in 1949 was expended upon producers' capital goods, in this Estimate to the extent of £14,000,000, upon the building of private dwellings, hospitals, schools, etc., to the extent of £15.8 millions. Other home-produced capital was estimated at £17.1 millions, and increase in stocks and work in progress, £1,000,000.  These figures total £47.9 millions, because of course in the Estimate of the amount of capital available there was added in not merely the amount saved by our own people but a sum of £9.7 millions representing foreign disinvestment.</P>
    <P>I am presuming that the Minister when preparing this well-advertised capital Budget last year had before him some estimate from the Statistics Branch of the volume of savings in 1949.  The Statistics Branch may not have been able to give him the detailed figures which we now have but, presumably, he asked from them and got some estimate upon which to frame his Budget, because it would have been foolish to prepare a capital Budget and to express the hope of being able to finance that Budget out of current savings without having made some effort to estimate what the volume of savings was likely to be.  If the Minister for Finance had any such estimate before him, then he was speaking to the Dáil with his tongue in his cheek when he expressed the hope of being able to finance that capital expenditure out of current savings and to avoid the inflationary consequences of financing it in other ways.  We know that he floated Exchequer bonds to the extent of £15,000,000 and got in public subscriptions only £10,000,000.</P>

      <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister has succeeded in carrying out the capital investment programme he outlined in last year's Budget.  He has resisted attempts to extract any information from him.  We may hear it in the Budget statement this year.  We know that in his efforts to cover that capital Budget by public subscription he failed to the extent of two-thirds.  Ten million pounds were all he got from public subscription and the loan of £15,000,000 was filled to the extent of £2,000,000 by the investment funds and as to £3,000,000 by the banks and the balance of the £31,000,000, if it was in fact raised, was secured, so far as I can gather, from the American Loan Counterpart Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1947 and 1951 the cost of Government services here has risen by 40 per cent.  Now I want the House to understand that in 1947, when the Budget of that year was presented by the then Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, described it as imposing an intolerable burden upon the national economy.  In relation to the circumstances of that year he thought that the amount the Government proposed to take from the public to spend upon public services was so excessive that it would be bound to cast undesirable economic and social consequences; the phrase used was &ldquo;an intolerable burden&rdquo;. Between that year, 1947, and the present year the cost of these services has increased by 40 per cent. There has been, as is now clear to us, no corresponding increase in the national income and so the burden this year must be substantially heavier than the burden of 1947, not merely actually but relatively.  Between the year 1947 and 1950, according to these <Col N="1044" /> figures now available to us, the national income increased by 14 per cent.; over the same period, under Deputy McGilligan's administration, the cost of Government services has increased by 34 per cent.</P>
      <P>It was Deputy McGilligan, as a private member of this House, who in 1947 described the Budget of that year as involving an &ldquo;intolerable burden&rdquo;. How would he describe the imposition now if he spoke honestly to us of the much heavier burden which he himself proposes to cast, whether of his own volition or under pressure from the minor Coalition groups we do not know.  It is possible, of course, that in the present year the national income, measured in devalued pounds, will be higher than last year.  I think nobody can hope that there will be such an expansion of the national income that it will have any relationship with the expansion in the cost of Government services which this book reveals, much less meet the still further expansion we are entitled to anticipate in next year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hickey seemed to think that I was to some extent contradicting myself.  I do not think so.  I said earlier that the assertion that the expansion in Governing spending was most undesirable came from members of the present Government when they were in opposition and during their first year in Government and not from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the election campaign of 1947 the argument in favour of cutting the cost of Government came from those Parties that now constitute and support the Government.  The argument in favour of raising the level of Government expenditure, if the national income would support it, came from members of that Party which is now in opposition.  The same is true in relation to the cost of living.  It may be that the burden of the cost of Government services even as revealed by this Book of Estimates is not too heavy.  The Minister for Finance has argued that so long as the level of taxation is such that the total amount taken in taxes is less than 25 per cent. of the national income, then it is within the safety limit.  We are at <Col N="1045" /> that point now.  I do not know if the Minister for Finance will seek to balance his Budget this year by imposing new taxation or by further recourse to the money lenders, but I assume that if he decides to screw up his courage to the point of presenting an honest Budget to the House, then we shall have passed what he himself has described as the safety limit this year and we shall certainly be well beyond it next year.</P>
    <P>It is of course possible that there has been an expansion of Government revenue since devaluation sufficient to take care of the increase in the cost of Government services shown here. With the jump in the prices of imported goods I am sure that customs duties are yielding far more revenue than they yielded for several years past.  With devaluation and the rise in the cost of living and the enormous increased spending upon drink, tobacco and amusements, which so distressed the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it is likely that Government revenues, and particularly the revenues from beer, tobacco and amusements, will show a corresponding expansion.  But if the Minister for Finance intends to persist in the policy of borrowing to meet deficits, which he dislikes covering by taxation, and if he persists in the policy of regarding as capital charges recurring grants of various kinds&mdash;grants for housing, grants for rural electrification which are really in the nature of social service payments, and which create no Exchequer assets&mdash;then it is inevitable that the economic consequences of the policy he followed last year will be further intensified in the coming year. If the burden is to be lightened, the public must either be taught to be contented with a curtailment of Government services or there must be an expansion in production, if that is still practicable.  It is the efforts which the Government will make to effect an expansion in production to an extent which will enable the people to bear this extraordinary growth in the cost of Government which will be the real test of its competency.</P>
    <P>I do not know and I have not been able to discover by way of statement or parliamentary question here, what <Col N="1046" /> the Government is likely to do either in relation to agriculture or in relation to industry.  I do not think anybody really knows.  The Department of Industry and Commerce provides the country with a picture of indolence and indecision.  The Department of Agriculture gives a picture of feverish activity, and feverish is the right adjective, of a Minister running around in circles and getting nowhere.</P>
    <P>There has been some increase admittedly in the over-all output of agriculture, but that was inevitable following the ending of the war.  That increase occurred despite the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture to confuse the farmers as to the lines of development which were open to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the industrial question later.  There has not been in agriculture that increase in output which should have been possible having regard to the disappearance of the difficulties and the scarcities caused by the war.  There has not been that increase in output which we should have if we are to support any array of Government services at the present high level.  There has not been that increase in output which many of the E.C.A. experts now in the country are prepared to demonstrate to be practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true there has been a recovery in live stock.  The number of cattle has increased since 1947 by 6.5 per cent.  There has been an increase in the number of sheep, in the number of pigs and in poultry.  But, against that increase in live stock, there has been an all-round decrease in tillage.  Since 1947, the acreage under wheat has fallen by 37 per cent., the acreage under oats by 26 per cent., the acreage under barley by 16 per cent., the acreage under all corn crops by 29 per cent.  The acreage under potatoes is down by 12 per cent., under sugar <Col N="1047" /> beet by 3 per cent., and under all root crops by 12 per cent., and the acreage under flax has declined by 34 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from these figures that there has been, not so much a change in the volume of agricultural production, as a change in its character. Whether that change in character is desirable in present circumstances is a matter that can be more conveniently debated, and which I am sure will be debated, upon the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there has not been in agriculture that expansion in production which we believed would be possible after the war when we were planning our post-war programme and which we must get if we are to continue expanding the array of Government services in the manner in which we are now doing.</P>
      <P>In the case of industry, there has been an expansion in production. Whether that expansion was assisted or retarded by the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Industrial Development Authority is a matter about which there is room for considerable difference of opinion.  It seems to me, anyway, that, in the things that really matter, nothing has been done.  A great deal of discussion may have taken place.  We certainly have been continuously assured that these vital matters were under consideration but evidence of results has not been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>There has not been any expansion of our shipping service since 1947.  The only addition to the mercantile marine upon which the Government decided was the purchase of two small colliers. After our experience of the war, the previous Government took a decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Irish Shipping, Limited, alone should acquire sufficient tonnage to carry the minimum essential requirements of this country in circumstances in which tonnage of other nationality might not be procurable. We regarded that figure as representing <Col N="1048" /> the safety level below which our merchant shipping service should not be allowed to fall.  Quite clearly, there was in 1948 or 1949, by our successors, a decision taken to abandon that programme.</P>

      <P>There has been no development in transport.  How many months is it since we passed the Transport Act, since we heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce expounding upon the substantial capital investment in internal transport facilities that was contemplated, since we solemnly went through the farce of passing sections in an Act empowering the Minister for Finance to sanction and guarantee the raising of new capital by Córas Iompair Éireann for transport development purposes?

      <P>Certainly.  The progress we started is still going on, but I want to ask from the Government some assurance that whatever is putting the brake upon these other projects will be removed.  I do not know if it is in the Department of Industry and Commerce or in this Industrial Development Authority but somewhere, either because of positive decision <Col N="1049" /> or because of indecision, there is an impediment which it should be within the power of the Government to remove.</P>
      <P>I want to say this&mdash;I hope I will say it in the way that I would like to say it&mdash;we know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been ill for a long time.  I do not know if he is still ill.  It is noticeable that he has not been available to the House to answer Dáil questions since the Dáil resumed this year.  If it is so, that he has not got the physical strength to discharge the duties of the Department of Industry and Commerce, then I think the possibility of transferring him to some other post should be considered. I do not think it is fair to him that he should be left in a job of such importance if he has not got the physical health and strength to perform it.  I do not think it is fair to the country.  I do not think it is fair to all those who are engaged in industry in the country, who are being held up by inability to get clear decisions on matters vital to them from the Department, that the should remain there.</P>
      <P>May I say this?  I do not think it is fair to the Parliamentary Secretary because, no matter how he may try to relieve the Minister of work, no matter how he may try to increase the area of his own activities, he cannot possibly do so successfully when he has not got the authority of the Minister.  The position at the moment is that everything is at a standstill, whether because of some weakness in the Department or the ill-health of the Minister.  It is at a standstill because the one thing that will get things going&mdash;ability to get clear decisions&mdash;is not there.</P>
      <P>It is true, of course, that the Department of Industry and Commerce has been gutted of its responsibilities. A large part of its former work has been transferred to External Affairs.  A still larger part has been transferred to the Department of Agriculture, and now we find that responsibility for the turf programme is transferred from that Department to the Department of Social Welfare, no less.  Did anybody outside a madhouse conceive of such a thing?</P>

      <P>Anyway, what I have said is still true, that the Government are piling on new burdens on the country, but they are not, either through the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Industry and Commerce, taking the steps necessary to give the country the strength to bear these burdens.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has said on more than one occasion that our people are, of course, better off; we are producing more and exporting less and importing more.  There is, therefore, a larger volume of goods being consumed and that means that our people are better off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the measure of well-being, it is perfectly true.  We imported last year no less than £160,000,000&mdash;to the nearest million&mdash; worth of goods; we exported £70,000,000.  There was a deficiency there of £90,000,000.  To that extent we imported more than we exported and our imports last year exceeded our imports of the previous year by no less than £30,000,000.</P>
      <P>We are certainly consuming luxury goods in considerable quantities, far in excess of our means to buy them, and because we are permitting and encouraging and facilitating that enormous influx of luxury goods, the capital resources upon which we were relying to develop our productive capacity and to give us the strength to carry this array of Government services, are being wasted at the rate of £30,000,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister's estimate we had last year net external assets to the value of £225,000,000.  We used up £30,000,000 of them last year maintaining this level of luxury consumption in excess of what our current earnings would enable us to buy.  How long <Col N="1052" /> will they last if we continue to absorb them in maintaining current consumption at that rate and, when they are gone, what will happen?  We will have to face here a very serious lowering of the standard of living of our people, a lowering enforced through higher taxation, enforced through unemployment, and which will lead inevitably to another exodus, another flight from the country, a recurrence of the emigration which we knew in Cumann na nGaedheal times and which we were able to check or partially to check in 1932.</P>
    <P>All these things are the results of the financial policy which the Government are following.  Financial policies that in other countries would lead to inflationary pressure on prices, have in this country a different result, because of the integration of our currency with the currency of Great Britain, because of the absence of any exchange restrictions between this country and Great Britain, because there are, in fact, few other restrictions upon the flow of goods from Great Britain in here, and because of the existence of these accumulated sterling assets, upon which we can draw.  The effect of the financial policy of the Government, a policy which would produce inflation in other circumstances, is to expand the level of imports here because there are goods which the expanded purchasing power can buy.  The effect of that expansion is not found in prices, but in the increase in the influx of goods.  That is what has happened.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Finance deliberately took £20,000,000 out of the banks, or realised external assets, or drew out of the Counterpart Fund, and spent it, and that £20,000,000 is reflected in the expanded import of goods which took place in that year. He regarded that, not as a national disaster&mdash;that these limited resources of ours are being wasted in that way, these resources upon which we were relying to finance our future activities &mdash;but as evidence on which to base the declaration that the standard is living is rising.</P>
    <P>Will Deputies examine, from the published returns which we got this morning, the effect of public policy on <Col N="1053" /> the pattern of public expenditure? They came in here in 1948 and in so far as their actions proclaimed their policy they announced that it was preferable that our people should spend money on beer, tobacco and amusements than that they should spend it on food or clothing.  In so far as the Government, through taxation, can influence the pattern of public expenditure, that is what they set out to achieve.  They reduced the taxes on beer, tobacco and cinemas; they reduced the food subsidies and introduced a dual-price system for certain foods and they got, in 1949, the results which they set out to achieve, the results which they should have anticipated by that policy.</P>
    <P>We find that, in 1949, although there was an increase from £335,000,000 to £347,000,000 in total personal expenditure, expenditure upon food went down but, of course, expenditure on alcoholic beverages and tobacco went up from £37,000,000 to £40,000,000 and expenditure upon amusements went up from £3.9 million to £4.2 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce can go to an advertising agents' banquet and deplore these results, but these were inevitable consequences of the policy of the Government. They were short-sighted if at any time they anticipated any other results.  Do Deputies think it is still good policy so to arrange the pressure of taxation as to discourage, even in a period of expanding expenditure, outlay upon food and clothing and encourage a higher outlay upon beer, tobacco and amusements?</P>
    <P>This policy of expanding imports, expanding the gap between the level of imports and the level of exports, has also been represented as desirable in the national interest, that it means the repatriation of external assets, which we were told was so desirable and was the aim of Government policy.  If there was a repatriation of these assets in the form of productive equipment which would enable us to expand output, either to avoid imports or to increase exports to an extent that would compensate for the loss of revenue through the reduction of these assets, then it would be a matter that we would fully approve, but that is not what has happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> I want Deputies to get into their heads what is happening.  It is not merely has there been an increase in luxury spending but, in the main, the expansion of the imports in the last year took the form of increased outlay upon commodities that could not in any circumstances be described as capital goods.  Against that total increase of £30,000,000 in the value of imports we find that we paid £2,128,000 more for wheat.  We will be dealing with that again when the Supplementary Estimate for £1,500,000 additional subsidy for flour comes before us in a day or two.</P>

      <P>We are not getting far off the price that was paid for Argentine wheat.  We are only about £3 a ton off it at the moment.  Do not have any doubt about it whatever &mdash;the Minister for Agriculture is completely prejudiced against wheat.  This present policy of getting good Irish wheat crushed for animal feeding which is going on at the present time is deliberately designed to create a prejudice against Irish wheat in the minds of the Irish farmer.  It is no accident that the so-called guaranteed price for wheat now in operation is merely a device to ensure that the Irish farmer will get a lower price for his wheat than he would get in a free market.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture said, as a private Deputy, many years ago that he would not be found dead in a field of wheat.  Deputy Cogan quoted him here as saying last week that he still has the same opinion about wheat growing in this country as he always had.  If there are Deputies who do not agree with that policy but who allow him to exploit his prejudices in this way, then they are responsible more than he is for the consequences of what he is doing. As a result of what he is doing, we borrowed more dollars from America last year and with those dollars we bought more wheat, and of the <Col N="1055" /> increase in the trade gap the increased expenditure on wheat represented practically £2,250,000.  We spent £2,700,000 upon maize.</P>
      <P>I notice that even the American representatives who are sent here from the country in which, in the main, we buy that maize are telling us that we are mad to do it, telling us that it is madness not to be growing here to a far greater extent than we are the animal feeding stuffs that can replace these imports.  We spent $40,000,000 per year upon import of animal feeding.  That is all right so long as we can borrow these dollars, but next year our power to borrow dollars will cease.  What will happen after that if the present policy of the Minister for Agriculture is pursued&mdash; the policy which has, I admit, given us an increased number of live stock but a decrease in tillage?</P>
      <P>The next item on the list was raisins. We paid £700,000 more for raisins last year than in the previous year.  That is a fine capital investment!  That is going to enable us to expand our production and give employment to Irish workers.  We spent £1,500,000 more on sugar; over £1,000,000 more on tea, and millions more on tobacco.  We spent £500,000 more on cement, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce could not make up his mind what he was going to do, and £4,500,000 on textiles that we could have made for ourselves in our own mills.  Does anybody see in these figures evidence that the repatriation of these external assets, in that form, is going to enable such an expansion in our productive capacity that, in the course of time, we will have either an increase in exports or a decrease in imports to the extent that would offset the buying power we are now losing for that reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in one of his articles in an English magazine, estimated that against the £90,000,000 increase in imports and the £30,000,000 increase in the adverse trade balance and the £30,000,000 deficit in the total balance of payments, outlay upon capital works, including depreciation, repairs and maintenance and the maintaining of higher priced stocks, increased <Col N="1056" /> last year by £9,000,000&mdash;a modest £9,000,000, of which half was attributed to capital outlay by private enterprise.  Anybody with any knowledge of business conditions would see that financing the higher costs of stocks last year, without any addition to their volume, without any suggestion of stock piling of any kind, involved a far more considerable additional investment by industry than the £4,500,000 the Minister's calculations produced.</P>
    <P>Probably if the position were analysed and due allowance made for the effect of price increases, it is far more likely that there was a net disinvestment of capital in industry last year&mdash;a disinvestment represented by a diminution in the volume of stocks held.  It is obvious from these figures that the import excess was not due to any capital imports.  We are not building up our productive capacity.  We are certainly not getting increased production as a result of the wastage of these external assets which would make it possible to carry this exceptional expansion in the cost of Government. Is that policy to go on?  Last year the Minister for Finance spent, through his capital investment schemes, £20,000,000 more than he was able to draw off current savings.  As a result of that inflationary expenditure, we had this enormous growth in the volume of imports, as well as the intensification of the upsurge of prices. Are we going to have the same policy this year?  The Minister for Finance, in so far as I can interpret what he has said, actually contemplates increasing the volume of capital expenditure this year, despite the probability that the volume of savings has been curtailed.  Are we to get another inflationary surge as a result of that policy&mdash;another expansion of purchasing power reflected in a further increase of the flow of luxury imports, which must inevitably by reflected in higher prices and further frantic efforts by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to control that prices rise?</P>
    <P>If the Government is going to seek to borrow in 1951 the same sum as it borrowed in 1950, or a larger sum, by the same methods, then not merely <Col N="1057" /> will the consequences be the same but of a certainty they will be intensified. If that borrowing programme is carried out, there will be next year, even to a greater extent than there is now, a further draining off of the resources that should be available to private industry and private enterprise in commerce and agriculture&mdash;resources without which they cannot possibly give us that expansion in output which is necessary if we are to carry this burden of State expenditure. I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>The full implications of the question I propose to raise to-night cannot be fully exposed in the brief time I have at my disposal.  When they are fully exposed to the public, however, they will reveal a sorry episode, a tawdry episode and a disgraceful episode, such as, I am glad to say, never before disgraced the public administration of the State, and, it is to be hoped, such as will never occur again.  To understand the full significance of the matter, it is necessary for a moment to stress the fact that the officer who was the centre of this episode and who subsequently suffered for withstanding the pressure which was brought to bear on him was the secretary of one of the great Departments of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post of secretary of a Department is a very difficult one to fill conscientiously and effectively.  It is difficult because of the peculiar and intimate relationship which exists between him and the Minister in charge of his Department.  It is true that the secretary is the officer of the Minister; it is true that he must be loyal to the Minister; it is true that he must serve the Minister to the best of his ability and the utmost of his capacity; and it is true that, in everything relating to the business of his Department which it is lawful and proper for him to do in his capacity as secretary, he must be obedient to his Minister.  But the secretary of a Department is not bound to be the rubber stamp of his Minister; he is not bound to be a mere chiper in <Col N="1058" /> his Department; he is not bound to be the cat's-paw of his Minister or to permit himself to be used by the Minister to further his own private interests. The secretary of a Department is bound to be zealous, loyal, active and obedient in all lawful things, but he is also expected to be independent in his judgment, fearless in advising the Minister and firm in resisting anything which would jeopardise the probity and discipline which the people expect to be maintained in their public service.</P>
    <P>We must bear all this in mind in considering the subject matter of the question which I put to the Minister for Social Welfare to-day.  Briefly, that question asked whether a certain litigant&mdash;and, here, in order that there may be no confusion of identity or character, it is necessary for me to mention and to refer sometimes to the Minister for Social Welfare by his own proper name and surname&mdash;in these private civil procedings, to wit, Mr. William Norton, of Merlyn Park, Ballsbridge&mdash;endeavoured by pressure on the gentleman who was then secretary of the Department of Social Welfare to compel that officer to place at the disposal of Mr. Norton's lawyers certain confidential State papers in order to assist them in the prosecution of their client's suit.  The question was addressed by me to the Minister for Social Welfare because it was in virtue of his office as Minister for Social Welfare that this private litigant was able to bring pressure of this particularly despicable and reprehensible kind on a high servant of the State.</P>
    <P>The general character of the steps taken by Mr. Norton's agents and representatives in this matter is briefly indicated in the question.  They will, I think, on another occasion be expanded and proved in an irrefutable way.  The question, however, if I may recapitulate it, briefly asked whether Mr. Norton's solicitor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A reply came, a letter&mdash;the letter was obviously a reply to a prior refusal on the part of Mr. O'Donovan to comply with the request previously made by Mr. Gore-Grimes on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;and the reply was in these terms: &ldquo;In the first place, it is not an unauthorised communication, as you are authorised to send it to me by the Minister, who is your superior officer, and I receive it, not as a member of the public but as a servant of the Minister, inasmuch as I am a solicitor engaged by him to conduct this piece of litigation.&rdquo;  Mark the terms, the emphatic terms of this letter.  &ldquo;It is not an unauthorised <Col N="1062" /> communication, as you are authorised to send it to me by the Minister, who is your superior officer.&rdquo;  Would any solicitor in his right mind and in his full senses and in control of his faculties write in that mandatory&mdash;and, indeed, minatory&mdash;tone, if he had not received the explicit direction of his client to do so?  Someone is lying in regard to this matter, whether it is the reputable legal practitioner of high standing in his profession, or someone else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was the Minister for Social Welfare, in his personal capacity, giving an address at Merlyn Park, Ballsbridge, Dublin, Mr. O'Donovan's superior officer, as Mr. Gore-Grimes emphasised in his letter of June 22nd, 1949, a passage from which I have just put before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not actually present but I understand from the counsel and solicitors that in the course of the legal action they had occasion to see Mr. O'Donovan.  I was not present when they saw him; I declined to be present on any such occasion.  As a result of the interview which took place between the solicitor and counsel and Mr. O'Donovan, the solicitor received from Mr. O'Donovan three copies of a memorandum supplied by the late Secretary of the Department.  Setting out what?  The solicitors went there for the purpose of getting a picture of what kind of work the Department was doing and what were its activities, and as a result of that discussion the Secretary of the Department voluntarily supplied to were its activities, and as a result of that discussion the Secretary of the Department voluntarily supplied to the solicitors three copies of a document being a description of the work of the Department of Social Welfare. Here it is.  Anybody who likes can see it.  It is all in the annual report of the Department of Social Welfare, which is available to all to read.  The solicitor wrote thanking him for those documents, saying: &ldquo;I will see you later.&rdquo;  That was on the 20th June. On the 22nd June the Secretary of the Department wrote to the Solicitor, saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;At our recent discussion, I promised to give you a background picture of the Department's work as you felt that it would be most helpful in the preparation of your brief. To that end, I have had the enclosed notes prepared on the progress of the White Paper and the various reciprocity agreements.  Bearing in <Col N="1066" /> mind the secrecy imposed on civil servants, I am now extremely worried&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;as to the propriety of allowing such information to go outside the Department except on a specific direction of the court.  I am seeking advice on the matter and, in the meantime, I would ask you to treat the information in the strictest confidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whereupon the solicitor said, of course, that in any case the document was just rubbish.  It consists of an explanation of the Social Welfare Act, 1948, which anybody can look at, an explanation of the work of the Department and five Press statements which at that time were a year old and had already appeared in the newspapers. That is what the late Secretary of the Department sent. This rubbish, this pure unadulterated rubbish, in the circumstances of the day and at the time the case was being heard, is being twisted and described in Mr. MacEntee's question as information of a confidential character. Anybody who likes can read this document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The solicitor regarded these documents as rubbish, which it was.  No documents in the Department of Social Welfare were of any value to the solicitor.  He merely wanted a picture of the kind of work done in the Department and the Minister's association with it.</P>

There is nothing confidential in them and there was no impropriety whatever either on my part, on the part of the solicitor or, in fact, in my judgment, on the part of the Secretary of the Department in issuing these documents to the solicitor because they contained well-known facts which are in the possession of everybody.
