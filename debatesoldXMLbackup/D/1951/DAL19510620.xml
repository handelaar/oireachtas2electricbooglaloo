      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the appalling economic and employment position in the towns of Youghal and Fermoy, he will give the particular assistance of his Department and issue instructions to the Industrial Development Authority for the purpose of providing the establishment of industries in both towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the grave scarcity of sheet steel which is already causing grave unemployment in Messrs.  Fords of Cork and other manufacturing industries, he will proceed immediately with the proposals to extend Irish Steel, Limited, Haulbowline, so as to put in the balance of the necessary machinery to put the sheet and rolling mills there into production at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that difficulties have arisen due to the present scarcity of sheet steel.  The question of production of sheet steel by Irish Steel Holdings, Limited is under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> In so far as Messrs.  Ford are concerned, I am informed that it is not correct that there is unemployment amongst the workers of that concern but in any event, the manufacture of sheet steel at Haulbowline would be unlikely to affect the assembly of motor vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is <Col N="175" /> aware of the urgent demand for adequate electric power at Cahirciveen and the surrounding districts; and, if so, whether, in view of the fact that an inexhaustible supply of turf is available at Cahirciveen, Ballinskelligs and Portmagee, he will take immediate steps to establish a generating station in the area referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction of a turf-burning generating station in South Kerry is not included in the present programme of the Electricity Supply Board.  I understand that both the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna see considerable practical difficulties in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The construction of a generating station and the supply of adequate power to the area are separate questions. Apart from present temporary difficulties affecting electricity supplies generally, the Electricity Supply Board will be able to meet all the requirements of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that an official canvass of the Beaufort area (including Listry) is at present being carried out and it is expected that the results will be available in time for the area to be considered by the board for selection for development towards the end of this year.  It is not possible at <Col N="176" /> this stage to indicate whether the area will qualify for selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the Milltown area has been considered for selection by the board on a number of occasions, but has been rejected as the ratio of fixed charge revenue to capital cost is low.  A further more intensive canvass is now being made over an extended area in an effort to secure a better financial return and the position of the area will again be considered in the light of the results of the further canvass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Electricity Supply Board that an official canvass has been completed in the Kilgarvan-Kenmare area, that the network required to supply the householders has been designed and costed, and that the area will be considered for selection by the board towards the end of the year on the basis of the ratio of fixed charge revenue to capital cost.  It is not, of course, possible at this stage to indicate whether the area will qualify for selection when next considered by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Mitchelstown Co-operative Agricultural Society, Limited, was granted a building licence on 6th March, 1950, for the erection of premises for the production of bacon. Later the society intimated that it proposed to defer the erection of the bacon factory but that it wished to put up premises for the manufacture of cheese for which there was a growing export market.  The licence for the erection of a bacon factory was cancelled, and a licence for the erection of a cheese factory was issued on 2nd March, 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the question refers to the partial repayment of duty allowed in respect of petrol used in certain agricultural tractors and farm engines.  To meet the recent increase of 2d. per gallon in the duty on petrol, repayment is now allowed at the increased rate of 8d. per gallon instead of the former 6d. per gallon. No question of legislation arises.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he will accept the recommendation of the Waterford Board of Public Assistance that a new general hospital should be built in Waterford City instead of the proposed alterations to the old hospital which exists there at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In July, 1948, when the short - term programme for hospital building was drawn up, it was conveyed to the Waterford Board of Public Assistance that in view of the need for making rapid progress with a limited programme of hospital building, including only works of the greatest urgency, the provision of a new general hospital for Waterford, although desirable, would have to be deferred.  The local authority were, however, informed that a grant of two-thirds of the cost of improving the present county hospital would be made available from the Hospitals' <Col N="181" /> Trust Fund and the view was expressed to them that when the improvements had been carried out it should be possible to bring the service available to patients in the hospital up to a standard approaching that which would be provided in the new building.</P>
      <P>At a conference on the 22nd February last with representatives of the Waterford Board of Public Assistance this question was again discussed and I understand that the local representatives then accepted the position that as a new hospital providing for the numbers at present accommodated in the county hospital could not be realised in the immediate future there was no alternative to proceeding on the basis of rehabilitating the existing structures with a view to bringing the hospital up to a reasonable standard. In view of the position as to commitments on the Hospitals' Trust Fund and the large volume of work yet to be undertaken as part of the short-term programme of urgent works already settled, I feel that there is no alternative to proceeding by way of improvement rather than of replacement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that what the Deputy has in mind is the fact that in recent months the Kerry Board of Conservators has, in the discharge of its statutory functions, taken steps in the Cromane area to terminate the netting of salmon during the weekly close time, the use of pusher nets with meshes in excess of the prescribed size limit, and the use of nets as fixed engines.  The prohibition of netting in the weekly close time and of the use of nets as fixed engines is embodied in the Fisheries Acts and applies generally throughout the country, and I cannot undertake to consider amendment of the Acts to meet the wishes of the Cromane fishermen alone.  The Cromane fishermen are of course free to fish with draft nets at all lawful times, and they are not subjected to any more inconvenience or hardship in the administration of the Fisheries Acts than fishermen in any other part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt most Deputies are aware that a scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service commenced to function in June, 1950, and that discussions on a claim from certain Civil Service grades for an increase in rates of remuneration began at the conciliation level in November, 1950.  Accommodation, however, was not reached in these discussions and ultimately, on the 20th April, 1951, my predecessor referred the Civil Service claim to the Civil Service Arbitration Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service Arbitration Board <Col N="193" /> presented its report to the Government on the 24th May last.  A copy of the report has been laid before the Dáil and it is thus available to Deputies who may desire to give it closer consideration. The practical effect of it will be to increase the cost of the Civil Service by in round figures £1,242,000 in an ordinary financial year, but, as the award is made retrospective to the 15th January last, by £1,500,750 in this present year.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously with deciding to implement the award, the preceding Government decided to negotiate a settlement of the claims of the higher officers of the Civil Service who were excluded from the arbitration, and such a settlement was, in fact, negotiated, again with retrospective effect as from the 15th January last.</P>
    <P>Both commitments, estimated to cost annually £1,395,000, are being honoured&mdash;at a total cost in the present financial year of £1,685,000.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the findings of the Civil Service Arbitration Board upward revisions of the pay and allowances of the Defence Forces and of the Garda Síochána have also to be considered. It is not possible yet to say definitely what the increases are likely to amount to, but the total figure for the two services will be in the neighbourhood of £600,000 for an ordinary year.  For this year, however, since the revised scales will have effect as from the 15th January, the actual cost falling to be borne will be about £700,000.</P>
    <P>The net position accordingly is that by reason of the arbitration award, and the consequential revisions in the pay and allowances of the Defence Forces and of the Garda Síochána which it involves, an additional expenditure of almost £2,400,000 must be incurred in this financial year.  I should say that this charge did not appear amongst the commitments mentioned in the Budget in explanation of the allowance of £1,500,000 for expenditure which had not been provided for: this allowance, in fact, was described as &ldquo;already fully committed&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is intended to meet a particular situation which has arisen out of the general election.  Three of the Budget Resolutions, that is, those dealing with <Col N="196" /> income-tax, surtax, mineral hydrocarbon light oils and hydrocarbon oils, were given statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.  When the Dissolution took place on the 7th May the three Resolutions in question lost their statutory effect under a provision in the same Act. The purpose of this Bill is to remove difficulties and uncertainties arising from this position by enacting that the Resolutions in question shall have and be deemed always to have had statutory effect, and to make other incidental or consequential provisions.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a short Bill.  It is clearly essential that it should be passed as a matter of urgency.  As the House.  I think, will recollect, there were precedents for this proposed legislation in 1938 and 1944.</P>
      <P>I should say also that under Section 1 of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, the Government made an Order in May last to the same effect as the Customs and Excise Resolutions which lost their statutory effect on the Dissolution.  Having regard to the main provisions of the Bill, it is being proposed in the Bill that this Order shall cease to have effect.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputies have already been well informed of the purpose of the Bill?  However, the immediate purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the conversion of the four National Loans which are to be redeemed on the 15th July, 1951, but the Bill is phrased in general terms so that its provisions will apply to future conversion operations as well.  The four loans which fall to be redeemed on 15th July are the 5 per cent.  Second National Loan, 1950-1960, the 4½ per cent.  Third National Loan, 1950-1970, the 4 per cent. Conversion Loan, 1950-1970, and the 4 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds, 1950-1960. It will be noted that in every case the first redemption date fell in 1950. Thereafter, as the House will understand, the loans can be redeemed at any time before the final redemption date on giving three months' calendar notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Notice of the Government's intention to redeem the four loans was given on 13th April last, and the matter was referred to in the Budget statement on 2nd May.  I think that is sufficient justification for introducing the Bill to the House and for asking the House to give me all stages to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got a copy of the Bill before me, but there is one aspect of it to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  It appears to me that inasmuch as this Bill is designed to be one of general application and therefore calculated to become part of the conversion machinery, it is appropriate to raise the question as to whether it is not perfectly correct, and, I think, desirable, to provide that, where a conversion operation is in contemplation, the holder of stocks to be converted might not, with propriety, be deemed to desire to convert, unless he applies for <Col N="199" /> redemption at par.  I should imagine that the vast majority of holders of stock in the normal course of Government conversions which are ordinarily made at the current rates do, in fact, convert.</P>
      <P>While no one would for a moment desire to abridge the right of any stockholder to claim cash&mdash;and that can be made abundantly clear&mdash;it does seem to involve a lot of unnecessary &ldquo;goings on&rdquo; to stipulate that everybody who desires to convert shall specifically request to have conversion applied to his particular holding.  I know that there is some antediluvian view that the essential quality of the security is in some degree vitiated if everybody is not required to come up and do a <i>pas seul</i> in the Department of Finance if he wants to get conversion, but it appears to me that rational citizens who want conversion and no hugger-mugger about it would much prefer to have conversion effected on the clear understanding that, if they wanted their cash, a ½d. postcard would ensure that it would be paid to them on the due date.  I suggest that the Minister might consider introducing that principle into our conversion legislation on a permanent basis.  I believe it would save a lot of time and annoyance for harassed taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the absence of this provision from the Bill, a provision which formed, I may say, part of the first piece of legislation to regulate the conversion of a Government loan which I introduced in 1935, can be described as antediluvian.  If it is antediluvian, I regret it, and I apologise on behalf of my predecessor for the fact that the Bill is of that character.  I raised the same question with the Department and was informed that the position is that the prospectus in the case of each loan provided for positive repayment and, therefore, in order that there should be no suggestion that the State did not fulfil its commitments to the original investors and holders of Government securities, it was decided that the holder must take positive steps and ask that his holding should be converted to the new issue.  That, I <Col N="200" /> am told, is the position, but it might not be any harm if we passed the Second Reading and dealt with this on Report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is foolish of the Minister for Finance to be trying to score silly little points when I direct his attention to this matter.  Of course, he knows that I know that in his Conversion Act the provision which I recommend was present.  He knows that I know that in this Conversion Bill the same provision is absent.  He knows that I know, and he knows that I know that he knows, that there are two well supported views amongst financial thinkers&mdash;one is that if a prospectus contains an assurance to the subscriber to a loan that on a certain given date he will receive cash, to do anything but give him cash is in some measure to abridge or depart from the undertaking contained in the prospectus.  That is what I call the antediluvian view.  It seems to me that what matters is that the undertaking given in the prospectus be honoured in the letter and in the spirit. But the public convenience should be consulted and the 1,000 holders of national loan should not be put to the trouble of correspondence with the Department of Finance simply to salve the antediluvian conscience of certain strict financial theorists who maintain that the value of the security is in some degree abridged unless this very specific undertaking is carried out to the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, what happens is that some citizen of this country or elsewhere owns £100 worth of stock, and unless he notifies through his bank manager or directly to the Department of Finance on the appropriate form that he wants conversion, he will get his £100 in cash back into his hands and will have to go through all the abracadabra of reinvestment.  If the suggestion I made to the Minister for Finance were adopted, due notice would be <Col N="202" /> given, by publication to all, that the redemption date was so and so.  If they wanted cash, all they had to do was send a halfpenny postcard to ask the bank manager or stockbroker or anyone they cared to instruct, to send it in.  If they did not want cash, by presenting their stock certificate they would get a stock certificate of similar amount of the conversion loan.  Now, so far as I know, if they do want to convert, they must present their stock certificate; if they do want cash, they must present their stock certificate.  All I want to do is to save the individual citizen and the Treasury the expense and annoyance of going through a lot of useless abracadabra, and I do not believe the provision I suggest will reduce the intrinsic value of any loan made by this or any succeeding Government by the millionth of a millionth of 1 per cent. of human confidence. I imagine the proviso has operated elsewhere.  It has certainly operated in this country in respect of previous loans and I deprecate this unnecessary rigidity which it is sought to revive in this Bill.  If it is to be here revived, it does suggest that on a previous conversion operation the Government of the country then in office in some measure departed from the strict spirit of rectitude&mdash;which I do not believe it did.  I believe that it took a very sensible businesslike move in the right direction and I would deplore a reversion to the archaic and antediluvian procedure here envisaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether to regard it as a tribute to my sweet receptiveness that Deputy Dillon should consider me more susceptible to persuasion in regard to this matter than my predecessor was.  The Bill as I am introducing it is the Bill which was submitted to the Government by my predecessor and approved, I assume, in the exercise of its collective function, by the Government as a whole for introduction here.  I do not want to base the argument for the section as it stands merely on that fact.  I <Col N="203" /> think we should have regard to what Deputy Dillon has said himself.  He said that the conditions upon which a loan is issued should be honoured in the letter and in the spirit.  I am not so sure that the law would take very much account of the spirit in which a public undertaking is given, but it certainly would take into consideration the letter and the express terms in which a public undertaking is given. The undertaking which was associated with, I think, all the loans covered by this conversion operation is this, that the Government undertook to redeem the stock at par upon giving due notice after a certain date.  That was the undertaking that was given and it is to honour that undertaking in the letter and, I think, in the spirit, too&mdash;if I may introduce the spiritual element in this context &mdash;that the section has been drafted in its present form.  Redemption is not conversion and a conversion operation is certainly not redemption. When we talk about conversion what we really mean is that we are offering to the holders of existing stock an opportunity to make a fresh investment upon terms different to those attaching to their original investment.  In these circumstances I think that my predecessor was wise and I think that it is in fact an improvement from the point of view of the stockholders and investors on the Act of 1935 for which I was responsible.</P>

Deputy McGilligan should not endanger his reputation as a lawyer and as a debater by interjections of that sort.  This has nothing to do with the legality of the 1935 Act; what it has to do with is the question whether, from the point of view of the general investor, Section 3 of the 1951 Bill is an improvement on Section 3 of the 1935 Act.  As author of the 1935 Act, I am prepared to concede to Deputy McGilligan the credit of having improved upon my handiwork.  That is <Col N="204" /> a tribute which will, shall we say, enhance the reputation of Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's point not only relates to this Bill in its application to the four loans which have been made but relates to other loans that may fall for conversion later on.  When we are passing general legislation would it not be prudent at this point to introduce a clause such as is in the 1935 Act in relation to the four loans?  These four loans had a clause regarding redemption which, in the Minister's view, barred automatic conversion, but suppose that a new prospectus for a new loan is issued in different terms and the matter the Minister spoke of disappears, how will the Act be amended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to deal with a hypothetical case.  The position is that every loan which has been issued by the State contains a clause providing for redemption in the same terms.  If at some future date a loan is issued which does not provide for redemption I will leave the person responsible for that loan to negotiate with the prospective investors and to tell them what he intends to do in the event of a conversion operation if he gets their money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot say, however, that these loans will contain a clause in exactly the same terms. The question was whether, as we are passing legislation of a general type, it would not be wise to provide for redemption.  In addition to that may I ask, if every loan hitherto issued contained terms which bind the present Minister to Section 3, how did he avoid bringing in Section 3 in 1935?</P>

      <P>The real fact is that the Minister for Finance has not the faintest notion of what he is talking about.  He puts up a brave bluff, tries to pick up some information as he goes and then spouts it out.  He frequently mishears the information tendered to him and when he spouts that out he must go back on it, but there is no need for him to get into a fuss or pother about it.  The position is that in 1935 Dáil Éireann enacted a conversion Act of limited application; in 1951 a Bill is submitted to Dáil Éireann which is designed to lay down machinery which is to apply generally in respect of the loans mentioned in this Bill and in respect of any future conversion operations which the Government or their successors may have in contemplation.  In that situation I think it is reasonable to say to the Minister for Finance: did the 1935 proviso not function satisfactorily? If it did, would you not think it prudent to incorporate it into the permanent legislation which is being considered?  There is no need for the Minister to hop about from foot to foot or to explode all over the place because I think that, on reflection, he will probably come to agree with me.  He is a bit fussed and bothered now.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee. God forbid that I should ever be Minister for Finance, but if between here and the Seanad perhaps the Minister simmers down and has time to think this over he might consider the advisability of incorporating in permanent legislation the proposal I make.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot, for the life of me, understand why the big Bank of Ireland is being placed, under the terms of this Bill, in such a privileged position, particularly under Section 7 of the Bill.  I dare say the Minister will admit that the Bank of Ireland, as known, is in reality the Bank of England, which to-day is under the control of the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the British Socialist Government.  I cannot understand why our new Minister for Finance can come up and ask for the special privileges against possible costly blunders which he is seeking in Section 7 of this Bill. Will the Minister, if he can&mdash;I do not want to press him if he cannot, but he should do it later on if he cannot do it now&mdash;give the House and the country the amount of the rake-off which will pass into the coffers of the Bank of Ireland as a result of the commission and the monopoly which has been handed to them under the terms of the Bill as well as under Section 7 of the Bill?  Section 7 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act and the regulations made thereunder shall be a full and sufficient indemnity and discharge to the Bank of Ireland and the officers thereof for all things done by the said bank in pursuance of this Act or of any regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could he give us, in the first instance, the approximate amount that would pass from the taxpayers' pockets to the Bank of Ireland for the commission they are getting under the terms of this Bill?  I presume it would be impossible for him to give the approximate amount of the costly blunders that may be made by the Bank of Ireland in connection with their duties under the terms of this Bill.  No other Minister could give us that.  However, he is asking for too much when he is asking us to indemnify them under any regulations that may be made under this Bill.  Is there any obligation on the Government of to-day or was there any obligation on the Government of last week or on the Government that <Col N="209" /> was in existence when the present Minister was previously Minister for Finance to give this monopoly to the Bank of Ireland which is actually the Bank of England controlled by the British Socialist Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will wait, or &ldquo;simmer down&rdquo; as I was told.  The position is quite simple; the Bank of Ireland happen to be the Government bankers.  They keep the register of the national loans, and it is through them that repayments of the loan will be made.  It is to indemnify them for anything that they do under the Bill in regard to registers and in regard to repayments that Section 7 is included.  They are acting as agents of the Minister in relation to the keeping of the register and the general conduct of the conversion, but every other bank and also stockbrokers will receive the same commission as the Bank of Ireland in relation to applications for repayments.  So all this edifice which Deputy Davin reared so laboriously collapses; there is nothing in it.</P>

I presume that it is not because he is now being converted over to the other <Col N="210" /> view that he is going to prompt the Government not to indemnify these agents against what might be wrongfully-conceived proceedings taken by some person against the Bank of Ireland in respect of this conversion operation.</P>

      <P>On the section.  In the conversion terms of every Government loan, Ministers have always provided that a commission is paid to bankers and stockbrokers.  Here in our country, I do not think that that provision has ever been extended to solicitors.  It was extended, I know, on the other side for the big war loan conversion, 1931, to solicitors.  So far as the solicitors themselves are concerned, it is reasonably immaterial because if they are not paid by the <Col N="212" /> Treasury, so to speak, they are paid by their clients.</P>
      <P>However, it is a matter that affects clients, particularly in trust cases when trustees find it necessary to consult their solicitors about the investments. A point which would often weigh with trustees is whether, if they consulted their solicitors, the solicitors' charges would be paid by way of commission on a conversion.  It might assist the Minister in his operations and it would prevent trustees from having to realise capital funds for the purpose of meeting any capital cost that might be involved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy desires, for the information of the House, some information as to, shall we say, the result of the 4 per cent. conversion operation in November, 1935, in conversion of the 5 per cent.  First National Loan.  The position was somewhat complicated by the fact that an offer for cash subscription was made at the same time as the conversion offer in order to provide the cash required to meet redemption.  I think we can say without any exaggeration that the conversion operation itself was very successful, the amount of the stock issued for cash being only about £187,000 and the amount of the stock converted being £6,812,000.  The total amount of 4 per cent. conversion stock issued was £7,000,000.  Therefore, you could say that almost 97 per cent, of the stock so offered was converted.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to confirm an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order which was made on the 21st November, 1950.  As the House is aware, these Orders have to be confirmed by legislation within <Col N="222" /> eight months.  This Order, which is now being confirmed, applies to electric water heaters.  The existing duty covered electric water heaters up to 28 gallons capacity, but as the firm manufacturing them has extended its operations, and is now able to undertake the manufacture of these heaters up to 100 gallons capacity, it was decided by my predecessor to grant an extension of the duty to cover these larger heaters.  This is a firm which operates at Dunleer in the County Louth.  It is manufacturing these commodities and is an enterprising firm which has extended its activities within the last few years.  It is now giving considerable employment in that locality and deserves encouragement. There have been no complaints about the price or quality of its products which are both satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £230,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Beyond mentioning a few facts in regard to the figures, I do not intend to make a very long statement.  The Estimates, as the Dáil is aware, were prepared under the directions of my predecessor in office.  The total amount required under the seven Estimates is almost exactly the same as that required for the year 1950-51, some of the Estimates showing small increases which are offset by corresponding reductions in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount sought for old age and blind pensions&mdash;£7,240,000&mdash;shows an increase of £91,500, and is based on an anticipated average of 164,000 pensioners, as against 162,000 pensioners provided for in 1950-51.  When this Estimate was being prepared, the quarterly statistics relating to old age and blind pensions had shown a continuous upward trend in numbers and cost since the winter of 1946-47.  At the 30th September, 1950, the actual number of pensions in payment was 161,509.  Since the Estimate was framed, however, the figures for the 31st September, 1950, and 31st March, <Col N="224" /> 1951, have come to hand and show decreases to 161,232 and 156,638 respectively. The decreases were due to deaths of pensioners which, in these two quarters, amounted to the unprecedentedly high total of 11,917.  This figure exceeds by more than 4,000 the numbers of deaths in the two previous winter half-years and it exceeds by 2,300 the number of pensioners who died in the bad winter of 1946-47.</P>
    <P>I have had the death rate for old age and blind pensioners over the past 20 years examined and find that for the year ending 31st March, 1951, 120 per 1,000 pensioners was the highest, while the rates in the three previous years, viz., 92, 89, and 94 per 1,000 were the lowest.  This unprecedented and unfortunate death rate will affect the Estimate already made.  It now seems probable that, in all the circumstances, there will be considerably less than an average of 164,000 pensioners in the year 1951-52 and a lesser sum paid in old age pensions as a consequence.  In view, however, of the fact that the Government has introduced legislation which will increase pension rates and effect further modifications of the means test and that, in consequence, a Supplementary Estimate will later be required to give effect to the increase, I do not propose now to reduce the provision sought for old age and blind pensions.</P>
    <P>The provision for children's allowances shows a slight increase on the amount provided last year.  This is a continuation of the trend over recent years in which there has been a steady increase in the number of children's allowances claimed.</P>
    <P>There is a small increase in the amount required for unemployment insurance and an appreciable decrease for unemployment assistance in the current year as compared with the amount required last year.  The Estimate is based on the unemployment position at the end of 1950.  There is a small increase in the amount required for widows' and orphans' pensions which reflects the continued increase in the number of these pensions in course of payment.  There is also a small increase in the amount required for <Col N="225" /> national health insurance which is due mainly to the increase in the Exchequer grant in respect of expenditure on benefits and administration. The expenditure on benefits of which the Exchequer provides two-ninths has shown an increase in recent years, due, in part, to an increase in the number of insured persons and, in part, to the increasing popularity of the non-cash additional benefits such as the dental, optical and hospital benefits.</P>
    <P>The last Vote with which I have to deal is that for Miscellaneous Social Welfare Services.  The increase in the amount required under this Vote is due to an anticipated increase in the expenditure on school meals by way of grants under the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930.</P>
    <P>The trend of expenditure on social welfare has been upwards for the last 20 years.  It is interesting to note that the expenditure from the Exchequer on all the services now administered by the Department has varied almost uniformally over the years.  In 1931-32 it was £3,351,000; in 1947-48 it was £11,262,000 and in 1950-51 it was £12,762,000, so that we have for the 16 years from the end of March, 1932, to the end of March, 1948, an average increase in expenditure of £500,000 per year.  In respect of the three years from the end of March, 1948, to the end of March, 1951, we have an exactly similar increase of £500,000 per year. It would, therefore, appear that the late Government had maintained the average increase that was there for the previous 16 years.  My predecessor in office, Deputy Norton, was able to maintain the pace in increase of social services that was set by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>To-day, a Chinn Comhairle, I introduced a Bill dealing with old age pensions which will be circulated, I hope, in a few days.  It is practically on the lines of the proposals made by my predecessor when he was dealing with the Social Welfare Bill on Second Stage earlier this year.  The Government intends to bring in a comprehensive Bill on social welfare as soon as it can be drafted.  It will be on the same lines as those given by my predecessor on the occasion of the Second Reading <Col N="226" /> of the Social Welfare Bill that was brought before the Dáil.  No time will be lost in bringing that comprehensive Bill before the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be unreasonable to expect the Minister, after a short time in office, to give us any detailed survey of the Department of Social Welfare as time was not available for any such survey by the Minister.  As he quite rightly points out, the Estimates are sound, having been prepared by the previous Government. He can rely upon the prudence of the officials.  That must be a great source of consolation to him to-day and should console his spirits during the remainder of the financial year.</P>
      <P>I would like, at this stage, to express my very sincere appreciation of the work of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare during my association with them.  The present officers of my Department worked zealously and enthusiastically.  While I made inroads on their time and probably on their patience and on their toleration, I must say that in return I got only kindness, co-operation and understanding from them.  I would like, therefore, to put on the records of this Dáil my very sincere appreciation of the help and assistance which I got from these officers.  I feel sure that the new Minister, who is not unfamiliar with the Department, will find he will get the same loyalty and the same co-operation from an excellent set of officials.</P>
      <P>The Minister was getting rather puppish when he came to talk about old age pensions and social services generally.  One thing we did in the past three years was to push the whole question of social services into the forefront of national affairs.  We have taken social welfare services out of the ruck and brought them up to the top of the queue.  If there has been a wide discussion on social services during the past three years, it was because of the manner in which we brought those services to the forefront, making them what they are in most other progressive countries, namely, a prominent subject for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have during the past three years, by means of the White Paper and by means of the discussion which <Col N="227" /> it aroused, and even by the heat which it sometimes engendered, given people an appreciation of the principles of social security and of the difficulties which must be surmounted in any intelligent approach to the application of an enduring scheme of social security in the special circumstances of this country.  I think that is a considerable achievement.  I think that is something which must help any Minister and any staff concerned with disseminating a wide knowledge of social security and social welfare generally.  I think during the past three years, however much we may have differed as to the proper approach to problems affecting social security or however much we may have felt that taking a different course would be a wiser line, we nevertheless succeeded in attracting public attention to a problem which will tend more and more to absorb the time of Parliament and which will tend to appear more and more in the forefront of public discussion.</P>
    <P>I think, whatever view we may take individually of social security, that is all to the good in a country like ours, which is almost invariably inclined to turn its back on problems because many of our people are unfortunately too lazy to study the difficulties involved in the solution of them.  Anything that contributes to a better and a broader understanding of social security, irrespective of whether it is <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i> a particular scheme, has much to commend it because knowledge gained of social security, or indeed of any other problem, is the lightest of all burdens to carry.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, and I welcome his statement, that he will introduce an old age pensions Bill which will follow on the lines indicated by me here a short time ago.  I feel, and I am glad that he feels the same, that an increase is due to old age pensioners and blind pensioners.  We had proposed in the Social Welfare Bill introduced by us to increase the amount to £1 per week and to modify the means test.  I am glad that that part of our programme will be continued.  Any Bill designed to provide for these additional benefits <Col N="228" /> will receive a warm welcome from both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the Minister frankly that I do not like the ring in that portion of his speech relating to the main scheme of comprehensive social security.  From what the Minister said and from the economics on which his own scheme is based, I have a feeling that it will be a long time before we see a comprehensive scheme of social security.  Probably this is not the time to become acrimonious but the Minister will find, now that he has the service of the officials of his Department at his disposal, that he made a trifling error of over £3,000,000 in his calculation of the cost of widows' and orphans' pensions when he hurriedly prepared the scheme he adumbrated when the Dáil adjourned after the discussion on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.  Can the Minister to-day be any more precise than he was then and can he give us now some indication as to when we are likely to see a comprehensive scheme?</P>
    <P>As Minister, it fell to my lot to decide hundreds of matters affecting the introduction of the last scheme. All these decisions in principle have been taken.  An administrative staff was set up for the purpose of devising an administrative machine for the implementation of a comprehensive scheme.  Records of all kinds have been made.  Plans were made to introduce the scheme and I had hoped myself that it would be possible to introduce a comprehensive scheme in January next.  True, my officials thought I was cutting the time rather fine.  They asked that such a scheme should be deferred until 1st April because they felt the task I was imposing on them was a very heavy one. But it was my view all the time that we should aim at 1st January next; their view was that we should aim at 1st April.</P>
    <P>I would like to know now from the Minister if he can give us some indication to-day as to when he thinks his scheme is likely to come into operation. I would also like to know whether we may assume that the scheme will <Col N="229" /> follow the lines indicated by the Minister when he was in opposition.  If that is so, then the Minister of course has made no provision for certain services included in my Bill.  He made no provision for the retirement pension which was a cardinal principle of my Bill.  Are we to understand then that retirement pensions will disappear completely in the new Bill?  Are we to understand that those issues upon which the Minister was silent when he issued his counter scheme will not be embodied in the new scheme?  As the Minister has pulled aside the curtain to some extent in revealing his intentions in respect of social security, perhaps he would give us some indication now as to whether we may definitely assume that the Minister intends to kill the scheme of retirement pensions at 65 and whether he intends to do nothing in respect of the other services which were not mentioned in the alternative scheme submitted by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to be complimentary to Deputy Norton but he did not take it as a compliment.  I said that he maintained during his term of office the pace set by Fianna Fáil in relation to social security.  Over our 16 years we had increased social services by £500,000 and Deputy Norton continued that for three years.  Deputy Norton has said that he has prepared public opinion for social welfare.  That is something to claim and I am grateful to the Deputy that we have public opinion on our side.</P>
      <P>With regard to the comprehensive scheme, I have not been able to find out how long its preparation will take. I am anxious that there should be no delay.  I think myself that it should not take very long to change our legislation in such a way as to relate it to the proposals made by me on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party when that Party was in opposition.  I have not yet succeeded in finding out from the staff of the Department or from the Draftsman's Office whether or not they consider it to be a very big job.  I sincerely hope we will have the Bill passed through the Dáil before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> Perhaps I was mistaken in my calculations, but if the scheme costs more than I anticipated, I am sure Deputy Norton will not object, however much he might have objected as a Minister.  If I made that mistake when speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil, then we will stand over the mistake.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the big question of retiring allowances.  I did make it quite clear that any insured person would not suffer as a result of the changes proposed by me.  I said that the rates payable by means of unemployment or sickness benefits, as the case may be, would be as high as the retiring allowances.  I do not think it will make any great difference to a person between 65 and 70 if the amount of money he receives is the same, irrespective of whether it is called unemployment insurance, sickness benefit or retiring allowance.  I do not think the Deputy need have any fears that those between 65 and 70 will be treated any worse than they would have been under the measures proposed by the Deputy when he was Minister.  I think the Deputy will agree with me that it is difficult to discuss a matter of this kind on the Estimate and I think we must wait until the Bill comes before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When dealing with this matter on the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill introduced by the last Government I said that my alternative proposal was that between 65 and 70 a man would receive unemployment insurance or sickness benefit at the same level as retiring allowances and that the allowances would be given at 70 instead of 65.  To put it positively, I think a man should be encouraged to work rather than discouraged from working between 65 and 70.</P>

      <P>In view of the very short time since I assumed office Deputies will, I know, not expect me to have made myself adequately informed of the activities of the Department or to have examined its policies.  In presenting this Estimate, therefore, I propose to do no more than give an account of the working of the various services during the year 1950-51 and to indicate the Department's proposed activities for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross Estimate for 1951-52 amounts to £6,980,066 but, allowing for <Col N="236" /> receipts to be appropriated in aid, the net Estimate is for £6,712,000.  This represents an increase of £1,204,130 over the net provision for 1950-51. This figure is not that shown in the published Volume of Estimates (page 297) but there is a simple explanation of the difference.  Because of the early date by which the Estimates Volume had to be circulated this year, it was not possible to show, as is the custom, the effect of the Post Office Supplementary Estimate approved by the Dáil on the 14th March, 1951.  This Supplementary Estimate was for £19,270 and this amount should be deducted from the increase of £1,223,400 shown in the Estimates Volume to get the net increase of the 1951-52 Estimate over the previous year's figure.  In making comparisons later between sub-heads of the Estimate, account has been taken of the provision made by the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Of the net increase of £1,204,130, £806,600 is required for the purchase of reserve stocks of engineering maintenance stores and general postal stores.  The balance is required for increased expenditure under several of the various sub-heads.</P>
    <P>The more substantial variations on the sub-heads (those of £5,000 or more) occur on the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-heads A (1), A (2) and A (3)&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;The increase of £65,670 under these sub-heads is mainly attributable to increased provision for staff to meet the expansion in Post Office business, for normal incremental increases and for approved rates of payment for the delivery of telegrams.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D&mdash;Purchase of Sites&mdash;The increase of £28,500 is for the acquisition of sites for premises.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (1)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Rail&mdash;Decrease, £16,525. The decrease is mainly due to an expected reduction in our inter-State payments to Great Britain on account of the changed incidence of cross-Channel parcel post traffic.  This reduction is offset by increased provision for the carriage of letter mails by rail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> Sub-head E (5)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Air&mdash;Decrease, £33,600. This is due to the fact that heavy arrears of air mail accounts, mainly from the U.S.A., were received and discharged in 1950-51.  The reduced provision to be made this year is offset by this Administration's share of the cost of the new cross-Channel night air mail service.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Stores (other than engineering)&mdash;Increase, £75,250.  The increased provision is required to meet anticipated heavier expenditure on miscellaneous reserve stores.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (2)&mdash;Uniform clothing&mdash; Increase, £184,300.  The bulk of the increase is for reserve stocks of cloths, serges, cottons, etc.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (3)&mdash;Manufacture of Stamps, etc.&mdash;Increase, £45,760.  For purchase of reserve stocks of watermarked paper used for the production of stamps, postal orders, etc.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I (1)&mdash;Engineering Establishment&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;Increase, £25,800.  This sub-head provides for the total pay of the engineering branch staff, less the cost of staff time devoted to the development of the telephone service (as distinct from its maintenance) which is defrayed from telephone capital funds. The increased provision made is for maintenance and renewal work.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K&mdash;Engineering Materials &mdash;Increase £561,000, due in the main to the purchase of reserve stocks and to higher prices.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (3)&mdash;Contract Work (Engineering)&mdash;The increase of £66,550 is mainly in respect of anticipated increased payments for work to be undertaken by contractors, including modernisation of the coast wireless stations at Malin Head and Valentia.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments&mdash;Increase £131,561.  Funds for the development of the telephone system are provided under the authority of the Telephone Capital Acts (1924-1946) which authorise the Minister for Finance to issue sums out of the Central Fund for this purpose. Repayment of these funds is made by <Col N="238" /> means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 20 years.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance provision is made each year under this sub-head for the repayment of the instalments of principal and interest on the annuities created.  The increased provision in the sub-head is an indication of the continuing expansion of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1)&mdash;Superannuation Allowances, etc.&mdash;Increase £5,700, attributable to an increase in the number of pensioners and to greater provision for marriage and death gratuities.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q (2)&mdash;Provision and Installation of Equipment, etc.&mdash;Increase £7,800.  Due to larger provision for airport construction works.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash;The decrease of £46,154 here results mainly from the cessation of payments by the British Government in respect of the staffing of the Malin Head and Valentia wireless stations.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the Post Office as a whole is not satisfactory. In 1947-48 and 1948-49, there were deficits amounting to £99,611 and £200,612 respectively.  At the end of 1949-50, the latest year for which complete figures are available, another deficit resulted, this time amounting to £167,251.  In that year the postal services and telephone services combined to show a profit of £115,576 but the heavy loss of £282,827 on telegraphs turned the scales.</P>
    <P>The completed revenue and expenditure figures for 1950-51 are not available, but preliminary figures suggest that there will be an even heavier deficit in that year, perhaps of as much as £500,000.  Furthermore, as compared with 1950-51 considerably higher wage rates are already in operation in this year (1951-52) for some sections of the Department's staff.  The recent Civil Service arbitration award and other proposals for increased pay affecting the Department's staff which are in various stages of examination are obviously exceedingly costly and, if granted, will produce a further deterioration in the financial position.  In <Col N="239" /> addition, the Department is laying in heavy stocks against an emergency and these will have to be paid for either out of revenue or borrowed moneys.  Increased annuity charges consequent upon capital sums advanced for development also substantially increase the annual outlay.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for me at this stage to anticipate the outcome or the full effect of these matters, but it is at least clear that the Department's financial position in the coming year will be considerably worse than last year.  In the recent Budget speech the former Minister for Finance dealt with this worsening position and, having drawn attention to the Department's traditional policy of making its services pay for themselves on a commercial basis, indicated that increases in charges have become necessary.  The Irish Post Office is not alone in having to take this step.  Other administrations have recently been obliged to revise their charges or are preparing to do so. I am aware from information available to me that the former Administration before leaving office had approved and were preparing to introduce certain increased charges with a view to reducing the deficit.  I am having these proposals examined in the light of the whole financial position.</P>
    <P>The internal mail services generally are working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>A special night air service between Dublin Airport and Ringway, Manchester, was introduced on the 12th March last for the conveyance of a considerable portion of the cross-Channel mails.  The service is on a charter basis and is being used for both first and second-class mail (that is all mail except parcel mail) in each direction between here and Great Britain.  Over 1,000,000 items weekly are being conveyed by the service.  No additional air mail fee is being charged.  Cross-Channel correspondence posted up to 6 p.m. at the General Post Office and College Green Branch Office, Dublin, and correspondence included in day mail despatches from the main provincial centres connects with the <Col N="240" /> despatches by the night air service, which leaves Dublin Airport at 8.20 p.m.  The mails secure first delivery next morning over the greater portion of Great Britain, including first delivery in London, which represents a very big improvement on the service obtainable by means of the mail steamers.  The air service reaches Dublin Airport at 11.45 p.m. on return from Ringway and inward mails received by it secure the first morning deliveries in Dublin and district and day mail delivery in the main provincial centres.</P>
    <P>On the 7th May last a further important development in the use of air services was brought about with the introduction of a day air-mail service to Great Britain supplementary to the night mail charter service.  First-class mail, that is letters, postcards and letter packets for a large part of Great Britain, is forwarded by morning Aer Lingus planes from Dublin. Postings reaching the Dublin Sorting Office between 6.15 p.m. and 5 a.m. are forwarded in the new despatches, including night mail postings from provincial centres.  Letters for London are being delivered on the day of despatch.</P>
    <P>The Department is continuing to retain the use of the sea service as the present night air service could not accommodate all the mails available and provision must, of course, be made for occasions on which the air service cannot operate because of adverse conditions, for Saturday night despatches (when no advantage would be gained by having the mails conveyed by air) and for periods of pressure such as are experienced around Christmas, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, etc.  So far the new service has operated very satisfactorily and a big improvement in the cross-Channel mail service has been effected as a result.</P>
    <P>There has been a general growth in the volume of inland letter mail traffic. There was, on the whole, some decline in the volume of parcel post traffic during 1950 but since the beginning of this year an upward trend has been manifest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> The normal operation of the mail services was adversely affected during the year by the occurrence of the partial railway strike over the Córas Iompair Éireann system, which took place on the 18th December last and lasted until the beginning of February of this year.  The strike involved the setting up of a complete network of special road services to deal with letter mail traffic.  Despite adverse conditions and the unprecedentedly heavy volume of mail handled during the Christmas period, the emergency services worked satisfactorily and the letter mail service was fully and effectively maintained.  Because of the strike and the inability of the company to carry parcel traffic it was, unfortunately, necessary to impose a temporary suspension on the acceptance of parcels for a period of a fortnight from the 18th December to the 31st.  As from the 1st January, however, the railway company was in a position again to accept parcel post on the trains that were running and the service was restored as from that date.  During the period of the rail strike no restriction was, of course, placed on the size of letters or packets which might be sent by letter post, so that the suspension of the parcel post did not involve a complete suspension of the conveyance of sizable articles by post.</P>
    <P>So far as the foreign mails are concerned the volume of traffic continues to be high and the air mail services are continuing to be used extensively.  Because of the heavily increased conveyance charges for air mail and in order to comply with the requirements of the Universal Postal Convention, to which this country adheres, it was necessary recently to revise the postage rates for air mail and for foreign surface mail. Advantage was taken of this revision to unify the air mail charges on letters and postcards which previously varied from country to country.  The second class air mail service which had previously been available only to North America was extended to all overseas destinations as and from the 1st March.</P>
    <P>Regarding the rural postal services, the work of revising them with a view to giving daily deliveries on restricted <Col N="242" /> posts and improving the arrivals and despatches of mails generally was continued throughout the year and new services were introduced in the Gorey, Birr, Wicklow and Tullamore districts. The Nenagh postal district has also been revised and it is hoped to introduce new services there at a fairly early date.  Revisions or partial revisions of eight other head office districts are receiving attention at present and at least six of these should be implemented during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in hands for modernising and improving fittings and equipment in sorting offices throughout the country continued to receive attention during the year.  Specially designed conveyor bands were installed at the chief parcel office in Amiens Street, Dublin, and in the Dublin letter office a conveyor band system, mechanical facing table equipment and modern sorting fittings were installed. Improved fittings were also installed in several of the main provincial centres.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the public, arrangements are being made to extend the introduction of stampvending machines at offices throughout the country and 100 new machines have recently been received.</P>
    <P>In September last, a special stamp in three denominations was issued to mark the occasion of the Holy Year. The stamps were produced by the recess process and received favourable comment from the public and philatelists generally.  This country also participated in an International Philatelic Exhibition held in Madrid in October, 1950, and the Irish display at the exhibition evoked favourable comment.</P>
    <P>During the year, 17 new sub-offices were provided and money order and savings bank facilities were extended to 14 existing sub-offices.  Fifty new letter boxes were erected.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that an increase in the loss on the telegraph service has again to be reported.  This is due in the main to the increase in salaries and wages which became operative towards the end of 1948, but also to <Col N="243" /> some decrease which took place in traffic and consequently in revenue.  I have been informed by the Department that the telegraph service generally has been under examination in an effort to improve its financial position and efficiency and that, towards that end, the question of an extension of the use of teleprinters to replace morse working is being considered.  Provision has been made this year for teleprinters for a number of telegraph circuits. The investigation into the service is being pursued actively but, having regard to the general experience throughout the world of losses on telegraph working, the most that can be expected here is that the loss will be curtailed.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty affecting the operation of the telegraph service is that of providing satisfactorily for the delivery of telegrams from small offices where the employment of a regular departmental boy messenger would not be justified.  At offices where there are only a few telegrams a day to be delivered it would be uneconomic to provide a messenger to &ldquo;stand by&rdquo; for the work and consequently a messenger must be sought by the subpostmaster to deliver each telegram as it arrives.  In many districts it is not easy for sub-postmasters to secure the services of casual messengers.  It has just been decided to pay higher fees to casual messengers engaged for the delivery of telegrams and this, it is hoped, will improve the position considerably.</P>
    <P>A sum of £34,000 is included in the Estimate to obtain transmitting and receiving equipment and to provide for other items of apparatus for the coast radio stations at Malin Head and Valentia.  A good deal of the existing equipment is old and out of date and the expenditure is necessary to modernise the station.</P>
    <P>Some years ago telegraph or telephone radio communication was established with those islands off the coast on which there was a fair population. The equipment, which depends on wind chargers to keep the batteries charged, is not thoroughly efficient but no better type of apparatus was <Col N="244" /> hitherto available.  The laying of a submarine cable would be a fairly formidable job and the cost would be prohibitive. The Department is now, however, studying with interest developments in the provision of more efficient radio apparatus for island requirements and if, as is expected, these developments prove fully successful the newer equipment will be installed where needed.  A sum of £7,000 has been provided for this purpose in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The telephone service continues to expand.  During 1950 the number of trunk calls was 9,432,000, an increase of 482,000 on the figure for 1949.  Local calls increased by 6,000,000 to 68,000,000.</P>
    <P>As in the two previous years the Department concentrated its main engineering effort on the installation of telephones, and continued the policy of dealing with the accumulation of applications in bulk by exchange areas. 6,800 lines in all were connected, 4,815 of these being connected to exchanges in Dublin and the other main centres of population and 1,985 to exchanges in smaller towns and villages.  The total number of subscribers exchange lines in service on the 31st December last was 52,506 of which 36,069 were in Dublin and other large centres of population and 16,437 in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>For several years past the demand has been steadily growing and 1950 showed a still further increase.  The greater the number of telephones in service the greater is the value of the telephone to subscribers and the rapid growth of telephones therefore stimulates demand still further.  Every effort will continue not only to keep pace with demand but also to whittle down the arrears of applications on hands.  This problem of arrears is one common to all telephone administrations.</P>
    <P>During the year progress was made with the extension of the capacity of the Dublin automatic exchanges so as to cater for additional subscribers. Some 100 exchanges throughout the country were extended.  At four provincial exchanges, An Uaimh, <Col N="245" /> Drogheda, Dungarvan and Enniscorthy, the exchange switchboards, which were worn out and of an obsolete pattern, were completely replaced by new switchboards of modern design.  There now remain only four exchanges where switchboards of this pattern are in use and, as these switchboards are nearing the end of their useful life, it is proposed to replace them within the next year or two.</P>
    <P>A small automatic exchange of a type intended for use in rural or semi-rural areas was installed at Castleisland&mdash; this being the first provided outside the Dublin district.  Since the beginning of this year two further exchanges of the same type have been opened&mdash;at Swords, County Dublin, and Mitchelstown, County Cork.  This type of exchange gives full automatic service for local calls, i.e., subscribers dial all local calls in the same way as subscribers in Dublin do.  They are also enabled to dial directly subscribers connected with other automatic exchanges within a certain radius, at present limited to 12½ miles.  This latter facility cannot be availed of at present at Castleisland and Mitchelstown because there are no other automatic exchanges within 12½ miles of either of them.  When a subscriber connected to one of these automatic exchanges requires a trunk call he dials &ldquo;O&rdquo; and is answered by the operator at the trunk exchange to which his automatic exchange is connected. That operator then sets up the connection required.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to install these unit automatic exchanges in towns in which there are expected to be between 100 and 400 subscribers within the next ten to 15 years.  There are approximately 120 such places at present.  It will, of course, be many years before this full programme can be completed.</P>
    <P>It is hoped during the current year to open a main automatic exchange in Dublin to serve central city subscribers. A new automatic and trunk exchange at Dundalk will be opened next month.  All Dundalk subscribers will then be enabled to dial their local calls in the same way as Dublin subscribers do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> In pursuance of the policy already announced of giving 24-hour service from the larger exchanges continuous service was introduced at 60 additional exchanges during 1950.  At a recent date approximately 93 per cent. of subscribers' lines were connected to continuous service exchanges and another 3 per cent. were being given continuous service by switching their lines through at night to distant exchanges. Of the remaining 4 per cent. which had not continuous service, approximately half had service up to 10 p.m. on week-days and the remainder up to 8 p.m.</P>
    <P>Work on the scheme for installing call offices in rural post offices was resumed early in 1950 and some 150 call offices have since been opened. There are still about 700 post offices to be dealt with and, as most of these are in remote areas, heavy construction work is involved in bringing the telephone to them.  The scheme will, therefore, take several years to complete. In order to enable the most rapid progress to be made without interfering unduly with other urgent work, the offices to be dealt with are selected mainly on engineering considerations. The programme for the current financial year provides for the installation of 137 call offices.  Thirty new kiosks were erected during 1950. It is hoped to erect at least as many during the current year in the areas where the greatest use is likely to be made of them.  This is the determining factor in the selection of sites.</P>
    <P>A number of additional trunk circuits amounting to a total of 2,700 miles was provided during the year.  Owing to the steady increase in trunk traffic in recent years, there is, however, still considerable delay on calls during the busy hours on many routes, and I understand that, owing to the volume of urgent engineering work in sight, it will be some years before such delays can be fully eliminated.  As many additional trunk circuits as possible will be erected during the current year and they will be provided on the routes where the need for relief is greatest.</P>
    <P>The underground cable from Dublin to Cork via Portlaoighise and Limerick, with spurs from Portlaoighise to <Col N="247" /> Waterford and Athlone, has now been almost completely laid, but testing, and the installation of equipment required for full functioning of the cable will take about another year.  In the meantime, short distance circuits have already been brought into use on part of the route between Dublin and Portlaoighise and it is hoped to obtain some circuits in the Mallow-Cork sector shortly.  Other short distance circuits will become available gradually over the next year, and it is hoped to have some few long distance circuits to Cork and Limerick within the next six months.  When the full number of circuits provided by the cable becomes available on any part of the route, delay over that part is eliminated; and when the whole work is completed within about a year, there should be no delay to calls on any part of the cable route.  The laying of a trunk cable from Dublin to the Border will begin next month.</P>
    <P>The existing skilled engineering staff of the Department is insufficient in number to enable all phases of telephone development to be proceeded with as quickly as could be wished.  In the past three years, the main construction effort has been devoted to installation of new telephones.  This concentration on connecting new lines for subscribers has meant that less could be done to improve the trunk service for existing subscribers.  I propose to consider carefully whether a somewhat greater proportion of the engineering effort should be devoted to improving the service to existing subscribers, but if this is to be done, it will, it is feared, be for the present at the cost of reducing the rate of connection of new subscribers. The real need is, of course, to ensure that all phases of telephone development can receive adequate attention and I shall consider urgently what it is possible to do to reach this position.</P>
    <P>So far as the Department's building activities are concerned, fair progress was made during the past year.  Works completed include a new automatic exchange building at Dundalk, a telephone repeater station building at Limerick, a temporary post office at <Col N="248" /> Loughrea and three new automatic exchange buildings at smaller centres. Structural alterations to improve accommodation were carried out at several offices.</P>
    <P>The new main telephone exchange building and telephone headquarters at the rere of Hammam Buildings are nearing completion.  Other new building works at present in progress include: post office and telephone trunk exchange at St. Andrew Street, Dublin; mechanical transport repair shop and garage at St. John's Road, Dublin; engineering garages and workmen's headquarters at Distillery Road, Dublin; automatic telephone exchange at Mount Merrion, Dublin; automanual exchanges at Waterford and Athlone and reconstruction of Cork head post office.</P>
    <P>Work will commence in the current financial year on a number of automatic exchange buildings and on the provision of new post offices and telephone exchanges at Drogheda, Kilrush and Rathluire.  Improvement schemes at Ballina, Clonmel, Cahir, Boyle, Clifden and at a number of other offices are also due to commence.  Site difficulties have held up a number of schemes at such places as Galway, Letterkenny and Wicklow, where new buildings are proposed, but relief measures are being taken where practicable and the difficulties referred to are being disposed of as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>Plans for the provision of a central sorting office in Dublin had to be extensively revised in the light of the substantial growth in postal traffic in recent years.  Re-examination revealed that the increased demands could not be met, as had been contemplated, on the site of the existing sorting office in Pearse Street and that a new site would have to be obtained.  Inquiries to this end were instituted and negotiations for the acquisition of a suitable site are now nearing completion.  In view of the urgent need to replace the existing inadequate sorting accommodation, everything possible will be done to expedite the planning work and commencement of building operations on the new site.</P>
    <P>The Post Office Savings Bank as a <Col N="249" /> medium for savings continues to be popular with the general public. Deposits for the year totalled £11,286,000, exceeding withdrawals by £3,094,000.  The amount, including interest, to credit of depositors at 31st December, 1950, was £48,133,000 as compared with £43,920,000 at the end of 1949.  The amount remaining to the credit of depositors at the end of various three-year periods may be of interest to Deputies.  The amount in 1939 was £10,650,739 and had increased by 1942 to £16,742,875, an increase of £6,092,136.  By 1945, the amount was £32,653,360, an increase of £15,910,485. By 1948, the total was £38,981,315, an increase of £6,327,955, and in December, 1950, the amount had increased by £9,151,685 to £48,133,000.</P>
    <P>The total amount invested in Savings Certificates during the year ended 31st December, 1950, was £1,409,000 as compared with £1,440,000 in the preceding 12 months.  Withdrawals, principal and interest, amounted to £1,355,000 as against £1,217,000 in 1949. The amount remaining invested at the end of 1950, exclusive of interest, was £13,012,000 as compared with £12,561,000 at the end of 1949.</P>
    <P>The amounts remaining invested at the end of various three-year periods were as follows:&mdash;1939, £7,717,487; 1942, £8,220,571, an increase over 1939 of £503,084; 1945, £11,053,620, an increase over 1942 of £2,833,049; 1948, £11,979,488, an increase over 1945 of £925,868, and 1950, £13,012,000, an increase over 1948 of £1,032,512.</P>
    <P>The figures for 1948-1950, while showing improvement over some previous periods, are short of what would be desirable under present economic conditions.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service a departmental conciliation council was set up in the Post Office.  It held its first meeting in May, 1950, and since then a number of important claims by staff associations have been submitted to it.  The meetings of the council are characterised by a spirit of goodwill and a readiness to examine both sides of a case with an open mind, and the existence of this spirit augurs well for <Col N="250" /> the future of conciliation machinery in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department's policy of keeping under review its organisation and methods of operating was continued during the year with satisfactory results.  I should like to assure the staff of all grades that the zealous and efficient service which, the Department assures me, has been given during the year is greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>In concluding my observations, I should point out that the plans for telephone development were being prepared in the years before 1948 and were one of the objectives regarded as of vital national importance by the Government of that day.  These plans are now being implemented and the Minister who held office before me, it is only fair to say, gave active encouragement to this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear of the progress that was being made in the utilisation of air services for mail deliveries.  I hope that the Minister will use his best endeavours&mdash;I am sure he will&mdash;to push on this development. I am not quite certain whether there is a direct mail service to London yet: I think that, so far, the mails are delivered to Manchester and there sorted and distributed in England.  It always occurred to me that there should be a possibility of arranging a direct mail service to London, thereby saving, as far as mails to London are concerned, a fairly considerable proportion of time and handling.  We have a number of direct air services to London every day and it might be possible to avail of them to carry mails.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I would like to mention; the Minister adverted to it and I am sure he will keep it before his mind.  It is the necessity of providing radio communication with many of the islands off the coast.  I know that in the winter months especially, the lack of communication is often the cause of great hardship. The cost of providing small radio transmitters on some of these islands would be negligible in proportion to the whole Estimate and I think it is a matter which should be kept well before the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> On the question of the general finances of the Post Office, I think that, on the whole, the Post Office is to be congratulated that its finances are not in a worse condition.  The Post Office has had to undertake very considerable expansion in recent years and I hope that no attempt will be made to restrict that expansion, which is so necessary. I know that the Post Office suffers from a shortage of technical staffs and I often wonder whether that shortage does not arise from the mistaken belief that the expansion is purely of a temporary nature.  I think that for many years to come, at least for 20 or 30 years, our Post Office will still be expanding, to catch up with modern development.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that the question of the provision of additional permanent technical staffs should be considered by him.  It might in the end be cheaper and make for greater efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a quotation which has been getting a certain amount of publicity through being made the title of a book published some years ago: &ldquo;On Another Man's Wound.&rdquo;  I think it could apply to the Minister who has read us this interesting account of the work done during the period over which he had no responsibility for it and where I see he is taking credit for another man's work.  It is probably for that reason that he is conscious himself of the fact, when referring to the work for which he is in no way responsible, that he was able without embarrassment to refer in the terms he did to the question of conciliation and arbitration. Conciliation and arbitration now, of course, is a settled type of machinery and it is already working through various Departments.  Among the phrases used about it in this statement in connection with the Post Office we find:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The meetings of the departmental conciliation council are characterised by a spirit of goodwill and a readiness to examine both sides of a case with an open mind.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as the Government with which <Col N="252" /> the Deputy was connected was in office, no effort was made to provide such conciliation and arbitration machinery and there was no effort to examine both sides of the case.  There was one side, the official side, and that went. If there has been anything in the way of proper conciliation machinery, it certainly did not come in with the approval of the Government to which he previously belonged.  At any rate, it will probably help him in association with unknown members of the Northern Parliament who now find that he has come over to this matter of arbitration.  I understand he was quoted yesterday in Stormont as a person who decided to discuss our business here with a member of another Parliament and recommend a policy of arbitration for the stockholders who are members of a railway concern which is the subject of discussion and determination between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether he is responsible for one change in the typescript, one interesting change in the early part of it.  The document as drafted had the phrase: &ldquo;The financial position of the Post Office as a whole is far from satisfactory.&rdquo;  The two words &ldquo;far from&rdquo; have been struck out and the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; put in.  I do not know whether the Minister is responsible for that change in emphasis with regard to the rather bad and deteriorating position of the Post Office.  However, I think the typescript might be amended still further in order to make it up-to-date at least with what his colleagues are doing.</P>
    <P>At the start of the proceedings to-day we were told that the new Government have accepted the arbitration award of the 24th May and that it will be implemented. In this document we are told:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The recent Civil Service arbitration award and other proposals for increased pay affecting the Department's staffs which are in various stages of examination are obviously exceedingly costly and, if granted, will produce a further deterioration in the financial position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They have been granted, I understand. I do not know if I heard it aright, but <Col N="253" /> that is the way it sounded as I heard it read.  This phrase sounds ominous: it seemed as if there were to be some pulling out by the Department which is responsible for a greater number of civil servants than any other Department. I do not know the figures exactly, but there are roughly 34,000 civil servants and almost half of them are in the Post Office.  If there is to be any change with regard to arbitration or the implementing of the recent award, in connection with Post Office staffs, that change of course would affect about 50 per cent.  of the employees of the State.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw that somebody thought fit to amend this statement in the slight particular I have mentioned, describing the financial position as &ldquo;not satisfactory&rdquo; where the typescript described it as &ldquo;far from satisfactory&rdquo;, on reading the typescript I thought the more critical phrase was the one which was more consonant with what the rest of the typescript disclosed.</P>
      <P>I notice another point.  The typescript goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In addition, the Department is laying in heavy stocks against an emergency and these will have to be paid for either out of revenue or borrowed moneys.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest there is an alternative.  I suppose that what was decided in the Budget statement that I read this year could be described as payment out of borrowed moneys, but I think it is rather straining the term to say that one is going to allow payments for certain stocks to be put on the taxpayers for the year in which the stocks are used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I read this it would appear&mdash; whether it is an early edition I do not <Col N="254" /> know&mdash;that there is still some doubt whether these emergency purchases or forward purchases are to be paid for out of current revenue.  If that is so the deficit in the Post Office will certainly be far higher than anything so far incurred; the deficit will, of course, go up.  The typescript contains one part of a phrase from what is described as the Budget speech.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The increase is mainly in Post Office revenue and is due to normal expansion of business and recent increases in certain postal charges which form part of a plan to redress the serious discrepancy between Post Office costs and receipts and restore commercial solvency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is traditionally the Department's policy to make its services pay for themselves on a commercial basis and, to achieve this, increases in charges have become necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That refers to increases already brought into operation, not to increases which may be in contemplation. I went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Post Office is not alone in having to take this step.  Other Administrations have recently been obliged to revise their charges or are preparing to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When that was written, of course, the award of the 24th May had not been published.  Earlier to-day we were told that the award in a full year&mdash;I leave out arrear payments, as that is a complicating factor&mdash;in its application to civil servants would cost £1,250,000. That applies to some 33,000 civil servants, 16,000 to 18,000 of whom are servants of the Post Office.  They are in the lower grades, of course, and they will absorb more than 50 per cent. of the cost of that full award.  If the Post Office is to follow its traditional policy of raising charges to meet the cost of its services, whatever deficit was forecast prior to the award will have to be magnified by the addition of about £600,000.  If that is the case the House should know and the country should realise just what increases in <Col N="255" /> Post Office charges are likely to be brought about.</P>
    <P>The arbitration award has to be paid back to the 15th January.  There will be in this year two and a half months' extra payments and those payments will, I assume, be made right away. If they are, extra expenditure will have been incurred and will go on over each week and over each month as the rest of this year goes by.  We are now in the month of June and I do not know whether it will be possible to have increased Post Office charges brought in with any speed.  If extra payments should fall to be met in the year, a very big deficit faces the Post Office this year.  The Minister has referred to increases in charges that had been considered by the previous Administration.  Quite a number of charges were proposed for our consideration. Some of these had, as far as I was concerned, been found acceptable, while some were found definitely unacceptable, as being very heavy and imposing a rather severe burden on a certain portion of the charges for Post Office services.</P>
    <P>The increase in State expenditure announced this morning of £1,250,000 as far as the civil servants are concerned, and with equivalent increases to the Army (all ranks) and to the Guards, will mean a charge, we were told to-day, in a full year of £2.4 million.  Facing that, I do again emphasise the necessity for announcing to the public whatever new charges are to be made by the Post Office at the earliest possible date.  I should mention also that the £2.4 million includes nothing whatever for the teachers who are going forward to arbitration on their own and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility or even of probability that some payment will be recommended for them.  If it is anything like the award made to civil servants or the equivalent grant to be made to other Government servants, the £2.4 million bill will swell to something very much heavier indeed.</P>
    <P>In order to give the public a better appreciation of his point, I think that <Col N="256" /> the Minister might make an addition &mdash;it could possibly be made at a later stage.  Bank and Savings Certificates statistics are of particular importance to the people of the country and they should appreciate that the staff of the Post Office plays such a large part in gathering in all these small savings. To a great extent the Post Office provides the machinery for small savings. It must be remembered, of course, that for the last three years these savings will be in addition to whatever subscriptions were given to the national loans which were floated in each of these three years by people who normally would have made small savings. They are all savings to the country and it is not a fair representation of Savings Bank and Savings Certificates not to relate them to the very big subscriptions which were made to each of the national loans floated in each of these three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise the question of the exchange in Claremorris, County Mayo.  The matter was raised on a number of occasions in the 11th and 12th Dáil by the Deputies of my constituency, but since then very little progress has been made to ease the situation.  I understand that the Minister comes to my county on various occasions for holidays and I wonder if he ever had the experience of putting a call through to Dublin or anywhere nearer home from Claremorris. If he had he would have found that he had to wait from one to three hours to secure the call.  It would be much quicker to travel by train or car, as you would be in Dublin by the time a call would be through. The Minister's predecessors promised Deputies from South Mayo on a number of occasions that the matter would be attended to, but so far nothing has been done.  It is most unfair to subscribers in South Mayo who use that exchange and who pay revenue to the Minister's Department. As you all know, the telephone plays a big part in business but if you must wait for three hours in the post office or in your home before you can make contact with this city, it is a bad state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to impress upon the <Col N="257" /> Minister that the whole system, not only in Mayo but everywhere else, is not up to date.  Here in the City of Dublin if one wants to phone only from one street to the other, there is great difficulty in getting through, and one does not always receive courtesy. I think that the matter might very well be overhauled.  I do not intend to say any more on that point as I am new to the House.  I was not present for the Minister's explanation.  I know he is new to his Department and is merely presenting another Minister's Estimate. He is not responsible for what has been happening over the past three years and, for that reason, I do not intend to be hard on him or to dwell too long on that particular subject.  Let us hope that if this Government continues in office for the next year some effort will be made towards bringing about a change in the situation, as far as my constituency is concerned, and as far as subscribers in Mayo as a whole are concerned.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of auxiliary postmen.  The auxiliary postman is a person who gives very good, honest and honourable service.  Yet he receives very little consideration.  Many of these men have given service for 20 or 30 years.  The sub-postmaster's job is not an easy one; in wet weather and in fair weather he must do his duty&mdash; which means hard work.  He has got to be honest and it is very hard lines that, after 20 or 30 years' service or perhaps longer, he gets no remuneration in the latter days of his life.  I think it is most unfair that a man who has given such good service to the State should be dispensed with by his Department when he reaches the age of 70 years, or is no longer able to work.  In his old age he has nothing to fall back on except whatever little savings he has managed to put aside. If he is a married man who has raised a family, we can all well imagine what he has been able to save! If he is lucky he has a few pounds at his disposal for the rainy day.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the weekly half-holiday in sub-offices throughout the country, I agree that sub-postmistresses or sub-postmasters should have a half-holiday.  However, <Col N="258" /> it does sometimes happen that a half-holiday follows in succession to a Sunday and a bank holiday.  That means that the sub-office is closed for three days.  I think this is a most unfair situation in a rural area, and the Minister should take the matter up with the association or organisation concerned, and try to get them to realise that, while the Department agrees that the sub-offices should have a half-holiday, they think it unfair to the public that such half-holiday should be availed of when it follows a Sunday and a bank holiday, or even a bank holiday.  In Mayo a very large amount of business is transacted in most of these sub-offices, as a big percentage of the people have emigrated to Great Britain and America. In consequence these offices have to handle heavy mails, money orders and telegrams.  Apart from the business point of view, I think it is very unjust to the community that a sub-office in a town like Swinford or in other towns should be closed down for three days in succession, or for two days in succession.  The association in which officials of the sub-office are enrolled should give some consideration to that state of affairs and the Minister should, at his earliest possible convenience, bring that fact to its notice.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the employees in these sub-offices.  The Minister is well aware, and so are many members of this House, that these people are not paid a remunerative wage in relation to the hours they work and the duties that they carry out.  In many instances this results in fraud and theft. As the Minister is aware, such has occurred over a number of years, and I would say that, in most cases, it arose out of being underpaid.  Whether it be in sub-offices or in any other occupation where the employee is not sufficiently paid, we are putting him in danger of doing the other thing to secure the difference between his rightful wage and that which his employer pays him.  You are creating a source of temptation, particularly if he has responsibilities in life as a married man or if he has other responsibilities. The Minister should look into that matter.  It is unfair that young men and young women should <Col N="259" /> be in the employment of an important Department or in the employment of sub-post offices and not be properly paid.  It is not right and you can hardly blame people if they stoop to something which they should not do.  It arises in most cases out of being underpaid.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, at his convenience, to consider the points I have mentioned, namely, the exchange in Claremorris, the auxiliary postmen, the half-holiday, and the staffs employed in sub-offices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another point which has come to my mind is that it is much easier to get a telephone into a private house than it is into a business concern.  I cannot understand that for the life of me.  I think the business community of this country are worth considering whether they be in a large or a small way.  I know many people, such as mineral water companies, breweries, solicitors, doctors, who require urgently the use of a telephone and cannot secure one, but if I, or any other private citizen, want a telephone, I can secure it in a very short time.  If it is needed as a means for the development of business, to give more employment, for the extension of business, one has to wait a considerable period of time, perhaps a year, 18 months, or even two years.  I do appreciate that during the war years it was difficult, owing to the scarcity of material.  That difficulty should have been overcome by now and the material required for the installation of telephones should be in large supply.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister that in regard to future applicants for the installation of telephones, people who require them for the furtherance of their business&mdash;solicitors, medical men and that type&mdash;should get prior consideration. Furthermore, I would ask the Minister to see that in every sub-office in rural Ireland a telephone is installed.  In regard to a number of villages in County Mayo representations have been made&mdash;I am sure the Minister will find them if he looks up his files&mdash;and so far nothing has been done.  A telephone is availed of by a large section of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> No village, no matter how small, and no sub-post office, no matter how small the amount of business transacted in it, should be without a telephone to-day. It is essential that a telephone should be available if a person wishes to call a doctor or a priest or to transact some important business.  I do not know the present position as regards crossChannel communications but if it is as bad as our inland system then we are in a deplorable state indeed.  I ask the Minister, through his Department, to give prior consideration to Claremorris exchange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that his Department have 100 stamp machines on hand.  They should be distributed among the small towns and the new housing schemes in our cities.  The residents of Cork Road housing scheme, Waterford, have to walk up to two miles in order to secure a 2½d. stamp.  It is mostly working people who experience difficulty in procuring stamps.  The post offices are open during their hours of employment and when these people have the leisure to write a letter in the evenings or on Sundays they find they are unable to purchase stamps because the post offices are closed.  The provision of stamp machines in appropriate places would help very materially to ease that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that a good deal of money has been spent on advance buying.  I trust that we have laid in an adequate supply of copper wire and telephone equipment.  Every rural district and every small town should have at least one telephone kiosk.  In rural areas it is usual for sub-post offices to close at 7 o'clock. The Civic Guard stations have, in the main, been the centre of communication and have delivered urgent messages. I understand that there is now a proposal to close the barracks at 7 o'clock and if that happens it will mean that the people in the areas in question will be completely cut off as regards telephonic communication from 7 o'clock each evening.  It is essential, therefore, that kiosks be made available in order to enable people to call a doctor or a priest, when necessary. We owe it to the people on the land to <Col N="261" /> provide them with every possible service in order to induce them to remain on the land and continue the essential work which they are carrying out.  The Minister should see to it that his Department's engineers will continue the job of installing telephones in small towns and rural areas.  He should ensure that this important work will not be neglected.</P>
    <P>The Minister also states that his Department have under consideration the question of increased charges.  Increased charges, unless they are very modest, may have the effect of killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  If the charges are unreasonably high the people will have to do without the facilities which they would otherwise avail of.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Cafferkey in appealing for consideration for auxiliary postmen.  I believe they are the Cinderellas of a Cinderella service.  By reason of the nature of their work, which is supposed to be part-time, it is impossible for them to secure employment for the balance of the day.  They are out in all weathers and they work for a miserable wage.  I do not suggest that that is the fault of the present Government or of any other Government, but if the Minister addresses himself to the solution of that problem he will earn the gratitude not only of the auxiliary postmen but of all the people who benefit by and appreciate the work done by them. These men deliver letters in bog areas, in swamp areas, in mountainous areas, and in rural areas in general, thus enabling the people in those parts to keep in touch with their friends who live in the towns and cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Cafferky, I also should like to mention the importance of giving attention to the position of auxiliary postmen.  It is vitally important for us to realise that by the time these men complete their rounds in rural areas there is not much of the day left.  They must, therefore, live on the sole wage they get in the service of the Post Office.  At the end of their days it frequently happens that they have to retire on a small gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> I cannot altogether agree with Deputy Cafferky in the matter of the half-day.  In many rural areas the people in the sub-post offices do not seem to enjoy the half-day at all yet. These people should be in a position to enjoy a half-day.  It will be found that, within a very short time, people will get used to the system which is in operation in our towns and cities, where every establishment closes for a half-day every week.  That facility should be made available to every subpostmaster and every sub-postmistress in the country.</P>
    <P>My approach to this Estimate to-day is the same as it would have been had I happened to be sitting on the Government side of the House when it was introduced.  I believe that due recognition must now be given to the Minister who was in charge of this Department for the past three years. I do not wish to say anything harsh but I feel that if the present Minister and his Party were sitting on the Opposition Benches to-day there would have been a lot of opposition to this Estimate.  Even at this late stage, I think that due recognition must be accorded to Deputy Everett for his administration of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and for the efficiency of the staffs in the various departments of the Post Office.  We realise that this important Department has much to do with the daily lives of all our citizens from the businessman down to the old age pensioner.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the Cork postal district has gained the advantage of a daily delivery of mails.  People in many remote areas were handicapped because letters were delivered only every second day and often only once or twice in the week.  For the past 12 months or so, the people in those areas have had a daily delivery.  That speaks well for the organisation and the work of the Post Office authorities.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that, at the earliest moment, a system of daily delivery will apply in the Bandon postal district.  I appreciate the fact that, for some time, the possibility of having it has been under consideration.  I know, of course, that a daily service will be provided in that area some time, but what I am <Col N="263" /> hoping for is that it will be at as early a date as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of public telephones and extra sub-post offices, I was one of the Deputies who were stressing their importance in the various areas for some time.  I appreciate the fact that the last Minister, over the last three years, adopted a system which, I understand, was put up to him by the Post Office authorities.  Undoubtedly, it has worked very satisfactorily.  Instead of adopting a piecemeal system of providing public telephones simply to suit individuals, the former Minister adopted a system of working in block areas.  I believe it is the only system which will give real satisfaction, because it will make sure that at the earliest possible date the rural areas will be supplied with a proper public telephone system.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kyne that it is of vital importance for the people in rural Ireland to have a public telephone system in their areas.  If the inhabitants in those areas are left without such a service, then they are very seriously handicapped, particularly in cases where the services of a doctor or clergyman are required urgently after 7 o'clock at night.  I hope that the system of providing public telephones, which has been operated within the last couple of years, will be further expanded to meet the requirements of people living in remote areas.  If an up-to-date system of telephonic communication is soon made available for them then the disadvantages from which they have suffered in the past will be removed.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that Cork City has gained immensely by the improvements which have been carried out to the Post Office building in that city. I think nobody appreciates that more than the staffs engaged in that building. Heretofore, they had to carry out their work at a great disadvantage. It is a great satisfaction to them to find that the bad conditions under which they were obliged to do their work have been completely <Col N="264" /> altered for the better.  In the future, they will be able to do their work under decent conditions.  From the health point of view, the improvements carried out are of the utmost importance to the staff.</P>
    <P>I should like also to urge on the Minister the possibility of providing extended telephone facilities on Sundays in sea-side areas.  In my experience the lack of such facilities on Sundays has meant the loss of a few lives.  That was so last year at Garrettstown in County Cork.  We all know that a big number of people flock to these sea-side resorts on Sundays during the summer months.  Perhaps, if we had a satisfactory public telephone service in operation on Sundays at these sea-side resorts, lives could have been saved and these tragic drownings would not have occurred.  It may be that there are certain difficulties in the way of doing what I ask, but I would urge the Minister to consider the matter, and see that, in those areas where there is a public telephone service on week days, it will be extended to Sundays up to 7 or 8 o'clock at night.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by urging on the Minister to speed up the provision of a daily postal delivery in the Bandon area.  I know it is under consideration, but what I am asking is that it should be introduced at as early a date as possible.  I know it takes time to do that, and I am not expecting miracles. I also hope that the Minister will consider the position of the auxiliary postman and the demands that are made on him.  He has to be out in all kinds of weather, winter and summer.  He has to work to a pretty regular time-table. His time is checked pretty severely.  He is subject to an overseer who, of course, has to do his own work, and very often may have to question him if he is ten minutes or a quarter of an hour over his time.  I hope that the Minister will consider the position of the auxiliary postman and also an extension of the public telephone system, a matter which was very capably dealt with in the last few years.  I believe that, if the Minister is able to deal satisfactorily with the matters to which I have referred, in 12 months' time every member of the House will come to <Col N="265" /> realise that the Post Office is one State Department which is giving a good return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cafferky has spoken about the needs of South Mayo. He referred to the Claremorris area. What is true of Claremorris and South Mayo is also true of Ballina and of the towns in North Mayo.  We, in the North Mayo area, use the telephone extensively.  What Deputy Cafferky stated in regard to South Mayo is true of the North Mayo area and applies to many towns there such as Ballina, Belmullet, Ballycastle, Killala and others. Deputy Cafferky referred to delays of one, two, three and four hours in making a call.  I do not want to say that these delays are due to any inefficiency on the part of the staffs in North Mayo. As a subscriber, I can say that I am quite satisfied with the staffs in our post offices in the North Mayo area. They carry out their duties in an efficient manner.  Having said that, I would ask the Minister, in this matter of the telephone service and the Post Office generally, to consider the position in what may be described as the very neglected area of North Mayo.  In that area of North Mayo we are very far removed from the City of Dublin and in most cases we are very far removed from hospitals.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the matter. The truth of the matter is that, in the North Mayo area and in Mayo generally, we seem to be the most neglected people in the whole of Ireland.  Since consideration is not given to us in other matters, the very least we expect is to be given good telephonic communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has in mind&mdash;as had his predecessor&mdash;the purchase of additional equipment.  I also understand, not from the Minister but from various officials who have been connected with Post Office work, that it is the practice of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to buy second-hand equipment from other countries.  I think that if that was the practice in the past it is a practice that should be discontinued at once.  If we buy second-hand or inferior equipment <Col N="266" /> it follows, of course, that you will have breakdowns from time to time and our servicing costs will be very high.  For that reason I would advise the Minister to buy, if at all possible and if it is obtainable, new equipment instead of purchasing second-hand equipment.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from North Mayo, I should like to impress upon the Minister the necessity for special consideration for the auxiliary postmen. Mayo is rather a mountainous county and this makes it difficult for these men to get round.  I say, as Deputy Cafferky and others have said, that these men should get very special consideration.  In my own particular area very old men are doing the rounds to-day as they did many years ago.  They are very poorly paid and they have seen many winters.  The job is very difficult and the roads are not so good.  I should like to impress on the Minister that their pay should be increased, and substantially increased.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to provide a 24-hour, round-the-clock, service in all our towns.  It is true that we have a 24-hour service in some of the towns but, if at all possible, I should like that to be extended to all the towns in Mayo.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay long on the subject, since it has been dealt with very well.  I am just making those few points to show how we are affected in North Mayo.  I expect that the Minister will give these matters serious consideration.  As I stated at the outset, we are affected in many ways in North Mayo and the least we should get is good telephone and post office services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter I would like to raise.  It is rather a local matter.  I received some complaints with regard to the reorganisation which has taken place in the postal deliveries in the Clara area in Offaly.  I am told that the reorganisation which has taken place recently has resulted in some inconvenience in the town of Clara, both to postal officials and people in that area. I know that general reorganisation has been carried out in the last 12 or 18 <Col N="267" /> months by the Minister's predecessor, but I would like if the Minister, at his convenience, would investigate that particular area of Clara, where, I am informed, certain inconveniences are caused both in the post office and to residents in that area.  As far as residents are concerned, apparently the postal delivery is now much earlier than previously and, with parcels and other deliveries of that kind, it has meant that residents in the area are disturbed at a much earlier hour.  I should like if the Minister would investigate that particular matter.</P>
      <P>I would like also to join with other Deputies who have raised the question of pay and allowance for different postal officials.  I raised this matter previously when this Estimate was discussed. I have nothing to add to what has already been urged by other Deputies. I think that the entire matter should be reorganised.</P>
      <P>May I also join with Deputy Desmond in his tribute to the Minister's predecessor?  I should have started, perhaps, by congratulating the Minister on his selection by this House as a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and wishing him not a long life as Minister, but every success for the short time he will be there.  In doing that, I must congratulate Deputy Everett, whose Estimate we are now discussing, for his excellent work.  As a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he has been maligned by that former Independent Deputy for the County of Wicklow, Deputy Cogan, who is now the second Fianna Fáil Deputy for that constituency.  Deputy Everett was consistently maligned by Deputy Cogan as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Certainly his reputation as Minister, his conduct of his Department and his work in office were recently judged by the people he represents in the constituency of Wicklow.  Decisively they decided in favour of Deputy Everett and against Deputy Cogan.  No doubt Deputy Cogan, bearing a grudge against the people he represented, endeavoured to work out that grudge by deciding against their wishes and putting Deputy Everett from his post as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I feel that if the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs endeavours, even in some small way, to carry out the policy of his predecessor, he will be administering this Department in an excellent and in an efficient manner. I do not think he will be long there. I have no doubt that by the time the next Estimate comes up Deputy Everett will occupy the Minister's place in this House, but so long as the present Minister is there I can only commend him to carry on the policy of his predecessor in endeavouring to improve the conditions of postal officials, the conditions for the ordinary public and, generally, bettering the services available to subscribers and ensuring fair play.  That is what the Minister's predecessor did.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, at his convenience, to inquire later into a particular local matter which I raised, because I am informed that it has caused concern in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention.  In the course of his speech to-day he referred to revisions of rural services.  In so far as these have proceeded very valuable work has been done from the point of view, firstly, of improving the organisation of deliveries and collections in the areas concerned and, secondly, of expanding part-time posts to full-time posts.  It is to the latter portion of the beneficial effects of such revisions that I want now to refer.  I know the Post Office has carried out some of these revisions.  The Minister indicated in his speech the areas covered, but there are still very substantial portions of the country which have not yet been touched under these proposed revisions. While I know that the Post Office is at heart sympathetic with the idea of proceeding with the revisions, unfortunately it does not seem to have the tools with which to do the job.  I think that particular section of the Post Office is altogether understaffed. If my memory does not mislead me, I think there is, in fact, a vacancy in that section and it is on that vacant post that the continuance or suspension of these revisions really depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, therefore, would like to direct the <Col N="269" /> Minister's attention to the fact that this is vital work, that it is urgent work and that it is work which should not be neglected merely because it is difficult at the moment to fill a particular vacancy.  Wherever staff can be got they should be got for the purpose of proceeding with the revision of rural post offices because by carrying out that work you can provide daily deliveries and give better delivery and collection services, which will in turn enable you to expand part-time posts to full-time, with a consequent improvement in the present rate of remuneration of part-time postmen.</P>
    <P>To me it seems a complete distortion of values to find ourselves talking in 1951 about air lift for letters and circulars, about the installation of automatic exchanges in rural areas, about radio telephony to the islands and about a dozen and one other mechanical processes which crop up during the year in relation to the telegraph and telephone services while, at the same time, we are not able to organise the Post Office services on the basis of giving full-time employment to many thousands of officers serving in that Department.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware of the matter, but it is a fact that thousands of persons have been employed as part-time officers in the Post Office for upwards of 40 years. Whatever the mentality was in the Post Office approach to part-time employment 40 years ago, I do not think any person is to-day intellectually so poor as to try to justify part-time employment and part-time rates of wages. While, as I say, I give the Post Office credit for having cultivated, especially in recent years, a much more liberal approach to the problem of expanding part-time posts to full-time posts, the problem is still so big that it justifies taking special measures to bring to an end what can only be described in 1951 as a scandal, namely, that men should be employed on part-time duties at part-time rates of wages and expected to live, in many cases with no other employment, on the rates of wages offered for part-time posts.</P>
    <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to the continuance of that problem. It is not a new problem.  It <Col N="270" /> has existed down the years.  It was the method first adopted in order to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria away back in 1897. Because we wanted to celebrate Victoria's Diamond Jubilee with a daily delivery in rural areas, unfortunately Irish auxiliary postmen have been crucified with part-time employment at part-time rates of wages ever since.  It is time that relic and memory disappeared. The best way we can remedy the situation is by organising the services on the basis of providing full-time employment for every person employed in the Post Office service.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to concern himself with that problem in particular. I do not say the Post Office has not liberalised its view on the matter, especially in recent years, but I would urge upon the Minister that he should give more attention to the problem.  It is a blot on the entire Post Office service that it, the largest Department of the State, should still permit this problem of part-time employment to defy solution.  I do not think the problem can be solved very easily.  If the Post Office recognise the basic principle that it is wrong that men should be employed on part-time duties at part-time rates of wages and if it accepts that as being wrong in principle, then there is no insuperable difficulty in abolishing that evil by replacing that part-time employment with full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is the question of Post Office buildings.  Anybody who has any long association with the Post Office knows that the work it does to-day is far in excess of that which it undertook 30 years ago.  Practically every new social service in one aspect or another is thrown upon the Post Office.  Old age pensions, expanded as they have been, children's allowances, widows' and orphans' pensions, methods of rationing and the collection of coupons&mdash;services which have grown up rather rapidly in the last 25 years&mdash;have all turned to the Post Office for their administration, with the result that the Post Office to-day is carrying out work for which it was never originally intended.  I do not complain because it does that <Col N="271" /> work.  I think it is an excellent agency. I think it has an excellent staff for carrying out that kind of work.  What we must remember is that the Post Office is endeavouring to fit into the same old buildings work which is three or four times greater than it was 25 and 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>That brings me then to the necessity for providing up-to-date accommodation for the transaction of Post Office business.  Many of our post offices to-day are just the same as they were 50 years ago.  It is in these buildings, some of them dark and dreary edifices, that the Post Office staff to-day is trying to do the greatly enhanced volume of work which now falls to its lot. Unless the Post Office seriously bestirs itself, I can see that problem still with us 50 years hence.  I have always thought it desirable that the Post Office should have control of the power of making decisions to meet its own needs; in other words, that it should do the work itself, after ascertaining its needs, out of money allocated on a repayment basis by the State.  Unfortunately, all the building of all the Departments is concentrated in the Board of Works.  I hope I will not hurt Deputy Donnellan's feelings now when I say that if one wants the Board of Works to do anything quickly, that institution quickly cures any impatience one may develop.  Everybody is tugging at the Board of Works.  One Department wants a post office; another Department wants a school; some other Department wants offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is tugging at the Board of Works.  When one approaches the Office of Public Works to find out the reason for some delay, one is told that they cannot get staff. When one asks why the Board of Works cannot get staff one is told that it is because the board's proposals are held up in the Department of Finance.  Then you sit down and wonder where you should go next.  If you go to the Department of Finance and say that you approached the Board of Works, they will tell you they gave them staff two years ago.  You find that you get <Col N="272" /> nowhere, with the result that unless you are a crusader you just give up the struggle altogether, leaving it to them to complete the building in their own good time.  My experience of the Board of Works was that the only person who got any attention was the person who was able to insist on having his representations dealt with immediately.</P>
      <P>The Board of Works is like the fond father from whom the crying child gets most attention.  If you approach the Board of Works with a quite and patient demeanour, you will find that you will be the second last in the queue; the quieter you are, the less you will get.  Your only chance of getting anything done is by forcing the issue.  If you adopt really gentlemanly tactics you will get nowhere.  I do not know whether the Minister would like to enter the field as a gladiator against the Board of Works, but I can assure him that writing plaintive letters marked &ldquo;Urgent&rdquo; will have no effect whatever on the board.  You might as well try to keep back the Atlantic with a fork as to expect to get any attention for such letters from the Board of Works.  That has been my experience and I recount it for what it is worth. I do not think the Board of Works changes its tactics even when there is a change of Government and I draw the Minister's attention to the necessity of fighting his corner so as to have erected for the Post Office the many necessary buildings which the Post Office requires to provide for the accommodation of its staff and the transaction of public business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I want to raise one matter.  I should like the Minister to indicate what is the present position in regard to the appointment of sub-postmasters. I understand that, during the course of the past year, a reform was introduced into the Department by which the power of making appointments was taken out of the Minister's hands and put into the hands of a Selection Board.  I should like if the Minister would give us some details as to how the Selection Board works.  Is it completely immune from ministerial interference? I should like to ask is the <Col N="273" /> recommendation of that board final or has the Minister the last word?  If the position is that the board has absolute and complete powers similar to those of the Local Appointments Commission or other bodies of that kind, I think it is a satisfactory arrangement because I think the old tradition in regard to Post Office appointments was bad and an incident which happened during the past year revealed how evil it was.  Deputy O'Higgins went out of his way to launch an attack on me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He suggested that in some way I had maligned the Minister's predecessor.  Nothing, I think, would be further from my wishes or desires than to malign Deputy Everett. Deputy Everett is my fellow Deputy for Wicklow and he and I have always been the best of friends.  <i>(Interruptions).</i> When the position arose in regard to the Baltinglass appointment, I had to take a very definite stand and I took that stand.  To suggest that in taking that stand in defence of ordinary fair play and decency I was maligning the then Minister is absolutely absurd. Does Deputy O'Higgins suggest that the parish priest of Baltinglass was maligning the Minister when he said: &ldquo;I am convinced that your Minister has done a grave injustice in appointing Mr. Farrell to the position.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;I am with my people in their agitation.&rdquo;  That letter was written by the late parish priest of Baltinglass and it was written to the then Taoiseach.  I think, in view of that fact, the Minister will acknowledge that there was complete justification for, and a complete vindication of, the stand which I took in that matter.  The fact that the person appointed was able to hold the position for only 11 days shows that the appointment was altogether an unsatisfactory one.  Since the matter was raised by Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;I had no intention of raising the matter since there has been a change of Government&mdash;I should like <Col N="274" /> to ask in connection with this appointment, which of the two applicants for the position which was advertised, Mr. Farrell and Miss Cooke, was recommended by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs?  Which applicant was given priority in the recommendation to the Department, Mr. Farrell or Miss Cooke?  I should like to have a clear and definite answer to that question.</P>
      <P>There is another matter on which I should like some information.  What was the total cost of transferring the post office in Baltinglass for a short time from Mill Street to Cuckoo Lane and what was the cost of re-transferring it to Mill Street?  I should like to have the exact figure in regard to the whole transaction, the full and complete figures.</P>

That was the statement of Deputy MacBride.  I pointed out that if Deputy MacBride and his Party had taken their stand for clean government on the occasion of the Baltinglass appointment they might have saved not only their Party's soul but a substantial portion of its body.  However, they decided in the wrong way, they marked out their own destruction and they dug their own grave.  I should like to think that the fight made by the Baltinglass people has resulted in a permanent improvement in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think that in future no such unjust appointment will be <Col N="276" /> made as that which was made in Baltinglass. I should like to feel when appointments are being made in future that long service to the Department, though it may not be direct service, long service to the public in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will be recognised and rewarded.  That would be only in accordance with ordinary decency and justice.  I trust that the Minister when replying will make it clear that as a result of the fight made by the Baltinglass people there has been a substantial improvement in the matter of making those appointments.  I hold that every citizen of this country is equal; that every citizen is entitled to equal fair play and justice.  I hold that entry into the public service and promotion in the service should be on the basis of merit and merit alone.</P>

The position which arose in regard to Baltinglass Post Office has ended for good.  I should also like to comment on a statement which was made recently by the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs before he went out of office in which he accused Miss Cooke of having made a statement for which he would demand withdrawal in his position as Minister.  I think that that represented a petty victimisation.  In the same way, his attitude towards the Guards, when he threatened them with action because they failed to persecute the Cooke family and their supporters, was also a grave interference with the administration of a Department over which Deputy Everett had no control. I think that is one of the reasons why the ex-Minister proved himself to the majority of this House unfitted to retain office as a member of the Government.</P>

      <P>Another important matter was raised by Deputy Norton. Here again I think Deputy O'Higgins should take Deputy Norton in hands and seek to prevent him from defaming the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Deputy Norton drew attention to the fact that there are a large number of persons working in the post office on part-time rates.  I think that is a gross scandal.  Why that should have been allowed to continue for three and a half years while a Labour Minister was in control I do not know.  I know that in my own parish there is a very efficient auxiliary postman working for 43/- a week for a six-day week.  It is true that he does not work a full day each day.  But the fact, remains that he leaves his house to go to work at 9.30 in the morning and returns at 4 o'clock.  It is very hard for him to supplement his inadequate part-time pay of 43/- in the remaining few hours in the evening. The fact that Deputy Norton so strongly condemns that system is in itself a condemnation of his colleague, the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan does the usual run-out which is characteristic of him and a few of his friends.  When I heard the hooves of the Baltinglass hobby-horses immediately Deputy Cogan rose, I anticipated that we would have seen what we saw before&mdash; the gallery filled with the working-class people of Wicklow in fur coats and the quadrangle outside filled with the workers' cars in order to hear what Deputy Cogan had to say about the Baltinglass episode.  I do not know if it was very much in order that this discussion should have been allowed, but it seems to have been.  Therefore, I suppose I am as entitled as anybody else to address myself to it and to the general principle of appointments which is to be followed in future by the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, and I think any fairminded person will agree, that I regard the present Minister as one of the <Col N="279" /> luckiest members of the present Government, because he is taking over a Department which has had a reputation for the past three years of being excellently run.  Any Deputy in any part of the House who had any reason to make representations to the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will acknowledge freely the fact that service of a kind which is seldom found in any Government was forthcoming so far as Deputies were concerned from the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and from those who surrounded him, his private secretary, to whom great tribute is due and, I am sure, the secretaries of the Department.</P>
    <P>We have had this question of Baltinglass bruited about this House so many times that many people must be sick of hearing it.  It is interesting to note that issues which appear great to some appear to be of very little importance to the mass of the people.  Deputy Cogan, in my view, is one of those people who never learn, who just will not learn.  He has been whistling the tune of Baltinglass in the House since the occasion of the appointment of Mr. Michael Farrell, and all to no avail. It must have been obvious even to the most foolish person who ever stood for a Dáil election that the people of Wicklow were behind the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to a man and that they were not behind Deputy Cogan.  Deputy Cogan crawled in at the bottom of the poll on preferences which he got from Deputy Everett, and he gets up in this House and, in order to draw a few lines in the paper, harks back to what seems to be the only tune he knows, Baltinglass.  Deputy Cogan will find that, compared with what will happen to him when the next election takes place, he has been very lucky in what happened to him recently.  He had a very narrow shave recently but I believe the next election will produce an entirely changed situation.  The people of County Wicklow who voted for Deputy Cogan did so in the belief that they were supporting Deputy Everett when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the wages of an auxiliary postman in his particular townland or the area in which he <Col N="280" /> resides.  I do not propose to address myself in that parochial fashion to any individual case.  Of course, everybody in the House knows Deputy Cogan's record in so far as the wages, conditions and treatment of workers are concerned. Nobody has fought harder in this House on issues relating to workers to stop the improvement of their wages or conditions than Deputy Cogan.  He must have some friend in the area in which he lives who works in the Post Office when he raises this single case. The Dáil should concern itself, not with any single case, but with the whole question of auxiliary postmen throughout the country.  Auxiliary postmen are essential to the efficient running of the country.  The work which they perform in the Post Office is essential. Many Deputies, over many years, have raised the complaint which I now raise, that these men have not been treated with justice in the matter of wages.  It is not right, it is not just, it is not fair to men, most of whom are married, that in this day and age they should be asked to work for 30 or 40 hours a week for a wage which does not enable them or their families to live in any sort of comfort.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the position could have been rectified in later years.  I believe Deputy Everett, when he was Minister, was making very good progress towards the remedying of that position in recent years.  This is a matter which must be tackled by the present Minister, and which should be tackled.  The Minister will be able to indicate what he proposes to do.  It is quite obvious that it will make for the more efficient running of the Post Office if men who are now badly paid are adequately paid and men who are now working only a couple of hours a day can have their working day extended to the normal average of eight hours, which applies to most workers, and thus have their wages increased to a living standard.  This would apply particularly, and should be easy of accomplishment, in areas such as County Dublin, particularly areas such as that which I represent, areas surrounding big cities, where there is a very big population and consequently a very heavy volume of post.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> It should not be outside the competence of the Post Office officials and the Minister to make a start in areas such as those surrounding the big cities, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere, and so to reorganise the postal service as to ensure that the position of auxiliary postman will be abolished, and that the existing auxiliary postmen will become full-time employees of the Post Office.  That can be done if sufficient effort and energy are devoted to the task and sufficient attention is paid to it by the present Minister and, if it is done, it will be welcomed by the members of all Parties in this House.</P>
    <P>That is the principal matter to which I wish to address myself on this Estimate.  I have already paid tribute to Deputy Everett, who acted as Minister for the past three years.  I do not think that anybody will deny the tremendous service which he rendered to the people and to the Post Office. The workers generally will be very happy in the knowledge that he as a Labour Minister was instrumental in having wage increases granted to them, and in having a decision taken before the present Government assumed office which the present Government must honour, and has undertaken to honour in accordance with precedent, whereby the employees of the Post Office will receive an increase in wages on similar lines to that which will be accorded the workers in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has gone.  Unfortunately, he went as soon as we took the opportunity to reply.  Deputy Cogan in his usual fashion waited until he thought every member of the House had had his say on the Estimate before he tried to get in his stab in regard to Deputy Everett and the Baltinglass incident.  I can only say&mdash; I only wish that Deputy Cogan were here so that I could say it in his presence&mdash;that Deputy Cogan need not think that by harking back to that incident he is enhancing his own prestige or political position.  The people have spoken very recently.  In my view and in the view of many people outside this House, Deputy Cogan has not obeyed the command of the people in <Col N="282" /> the manner in which he should.  That is something for which he will have to answer.</P>
    <P>The people have spoken in Wicklow on the conduct of Deputy Everett as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in no uncertain fashion and it remains that we have Deputy Everett in the House, not on any preference votes, not representing the rag, tag and bobtail of the Masonic Order, not representing all the dissatisfied cranks in Wicklow,- but representing the ordinary common decent people and Deputy Cogan is still here, just barely here and for a short time, as the veritable toe rag of the elements to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer the Minister to the latter portion of his speech in which he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In concluding my observations, I should point out that the plans for telephone development were being prepared in the years before 1948.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If they were, they were never submitted to me.  I had to call a conference of the engineers and make arrangements for meeting the demands of the people.  I may say that the engineers responded whole-heartedly to my efforts in that connection.  I insisted on a reorganisation of the services in the rural areas because I maintained that the men on the hillsides, in the valleys and in the outlying districts were entitled to daily deliveries just as much as the businessmen in the towns and cities.  I felt that these people should not have to wait unduly for a wire if a relative were dead or dying, but should have the same facilities, as taxpayers, as the people in the cities and towns.  I organised that scheme and I hope the Minister will continue that scheme and will not allow the heavy hand of Finance to turn him down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Department, he has a staff which is equal to, if not better than, the staff in any other service in the <Col N="283" /> State, a staff of good loyal officials whose sole object is to serve the State and the public and he is lucky in that he has such efficient officials.  These officials have been recognised as being very efficient not alone in this country but in many of the countries in Europe.  They have been offered the highest positions and the chairmen of various conferences have sent messages of congratulation to this country on our having such distinguished men in our service.  With the co-operation of that staff, there is no fear of the programme which we set in progress not being continued.</P>
    <P>We have heard about Baltinglass and I propose to give the history of that affair.  Mr. Farrell and an old lady, who did not produce her birth certificate, applied for the position.  He was recommended by a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators.  Mr. Farrell was not recommended by any of the Labour members.  I knew his people.  He himself had served his country and his father's property was burned down by the Black and Tans. The family had to live in a little hut, and the famous Major-General Dennis was the landlord who charged £1 a year ground rent.  When the Shaw Commission sat, it awarded Mr. Farrell's father £2,000 for the erection of a house.  He erected the house and Major-General Dennis increased the ground rent to £25 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing against Miss Cooke, and, when it was not popular, I voted for her relatives to fill positions for which they were qualified. Mr. Farrell had no connection with the Black and Tans.  He had served this country and not one belonging to him worked in Wicklow as a Tan. Can the other party say the same? When the matter came before me, I did not worry about the Department. These were the two applicants and I selected the one who had served this country and the person who, I believe, was best qualified.  During the previous fortnight, two Fianna Fáil men, one from Laois-Offaly and the other from Meath, had been appointed in similar <Col N="284" /> circumstances, simply because they were young men who were about to marry and settle down here instead of emigrating.  If anybody in this House were in the same position, what would have happened?  Would the appointment have been given to a man who had served his country or to an old lady who did not submit her birth certificate? She said she was 58 years of age.  I do not know about that, but I know she came to Ireland some years ago.  She was not an Irish citizen.  Her people were brought over by the ancestors of Major-General Dennis from Scotland and given jobs in Ireland of which Irishmen were deprived.  She was not a naturalised Irish citizen, because she was here only temporarily, so that it was a question of giving it to an Irish or an English person.  I decided to give it to the Irish person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has made certain statements and we have asked for proof.  He has refused to make them outside.  He has said I made a certain statement and I admit I did.  Miss Cooke is alleged to have said in a letter to the Press that I suppressed her recommendations.  I challenged her and told her that she would be answerable for this libellous statement outside.  I did say that.  Deputy Cogan said that I had made an attack on the Guards.  I never mentioned the Guards. He has again taken the <i>Irish Press</i> report which was supplied by a gombeen shopkeeper and not by a recognised journalist.  The journalist sent a report to the <i>Irish Press</i> and it would not be accepted because they had already taken from the gombeen shopkeeper, who was on the protest committee, an alleged report of a speech I never made.  I did complain about one individual whose job it was to preserve law and order.  I protested against his dining and wining with a cousin of the British queen.  I have got the votes of the plain people of Baltinglass.  Who were those on the protest committee?&mdash;cousins of the British queen, a gentleman from Poland, another from another part of the country and the famous Major-General Dennis, the rackrenter and member of the Basil Brooke fifth column.  Thank God, I did not get their support nor do I want it.  I got <Col N="285" /> the support of the plain people and Deputy Cogan has the members of the fifth column in Wicklow of Basil Brooke in Belfast, and he can keep them.  If trouble takes place, we will send these Brookes and fifth columnists across to the place where their spiritual home is.</P>
    <P>Now let me give some of Fianna Fáils history.  A post office became vacant some years ago in Kerry.  The postmistress there was assisted by her niece, Miss O'Sullivan, in a little shop. She was fully competent and suitable for the vacancy, but she was turned down and a sister of the Taoiseach's private secretary, Miss O'Connell, was appointed to the job.  That was the only qualification she had for the job. I am referring now to documents which I have received, not from the Department. That girl is still alive to tell the tale of the vacancy in Caherdaniel post office.  Let me give another case &mdash;the Waterville post office.  The post office there became vacant some years ago owing to the resignation of the postmistress, Miss MacSweeney.  There were several applicants.</P>

      <P>Let me give the case of the Ballymacelligott post office, to which the daughter of a Fianna Fáil Deputy, who is still in occupation there, was appointed.  In these cases, neither the Broy Harriers nor Basil Brooke's fifth column took any interest. <Col N="286" /> It is only when the poor labouring man whose father was attacked by the Tans comes up for appointment that the Masonic Order in Baltinglass takes any interest.  Their number appears in the 1950 directory of the Freemason report of that year.  They are there for anyone to see and there you will find some of the prominent people with their names, numbers and lodges.  This is the crowd that pretends they are looking after the interests of the people of the country.  In Carndonagh the position was given to a Fianna Fáil representative.  The removal was done at considerable cost, notwithstanding the hardship on old age pensioners who had to walk half a mile uphill, and it cost £20 a week for five months to keep the Department's staff there.  We had Basil Brooke's columns and the lodges siding here in the House but we are in a position now, having that 1950 directory, that we can publish their names and use them on the platforms in the various parts of the country.  Mr. Cogan can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He did not tell us what the destruction of the telephone poles cost or what the Guards were doing that they could not find out who cut down the poles.  It was common knowledge in Baltinglass.  What I did protest against was as regards the drinking of wine and the celebration of victory in the presence of the Queen's cousin.  Of course, to be associated with royalty was something new for Deputy Cogan.  He has not told this House why he left the Civic Guards.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a staff which is second to none and I appeal to him, in regard to the programme outlined, not to worry about the finance part, as there will be the heavy hand against everything that means improvement. If he looks up the record, he will find that for years previously every time we wanted economy it was said: &ldquo;We will start to reduce the deliveries in the rural areas.&rdquo;  We have given the rural areas, one-fifth of the country, a daily delivery at no extra cost.  I am proud at the achievements and cooperation of the whole staff over the past three years.  There were demands for telephones and no materials, but to-day the Minister will find a two years' supply of materials should an emergency take place.  He is not placed, as we were, practically down to one ton of wire.  We found people crying out for letter deliveries all over the country, no air delivery, no trains, and a letter taking about three days from Dublin to Wexford.  That has changed from the emergency.  The trains and aeroplanes are in service and there is a delivery to America. We are proud of our achievement in three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Minister that he will receive the support of this side of the House in his march of progress.  I compliment him and congratulate him on being appointed to the position. He has a staff whose whole concern &mdash;I do not know their politics, though I have been associated with them for years&mdash;is to improve the service and improve the Department.  Their one desire was to give the best service they could to the State.  So long as that continues, the Minister in introducing his next Estimate, will be able to show further progress in connection with the revision of the deliveries and the improvement of the telephones.  I recognise the difficulty in regard to <Col N="288" /> trunk calls, but the Minister will find that the cable has been laid from Dublin to Cork and work is proceeding with the contract signed for the cable from Dublin to the Border to relieve the situation in Drogheda.  In those lines of progress he will have the support of the members of the House.  I can assure him, as far as I am concerned, that it will be given without any undue criticism.  Other things may pass over, but the Post Office remains there.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be faced with difficulties, but I hope he will not be faced with the same problems as I had in the last three years&mdash;shortage of material, the question of reorganising the whole service, the problem of a strike on the railway last Christmas, and so on.  I hope he will not have the same problems and that he will be able to show success in his position.</P>

      <P>I am not going into the merits or demerits of Baltinglass or Carndonagh, but I understand that the ex-Minister has set an example whereby we may never again have a Baltinglass or a Carndonagh.  I understand a commission of civil servants has been set up and that in future all appointments such as postmasters will be made on the recommendation of that commission and that only.  That is a very good thing and it is a tribute to the ex-Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years past the radio telephone service to the islands in the West and North-West part of the country has been a disgrace.  I have known telegrams sent to islands off the coast of Donegal which were not delivered&mdash; through the inability of the receiving set to receive them&mdash;for seven days from the date on which they were handed in.  The ex-Minister took a very keen and personal interest in the radio telephone service to the islands and I am glad to see from the Estimates that he and his staff were instrumental in procuring up-to-date radio telephone equipment for the islands off the West and North-West coast.  I hope the present Minister will augment the scheme inaugurated by his predecessor and that in a very short time we will have each and every <Col N="289" /> inhabited island connected with the very latest radio telephone service.  I hope it will not be confined to a day service but will be a 24-hour one. That is a duty which we owe to the islands.</P>
    <P>Wherever possible, telephone exchanges should not be placed in post offices.  The disadvantages of having these public exchanges in local post offices are quite obvious.  A separate staff should be employed to deal with the telephone exchange and it should be completely separate.  Again, it should be impressed upon the staff of both post office and telephone exchange that secrecy is absolutely essential in regard to all messages. The Minister should take a very strong disciplinary stand on this matter of secrecy.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, wherever possible there should be at least one public telephone kiosk in every village.  I know professional and business men who have been inundated by requests from their clients and customers to use the telephone.  It would be for the benefit of all, and particularly for the benefit of the Post Office, if we had a public telephone kiosk in every village and town in the country.  As a last request I would appeal to the Minister to have a telephone installed as soon as possible in every sub-post office in the country.  I understand that there are some 800 sub-offices in which there are no telephones and the sooner phones are connected there the better for the telephone service and for the public generally&mdash;Deputy Everett has told us that we have a two years' supply of materials.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell, I do not propose to intervene at any great length in this discussion.  Like him, I am presented in my constituency with the problem of the inhabited islands.  Even an island which is close to the shore in Bantry Bay, Whiddy Island, suffers from tremendous irregularity in postal deliveries.  That arises from many reasons and the Minister might consider the type of boat used for mail delivery because an improvement in the type of boat would obviate the difficulty. It would not be so difficult as <Col N="290" /> heretofore because, as a result of the agitation which has been going on for facilities for the delivery of cream from the island to the mainland, it might be possible for the Minister, in collaboration with the Minister for Agriculture, to get a boat to brave weather conditions there&mdash;the gap to be bridged is a short one.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell, I would appeal to the Minister to speed up the provision of telephones to sub-post offices, particularly in isolated rural districts such as abound in Deputy O'Donnell's constituency and mine.  If it is not possible to have a separate installation and a separate staff, a portion of the post office premises should be reserved for people using the telephone so that they would not have to use it in a semi-public way.  The telephone cannot be used in any other way in many post offices in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell urged the Minister to consider very seriously the fact that the lack of secrecy in the telephone system of the country is becoming alarming.  It is amazing&mdash;I say this deliberately&mdash;that in the exercise of your duty as a public representative, no matter what message you endeavour to get through to your constituency there will always be leakages which can only be traced to one source, the Post Office itself.  That not only occurs to Deputies of one Party, but to Deputies of all Parties.  That should not be so, and I would urge upon the Minister the need for the enforcement of any regulations possible to ensure the secrecy and privacy to which the person using the telephone and paying for its use is entitled.</P>
      <P>The Minister should review as quickly as possible the question of the routes and the times of postmen in the rural areas.  I know of one extraordinary instance in my constituency where a postman operating in the Glengarriff area has lost his right to be considered permanent and pensionable by virtue of a 35 minutes' discrepancy in his times.  This is a very old case. In these border-line cases I would ask the Minister in his new found office, in which we wish him well, to exercise sympathy and mercy and to make such a person permanent and pensionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> There has been considerable agitation by people in the Ballylicky area where an effort is being made to get certain telephone installations.  A levy by way of deposit that strikes me as being inordinately high is charged against these people.  I have been in constant communication with the Minister's predecessor, and indeed in the last day or two I have raised the matter again with the Minister himself. Some method should be adopted to guarantee against loss which would not involve the necessity for an individual to deposit large sums, thus losing the benefit of the use of the money or interest upon it merely because he wishes to have certain facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a comparatively easy task because, no matter what slander or abuse his predecessor received, I think that he did a workmanlike job.  As the representative of a rural constituency I feel that it would be unfair of me to let this opportunity pass without paying a small tribute to Deputy Everett for the way he got things done during his period of office. I was very pleased to hear him state&mdash; and I hope the position is so&mdash;that the Minister has two years' supply of equipment on hands.  In the light of the present ominous situation, which changes from day to day, I would urge the Minister to make use of that equipment to develop communications in the rural districts so that never again will the needs of human beings in their extreme hour be unfulfilled because a telephone is not available in the area to call either for medical assistance or for the assistance of a priest.</P>
    <P>These may seem small things, but they are very large to the people in the rural areas.  They are facilities to which the people of rural Ireland are entitled.  They should have priority and the Minister should give priority to this public type of service, this most necessary service in rural Ireland, rather than to the installation of private telephones for subscribers who seek them.  I would urge upon the Minister in his present situation to speed up, if possible, the installation and development of rural telephonic communication.  I want to conclude on this note that I hope the day of disputes <Col N="292" /> with regard to appointments in the post offices or sub-post offices is gone, and that the Minister will continue to allow the committee or selection board of the senior personnel of his own Department to make the recommendations as to who should be appointed in any case, and, having got that recommendation, that he will implement it irrespective of class, creed or politics.</P>

      <P>I promise that I shall keep the Minister only two minutes to refer to a local matter to which I expect he will not be able to reply in the course of his speech tonight. It is something which affects a number of workers down in Wexford town.  I would like it to be taken up immediately and perhaps the Minister would let me know, in the course of a few days, what the position is and if something can be done in connection with the workers attached to the engineering section of the General Post Office in Wexford town.  About two weeks ago nine of these workers were assigned to a place called Ardee in County Louth.  I think it is daft that nine men attached to the engineering section of the Post Office should be sent to work approximately 130 miles away and I think Deputy Walsh will agree with me.</P>

      <P>I am not making any crib about that.  I am not trying to make a smart speech nor am I interested in who was Minister at that particular time.  I wonder if it is wise policy for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to have nine workers assigned to a town 130 miles away.  I appreciate it is not always possible to have the work localised in Wexford town or centred around Wexford but I think at least they could be kept in <Col N="293" /> the county or in that postal area.  If work shifts up the line, the workers in Arklow could be sent to Wicklow, those in Wicklow to Bray and workers from South County Louth or North County Dublin could be assigned to Louth.  It is very hard on these workers; six of them have families and it is tough on these families to have their breadwinner domiciled in a place 130 miles away.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the present Minister.  I appreciate this could happen under the present Minister's régime.  A Minister cannot have his finger on every single section of the Department.  Deputy Childers could not, any more than Deputy Everett, keep in close contact with every single thing that goes on in the Department especially as far as the employment of men is concerned. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to have that situation examined immediately with a view to seeing if these nine workers could be given employment nearer to their own town in Wexford.</P>
      <P>With regard to a remark Deputy Killilea passed in the discussion on Baltinglass in connection with my employment in private life outside this House, I challenge Deputy Killilea to raise that particular question when the Minister for Local Government comes into the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the many observations made by Deputies, I want, first of all, in a general way, to say that I will have all the questions they have raised, where they are of interest or where they throw some light on administration, examined with a view to seeing where some improvements could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now propose to deal with the details mentioned by Deputies.  Deputy MacBride spoke of the question of communication with islands.  Deputy O'Donnell also referred to this point. As I said in the course of my speech on the Estimate, we are doing all we can to improve the radio communication with islands.  A sum has been provided <Col N="294" /> in the Estimate&mdash;£7,000 I think&mdash; with that end in view.  All islands with a population of 100 or more have some sort of telephonic communication, either by radio or otherwise, and it is the object of the Department to improve that service as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride and other Deputies too have asked me whether I had any intention of restricting the expansion of the telephone service.  So far as I can foresee, and that is not very far at the present time, we have every intention to continue expanding the telephone service and to continue expanding and improving the postal services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride also referred to the shortage of staff that he was aware existed.  I think I ought to take this opportunity of appealing to the young people of the country to consider becoming electrical engineers.  Employment is assured for them in the postal service of this country where vacancies await them.  At the present time all electrical engineers who come forth from the universities are absorbed by the Post Office.  In fact, insufficient numbers are available.  The rates of pay are satisfactory and compare favourably with those of other State boards. I would, therefore, appeal to universities to consider whether they are doing enough to attract young people to this particular service.  As I have already said, the Department is able to absorb all the suitable persons who are trained as electrical engineers and who offer themselves for employment.  There is a bottleneck in telephone development arising from the shortage of staff.  Some people are attracted abroad, possibly by higher inducements, a love of adventure or other considerations, but they are needed in this country.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister tended to emphasise the construction of new exchange lines, the placing of telephones in dwellings of private individuals, in businesses and so forth.  As a result, there are already arrears of maintenance work, and further planning must be done.  We must get more electrical engineers if all this work is to go ahead.  Deputies will be of great assistance to the Department if they will do all they can to encourage young men who are not quite sure what type <Col N="295" /> of career they will take up, and who have some mechanical aptitude, to consider electrical engineering.  It is a very safe career and there are enormous opportunities for employment abroad in case there should be any lack of employment here.  I would like to put it the other way around&mdash;we can assure them of good employment in the Post Office, that is, those qualified sufficiently for the various grades.  The Department has actually sent persons to give lectures in University College in order to attract people to this particular service.  These lectures have had some effect.  Every step has been taken to avoid, so to speak, bidding for such engineers as become available by State boards in competition with each other.  We are doing everything possible to avoid such competition, so that each State board can get its particular proportion of engineers.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to one sentence in my statement in which I suggested that the award of higher remuneration to the postal staff was still a matter for consideration.  I only used the words &ldquo;if granted&rdquo; in that connection because any proposals put forward by the staff side to the Conciliation Council in the Post Office which had not yet been decided must be decided in some way or other.  I was using the term &ldquo;if granted&rdquo; in a purely technical sense, having regard to the decision made and to the date upon which the award was decided.  I think this is quite clear to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky, Deputy Kyne, Deputy Desmond and a number of other Deputies referred to the position of auxiliary postmen.  I agree with Deputies who feel that their work is, in some cases, exacting, and their wages more than modest.  In common with my predecessors, I will do all I can to see that their position is safeguarded and, if possible, improved.  The number of full-time temporary postmen, in relation to the number of partly-employed temporary postmen, is not so unsatisfactory as may be imagined.  Some auxiliary postmen have other sources of employment, which makes the position easier for <Col N="296" /> them.  Others are not so successful in that regard.  I am glad to say that their modest wages were very considerably increased during the time of our Government and since 1939&mdash;and they have increased since that date under the Minister who held office before me, though their wages are still very modest.  I think that everything that can be done for them should be done for them.  I have not been in this position long enough to know what the general state of affairs is.  I cannot say anything more than that. It would be very unwise of me to make foolish promises which I should be unable to implement.  Wages went up between 1939 and 1948 by anything from 70 to 80 per cent., and the wage which was achieved still was not anything remarkable in the way of a wage. Wages have increased since that date by a small amount&mdash;obviously not the same amount, but by a certain amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky referred to the delays in connection with telephone calls from Claremorris and district.  In the course of my opening speech I indicated that there would be inevitable delays until we increase the number of circuits and trunk lines.  I indicated that, if anything, during the past three years the emphasis has been upon an increase in the number of exchange lines and stations or individual telephone points as compared with the number of trunk lines.  As a result, there are still arrears in the work of providing sufficient trunk lines, minor trunk lines and circuits in order to deal with the increased number of telephone calls.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky suggested there was some discourtesy shown by certain telephone officials.  Any discourtesy should be investigated.  A great number of people serving in sub-post offices are, on the contrary, extraordinarily polite and give a kind of informal assistance to subscribers in the area which is altogether beyond what is expected of them in a very large number of instances of which I am personally aware.  While there are bound to be variations in the conduct of persons of their kind, as in the conduct of all other persons, I should like to have any suggestion of discourtesy reported. <Col N="297" /> As I know it, the tradition of the Department has been one of courtesy and kindness and thought for other people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky made various suggestions in regard to the order in which telephones were attached to the system. We have a priority list which includes people who have public duties to perform, and the priority list is followed as far as circumstances permit.  Over and above that, we try to reduce the time and expense involved in the creation of new exchange lines by dealing with all the applications from a particular area at once and trying to complete them.  Inevitably, there are departures from that plan and it does not work perfectly but, as far as possible, the group plan is carried out to a fair degree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky referred to places where the sub-postmasters have no half-holiday.  The practice is for the sub-post office to close when there is a half-day in the area.  If there is any exception to that practice, we should like to hear of it and see if we can remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the importance of establishing telephone call-offices in the country.  Some of them must have omitted to hear that part of my opening statement in which I said that 150 call-offices had been established since 1950; that 700 were left to be established and that, of those, 137 were in progress this year. That shows progress of a reasonable kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne spoke of the necessity for more stamp machines.  I have already indicated that these are on order and are being established wherever required.  We shall do all we can in regard to the establishment of telephone kiosks.  The actual charge, consequent upon the erection of telephone kiosks, is rather heavy.  I have been informed by the officers of my Department that it is as much as £35 a year.  They must be placed in areas where they will have some chance of paying their way.  I am always prepared to consider special exceptions. One Deputy referred to the possible <Col N="298" /> early closing of Garda stations.  That is a matter which should receive consideration. I cannot promise anything but if an area is completely isolated from telephonic communication at night, and persons who want to make urgent calls for medical assistance or religious aid, or something of that kind, cannot do so because no telephone is available, we would have to reconsider that matter.  I can hardly believe, however, that there are many areas of that kind in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky suggested that assistants to sub-postmasters are badly paid.  It is established that sub-postmasters will pay wages applicable to comparable forms of employment in the area.  If the Deputy knows of any case where there is no family connection, and somebody is clearly underpaid, the matter should be brought to the attention of the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy S. Collins referred to the absence of secrecy in the postal service.  I trust that Deputy Collins was exaggerating. I think that examples of failure to observe secrecy should be given.  In some remote areas, where there are hardly any secrets of any kind, it is very difficult for people not to imagine that maybe a secret was given away by a postal official when, in fact, it was repeated in the nearest pub.  It is extremely difficult to secure evidence of that kind.  There is no clear evidence that there is an absence of secrecy in the Post Office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond made one of the most useful and original suggestions in the course of this debate.  He suggested that during the tourist season in holiday resorts there might be a temporary alteration in the hours during which the telephone service operates.  I think that that was an excellent suggestion which will have the immediate attention of the Department.  It was novel of its kind and it deserves sympathetic attention.  He also suggested that some of these telephone exchanges might remain open on Sundays during the holiday period.  That might be difficult to arrange but we will at least examine the question of changing, temporarily, the hours of operation of the telephone exchange in the months <Col N="299" /> when we can expect a large number of holiday-makers both from our own country and from abroad.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara and other Deputies referred to the delays in the installation of trunk lines, call-office and subscriber services in the West and North-West country generally.</P>
    <P>I am informed that steps have been taken to catch up on the arrears in those areas by transferring the engineering gangs from other areas into the areas of the West and North-West. I cannot foretell what the effect of that will be in this financial year, but I understand that we are going to try and catch up on the arrears in respect of various types of equipment in the near future in the West.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett made the suggestion that there were no plans in regard to telephone installations when he became Minister.  It depends on what you call a plan.  A certain general outline of work to be done had been prepared and a great deal of the equipment had been ordered.  I am informed that 6,025 subscribers' lines were established in 1948.  In connection with those lines of telephones, most of them certainly must have been ordered in 1947.  I think the House will accept it as being inevitably true&mdash;I cannot say of all of them&mdash;that a great part of them were ordered in 1947.  Great progress has been made in recent years.  One of the interesting things about the telephone service is the progress that was made during impossible and difficult times, even during the war.  I was amazed to find that in 1939 there were 26,986 subscribers' lines, and that in the years of the armistice in 1945, there were 33,417.  Where the telephones and cables came from I do not know, not having been Minister at that time. I think it was a remarkable piece of work during the emergency.  The number of telephones then increased from 1945, when there were some 33,000, while by the end of 1948 there were 42,000 subscribers.  I think that credit for a great deal of that was due to the previous Government.  Equally, there is credit due to the Minister who held office before me for the fact that since 1948 the number has gone up again by <Col N="300" /> some 10,000.  Great credit is also due for this to a zealous staff and to the work done by the officers of the Department.  One has only to read the report of what was done, both in planning, before 1948, and in work done during the war in difficult circumstances, and in the work done from 1948, to know that there is in the Department a very highly efficient staff of which we should be proud.</P>
    <P>I should like to give Deputies the number of temporary postmen&mdash;and grade B delivery postmen&mdash;at the present time.  It is approximately 2,300. The number of auxiliary postmen and allowance deliverers is 3,200.  The ratio to men who have full-time work is not so unsatisfactory as might have been thought.  I thought myself that the figure of auxiliary postmen was rather large.  I quite agree that to increase the number of men who could get a whole week's work is not, necessarily, possible, because of the technical considerations involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan asked that I should say something in regard to the methods by which sub-postmasters are now appointed.  The previous Minister agreed to, and appointed, a selection board consisting of two assistant secretaries, the principal officers in charge of the establishment in telephone branches and the chief inspector of services.  This board, from the time the Minister made the appointment&mdash;the 2nd January&mdash;has been appointing sub-postmasters, and there has been no interference by the Minister in the appointments.  Political patronage has been discouraged in that connection.  It is provided that: &ldquo;the board shall disqualify for the said positions any candidate who uses, or attempts to use, political influence for the furtherance of his candidature for any of the said positions&rdquo;.  It is not my intention to alter the system which has been put into operation by the previous Minister.  I should add that, legally speaking, the Minister must make all appointments himself, and he must ultimately take full responsibility for the character of those appointed.  There is no escape from that obligation on his part, and I hope that this new system will work and succeed.</P>

      <P>Nor is it my intention to deal in detail with the observations of the previous Minister.  I do not intend either to say anything in regard to previous cases of which the former Minister gave alleged facts and details.  The public are well aware of the history of the Baltinglass case. They are well aware of the fact that public opinion revealed overwhelming support for the person who was finally appointed.  Public opinion revealed itself in a manner which had no connection with the alleged machinations of any societies or of persons of any particular faith or religion.  In fact, so far as public opinion revealed itself, it was represented in the proportions of all the faiths of this country as far as one could see.  It was fairly representative of all faiths.  As I have said, in so far as there was an expression of public opinion, it was unique in the history of postal appointments.  Even if everything the previous Minister said about certain other appointments were true, there never was that expression of public opinion which took place in connection with Baltinglass. As I have said, and I want to speak quite frankly about it, that public opinion was expressed by people who were in proportion to persons of all faiths, creeds and classes in this country.  There was no special emphasis on the part of persons of any one faith or one creed or one allegiance.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £136,250 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1952, for salaries and other expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had no part in the preparation of this Estimate and the House will not, therefore, expect me to justify the provision made under the various headings.  From the particulars supplied to me by the Department I shall, however, give factual information as to the causes of the variations in the sub-heads from last year, with a brief account of the working of the broadcasting service during the year <Col N="303" /> and a reference to a few other matters to which attention should be drawn.</P>
    <P>The net amount that will be required in the Wireless Broadcasting Vote for the year 1951-52 is £204,350.  This is a net decrease of £42,830 as compared with the provision in the previous year.  The true comparison, however, is between the gross totals for the two years as the fees estimated to be received from advertising programmes are this year being brought to the aid of the Vote as Appropriations-in-Aid. This is merely a change in accounting procedure.  Comparison of the gross totals show that there is a net increase in the provision this year of £5,170. The main increase is in Sub-head B from which payments are made for the provision of the daily programmes. Hereunder I give the reasons supplied to me for the variations in the sub-head provisions where an amount of any significance is involved.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A: Salaries and Wages.&mdash; The increase of £775 is of a casual nature and is due to a slight increase of staff, increments, changes in personnel and such normal matters.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B: Cost of Daily Programmes.&mdash;There is an increase of £5,920 on this sub-head.  Approximately £1,500 of it is intended to make slightly better provision for the payment of fees to playwrights to enable fees above the average to be paid for a small number of radio plays of outstanding merit if they become available. It also covers limited extra provision for variety programmes in Irish and English and to enable a few variety shows to be given in the provinces. The bulk of the remainder of the increase in the sub-head is for performing right fees (£1,600), which increase automatically as the number of licences goes up, and for payment of advertising agents who introduce sponsored programmes.  A small extra sum of £250 has been provided to improve the news service from the provinces.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C: Musical Instruments and Music.&mdash;The increase of £430 in this sub-head is an extra provision for musical instruments mainly to cater for additional studios which are being provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> Sub-heads E and F: Heat, Light and Power and Plant and Equipment.&mdash;A footnote to these sub-heads explains that a sum of £1,700 provided last year, and rescheduled, for the installation of heating, lighting and ventilation equipment in new studios in the General Post Office has been transferred from sub-head E to sub-head F, to which it is more appropriate.  The other changes in these sub-heads are of an incidental nature.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G: International Conferences, etc.&mdash;The provision in this sub-head has had to be increased by £525 due chiefly to a higher subscription payable to the new European Broadcasting Union.  The expenses of the former International Broadcasting Union were lower on the individual countries as there was a greater number of members. None of the Eastern European countries is a member of the European Broadcasting Union.</P>
    <P>The receipts from wireless licence fees in the year ended 31st March, 1951, were £193,395, that is, nearly £11,000 higher than the Estimate at the beginning of the financial year.  The revenue from sponsored programmes was £45,325 which is almost exactly the amount estimated.  The revenue from wireless licence fees in the coming year is estimated at £209,000 and from sponsored programmes £48,000.  The total estimated revenue of £257,000 is £4,650 more than the estimated gross expenditure of £252,350 from the Broadcasting Vote.  As against this, however, an additional sum of about £62,000 is estimated to be expended from other Votes on work done for Broadcasting; the particulars are shown at the foot of the first page of the Broadcasting Estimate.  The number of wireless licences at the end of March, 1951, was approximately 310,000 as against approximately 288,600 on the corresponding date in 1950.  It is hoped to maintain this rate of increase in the coming year and the estimated revenue has been framed, accordingly.  The saturation point for licences is now being reached gradually and it is not expected that the present rate of increase in licences will be maintained for many more years.</P>
    <P>This completes the information about <Col N="305" /> the financial provision in the Vote and the estimated revenue position and I shall now make a short reference to the programme operations.  It is, as I said, based on what has been supplied to me by the Department.  The outstanding feature of the programmes during the past year was the many broadcasts in connection with the Holy Year.  These took the form of broadcasts and series of broadcasts from our own studios, broadcasts direct from Rome, and material recorded in Rome by the staff for a series of programmes at home.  A member of the News Staff travelled to Rome with the National Pilgrimage and broadcast direct from the Holy City first-hand accounts of each day's events in the nightly news bulletins, and the head of the General Features department, accompanied by one of the mobile recording units, travelled to Rome in the autumn and collected recorded material for building into a series of descriptive programmes.</P>
    <P>In the regular programmes there was a development of considerable interest to the Irish language revival. What was begun by way of an experiment in the line of variety programmes in Irish attracted such public interest and enthusiasm that the seating accommodation of the Phoenix Hall, from which the programmes were broadcast, was insufficient to meet the applications for admission, and the series had to be extended.</P>
    <P>The policy of co-operating with efforts to organise public symphony concerts in various centres throughout the country has been pursued with increasing success.  Concerts have now been given in Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway&mdash;and their success has been so great that further visits by the symphony orchestra to most of these places either have taken place or are expected to take place. The most notable development in this field was the very successful visit of the orchestra to Belfast some months ago, when the largest hall in the city was filled to capacity by a most responsive and appreciative audience. Apart from public concerts, there have been two symphony concerts broadcast from Maynooth College, where the visits of the orchestra have stimulated <Col N="306" /> a lively interest in music among the students.  This is considered to be a development with good possibilities for the advancement of musical culture, in due course, throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The light orchestra has made a notable advance in the standard of its performances and has also taken part in public concerts in a couple of places outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>A new departure in the programmes was the launching of a weekly news feature devoted to provincial news.  It had long been realised that there are always many happenings and items of interest throughout the country, which, while not being of sufficient importance to call for inclusion in the regular news bulletins, reflect many valuable and often educational and entertaining aspects of the national life.  It is only comparatively recently that the facilities became available to make this special kind of news coverage possible. Much of the material is of an unobtrusive character and has to be located and written up.  Considerable use is made, in the compilation of the feature, of the mobile recording units and local correspondents, and the organisation, editing and production of these weekly broadcasts, called &ldquo;Provincial News Round-Up,&rdquo; calls for a good deal of detailed attention.</P>
    <P>The number of broadcasts of particular interest to farmers has been increased and their scope considerably widened.  The weekly talk for farmers, broadcast on Wednesdays, now has a large and steady public.  Evidence of this is provided by the volume of correspondence and queries on farming matters with which the broadcaster has to deal.  Farming features of a more diversified character have been broadcast regularly on Saturday nights many of them dealing with farming topics and methods in other countries as well as in our own.</P>
    <P>The need for the technical balancing within the studio of all that is broadcast is something of which many listeners may not be acutely aware, but which plays a vital part in deciding the quality of transmission.  In a small organisation it is difficult to command the conditions necessary for the training <Col N="307" /> of expert staff to concentrate on this aspect of broadcasting.  The British Broadcasting Company lent valuable aid in this matter, however, and a balance and control officer is about to be appointed who was given a period of training with the corporation. This will undoubtedly result in an improvement of the balance of programmes and of the musical programmes in particular.  An important matter related to this is the acoustical character of studios and this, also, has been receiving close attention.  Improved equipment for measuring the acoustical characteristics of the studios has now been supplied and many improvements have been effected, notably in the Phoenix Hall.</P>
    <P>These are all the matters of a programme nature to which I need refer, but the Department would like me to call attention to a few matters which are not concerned directly with programme building, but which are at the same time of importance for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Listeners on the Dublin wavelength will have observed that there has been serious interference with reception for some time past.  It is believed that this is being caused by a station working on power higher than that authorised under the European Broadcasting Plan. Representations are being made in the matter, but it is not known what effect they will have.  It is proposed to purchase a new transmitter for Dublin which will work on somewhat higher power than the present transmitter. When the transmitter has been obtained and installed it should help to get over the interference, if it has not been removed in the meantime.  It has also been decided to purchase new transmitters for Athlone and for Cork, but owing to present supply conditions, there is no certainty about the time of delivery of the three transmitters.  No provision has been made for them in the present year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>Local interference by electrical apparatus is also increasing, due to the wider use of electricity.  The Department's staff for helping in locating the cause of this interference has been strengthened, but quite <Col N="308" /> obviously it would take a huge staff to attend to every individual complaint of faulty reception.  The Department would like to urge the public that, before making any complaint, they should first have their own sets, including the aerial and earth connections, examined to make sure that the trouble is not there.  It would also be well if neighbours would co-operate to see if the trouble is general in the area and also by making representations to the owner of any plant which they think might be causing the interference. If local efforts fail to remove interferences the Department's engineering officers will be glad to help in every way possible.  They carry stocks of suppressors which they are prepared to fit at cost to any apparatus which is found to be causing trouble.  The Department is also doing everything possible to try to have interference removed at the source, that is, before electrical apparatus gets into the hands of the users.  Distributors of such apparatus who have been approached have promised the utmost co-operation in regard to getting suppressors fitted to the apparatus they supply.</P>
    <P>The Department would also like to make a special appeal to set-owners about the renewal of their licences. The organisation for dealing with wireless licence work is much more costly than it need be if all set-owners obtained their licences promptly.  In Britain the Post Office retains 7½ per cent. of wireless licence revenue to defray the cost of collection.  As Deputies will see on page one of the Broadcasting Estimate, the Post Office charge here for work for broadcasting this year is put down at £45,000 or more than 20 per cent. of the estimated licence revenue.</P>
    <P>The comparison between 7½ per cent. and 20 per cent. is not a strictly fair one as the British licence costs £1 as against our 12s. 6d.  Moreover the Irish Post Office performs a good deal of work for broadcasting which in Britain is done by the B.B.C. itself. Allowing for these factors, however, the cost of collecting licence fees here is unduly heavy.  I am afraid the main reason for this must be found in the reluctance of our set owners to meet <Col N="309" /> their licence obligation as it arises. According to the recent Report of the Beveridge Broadcasting Committee, over 99 per cent. of set owners in Britain respond to postal reminders for the renewal of their licences.  About 20 per cent. fail to respond to the renewal notices here.  That is an unsatisfactory position.  It gives no pleasure to the Department to have to institute legal proceedings against wireless licence defaulters, but it is obliged to see that the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act are complied with.  The expenditure on broadcasting is also increasing considerably and it is most important that the revenue should keep pace with it. Through the House I would like to urge the Department's appeal to the public to co-operate in this question of licence renewal.  If full co-operation is given it will avoid unpleasantness for the Department and for set owners and will save a great deal of expenditure on correspondence and inspections that should be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>There are many broader and more fundamental matters connected with broadcasting, such as broadcasting accommodation and the short wave station, on which I cannot usefully comment as I have not had an opportunity of examining them.  I shall do so, however, as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Department and the Director of Broadcasting that the staff generally connected with broadcasting gave unfailing attention to duty during the year and I want to thank them for it.  I would also like on behalf of the Department and for myself, to thank the members of the Broadcasting Advisory Committee, who, I am informed, continue to contribute most useful advice on a variety of matters connected with the broadcasting service.</P>

      <P>In relation to plays, music and other forms of entertainment, I do not know how the Minister's mind works.  Knowing a little about the present Minister, however, I believe there are many things he can do further to improve Radio Éireann.  Many criticisms of Radio Éireann have been voiced here during <Col N="310" /> the short time I have been here, but I still say we can well be proud of our radio station.  If I make certain suggestions to the Minister which would, in my opinion, go towards improving still further Radio Éireann.  I am sure that he will not take them amiss.  I appreciate, as I am sure the House appreciates, the difficulties under which Radio Éireann has operated and continues to operate.</P>
      <P>They experience difficulty, as the Minister has mentioned, with regard to the premises which are not at all suitable for broadcasting, because, in the first place, they are too small and because, as the Minister has also stated, they do not possess the sound-proof qualities required for broadcasting. There is also the difficulty I believe that our station is sometimes jammed by other powerful stations.  That is something over which we have not a lot of control, though we may have some control.  I believe that some powerful outside stations have tried to jam our station out of its wave-length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first improvement that I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;and I made a similar suggestion when I first spoke on this matter in this House&mdash;is that Radio Éireann should start its programme at 12.30 p.m.  The reason must be obvious to everybody.  Manual workers in this country, so far as my constituents are concerned in any case, leave work for their lunch at 12.30. Suppose they arrive home about twenty minutes to one, they have to wait until 1 p.m. before Radio Éireann comes on the air.  They have to leave for their work again at 1.10 p.m. or 1.15 p.m. so that they can hear only a quarter of an hour of what is termed Radio Éireann's lunch-time programme.  I suggest that the station should operate from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.  That would give the same length of time for broadcasting as is permitted under the present system.  I do not believe there are many people who listen to Radio Éireann from 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.  The workers have returned to their work at that time and the unfortunate housewife is cleaning up after the mid-day meal.  I would therefore suggest that the Minister should consider starting the lunch-time programme at 12.30 p.m. <Col N="311" /> I think he should also continue to encourage the idea of sponsored programmes, first of all, because they advertise many of our Irish products.  I think it a good thing that Radio Éireann has adopted a system of allowing Irish industrialists and manufacturers to run sponsored programmes. The people who run these programmes are, I think, also to be congratulated on the type of programme they select while the officials are to be congratulated on the way they &ldquo;vet&rdquo; these programmes as I believe they must be &ldquo;vetted&rdquo; and approved of by the officials.  I must say that their choice is very good.</P>
    <P>I have heard complaints, to which I also referred on the last occasion on which I spoke on this Vote, in regard to the method by which some of the news is transmitted from Radio Éireann.  Under the present system, I believe, news in respect to G.A.A. games is supplied by every Tom, Dick and Harry throughout the country.  I made a plea here before that that work should be given to the local newspaper representative, whether the game be in Dundalk, Drogheda, Athlone, Wexford or Cork.  The local newspaper representative should be given by the Department the duty of transmitting the result of matches instead of leaving it to the district secretary, this publican, or this, that or the other supporter. It is a job for a newspaper man, and a newspaper man is best fitted to do it.  If he is to get a fair chance in his profession Radio Éireann as a State sponsored organisation should entrust that job to him.  I think we have learned in this country, as people in other countries have also learned, that it is necessary to rely on newspaper men to give accurate reports.  I have listened on occasions to the Sunday night broadcasts of G.A.A. results, and I have found some of them wrong.  I think that in some cases where the broadcasting authorities depended on some local man, the result was not given.  The unfortunate fellow whose team was probably beaten had either got drunk or was so disgusted that he did not bother to go to the telephone to ring up Seán <Col N="312" /> Ó Ceallachain or whoever was in charge of receiving the results, to tell him who won the match.  I think you can always depend on a newspaper man, whether he be a top-notch journalist or a local village reporter, to give a good account and the correct result of a match.  I appeal to the Minister to see what can be done to correct the position which obtains at present.</P>
    <P>There is another complaint which I should like to put forward on behalf of many talented people throughout the country.  I am sure Radio Éireann, and perhaps Ministers themselves, have been badgered and pestered from time to time about Johnny or Mary who had a fine tenor or soprano voice or who could play the accordion to perfection.  There are, however, a number of really talented people down the country who should get an opportunity of displaying their talents, and who cannot get that opportunity because it is too expensive to come to Dublin to obtain an audition.  I believe that on occasion local auditions are held, but the records they make in a provincial town are not considered sufficient by the Radio Éireann authorities.</P>
    <P>I had a few examples of that character. One in particular I think I mentioned here before was that of a man who had made several records of his playing of the accordion and they were not accepted by Radio Éireann as a substitute for an audition.  They had nevertheless the audacity to use these records without his permission.  That I agree is beside the point and I am not raising that question particularly.</P>
    <P>I think, however, it should be possible to have local auditions especially for people who are talented in the playing of various musical instruments.  I think there might be some system whereby a postmaster in a provincial town would have power to arrange for auditions, not by himself, but by some reputable musician whose word the Department would accept because, as I have already pointed out, it is not worth a local artiste's while to spend money coming to Dublin and to provide for himself here, in order to have an audition, only to be told after he <Col N="313" /> had gone back: &ldquo;You were not accepted,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You were accepted for a ten minutes' broadcast for which you will get two or three guineas.&rdquo;  It just would not pay him to come to Dublin for an audition under these circumstances. There are many people outside Dublin and Cork who should have these auditions, people who, I believe, could make a contribution towards musical culture generally in this country if they were given the opportunity by Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion which I would like the Minister to examine.  I do not know whether it is feasible, but I do know that it was successful in one connection before.  There were a number of musical recitals given by way of gramophone records by the late Harold White, in particular of Gilbert and Sullivan operas.  The performance consisted of the playing of about 12 records of each opera and the late Harold White delivered a monologue or read a script at intervals giving some very interesting items in regard to the operas.  These were very successful broadcasts.  We have many musical societies operating in Dublin which usually put on two shows each during the year&mdash;one in spring and another in autumn or at the beginning of winter.  We have societies like the Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, the Dublin Musical Society and the Old Belvedere Society.</P>
    <P>They run shows in the Gaiety Theatre for a week or two weeks and I wonder would the Minister consider the possibility of having these broadcast, not on the first night, because they are amateur societies and anybody who knows anything about amateur productions knows what a first night is. I suggest that if Radio Éireann took its apparatus to the Gaiety Theatre on the third or fourth night of such a production the people outside Dublin down the country would enjoy very much any of the productions of that type of society.</P>
    <P>There is another avenue which the Minister could also explore and I do not think he would have any difficulties so far as finance is concerned.  We hear far too little of the No. 1 Army Band and the other Army bands.  I have such an admiration for the No. 1 <Col N="314" /> Band in particular that I think it is a crying shame that the people outside Dublin have not the advantage of hearing it more often, or indeed any of the other Army bands or, for that matter, the Garda Síochána Band.  If there could be more recitals from these bands it would add to the prestige of Radio Éireann.  I agree with the Minister in everything he said about the light orchestra which has been a tremendous success.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it or not but Radio Éireann has a worldwide reputation as far as the production of plays is concerned.  Recently I heard or read a comment from the B.B.C. paying a magnificent tribute to Radio Éireann for the type of play produced and the manner in which it was produced.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my complaint about interference with Radio Éireann. That is something which it may be difficult to correct at times, but it is something which the Minister ought to tackle because in some parts of the country it is absolutely impossible to tune in to Radio Éireann at certain times during the night.  These are a few suggestions which I thought I might put before the Minister.  The majority of them may not be feasible, but, knowing the ability he has, I know that the Minister will at least explore these possibilities.  If there is any merit in the suggestions, I should like them to be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a matter which I also raised in the course of last year.  It is in regard to our news bulletins.  There is a feeling that on many occasions the news bulletins are very much biassed.  With a new Minister now, it would be well to review that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the present Minister will approach this matter in an absolutely impartial manner, and I hope that in the course of the coming year there will be no cause for complaint. It would be only right and proper that a copy of the script broadcast should be retained and made available to Deputies.  It should be possible for any Deputy to look up the broadcasts which have been made over the year to see to what extent they <Col N="315" /> comply with the rules of ordinary fair play as between different Parties, to what extent they are really efficient news broadcasts and provide the items of news which are of general interest.</P>
    <P>I have the feeling that far too much time is devoted in the news bulletins to hackneyed and dismal foreign news, dismal accounts of the struggle between the various world Powers for supremacy. We all know that that struggle is going on and that it is a tremendous struggle on which perhaps the existence of the human race depends, but at the same time we as a people are very much interested in our own national and local affairs.  A good deal more attention should be given to the collection and broadcasting of purely Irish news.  In that regard, I should like to re-echo what Deputy Corish said about giving preference to good, reliable Press reporters who have the knowledge and the experience to present news that is really of value and to present it fairly.</P>
    <P>I do not want to touch upon anything which might by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as contentious, but I think the manner in which the news in regard to the appointment of a certain postmaster last year was dealt with by Radio Éireann did cause a terrific amount of comment.  The matter was suppressed for a long time and then on one particular night we had a long rigmarole from the retiring postmaster and the Minister's reply.  I think both were written by the same person, but that does not matter.  It certainly took up the greater part of the time allocated for the news on that night.  If Deputies had an opportunity of looking over the script of the news broadcasts from day to day we would have an opportunity of checking up and seeing to what extent the news bulletins are a fair presentation of the news items of interest.  I feel that while in regard to instrumental music, operas, etc., we get fairly good broadcasts, in regard to the lighter side of radio entertainment we are not getting sufficient value for the license fees we pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be a bad idea.  If the replies and interruptions of these people were also broadcast, it would make things rather lively.  I have frequently expressed the view that a broadcast of a little bit of political debate would be appreciated.  I am often amazed at the very contentious subjects broadcast from the B.B.C. and other foreign stations.  I do not know why we should be so timid in matters of that kind.  Why should we not have a debate on such contentious matters as the Baltinglass affair or the mother and child scheme or any of those things which are topics of interest for the day or for the week?  A debate of that kind would be listened to with great interest. There are other matters which could also be the subject of interesting debates.  For example, in dealing with agricultural matters, it is not necessary to have a heavy lecture on what is the best type of fertiliser to use, the best type of stock, the best breed of cattle, etc.  A short debate between two experts with different views upon a matter of agricultural interest would arouse far more interest than a straight lecture.  What the people want is discussion, dispute, if you like.  They enjoy that and I think they are entitled to get it.  I am surprised at the extent to which the B.B.C. cater for that demand.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I should like to stress&mdash;I know a certain amount is being done in regard to it-and that is the arousing of interest in history, particularly local history.  I should like to see each district of the country taken and a history of that district broadcast in an interesting way, perhaps made the feature of an historic sketch with the leading characters of the pageant of Irish history.</P>
      <P>County Wicklow teems with examples of the most magnificent personalities in Irish history&mdash;Art MacMorrough Kavanagh, Hugh Fiacra O'Byrne, Michael Dwyer, and all those great figures who played so important a part in history. Each district is intimately associated with their activities.  Glendalough is associated with St. Kevin and there are other historic places.</P>

      <P>I feel that particular feature of broadcasting should be developed to a much greater extent.  It would be of tremendous benefit to our people.  One matter which has been the cause of complaint here is the manner in which people who provide scripts for broadcasts are remunerated.  I am told that the remuneration for Gaelic writers is altogether inadequate.  I have been given examples where a fee of approximately £10 per hour is paid for a script in Gaelic while the fee for a somewhat similar script in English is up to £75 per hour.  There is wide disparity there which seems to operate against those who seek to advance knowledge of our own language.</P>
      <P>I certainly think it would be a good idea for the new Minister who, I am satisfied, has an impartial mind, to review the manner in which news is broadcast and the type of news that is broadcast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year when speaking on the Estimate I referred to the fact, which was obvious, I am sure, to the Minister and to everybody else, that of the programmes broadcast by Radio Éireann, by the far most popular amongst the people are the sponsored programmes.  It would not be right that the entire time of our national broadcasting station should be taken up by programmes designed to advertise commercial products but, last year, the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs indicated that the matter was under consideration.  It might be possible to have sponsored programmes broadcast during what may be described as the valley hours, the hours during the morning and afternoon which ordinarily, at the moment, are not utilised at all by Radio Éireann. It would be a very good thing if that possibility were explored by the Minister and, if possible, implemented.  It would mean increased revenue for the Post Office and increased employment from the point of view of those who <Col N="318" /> would be engaged in the particular programmes.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made in regard to broadcasting the proceedings of Dáil Éireann.  I hardly think that this Parliament is sufficiently mature to permit of such broadcasts.  Some of us would hate to think that some of the performances that we have seen here would be broadcast.  On the other hand, it might have a beneficial effect. It might open the eyes of some of the people to what goes on.</P>
      <P>In my opinion it would be a good idea to follow the headline which has been set in other countries in regard to major political issues.  In America and England, and possibly in other countries, when major political issues arise which give rise to controversy amongst the people, or which result in a cleavage of opinion, the facilities of the broadcasting network are made available to the leaders of various parties.  That would be a very good innovation in this country.  It would be a good thing if at election time the leaders of the various Parties were given a certain amount of time on the air to state their policies, and so on. Such an innovation would be appreciated by the people.  I definitely would disagree with the suggestion that the proceedings of Dáil Éireann should be broadcast indiscriminately. The time may come when that might be possible.  The system which has been adopted in England of inviting leading speakers of opposing political parties to debate certain specific subjects on the air might be explored with some benefit, but the indiscriminate broadcasting of parliamentary debates has not been adopted, to my knowledge, in any country, and I do not think it should be adopted here, at the present juncture at any rate.</P>
      <P>I recommend to the Minister that he should explore the possibility of increasing the time allowed for sponsored programmes during the hours which are not utilised for broadcasting at the moment.  In view of the possibility of an early general election, urgent consideration should be given to the suggestion that time might be given for speeches by political leaders on the air.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated in the course of my speech, I have had very little time to study the work of the broadcasting station.  I can only promise to Deputies that I will have regard to what they have said in the rather short debate that we have had.</P>
      <P>I may make a few references to some of the suggestions made about which I have been given some information. Deputy Corish suggested that we should increase the number of sponsored programmes.  There are all sorts of technical and financial difficulties there, which have to be overcome, apart from other considerations.  I can only say that I will give consideration to the proposal, but I am afraid it is not easy.  There is the question of limitation of accommodation and there are other matters to be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion to start the programme at 12.30, that would not be a physical impossibility, but, curiously enough, Deputy Corish may be interested to learn, there have been very few requests for that and if we had more requests we might consider it sympathetically.  So far there does not appear to be much evidence that the public would wish to have broadcasts starting earlier than the present hour.  However, the suggestion will have consideration, as will all Deputy Corish's proposals.</P>
      <P>With regard to the newspapermen and the giving of match results, I am informed that we have a number of local news correspondents working for Radio Éireann and that we get the results of matches included in the news bulletin from them whenever possible. In other places, apparently, it would not be worth while to engage local newspapermen and the information is got from any source that may be available. I suppose that source, on some occasions, as the Deputy indicated, may be an unreliable one.  I am informed that the results in the Sunday night special sports feature are obtained by the commentator, Seán Ó Ceallacháin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to searching for talent and examining talent reported, there is generally far less talent of a kind suitable for broadcasting, as distinct from <Col N="320" /> performing in small halls, than is imagined by the public, but we do arrange local auditions occasionally, and, if Deputy Corish knows of any case of genius undiscovered, he should give the name or ask the person concerned to write to the Director of Broadcasting and we will see what we can do.  As I have said, and as the Deputy well knows, the technical qualification for broadcasting is very often very different from the technical qualification from the point of view of performing in a very small hall.  Over the radio it is very often not the same thing.  I agree with Deputy Corish with regard to the No. 1 Army Band. I will see whether we are not having sufficient broadcasts by the band and see what can be done about it.</P>

      <P>And the Garda Síochána Band as well.  I should like to say a few more words with regard to interference.  Without having any experience of the working of the Department, except what I have gained from a very brief conference with the officers, I think I would be quite safe in making an appeal to the hundreds of importers of electrical apparatus into this country to fit their machines with suppressors immediately.  There is a perfectly good case for making it legally obligatory on them to do so. Nobody could say that it would be an interference with the liberty of the individual when we relate it to the numberless other Acts passed by this House and before us to prevent people making nuisances for other people. There could be nothing objectionable or lacking in precedent if we passed a law compelling the first importer, or the first manufacturer, in the case of an Irish manufactured article, to fit a a suppressor to his apparatus.  It would save the Department a lot of trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not gone to that point yet. We may try circularising the whole of these people&mdash;there must be hundreds of them&mdash;and ask them to co-operate with us voluntarily and to fit suppressors to everything, from electrical heating pads for invalids to refrigerators. I make an appeal to these people to make this law unnecessary.  A great <Col N="321" /> many of them are already co-operating with the Department.  Many of them have responded to the suggestion made, while others have not, as I know myself, because, when I bought the other day a piece of electrical apparatus from an acknowledged reputable maker, it had no suppressor fitted and there was a complaint against me by some other people before I assumed this onerous position which I was able to correct.  I had assumed that all the well-known makers of apparatus fitted suppressors to their goods before they left the factory or the importer's rooms.  Such is not the case and these suppressors should be fitted.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies interested in the broadcasting service to the encouragement of the development of sponsored concerts. Symphony orchestras can travel to a local area where a hall can be engaged by a person who is interested in music and who wishes to advertise his concern. It is a method of securing an advertisement and doing good for musical culture in the country, and, if Deputies know of any firms who have the financial capacity to arrange for a sponsored concert by the radio symphony orchestra, they should ask them to get in touch with us.  It is one of the least expensive and best ways of bringing music down to the country and I hope that we can develop the idea of these sponsored concerts not only by the radio symphony orchestra but possibly by other groups on the same basis &mdash;not a development of advertising in the literal sense, but an indirect advertisement, on the one hand, and a spreading of the musical facilities made available by Radio Éireann, on the other.</P>
    <P>We come at last to the question of the news service and I want to say right away that it would be quite fatal if Deputies were to press me to have the broadcasts laid on the Table of the House and available to Deputies, not because any definite harm might come through doing so, but because any work that I or the officers of my Department can do to improve the news service, to alter it in any one way with a view to making it better, can be done only if there is not even the slightest suggestion <Col N="322" /> of political influence.  Even the feather touch of a T.D. or Minister would make it impossible for the news service to develop on the lines of providing news of political importance which is interesting and designed on the basis that it is impartial and, at the same time, interesting to the public.</P>
    <P>If the news service has been unsatisfactory in the past, the easiest way to make it continue to be as unsatisfactory is to adopt any kind of political bias towards it and allow it to become the subject of, shall we say, indiscriminate political comment.  The people who operate the broadcasting service and the news department know that very well and any reputable long-term newspaper man knows it, too.  You have the very difficult job, therefore, that the Minister is responsible for the wireless news service and must ensure that so far as possible it is well balanced and, at the same time, must try to keep his own influence out of it, or he will never achieve the right objective.  I am speaking, as I have said, in a very premature way about something of which I know very little, but I know enough about human psychology to know the necessity of making it possible to have an independent news service from Radio Éireann with the least possible political interference. At the same time, I know that I am responsible for seeing that the news service is balanced and to reconcile these two positions is not going to be easy.  I am not even going to say that I consider the news service is unsatisfactory.  I have not been long enough holder of this position and so all the suggestions made in regard to the news will be considered like the others.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Cogan said about the emphasis on foreign news, we established a provincial news round-up to correct, perhaps, a disproportionate amount of foreign news.  We cannot help it if the foreign news is gloomy, but, having listened to Radio Éireann news on very many occasions, I think it is, on the whole, fairly well balanced from the point of foreign news items and items of home interest, and still more balanced now that there is this item of provincial news in the provincial news round-up feature.  If <Col N="323" /> Deputy Cogan knows of any cases where writers in the native language for Radio Éireann have been paid insufficient fees, I shall be glad if he will send the facts to me.  I will make sure that they are properly investigated.</P>
    <P>At the moment I do not favour political broadcasts.  I think it would be very difficult to arrange and I have not made up my mind about them.  I do not agree with Deputy Dunne that the Dáil is not sufficiently mature to justify the broadcasting of the debates, and I would not agree that that was a proper reason for not having broadcasts of political debates.  There are quite enough mature speeches made here by members of all Parties to justify such broadcasts, but so far as I know there has never been any request for political broadcasts, and a very large number of persons in this House do not favour them.  They think that on the whole the reports in the newspapers and the close contact which Deputies keep with their constituencies are possibly sufficient, but I have not made up my mind on any of these matters and I will give atention to all that has been said in this rather short debate on the wireless service.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,292,380 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total net amount required in the Vote for the Department of Local Government for the current financial year is £6,688,380.  The total net amount for the last financial year was £4,382,160, but as the Estimate for the current year includes unexpended balances from other Votes now transferred to this Vote, the actual comparable figure for 1950-51 should be increased <Col N="324" /> by £2,000,000 in respect of the former Vote for Transition Development Fund and by £240,000 from Vote 10, being the amount provided in the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote in respect of sanitary services schemes.  After making these transfers, comparison of the provision for 1951-52 with that made for 1950-51 shows a net increase of £66,220 in respect of the Department's Vote as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Transition Development Fund was instituted after the emergency to ensure that post-emergency schemes could proceed with expedition notwithstanding the heavy and erratic increases in costs of labour and materials which had been brought about by international conditions and which were likely to persist for some considerable time after hostilities had ceased in Europe and elsewhere.  The fund has been utilised, so far as the Department of Local Government is concerned, for supplementing the normal pre-1939 rates of subsidy towards loan charges on housing schemes. It was also drawn on to supplement the grants which were allocated from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote towards waterworks and sewerage schemes.  Early in 1950 it was decided to terminate the grants from the Transition Development Fund before the end of the financial year 1950-51 and, accordingly, no grants from the fund have been allocated towards schemes sanctioned after the 1st November, 1950.  The Estimates which I am introducing make provision for the continuance of a proportion of the balance of the Transition Development Fund and employment and emergency schemes grants applicable to schemes sanctioned before the 1st November, 1950, to the extent to which payments therefrom are likely to be made in the current year.</P>
    <P>As far as sanitary services schemes are concerned, the local authorities have already been informed that subsidy in future will be dealt with on the basis of contributions to loan charges corresponding in extent to the assistance hitherto given by way of grant.</P>
    <P>In the case of housing, the fixing of alternative subsidisable limits for the purpose of recoupment of a proportion <Col N="325" /> of the loan charges in respect of houses and flats of the type hitherto ranking for Transition Development Fund grants, is at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>During the financial year ended 31st March last the number of houses and flats completed by local authorities was 7,787 and there were 10,222 dwellings in course of construction at the same date.  Since then, further large schemes have been commenced by the Dublin and Cork Corporations and by the Carlow Urban District Council.  In addition, sites have been acquired by local authorities for about a further 14,000 houses and plans for the development of a number of these sites are already well under way.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that there has recently been a retarding of the Dublin Corporation's housing programme owing to a cement shortage and certain difficulties in regard to the working of overtime.  It is my earnest hope that these difficulties will be overcome and that a steady output of dwellings may be maintained.</P>
    <P>The post-war housing needs of the working classes were estimated to be 69,908 dwellings as at 31st March, 1947. Since then 15,686 dwellings were provided up to the 1st April last.</P>
    <P>Up-to-date housing surveys are necessary to ascertain the present position in each area.  Arrangements are being made to have these surveys carried out and also for the compilation of information on progress in each area since 1947, the rate of commencements, and the numbers of sites being acquired, planned and developed.</P>
    <P>Of the 69,908 dwellings estimated at the 31st March, 1947, to be required to be provided by local authorities the needs of Dublin City accounted for approximately 30,000.  Between March, 1947, and March, 1951, the corporation completed 5,490 houses and flats and on the latter date had 3,205 dwellings in course of construction, while sites were held for a further 5,063 dwellings.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of local authorities have been introducing systems of graded and differential rents.  I am aware of the objections in individual cases which may arise.  It is <Col N="326" /> quite possible that the application of the system may create temporary injustices, but these matters are open to review by the local authorities concerned, according as difficulties arise in the several local areas.</P>
    <P>The administration of the schemes of grants in aid of private enterprise housing has, I am glad to learn, been proceeding with increasing efficiency. About 4,331 new houses were erected in 1950-51 with the aid of grants, while 2,045 were reconstructed.  Staffing and other administrative difficulties gave rise to complaints of delay in dealing with individual cases in the period immediately following the enactment of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.  I am informed that these difficulties have now been largely surmounted and that grants generally are being issued with commendable promptitude.  The amount provided for under this head for the current year is £1,700,000 as compared with £1,635,000 in the last financial year.  The latter provision was disbursed practically in full and it is anticipated that a similar rate of payments will be maintained this year.</P>
    <P>Road administration claims the attention of many Deputies in every discussion on this Estimate.  Road expenditure is largely concentrated in rural areas so that, apart from its primary purpose of maintaining our general road system in a fit condition to bear modern road transport, it has also a very great influence on the disposition of the wholetime or part-time employment of a large number of rural workers.  It represents the greatest single item of revenue expenditure by county councils.  Although the main source from which State grants are made towards road expenditure does not appear in the Department's Estimate, it is relevant to both departmental and local administration to survey the position affecting the Road Fund income and the contributions of local authorities towards road expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund grants for 1951-52 are the same as for the preceding year. They consist of a 100 per cent. county road improvement grant amounting to £1,200,000, 100 per cent. main road improvement grant of £600,000 and a <Col N="327" /> main road upkeep grant of 40 per cent. of approved expenditure.  It is estimated that the total allocations will amount to over £2,400,000.  This represents approximately half the total expenditure of county councils on roads.  A further grant is under consideration to assist county councils in stock-piling a portion of next year's needs of tar and bituminous materials. The county engineers have also been advised to concentrate on surface dressing work so as to use as much tar and bitumen as they can obtain, in carrying out this year's programme.</P>
    <P>Not only the main roads but the county roads are becoming more and more in need of transformation to take motor traffic, which is rapidly replacing horse traffic all over the country. There are about 40,000 miles of county roads, most of which are unrolled.  It takes approximately £2,000 a mile to improve a typical county road up to modern needs.  At the same time, the hazards of main road traffic on dangerous alignments or ill-kept surfaces cannot be overlooked.  The problems which we have to solve and the programmes which we have to undertake are, therefore, necessarily complex and long term.  They must be fitted as best we can into the general problem of State finances and national economy.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have visible evidence of the progress of a much-needed scheme of street improvements in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  Grants have also been given to the other three county boroughs for the resurfacing of badly deteriorated streets.</P>
    <P>Road Fund income from motor licence duties amounted to £2,814,000 in 1950-51, as compared with £2,552,000 in the preceding year.  The number of vehicles of all classes under current licence in August, 1950, showed a total increase of 15,598 on the corresponding date in 1949.  The greatest increase in any class was in that of private cars. I hope to keep fresh borrowing on the security of the Road Fund to a minimum during 1951-52, particularly in view of the prospect of repayment commencing in March, 1952, in respect of the amounts borrowed since 1948. The amount to be repaid to central <Col N="328" /> funds next March is expected to be over £200,000.  This liability added to administrative charges, £100,000, will reduce the available Road Fund income to about the equivalent of the allocations to county councils for works in the year, after making allowance also for the contribution of £300,000 to the aid of general taxation for which provision was made in the Budget.</P>
    <P>As regards the schemes financed by State grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, £1,250,000 was provided for this service in 1949-50.  In the following year the Vote provision was £1,750,000, while this year it is £1,220,000.  This expenditure is classified in the Book of Estimates as a capital service proper to be met from borrowing.  The works to be approved for execution by the aid of grants will, therefore, be expected to be of lasting value.</P>
    <P>The fuel position came up for review at the beginning of 1951, and it was decided to ask local authorities to produce a quantity of turf which was calculated to work out at about 300,000 tons, representing three years' supply of the local authorities' own requirements. A later estimate put that figure at 540,000 tons.  It was not considered possible that this latter figure could be attained this year even with an all-out drive under the most favourable conditions.  The targets to be fixed are within the discretion of the several county councils concerned and these indicate that the amount which will actually be produced in 1951 will be approximately 180,000 tons.  A considerable amount of bog development work was done from 1941 to 1947.  This work will be restarted now, and grants are being made available for the purpose up to a sum of about £70,000, of which £40,000 is being met from the Vote for special employment schemes and the balance from grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.</P>
    <P>The results attained by some county councils in connection with hand-won turf production in 1951 suggest the need in certain areas for machine production of turf in 1952 and subsequent years.  A number of county council have agreed to the purchase of semiautomatic turf producing machinery. <Col N="329" /> Each of the machines has an output of 700 to 800 tons per season.  The turf produced by Bord na Móna with the use of these machines is of first-class quality and superior to the hand-won production, particularly in areas where there is not available labour skilled traditionally in hand-winning methods. Machine-won turf has always been an acceptable fuel, and even if coal were to become freely available at normal prices machine-won turf would probably hold its own, and is acceptable to the managements of various local institutions as well as for other local authority purposes.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated the new financial arrangements which will apply to the subsidy of loans raised for sanitary services works.  The provision of waterworks and sewerage schemes continued during 1950/51 at an accelerated rate.  The total of loans sanctioned for these works in 1950/51 was £718,251 as compared with £609,669 in the preceding year and £497,386 in the 1948/49 period.  At the 31st March last 51 water and 31 sewerage schemes were in progress at an estimated total cost of £1,556,000.  It is expected that the level of activity reached at the end of last year will be maintained and probably increased in the present year.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been approved for two out of the three sections of the North Dublin Regional Water Supply.  The planning of the Howth Outfall Sewerage Scheme which will drain large areas to the north of Dublin City is proceeding and arrangements have already been made for the laying of pipes to deal with the area between Finglas and Raheny which is scheduled for early development.</P>
    <P>General progress with sanitary services schemes would have been even more satisfactory save that the supply position regarding materials remains difficult.  There is a delay of from six months to two years in the delivery of water mains, fittings, pumping and filtration plant.  Mechanical equipment for sewerage schemes is subject to similar delays.</P>
    <P>A provision of £1,400 is made in the Estimates in connection with the revision and codification of Local Government <Col N="330" /> law.  Considerable progress has aleady been made.  Detailed proposals for both a Revision Bill and a Codification Bill dealing with sanitary services, fairs and markets, burial grounds, etc., have been prepared. Substantial progress has also been made in the proposals for the revision and consolidation of the law relating to the constitution and general powers of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>A measure of co-ordination on town planning and allied problems has been effected within the Department so that the town planning section is now responsible for bye-laws relating to new buildings, extensions of borough boundaries and acquisition of land by local authorities for all purposes.  Town planning schemes are in course of preparation in 48 of the 60 urban areas and 19 of the 27 county health districts. The main concentration practically everywhere is, however, on interim control.  The number of appeals submitted to the Minister during the year was 214 as compared with 226 in the previous year.  In a large number of cases it was possible to secure agreement between the appellants and the planning authority and a formal decision was not required.</P>
    <P>The administration of the Combined Purchasing Act reflects the existing  unsettled trade conditions.  The prices quoted for most commodities, both home and foreign manufactured, were higher than last year's prices.  Applications for permission to increase contract prices were received from 841 firms in 1950-51 as compared with 277 in 1949-50.</P>
    <P>A general tendency towards increased costs of supplies and services is reflected in corresponding increases in the rates struck by most county councils for the current year.  While a large percentage of the increase may be attributable to expanding programmes in respect of health, roads, housing and sanitary services, even under these heads the increase is also partly attributable to increases in the costs of commodities and labour.  So far as the share of the ratepayers in the liability for increased commitments is concerned they have been relieved very considerably by a very large increase <Col N="331" /> in State subsidies.  In 1950-51 the total amount of the State grant to all local authorities amounted to £15,000,000 as compared with an estimated contribution of £11,000,000 from rates.  The agricultural grant which, since the enactment of the Local Government (Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land) Act, 1946, increases automatically with an increase in rates, considerably alleviates the burden on farmers.  The amount of the grant for 1950-51 was £3,934,421.  The state of the rate collection was generally satisfactory at the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the Library Council is to assist local authorities to improve their library services.  In addition to the maximum State contribution of £2,500 towards the expenses of the Library Council, a token provision of £5 has been made in the Department's Estimates for the present year to enable the council to provide for financial aid arising out of the results of a survey which it is proposed to institute of existing library services.  The Library Council has appointed two surveyors to undertake the survey immediately. A token provision only is being made as expenditure will not arise in this connection until the results of the survey are available.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will wish to ask me a number of questions on the matters to which I have referred in this statement.  I want to assure them that I have tried to make myself as conversant as possible with the subjects dealt with, but in all probability I will be unable to give them the detailed information which they will wish to get.  If I am unable to do so now, I promise that information on any points to which I am unable to refer will be sent to the Deputies if it is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>My only comment on the Estimate just announced by the Minister is to compliment him on his translation to a Department which, while it has played a prominent part in the life of our people at all times, has in recent years taken on additional importance, being, in conjunction with the local authorities, the hub of the <Col N="332" /> national revolution which has taken place, the peaceful and, thanks be to God, non-political one of the housing of our people, the translation of our people from the slums, cabins and hovels in which they were condemned to live for so long.  This heavy responsibility has been cheerfully undertaken and I am glad to note that, with the co-operation of the local authorities under the guidance of the Department of Local Government, the work goes on apace.  It cannot go on too steadily for this House and the people of the country.  It is a magnificent thing to pass through the country and see the beautiful houses which have sprung up, mushroom-like, to replace the old mud cabins and hovels in rural and urban areas.  These houses, together with the water and sewerage schemes undertaken in conjunction with the housing schemes, plus the sanitary schemes in areas left unserviced for too many years, have not alone improved the health, life and comfort of our people, but also have given magnificent employment to our workers at good rates at a type of work than which I consider none better.</P>
      <P>These are all heavy responsibilities weighing on the Department of Local Government because if there were to be any flagging at this particular juncture, I think it would be disastrous. We have embarked upon a scheme and aroused the enthusiasm of all who are concerned with it, and responsibility falls on the Department of Local Government to maintain that flame, and by their energy and devotion to duty to encourage the local authorities to continue that grand work.  I commend that work to the Minister, and I am quite sure that when he examines the various sections of the Department he will be impressed by their efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay a tribute to each and every member of the staff in the Custom House, whether engaged on town planning, water sewerage, housing, Local Authorities (Works) Act or other schemes.  I never found a more devoted, loyal and able staff than the Minister will find at his disposal there, and I am sure that when he has <Col N="333" /> experience of the Department he will be able to bear out my words.</P>
    <P>I wish him God speed in the work he has undertaken, and I suggest to him not to let anything from any other channel whatsoever hamper his efforts. I admit that we all have had our difficulties with the Department of Finance.  I would encourage the Minister not to be deterred because of the enormity of the work he has engaged upon.  As I have said, it would be disastrous if anything were to happen which would break the continuity of the work that is taking place.  The men have been recruited, the materials mobilised, and the only hope, to my mind, for eventual and speedy success is to keep that work going by the preparation of schemes in advance to ensure that people can be transferred from one housing scheme to another where sites have already been secured. There should be a 12 months' programme planned in advance.</P>
    <P>In addition to having been desired by everybody in the country, the work should be a means of rescuing, as soon as possible, our people from their present tenements.  It will also provide a magnificent amount of employment, particularly in rural areas where it is so badly needed.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act, which has been framed to provide employment for the rural workers, will also enable them to get houses built for themselves, so that they can live in their natural environment. That is an important section of the work.</P>
    <P>The turf-cutting programme, which is under the control of the Department, should also contribute to the grand programme of employment and housebuilding of which the Minister ought to be very proud.</P>
    <P>The water-sewerage scheme is going ahead at an increased tempo such as never occurred before.  Any money that is put into that development is money well spent.  It is an investment in the health of our people and in their future happiness.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the members of this House of all Parties and to all staffs for the co-operation they gave to me during the couple of years I was in the Department of Local <Col N="334" /> Government.  As Opposition Deputy, I now extend that same co-operation to the Minister in so far as it is possible for me to assist him.  I trust that in 1951 he will ruthlessly smash the record I made in 1950 and lay such plans or schemes in advance that 1952 will again beat 1951, so that by our combined efforts, we may succeed in winning through to the day when nobody in this country will want for a decent house to live in.  That is the aim we are all aspiring to and in that desire I commend the Minister to redouble his efforts, smash all records and go on with the work.  I wish him God speed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The ex-Minister for Local Government is a kindly man. That is a fact which is acknowledged by all members of all Parties in this House.  He is a man who gave tremendous service to the people of this country when he held the high office which is now held by Deputy Patrick Smith.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that a week is a very short time to hold a public office so weighty as the Ministry of Local Government, and it would be impossible for any man unfamiliar with the ramifications of such a Department to embrace in that time the various aspects of the work which it must necessarily have and to be able to give as comprehensive a statement as might be desired.  However, there are some points that emerge from the Minister's statement which, to me at any rate, require some clarification.  I am more than disappointed that the new Minister for Local Government has done nothing more, on this occasion, than tell us what has been achieved by his predecessor in office.  He does not tell us how he proposes solving the many pressing and urgent problems that face this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take the mind of the Minister and the minds of the Government Deputies back a little&mdash;to two years ago&mdash;when it was found necessary by the late Mr. Tim Murphy&mdash;God be good to him&mdash;who was then Minister for Local Government, to reduce the road grants.  There was an outcry from the present Government and from those associated with them and from the <Col N="335" /> Fianna Fáil Organisation from one end of the country to the other.  The road grants were being cut, thousands were going to be unemployed, and it was all laid at the door of two Labour Deputies, principally myself.  In the event, the reverse happened.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that we have heard nothing about proposed future increases of the road grants, that we have heard nothing about the restoration of the road grants which were talked about here so loudly and so long and also at every chapel gate and crossroads in Ireland two years ago. I am disappointed and I am sure the Fianna Fáil Organisation is disappointed. Even Deputy Paddy Burke, of my own constituency, availed of that particular hobby horse to his personal political advantage on as many occasions as he could.  What of the road grants now that the power is vested temporarily, and for a very short period, in the Fianna Fáil Organisation and Party?  What is going to be done about them?  Are we going to have them restored to their former proportions? It is important that we should know whether those speeches which were made during the lifetime of the inter-Party Government&mdash;during the period when Labour had a share in the reins of office&mdash;were, in fact, seriously meant at all, because some of us doubt it.</P>
    <P>The road grants have an important bearing on the question of unemployment. I was very glad to hear the commendatory reference to the employment details in the Minister's statement and also the reference to the Local Authorities (Works) Act as a method of improving the country through providing employment in rural areas.  Let us take our minds back a little and recall that the Minister and those associated with him voted no less than eight times against that Act in this House.  They employed every device and every artifice that they could employ to try to obstruct its passage. Now reason has dawned, apparently, or, perhaps, it is just the change of position from one side of the House to the other.  Whatever it may be, there is a different national attitude <Col N="336" /> now to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>We stated, when that Act was being introduced, that it was one of the most beneficial and constructive and progressive proposals ever introduced in this House.  I recall very well that when Deputy Allen and other Deputies of the present Government Party were on these benches, they did all in their power to hold up the passage of that Bill.  They kept us here until the light burned low at night telling us how grievous a wrong was being done to the Irish people and to the farmer whose land would be trespassed upon by the introduction of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  What is going to happen to that Act now?  Will it be repudiated? Is it going to be operated on the same scale and on the same lines as it has been operated by the ex-Minister and by his predecessor?  Is it going to be operated along lines which will mean, as it has meant in the past three years, continuous employment in rural areas on a scale such as never existed before?  County Meath is a county which has returned two Fianna Fáil Deputies to this House.  The workers of County Meath will be interested to know whether, this year and in the future, the record of 100 per cent. employment, which was created there in the past two years by the ex-Minister for Local Government, will be maintained by the present Minister and by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that we have not heard what proposals there are for the future.  The Minister has told us what has happened in the past three years and what plans were made by the ex-Minister for the coming 12 months. But we have heard nothing at all about Fianna Fáil policy&mdash;not one word.  We have not heard a word about what is going to be done by the new broom that was going to sweep so clean, before it achieved office.  We will be interested to hear, before this debate is over, what is going to be done.  Last year, in County Meath, grants to the amount of £95,000 were made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Some 1,400 or 1,500 rural workers were kept in continuous employment for the first time in the history of this country in County Meath by virtue of <Col N="337" /> that Act.  That Act was voted against solidly by the present Government, then the Fianna Fáil opposition.</P>
    <P>They walked into these lobbies and they tried, by every means in their power, to block the passage of that Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>The various matters which arise on this particular Estimate are of tremendous urgency and importance. Apart from the Department of Agriculture, I think it will be agreed by everybody in public life in this country that the Department which reaches nearest to the everyday lives of the ordinary people is the Department of Local Government.  The Estimate for this Department deserves very serious consideration and every aspect of the administration of the Department should be examined.  In the past it has been the practice of Fianna Fáil Deputies to pay particular attention to this Estimate.  Many of them have done so with the experience behind them that some of us have, and that the Minister has, of local authority administration and in the knowledge of the tremendous importance of this Department.  In the light of its importance, I should have thought that a picture would have been presented by the Minister on this opportunity which he has been given of what the Fianna Fáil Government propose to do in respect of local authority administration.</P>
    <P>Take the matter of housing.  The Minister has acknowledged the progress that has been made in housing.  In all honesty, can it be said that in the past three years one word of appreciation of the work being done by the ex-Minister for Local Government and his predecessor emanated from the mouths of the gentlemen who are now in government and who were then in opposition?  Did one word of credit emanate or was one compliment paid or one statement of fact made in relation to the tremendous work which was done in that Department by the ex-Minister for Local Government and his predecessor?  On the contrary, was every opportunity not seized upon&mdash; even if it were only a meeting of a racing pigeon club to which the local Deputy was invited to say a few words <Col N="338" />&mdash;to try to make people believe that the housing drive was not going on so well because Fianna Fáil was not in office?  No matter what the occasion, the moan and the groan and the caoin were raised despite the fact that; during that time, we were experiencing the most tremendous housing drive ever known in this country.  Since the end of the war, 16,000 houses have been built.  Can anybody deny that?</P>
    <P>Can anybody deny that building started only with the advent of the inter-Party Government?  I do not say for one moment that it was not the desire of the former Minister for Local Government, who held office prior to 1948, to provide houses for people.  But the impetus, the energy and the drive did not come until we had the late Deputy Tim Murphy and, following him, Deputy Michael Keyes as Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>You can have your say later.  You can tell us about Cabra and about Dublin.  I am talking about the national housing drive which was carried out by the ex-Minister and by his predecessor.  I am talking about the efforts that were made to decry that drive and to endeavour to prove that there was no housing drive.  These efforts were made by gentlemen who now stand up and say: &ldquo;Here are the facts.  We made great progress&rdquo;&mdash; and they omit to tell us what they propose to do in the future.</P>
      <P>If we are to be charitable&mdash;a thing which, of course, politicians are not wont to be&mdash;but if we are to be charitable and to judge the Fianna Fáil Party by its past performances, I pity my constituents in County Dublin and I pity Deputy Burke's constituents too.</P>

      <P>I pity them for this reason, and it cannot be denied.  I have stated it in this House on many occasions and, at the risk of being repetitive, I shall state it now again. The houses which were built in the past two and a half years in County Dublin <Col N="339" /> represent a very big advance in construction, quality, size and situation on what went before.  Is that policy of giving better houses and larger houses to working-class people going to be maintained?  It would be interesting to have that information because, in the lifetime of the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;14 years ago&mdash;houses were built in County Dublin which were not fit for animals to live in and which could be condemned now and knocked down.  Deputy Burke, as one who knows, will bear that statement out. I have in mind the houses at Turnapin. You could push them down with your hand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inquiring whether it is the policy of the present Minister, and the Party behind him, to give us houses of a quality which working-class people, who are seeking houses, will be satisfied with.  I am inquiring whether it will be the Minister's policy to ensure that the houses that are built will be houses which will not fall down in 14 years' time.  I am inquiring what proposals there are, if any, or what ideas the Minister may have.  He may have some very progressive and constructive ideas&mdash;but, so far, he has not revealed them&mdash;on the very vexed and urgent question of the cost of housing to local authorities.  This question has so many ramifications and facets that it can be considered in many ways.  I propose to consider it in one respect only, namely, the way in which it affects the ordinary people. It has been found that the cost of the houses built during the last couple of years by local authorities has been three and four times what it was in pre-war years.  Take the case of the average worker in the County Dublin who applied for and eventually became tenant of a county council house. Owing to the comparatively low figure for building costs in 1937 and 1938, the rent he was charged for a house in these years was from 4/- to 6/- a week. Houses now being built by the Dublin <Col N="340" /> County Council are costing £1,200 or £1,500 or £1,600.  That is for serviced houses.  I am sure that example can be paralleled in almost every county.</P>
      <P>Repayment in respect of those houses must be found in two or possibly three ways: (1) by a State contribution from the Central Fund, (2) by a contribution from the rates, and (3) by the rent paid by the tenants.  The situation is that, where a county council refuses to impose substantial charges on the rates so as to help to offset the high rent they would otherwise have to charge a cottage tenant, it is customary for it to bring in a differential renting scheme.  I do not know whether the Minister has had any experience of that scheme, but we in Dublin have very great experience of it.  There is no more unpopular scheme so far as it exists in Dublin City, and on the fringe of the city in my own constituency of Ballyfermot.</P>
      <P>That arises from the fact that the local authority, in its anxiety to keep the rates at as low a level as it can and to make up the difference between the grant from the Central Fund and the amount levied by the rates, imposes heavy rents on the tenants.  We have tenants in the county paying 24/4 per week for a labourer's cottage.  The rents are graded from 9/- to 24/4, based on the total income of the family occupying the cottage.  The difficulty of persuading county councils to increase the rates so as to reduce cottage rents is obvious to every member of a county council.  You will have a cleavage of opinion invariably as to whether that is justifiable either morally or from the point of view of its utilitarian value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will always have difficulty in trying to get local authorities, whether they be corporations, urban councils or county councils, to increase the rates so as to reduce the rents.  The only alternative to increasing the rates in order to meet the building costs of houses would be to have a larger contribution from the Central Fund.  In that connection, perhaps the Minister would tell us what proposals he has in mind with a view to increasing the contributions to local authorities from the Central Fund in respect of the building <Col N="341" /> of labourers' cottages throughout the country.  It would be interesting to hear what his proposals are for the reason that in my constituency my colleague and political opponent, accompanied by some of his henchmen, have spent the last three years travelling the county saying that there was only one way to bring down rents of county council houses and that was by getting a larger contribution from the Central Fund.  Now the opportunity is there to do that.  I hope it will be done. If it is, it will save myself and others an awful lot of trouble because we need not try any longer to persuade the members of Dublin County Council to increase the rates in order to help to reduce rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, in his opening remarks, that the question of rents and of differential rent levels was primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned.  I think that there devolves on the Minister a responsibility to see that inordinately or unjustifiably high rents are not charged by county councils to the tenants of working-class houses or of labourers' cottages.  Even though county councils and urban councils may be the exception, yet you will find that some of them are prepared to tax unduly the capacity of tenants of cottages to pay high rents in their anxiety to keep the rates down.  There are some who will say that there is no justification for asking the Central Fund to provide more money, and that the rates should be increased to reduce the level of the rents charged by county councils to cottage tenants.  I would be in agreement with that because the highest rates are paid by those who own the most property in this country, and the collection of rates is, in the last analysis, a re-distribution of the wealth of the country.  The volume of opinion, however, would appear to be in favour not of increasing rate levies in the different counties, but rather to have increased grants from the Central Fund for the building of houses.  I hope the Minister will give attention to that matter and see that the implied undertakings given by Deputy Burke in the County Dublin during the recent election campaign, <Col N="342" /> and for some months before that, when he prosecuted a vigorous campaign on behalf of the downtrodden tenants of council houses who were being mulcted in high rents by the inter-Party Government, are carried out, and that Deputy Burke will not be disappointed in this present Minister.  I hope, too, that in a very short time we will see substantial improvement in the amounts made available from the Central Fund to local authorities for the building of houses.  I have thought it desirable to bring this matter to the Minister's attention in the hope that he may issue some directive to local authorities in so far as these rent levels are concerned.</P>
    <P>We have the position at present in Dublin City and County that houses are being built at a rate which was never before reached.  In Dublin City, houses are now being produced at the rate of one house per working hour. That is a great tribute to the former Minister and to the housing director who has worked night, noon and morning to secure that end.  But while these houses are being built and made available to the people, we have this system of renting which is totally unsatisfactory so far as the people are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is just that local authorities should be permitted by the Department of Local Government to assess the total income of a family regardless of what may be the particular circumstances in that family.  I do not think it is right that any local authority should have the complete and absolute power to demand from the family of a new county council or corporation tenant full details of their total income. I think there is something wrong about that.  I think it could easily be described as an invasion of the privacy of the home.  But that is what is being done.  I hope&mdash;if I am not expecting too much&mdash;that some attention will be given to that and that the Government will direct, in accordance with the undertakings given by my colleague, Deputy Burke, that this differential renting system will be either abolished altogether and a flat rate, which would be much simpler, made available to the people who live in county council or <Col N="343" /> corporation houses, or that there will be some other reasonable approach made by members of local authorities to this question.</P>
    <P>I hope the sole determining factor shall not be to keep the rates as low as we can at the expense of the unfortunate agricultural labourer, road worker or manual worker of any kind, who is trying to raise a family, by inflicting a higher rent on them just to keep at ease the mind of farmer John Murphy, who has four or five shops in the local town, so that he will not have to pay too much in rates.  This is a very important matter and it is one to which I hope the Minister will give attention.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the North County Dublin regional water supply scheme, which was referred to by the Minister in his statement, has progressed to the stage he indicated.  Of course, this scheme has also been one of the hobby horses of the representative of the Fianna Fáil Party in my constituency for God knows how many years.  The matter was first mooted, I think, in 1938 and it was, so far as our knowledge can go, on the shelf in the Custom House for several years. It was not until the advent of the inter-Party Government that anything was done about it.  We have now reached the stage where tenders have been invited and, I understand, accepted for the North County Dublin regional water supply scheme.  That scheme is of tremendous importance. I hope nothing will be done to prevent its early implementation because upon that scheme depends the well-being of thousands of citizens in my constituency in North County Dublin and, indeed, of the City of Dublin.  No houses can be built in that very big area running from the city to Howth and taking in that entire expanse of country from the main Swords road down to the sea until this scheme is in operation, because no drainage exists.</P>
    <P>I trust&mdash;I hope I am not being too optimistic&mdash;that the Minister will ensure that the dead hand which was laid on that scheme from 1938 to 1948 will not be laid upon it again.  I trust that the scheme will be pushed forward <Col N="344" /> with at least as much expedition as it was pushed in the last three years by the predecessor of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to learn that in the year 1950 there were 7,787 flats and houses built.  That must surely constitute a record.  No matter what may be said to the contrary, these houses and flats are the most eloquent testimony that can be paid to the work of the previous Minister, the officials of his Department and the hardworking officials of the local authority who had to deal with the housing drive in the last three years.  To my own knowledge, it was quite obvious that many of them in the Dublin Corporation and in Dublin County Council were overworked in the extreme.  I think the time has come when some recognition should be given to each and every one of these officials, many of whom sacrificed their spare hours and time and worked Saturdays and Sundays in order to try and get the housing drive on the way.</P>
    <P>Some recognition should be given to them.  They were the apparatus and the machine that made possible such progress as we have made.  In the City of Dublin, I understand, it is possible for the corporation to deal now with the case of families of four in one room.  I recall some years ago trying to get a house for a family with 11 in one room.  It was not possible to do it for love or money.  Now we have reached the stage where families of four in one room can be dealt with. With God's help, in the foreseeable future, providing there is no halt put to the impetus of the housing drive, we will see a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>The present Minister's predecessor was handed a problem that was unenviable. It was probably the worst problem that could be handed to a man coming into a Department&mdash;the problem of finding houses for 30,000 people, many of whom did not quite appreciate the difficulties involved in the building of houses, and the difficulty of tackling the lengthy and responsible process of the acquisition of land.  Some of the ancient methods we have of dealing with that particular problem of land acquisition are unsatisfactory. <Col N="345" /> That is an aspect to which, I hope, the Minister will give consideration in relation to the housing drive in the future.  Very often the efforts of local authorities are, to a great extent, negatived by the absence of adequate legal means to make possible the acquisition of land for houses, especially in large city centres.  Yet, in spite of the difficulties that did exist, in spite of the slow process of land acquisition and of compulsory acquisition of land, tremendous drives were made.  I hope the present Minister will live up to the efforts of his predecessor so far as housing is concerned.  If we can judge by the energy he displayed on these benches in other directions he should be able to live up to those efforts. If he lives up to them he will do a very good job.  My own opinion is that his time will be very short and we will not be able to judge.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the activities of this Department upon which I would like to have some enlightenment as to its future policy for this year.</P>
    <P>I refer to the question of the official attitude of the Minister towards the employees of the local authorities, their working conditions and their rates of wages.  Local authorities constitute one of the largest employing organisations in this country and every Deputy who represents a local constituency knows that the county council is looked upon as being practically the only resort for unemployed men.  Very often county council employment provides a convenient stop-gap for the small landholder or the man owning a horse or two.  These people can earn some money by working for the local authorities and from that point of view county council employment in recent years has become quite important in relation to the administration of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>It is essential, therefore, that those of us who represent rural constituencies should know what the Minister's intentions are in relation to the matter to which I have referred.  Will the employment which has been given in the last three years be continued? That is a very important question and <Col N="346" /> the workers want an answer to it.  Will the progressive wages policy introduced by the Labour Ministers in the Custom House be continued?  We all know that at one time the present Minister for Finance.  Deputy MacEntee, was Minister for Local Government. We all know that his policy at that time was diametrically opposed to that adopted by the recent Labour Minister. The policy of the present Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely inquiring from the Minister does he propose to pursue a future policy in consonance with the progressive policy pursued over the past three years?  Does he propose to pursue a policy of spancelling the rates of wages paid by local authorities to road workers to the agricultural rate in the different areas? I can recall occasions when a rule of thumb method was applied by a past Minister where, if a local authority wished to increase the wages of its employees by 10/- per week, it was permitted to increase them only by 1/- per week.  That policy was in existence not so very many years ago.  Is that the kind of policy to which the road workers may look forward for a second time under a Fianna Fáil Government? We would like to have an answer to that.  We do not want any equivocation about it.  We want to know exactly where we stand.  The workers are interested in the reply.  They want to know whether they will have full employment and well paid employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency in County Dublin the road workers are anxious to know if the Minister will sanction increased wages for them this year.  I am sure the same applies throughout the country where recommendations are made by local authorities.  Will we have in the future a continuance of the happy relationship that existed over the past three years between the Minister for Local Government and the local authorities?  We all know that that happy relationship can only be maintained on the basis of co-operation. Will we have that co-operation or will there be a reversion to the dictatorial <Col N="347" /> attitude of former years?  I sincerely hope there will not be such a reversion.  I am sure many members of the present Government hold similar hopes because, apart from it being a bad thing to have unhappy relationships existing between local authorities and the central authority, it is also bad politics.  That is a very important consideration for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>So many aspects of this Estimate enter into the ordinary lives of the people that more time would be required in dealing with them fully. The Minister referred in his opening statement to libraries and the work of the Library Council.  I think much more can be done in the future in regard to the provision of adequate library services.  We all know that the library service is practically the only solace rural dwellers have.  It is fully availed of at the present time, but I believe that very often the service leaves much to be desired, not through any lack of effort on the part of the committees but purely because of the fact that inadequate financial provision is made for the service.  I think there should be at the earliest possible date a complete reorganisation of the library service from the top down so as to ensure that the people who avail of it in the rural areas will have a wide and varied selection <Col N="348" /> of books of all kinds rather than a restricted or limited selection of a number of books of various kinds in order that they may get the maximum amount of enjoyment in their leisure hours.  From that point of view the provision of an adequate library service should receive the attention of the Minister.  I sincerely hope it will.  I trust that the provision of library services will be reviewed, and that steps will be taken to improve the present situation along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I have referred to many matters which are of importance.  They are for the most part matters which are burning topics of discussion up and down the country amongst members of local authorities.  I hope the Minister will give us some indication when he has examined the problem of the proposals he has in mind for improving the condition of the ordinary people. It must be remembered that the present Minister sits where he does by virtue of the fact that he was successful in persuading a majority of the representatives of the people here to vote him into office.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 21st June, 1951.</P>
