There was no question of a further report and none has been made, Mr. Christenberry's recommendations remain as in the synthesis which has already been published.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of ships for which contracts were placed on the authority of the Government by Irish Shipping, Limited, between February, 1948, and June, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the records of my Department, my predecessor was informed early in September, 1950, by the chairman of Irish Shipping, Limited, of the company's intention to place orders for one or two colliers.  The company were asked to postpone the placing of these orders as the Government were considering the whole question of the merchant fleet. On 6th October, 1950, the Government decided that two small colliers should be ordered by Irish Shipping, Limited, the cost of the vessels to be defrayed out of the company's own resources.  There is no record of any other decision taken, or of approval given, by the Government or sought by the company in regard to the placing of orders for ships by Irish Shipping, Limited, between the dates specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, what ships were ordered by Irish Shipping, Limited, between the dates mentioned in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A contract for one new ship was placed between the dates specified.  The first information the Department of Industry and Commerce got of that fact was when a newspaper rang up to know if it was true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Irish Shipping, Limited, decided, after consultation with the Department, to place orders for five additional ships&mdash; the two colliers and three others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping, Limited, <Col N="280" /> have a number of contracts for new ships placed.  Between the dates mentioned in the question, apart from the two colliers, a contract for one additional ship was placed and it was not done after consultation with the Department.  According to the records of my Department, they learned of that decision of the company when the Government Information Bureau, having been contacted by the newspapers, inquired if it was so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Irish Shipping, Limited, can place contracts without consultation with the Department, but is it not a fact that Irish Shipping, Limited, have at present two ships, the colliers the Minister has referred to, building, and, in addition, have placed orders, when berths are available, for three additional ships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of ships are on order now.  As between these two dates, the ships ordered were the two colliers of which the Government approved and one ship for which the contract was signed on 11th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that between the dates mentioned Irish Shipping, Limited, have reserved berths, when they become available, for three additional ships, as well as the two colliers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A contract for two further ships was signed after the date mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the date?</P>

      <P>20th June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>And up to June, 1951, they had reserved berths for three additional ships, as well as the colliers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not now clear not only that no impediment was put in the way of Irish Shipping, Limited, exercising their right to purchase ships but the complaint apparently is that they were told to buy ships and that they got rather belated notice of this fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not told to buy ships.  The statement I made in <Col N="281" /> reply to the question is perfectly accurate.  Apart from the two colliers, there is no record of any other decision taken or any approval given by the Government or sought by the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether any proposal was received by his Department from Irish Shipping, Limited, since February, 1948, for the sale of ships owned by the company; and, if so, when the proposal was received and what decision was conveyed to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the sale of the seven old vessels for which replacements had been ordered in 1946 and 1947 were made to my predecessor by Irish Shipping, Limited, on the following dates in 1949: 3rd March, 23rd March, 29th June, 11th August, 31st August, 23rd September and 13th October.  These proposals were approved in each case.</P>
      <P>On 31st January, 1951, the company indicated that they proposed to sell the two small vessels of the fleet, totalling 4,500 tons deadweight&mdash;the <i>Irish Rose</i> and the <i>Irish Willow,</i> and to purchase out of the proceeds of the sale a secondhand vessel of about 9,000 tons deadweight.  The company were informed that the proposed sale of the <i>Irish Rose</i> and the <i>Irish Willow</i> could not be authorised if it involved transfer of ownership and registration outside this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They wanted to dispose of these vessels.  The Government's attitude was: &ldquo;You cannot get rid of these vessels, we will not allow you to get rid of them&rdquo;&mdash;because of the fact that they had not already secured the ship which they proposed to purchase with the proceeds of the two ships they intended to sell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that during the autumn and winter of 1950, six wind velocity measuring stations were erected in County Donegal.  The readings are now complete from Blue Stack Mountain, Slieve Leahan near Glencolumbkille and Malin Head.  The readings are being continued for a second year at Bloody Foreland, Crocknafarragh near Crolly and Slieve Tooey near Glencolumbkille.</P>
      <P>The information received from the readings of the six measuring stations in Donegal was sufficiently favourable to warrant erection of further measuring stations on the west coast of the country to obtain fuller information. Eleven such stations have been erected and are in operation.</P>
      <P>The board has no immediate plans for the erection of wind-powered stations.  Certain pioneering work on the production of electricity from wind is proceeding in Britain and on the Continent and the board awaits the results of these experiments.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that on 14th March, 1950, I put a question to the former Minister for Industry and Commerce and got a similar reply, that the hold-up was due to the difficulty of securing the machinery for which orders had been placed? I am sure that the Minister is aware that this factory has been burned down for eight or nine years.  The general belief amongst the business people in Athlone and amongst those people who would like to secure employment is that there is no real desire in the minds of those people who run this factory to reopen it.</P>

      <P>Housing grants are allocated to applicants in the first instance on a provisional basis.  If the work carried out is regarded as unsatisfactory while the building is in progress or when the house is completed, an effort is made to induce the applicant to have the defects remedied by the builder.  Cases often arise, however, where such defective work has not or could not be remedied and it is the practice in such cases to impose appropriate reductions in the grants provisionally allocated.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointed officer is entitled in the first case to give a certificate of approval for the work which the applicant proposes to carry out. When he has issued an approval certificate, it does not mean that the applicant will actually carry out the work in accordance with the specifications. At a later stage the appointed officer may inspect the house when it is in a more or less raw state, may detect nothing wrong with it and may issue an approval certificate for the payment of part of the State grant.  It is only when the house is completed and before the final instalment is paid that the Minister's representative makes a report on the manner in which the regulations have been carried out and <Col N="301" /> the house constructed.  If it is found that there are defects which can be remedied, the applicant is asked to have them remedied.  The Deputy will admit, however, that there could be defects in certain cases that would be incapable of being remedied except at a very substantial cost.

      <P>In June, 1932, general directions were issued by the Minister for Finance which enunciated&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the nature and conditions of a civil servant's employment should of themselves suggest to him that he must maintain a reserve in political matters;</P>
      <P>(b)  that he must not put himself forward on one side or another and should do nothing that would give colour to a suggestion that his official actions are in any way influenced, or capable of being influenced by Party motives;</P>
      <P>and indicated that any departure from official impartiality would be followed by disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>The following specific instructions were embodied:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  An official shall not be a member of an association or serve on a committee having for its object the <Col N="306" /> promotion of the interests of a political Party or the promotion or prevention of the return of a particular candidate to the Dáil;</P>
    <P>(b)  an official shall not support or oppose any particular candidate or Party either by public speaking or writing;</P>
    <P>(c)  an official shall not make any verbal statements in public (or which are liable to be published), and shall not contribute to newspapers or other publications any letters or articles, conveying information, comment or criticism on any matter of current political interest, or which concern the political action or position of the Government or of any member or group of members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It was made clear that the foregoing applied to action of an official whether taken by himself alone or in association with others.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The prohibition of the issue of fishing licences proposed in this Bill is no more than a temporary administrative expedient rendered necessary by the impending establishment of a Foyle fisheries commission. It is expected that the main legislation will be before the Oireachtas early in the new year and that if it is enacted the Foyle commission will be established before the opening <Col N="314" /> of the 1952 fishing season on the River Foyle.  One of the duties of the commission will be to regulate the issue of licences, and it is, therefore, necessary that the position should not be prejudiced in the meantime by the issue of licences by the Moville Board.</P>
      <P>A Bill in similar terms to suspend the issue of licences by the Derry Board of Conservators has, I understand, also been introduced at Stormont.</P>
      <P>The whole essence of the Bill is expressed in Section 1 which is intended to operate so as to suspend the issue of all licences in the Moville district, save those for fishing with rod and line, until such time as a new licensing system can be set up by the proposed commission.  The provision in subsection (2) whereby the issue of licences may be permitted by Order will enable the old system of licensing to be reinstated if for any reason the commission should not be in a position to issue licences in time for the statutory opening of the net-fishing season on the 16th April.</P>
      <P>The second section is complementary to the first: it copper-fastens the prohibition of issue of licences by suspending the right conferred in such emphatic terms by Section 31 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1848, namely, that any person demanding a licence and tendering the appropriate licence duty</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall be entitled to receive the same without any question or objection whatsoever arising either from the time when, the purpose for which, or the right in virtue of which he or they may desire to use such licence, or on any other grounds whatsoever&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are those devoted to &ldquo;Interpretation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Short title and construction&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Arising out of this Bill, I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's <Col N="315" /> assurance that this is simply an interim measure to maintain the <i>status quo</i> until such time as the agreement is made whereunder this fishery will be taken over from private ownership of the Irish Society in London by a board representative of the Government of the Republic and the Government of Northern Ireland.  I intended to mention to the Parliamentary Secretary the matter raised by Deputy General Mulcahy.  If any circumstances should arise which operate to prevent the issue of licences to fish to people who had habitually that licence, I assume that appropriate measures will be taken to compensate them for any loss which an independent arbitrator might assess.  I think it is the Parliamentary Secretary's hope that no such loss will arise and that it will be possible to issue licences for the coming fishing season according to the ordinary procedure of the joint board which by then will have been established and vested with its statutory authority.  On these assumptions, I strongly recommend the House to extend to the Parliamentary Secretary every facility in order to prevent serious evil accruing to a very valuable fishery which is about to become the property of the people. I want, however, to mention one matter to the Parliamentary Secretary to which he might think it expedient to direct the attention of his Minister. Anyone familiar with Donegal knows that this question of the Foyle fisheries has been, for 25 years at least, the subject of much acrimonious agitation.  Therefore, when the prospect of resolving this very thorny problem presented itself, I consulted the Taoiseach, and we were agreed that, as a number of other matters quite divorced from fishing arose, it was expedient to avail of the services of an officer of the Department of Fisheries with very long experience who knew all the details of the history of this problem, whose seniority vested him with a very special sense of discretion, and whose wisdom, acquired by seniority, justified the Minister for the time being in reposing in him a discretion which it might be improvident for a Minister ordinarily to remit in a member of the public service, <Col N="316" /> no matter how trusted or how distinguished.  Furthermore, matters relating to territorial rights and abstruse questions relating to fishery rights and ancient titles arose.  In these circumstances, a great deal of the essential preliminary negotiations were conducted in very close consultation with the Attorney-General and the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances, I did not press on the officers of the Department of Fisheries to bend their time to a particular isolated problem in the way they ordinarily would if it were an everyday kind of problem.  So far as I am aware, this particular matter became very much the prerogative of one particular officer of the Department. The staff of the Department, generally, may have experienced some embarrassment in that, at my direction, they abstained from familiarising themselves with the details of this matter, and any failure to have a complete grasp of all the finesse of the question, if such a situation now obtains, is to be attributed entirely to the express direction that I gave.  This complication has arisen.  Before I went out of office, the senior officer of the Department, who was charged with special responsibility for this matter, reached the end of his normal Civil Service period.</P>

      <P>I will tell the Chair.  He retired and I consulted the Government. A special arrangement was made whereby that officer was allowed to continue in the special capacity of adviser because it was realised, in relation to matters arising out of the Foyle, that the delicate situations which I have referred to were continually presenting themselves.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will better understand that this arises out of licences when I say that there has been, since the State was founded, an energetic argument as to whether anybody in the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland had any right to issue licences in respect of these waters.</P>

      <P>The Chair will see the importance of what I am about to say when I mention that the services of that officer were retained for the purpose of the Foyle Fishery Bill on a part-time basis.  I understood that he was to remain available to advise in this matter and to conduct negotiations until such time as this matter was finally concluded.  This is a matter which concerns three parties: The Northern Ireland Government, our Government and the British Government. I understand that, shortly after our Government went out of office, it was decided that the retention of that officer's services for the purposes I have mentioned, was no longer necessary. All I want to say to the Parliamentary Secretary is that this business will not be satisfactorily concluded until all the legislation in both Parliaments has been satisfactorily passed. If the termination of that officer's employment has been done at the instance of the Department of Finance, I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should bring to the attention of his Minister the desirability, if the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me, of asking the Government to override the decision of the Department of Finance in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Parliamentary Secretary should tell us what is the position of the fishermen who hitherto have been granted licences to fish in the Foyle. If this Bill were to deprive them of rights which they have hitherto enjoyed, I would immediately challenge the passing of it here.  There is a further implication in this.  Assume that the Moville Fishery Board is no longer <Col N="318" /> authorised to issue licences, what becomes of the protection of the rivers Finn, Shrule and Mourne which feed the Foyle?  There is no use in taking care of the Foyle because no fish are spawned or reared there.  Who is to protect the rivers that supply the Foyle with fish, and provide those fishermen with the means of earning a living?</P>
      <P>The river Foyle is of no value except in so far as it is fed by the fish which are spawned and reared in the Finn, the Shrule and the Mourne.  I should like to know whether the Moville Fishery Board is without powers to protect those rivers.  Unless it has powers to protect them, then in five or six years the fishing in the Foyle will be worthless.  It will be of no commercial value.  I want to have a clear and a definite undertaking from the Parliamentary Secretary, before I can allow him to have this Bill, that the rights of all those men who have been fishing in the Foyle and who have been making a living out of fishing there&mdash;they live exclusively from the money they make from fishing during the season&mdash;are protected.</P>
      <P>What is the position going to be in regard to the issue of licences to them either by the board or the Department for the ensuing year?  Is the position to be that nothing can be done now until the New Year?  I take it that both the Parliament in Northern Ireland and this Parliament will be adjourned for the Christmas recess and so it is quite possible that nothing more will be done to expedite the passing of legislation in both Houses. One never knows what will occur.  It may be that this legislation will not be effective at all at the commencement of the forthcoming fishing season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we have an undertaking from the Parliamentary Secretary that this legislation will be in operation at the beginning of the fishing season?  If we cannot have that, I at least want an assurance from him now that either by the Moville Fishery Board or the Department&mdash;I do not care which party does it&mdash;the interests of the fishermen, who have hitherto earned their livelihood <Col N="319" /> from fishing there, and who have not other means of livelihood except the dole, will be protected, especially with regard to their right to fish during the forthcoming season. whether or not the joint legislation to be passed by the Stormont Parliament and by this Parliament has been completed before the beginning of the next fishing season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters have been raised on this Bill with which I am not prepared to deal.  I want to say that the possession of a licence does not give an absolute right to a man to fish. He has got to ensure that, when he has got the licence, he is entitled to fish in those particular waters.  That rule applies everywhere.  The rights of the Moville Board to refuse to issue a licence on demand are not being interfered with, but the effect of such a refusal, of course, would not show itself until the close season had ended.  In the normal course, applications for these licences are received in or about the commencement of the fishing season. Because of the very peculiar circumstances operating here, it has been thought that it is best to give the authority which issues such licences the power to refuse these licences until such time as the general legislation to be passed by the Dáil and by the Northern Ireland Government has, in fact, been passed and become law and the commission has been set up.  There is nothing I can add to what I have read out in my opening statement. Deputy Dillon has brought up matters with which I am not prepared to deal on this particular Bill.  What the Bill proposes to do has been very simply stated and no more can be added to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy may not be aware that the Minister who was in charge of fishing before the change of Government made a by-law which prevented fishing being carried on in certain stretches of this fishery.  That was a more positive interference with the rights of fishermen than that now proposed.  At least it was a matter of the same nature.  I should say that this is being done in the interests of those who will benefit from the fishery when the permanent legislation comes into being.  I want to inform Deputy McMenamin on this question of protection. Duties in respect of protection are still reposed in the Moville Board of Conservators within the limit of the powers obtaining under the Fishery Act.  This measure gives them some further temporary power, and that is all that is proposed.  A very full discussion will take place when the permanent measure is before the House. Deputies will have seen in the newspapers yesterday that it was only two days ago that the British Parliament passed legislation enabling the Belfast Parliament to deal with this matter. We will have to wait until they have dealt with it.  We take it that the measure will not have passed through the Northern Ireland Parliament until after Christmas and that the measure will not be law in Britain until early in the new year because the House of Lords will not have dealt with it. Therefore, we will not be ready to go ahead on our side for some considerable time.  If the previous Government had made similar progress this measure would not be required at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are faced with the outstanding fact that there is a large amount of unemployment, caused through a lack of industrial development in these areas.  I feel that this may lead to even greater emigration. When I was speaking last night I made it quite clear that any criticism which I direct towards this Bill is not merely for the purpose of opposing the Bill. Anybody reading this Bill, listening to the speech made by the Tánaiste and taking into consideration the restricted activities allowed to the members of the proposed board, must be honest enough and sincere enough to admit that, even when this Bill passes through the Dáil and the Seanad and becomes law, we cannot hope to do away even with a very small margin of the unemployment that exists in these distressed areas.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste stated that the idea behind the Bill is to try to promote industrial activity in those areas but if we are to do so there are so many factors to be taken into consideration that we must go slowly and carefully through the whole measure and particularly through the evasive&mdash; unwittingly perhaps but nevertheless evasive&mdash;speech of the Tánaiste. Have we any hope, not to mind guarantee, that the promotion of industry in those districts will ever be successful unless all factors surrounding these suggested industries are taken into consideration?  There is unemployment in these districts but there is as much unemployment in other districts which the Minister has specifically kept out of this Bill.  I know that further on provision is made in the Bill that, by Order, the Minister may include other areas but that in itself makes the Bill more complicated in so far as the working of the board proposed to be set up under this Bill is concerned.  It will automatically mean much slower progress in even getting so far as reaching the stage of even building factories in these districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> In connection with the powers given to this new body, there is no provision in the Bill so far as I can see, and the Tánaiste gave us no clear indication as to what factors they are to take into consideration.  We have no knowledge one way or the other here.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste made a statement to the effect that this board to be set up must, of necessity, give full consideration and base prior assessment on the disadvantages of any locations.  I do not want to twist his words but he has not stated what considerations are to be based on the assessment of certain advantages.  To me, at any rate, that means that the members of the board and even any technical advisers given to them for their assistance, will have to concentrate to the very fullest possible extent on finding what disadvantages may arise in the securing of an industry in any particular area.  I cannot say when, in the life of this Parliament or any other Parliament coming after it, all the disadvantages which can be found will be even fully examined, not to mind surmounted.</P>
    <P>We have no indication in this Bill or from the statements made as to what degree this board will be able to go to put into operation any cooperative suggestions offered by the E.C.A. technical advisers if such are forthcoming.  Must the suggestions come solely from individuals or groups in the areas where industries may be promoted?  The Tánaiste has stated that the board to be set up would have no power of initiation.  Apparently they must wait for such moves from local bodies or local groups.  Why this board are denied such powers of initiation themselves and obliged to wait for the individual or groups to come forward I do not know.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been around the country.  I am not objecting to that; I believe it is essential that he should have done so.  He has visited various areas and suggestions have been put at his disposal by various groups in various towns all over the country, including, of course, these congested districts. Surely at this stage a full report must be available to the Government <Col N="324" /> and the Tánaiste from the Parliamentary Secretary concerned.</P>
    <P>Possibly the weakness inherent in the Bill is the fact that this board to be set up will more or less have to go slow.  I do not mean that it is an advised Government policy to them but they will have to wait for individuals or groups in towns all over the congested districts and towns at the other side of that border to come forward with their schemes.  That, naturally, means a holding up of the whole scheme and in spite of what the Tánaiste said last night that he was ambitious to get this Bill through the House before Christmas, and through the Seanad, I honestly believe that when it does become law we will be almost as far away from getting industries in these places as we are at the present time.</P>
    <P>Another point that I consider requires clarification from the Tánaiste is the statement that the Bill does not apply to those industries or factories at present in the course of construction. I do not know what is behind that.  I am not trying to read something drastic or something political into it but surely if this Bill is meant to be a help to those districts and those congested areas, the very first thing we should do is to see that, in the case of any industry at present in the course of construction or even with plans being prepared, if it is possible, such financial help as is necessary will be given to get them going at the earliest possible opportunity.  According to the statements made it does not seem as if such help will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I am yet in doubt about the statement that this Bill may, at a later stage, be applied to other areas by Minister's Orders.  That, unfortunately, gives me the idea that this whole Bill and all behind it is nothing but a patchwork quilt and that the Government is trying to make people believe that we are going to give them industries in the very near future.  If we are honest and truthful, we must know that it will take years before we can do it.  At what stage could such powers be given?  Surely they cannot be given unless and until recommendations may come from this board to be <Col N="325" /> set up.  Such recommendations cannot be considered from the board until such time as individuals or groups from those other areas may put forward their schemes for industries and until such time as it is found that there is a high degree of unemployment in that district.  Before suggestions may come from local bodies under this Bill we are told clearly by the Tánaiste that people in those districts or areas at present excluded must not examine too closely the meaning of &ldquo;congested district&rdquo;.  Therefore, I honestly believe that, under this Bill, there is no hope and never will be any hope that the Minister, no matter what Government he may be in, will ever use the right by Order to extend this scheme or this Bill to areas outside the present areas specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>While we have unemployment in the areas covered by the Bill, it must be admitted that in areas adjacent to these congested districts we have unemployment not alone amongst ordinary workers but amongst a number of young people who are highly skilled.  What work can we offer to these people?  Must there be a continuation of emigration from these excluded districts or must these workers simply be encouraged to go from areas in which they at present reside into the so-called congested districts? To be quite candid, I cannot see that we are tackling this problem in the vigorous manner that we should.  If we are to continue attempting to cure the ills that at present exist in this haphazard fashion, we shall never cure them.  While the Tánaiste made it quite clear that any industries set up under this Bill will be safeguarded against competition from outside the country, we know that it will be almost impossible to protect them sufficiently to ensure their success against competition from inside the State.  Are we going to delude the people to such an extent as to build these factories and, then, after they have been in operation for a few years, allow conditions to develop which will make these factories nothing but white elephants?</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned various grants.  It is only right to offer such advantages to people who may <Col N="326" /> be prepared to start industries but while it may sound attractive to these people and to the workers who may be employed in these factories, I believe they will find in time that all they can hope for is to be enabled to postpone application for the emigration ticket for which they intended applying.  They may stay another few months at home in the hope that they will not require it.  The Tánaiste may think that I am trying to damn the Bill and everything connected with it but I am not.  I merely want to put forward a number of suggestions, some of which may not be quite workable, but my sole desire is to make this measure an outstanding success.  I believe that to achieve that, we must tackle this problem on a far bigger scale than is being attempted at present.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the Bill that financial provision will be made for the building of factories or to defray part of the cost of the construction.  There is also provision for grants up to 50 per cent. of the cost of the equipment of the factories. These provisions I believe are essential to ensure the success of the Bill.  It is stated also that grants are being made available for the training of workers.  That is another matter to which I should like to draw attention. First of all, where are they to be trained?  Are they to be trained here in Ireland or are they to be sent across the water for training there?</P>

Can we assume, if a certain industry is started in the West of Ireland to produce some commodity that is already being produced by another factory inside this country, that the men coming from the West of Ireland for training will get the best training here in a factory in the East, when it is known that they will ultimately go back to the West to produce a certain article which will compete with the products of the factory in which they are being trained?  I shall not go so far as to say that it is wrong to send them for training to such a factory but is there not a danger there?  Again if <Col N="327" /> we send these workers to England for training, have we any assurance that an industrial concern in England, which may at present be exporting certain items to this country, will give a proper training to these workers when it is known that they will be producing articles here at home later on to compete against the commodities which that industry has been sending to this country heretofore?  I think these are points that the Tánaiste might well consider.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which is worthy of the Tánaiste's consideration. We know that many people, some of them highly skilled craftsmen, have had to leave Central Europe and other parts of the Continent for some years past as political refugees.  We have an excellent example, of which we read in history, of a similar exodus in the past.  We learn that a colony of Italians came to this country at one time as political refugees and settled here in Dublin, where they produced articles and performed work which, in the course of time, came to be regarded as masterpieces.  We know also that a certain sect, the members of which had to flee their own country in olden times, landed on the coast of Waterford.  The crafts which these people practised and introduced to this country have left their mark even to the present day in the various centres in which they settled.  I believe that if such craftsmen are available on the Continent to-day it would be highly advantageous for us to invite them to take up residence in western districts where they could impart their skill to the native population.  In that way, we could have our own workers trained as skilled artisans and craftsmen near their own homesteads.  I would ask the Tánaiste to consider that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste has also stated many times during the debate that this Bill is founded principally on the policy of private enterprise.  We appreciate the advantages of having private enterprise engaged in the promotion of industries in the West and in the South-West, but if such private enterprise does not come forward, must we merely tell the people of the statement <Col N="328" /> made by the Tánaiste and that we can hope for no successful industry unless it is conducted solely by private enterprise? We have had the sad experience for many years past of knowing that individuals have turned their backs on promoting industries in many of these areas because they had not what they believed they were entitled to, namely, a full sense of protection and a fair guarantee that they would get a good return for any money they might so invest.  If that state of affairs is allowed to continue then we shall be as far away as ever from the provision of industries on our western and southern coast as we are at present.</P>
    <P>There should be a provision in the Bill whereby&mdash;if private individuals cannot be found to put up the money&mdash; the Government would be enabled to set up industries somewhat on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board and other such concerns.  If these new industries could be brought to a pitch of fairly good financial standing then industrialists and investors might be found who would co-operate once it was proved to them that such concerns were paying their way and paying a dividend on the money invested in them.  It could then be arranged to switch over from the State any concerns that prove they can be kept going&mdash;instead of going so far as to put up 50 per cent. of the cost of building and equipping a factory which we do not know will last for five years or 25 years.  That, in itself, shows that the Bill is not far-reaching enough.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Tánaiste used the term &ldquo;variety of employment&rdquo;. I do not intend to dwell on that matter now as I spoke about it last night except to point out that the term &ldquo;variety of employment&rdquo; is, of necessity, restricted in this connection. Apart from Dublin, Waterford, Cork and a few other large cities or towns, the selection, not to mind the variety, of employment that will be left to the other centres will certainly be very restricted.  It would seem that the matter will more or less be left for decision to the advisers of the board which is to be set up.  It seems that they will decide what industry will <Col N="329" /> suit a particular area or a particular town after considering any propositions put up by the local people.</P>
    <P>The Bill, when it becomes an Act, will apply to the west and south-west coast&mdash;and also to any areas which the Minister may, by Order, include within the scope of the Act.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the claims of areas which are not congested areas but which are depressed areas&mdash;areas such as Passage West and Kinsale.  I have in mind that in these areas the variety of employment will be restricted&mdash;if we want to make a success of it&mdash;to four or five different types of employment.  We must consider the possibility of improving as much as we can the system of small home industries.  I believe it would be a mistake to erect huge factories in areas where the purchasing power of the people in the locality would not meet the output of the new factory. There would be the additional worry that the new factory might not be able to compete financially with the products of other factories of a similar nature more favourably situated in the eastern part of the country.  For that reason, I think we should consider the matter of small industries in different localities.  We have to consider not only the number of people who would be employed directly but also the amount of money going to these people in wages, the amount of money given to people in areas adjoining that area and the amount of money in circulation within a fair radius of that small centre.  I believe that it would help if we could spread small industries over a larger area in these districts.</P>
    <P>One potential industry which we could make a real success is the processing of kelp and seaweed.  I remember asking a question a few years ago about the report of the committee which was set up many years ago to examine the possible uses to which this important raw material could be put. From reports that we get from other countries we believe that it is possible to make far greater use of the kelp and seaweed which we have in abundance around our western and southern coasts than we have hitherto made of it.  It is possible that, from these raw <Col N="330" /> materials, we may be able to start industries of a type which are not in operation in the eastern parts of this country.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the turf industry. I believe that in many of the districts which I have in mind, the turf industry could be greatly expanded.  We all know that through the amount of turf sold in different localities, through the amount of employment given and through the circulation of a larger amount of money in these areas the turf industry gives some little happiness to people who, otherwise, might not be able to get any form of employment in this country which would keep them in any fair standard of living.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Cowan said last night in regard to the fishing industry.  I believe that this body should have power to act on their own initiative rather than have to wait for would-be industrialists or groups of people to come from these areas to point out to them the advantages that would accrue to some of our districts&mdash; not alone depressed or congested districts but port towns also&mdash;through the development of fishing.</P>
    <P>That could be a means of keeping some of our people at home.  It is no satisfaction to any of us to go into areas in our constituencies and find that young men and women, whom we may have met on our last visit, have within the space of a few weeks been faced with no alternative but that of going across the water.</P>
    <P>If we are to make a success of this Bill we must base it around these problems. We must get from our minds the idea of a high standard of industrial production, Such as we expect from industries in the eastern part of the country which have been established for a number of years.  In some of these fishing districts provision has already been made for the improvement of harbours.  Surely that could go in full harmony with this Bill.  If a harbour is to be developed, is it not natural to assume that this new board would concentrate on the potentialities of such a locality?  There was a system in the past called that of the westerly boats, when we had not such a highly <Col N="331" /> developed road service and a great proportion of the transport between one town and another was by water.  If these points are remembered by the board, we will have gone half-way to making the Bill a success.</P>
    <P>We know that the £2,000,000 is not a final sum, but we also know that there is no proof that that sum will be spent.  It may cost £2,000,000, £20,000,000 or £200,000.  There is the weakness which Deputy MacBride mentioned last night.  It would be advisable to have a full report, half-yearly or yearly, of the advances made by the board.  The board should understand that while they can give certain industrialists a sum of money to build factories or can co-operate in the improvement of roads, bridges or railway sidings, these advances are not placed in the custody of the Minister alone, that not only he but every member of this House should know what these advances are.  This £2,000,000 is only a trivial sum when we are talking about improving the conditions in these districts.  Let no member say, however, that I am ridiculing the provision of £2,000,000.  What I want to convey is that this is to be considered only as a start.</P>
    <P>If we concentrate here on the improvement of the Bill and give extra powers, if necessary, to the board and the Minister, we would be doing excellent work in saving a section of our people that means so much to us, a section of our people that never knew what it was to live in a sense of comfort, a section of our people who so often had to depend on sons and daughters in America or England, who sent home a few shillings to help to keep the wolf from the door.  That economical policy of the past left a bad mark in those areas and perhaps it left a bitter mark in the hearts of many of our people who had to leave the western and southern areas.  Let us try to remedy that.  There was an old saying: &ldquo;The wind from the East meant good.&rdquo; At least this movement from the East, from this Parliament of the 26 counties of this nation, even if it is only a starting point, may get stronger as time goes on.  Let us forget Party politics <Col N="332" /> in dealing with this section of the community, since otherwise industries suggested by and carried out by political individuals, or factories manned solely by members of political Parties &mdash;I am speaking of things I know happened in the past, without saying to what Party they belong&mdash;would be detrimental to the success we hope to have under this Bill.</P>
    <P>We should adopt this Bill just as a start, as was the phrase used on a notable occasion by a noted Irish statesman, &ldquo;just a step forward&rdquo;; then we would be doing something to show the West and South-West&mdash;and I hope the Minister will remember the areas he can include by Order&mdash;that they are not forgotten by the members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of the undeveloped areas is a big one and an old one.  It has been widely accepted by those who have studied it that the final solution must come from men of vision, courage and enthusiastic interest in what they are doing.  This Bill does everything possible to bring to our aid, in fighting this great problem, all the resourcefulness, vision and enterprise of private industry.  It brings to our aid attributes which we could never hope to find in the movement of a State Department.  The inducements and facilities offered by the Bill can hardly fail to attract to the West people interested in industry. I must congratulate the Minister on the nature of the step he has taken, as well as on taking it in such a short period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect to see the effects of this Bill in the near future in County Clare.  We have immediate potentiæ which could be put to work almost now.  In the east of Clare we have the unused slate quarry; in North Clare the phosphate mines; and all the South-West of Clare has the great prospect of turf development.  Along the coast it must surely be possible to establish industries for marine products. At places like Liscannor, Quilty and Carrigaholt, where at one time we had rudimentary industries, we could now hope to see large firms establishing factories for the processing of fish <Col N="333" /> and their preparation for market, the full use of kelp and the preparation for market right at home of carrageen. Apart from these natural encouragements, the Bill gives the same chance to an industry setting up in Clare, or even a better chance, as a similar industry which might be set up in Dublin.  For that reason, we can hope that men interested in factories will establish many of these factories in the county and in other counties and thus help to reduce the great congestion which is coming about in Dublin.</P>
    <P>My people are eager to participate in the development of industry in the West and I believe that the Department will have available to them sources from which to get advice and information in regard to whatever project they may undertake.  I think the eagerness of the people, combined with the facilities offered by the Bill, will almost ensure the successful development of industries in the West of Ireland.  If, however, the progress of this development should be slower than we have reason to anticipate, it might be due to the fact that individuals, people with money and a knowledge of industry, and indeed people who might become interested in industry but do not regard it as having a personal call for them at the moment, are not coming together.  If we find that this is the case in the course of a year or two, keeping the State out of it as far as we can, some machinery for the organisation and bringing together of people to get down to the practical problems of starting particular industries in particular areas could be established. This machinery could be part of the Department but would be free to act almost as a private body could act.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we should work at the moment on the basis of a theoretical flaw in the Bill.  It is not really a flaw in the Bill, nor in the enthusiasm with which the Bill has been received&mdash;it is just that chance might so happen, that the provisions of the Bill might not be fully used, but if it does arise, I suggest that some such machinery be contemplated.  I would not suggest, however, that we <Col N="334" /> should do anything about it now because it is purely theoretical.  I assure the Minister that the people of Clare are enthusiastic and that he will receive every co-operation in the great step he has taken.  I congratulate him again on the nature of the step&mdash; putting to work something which everybody acknowledges to be the successful formula in business&mdash;private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMHession" hpid="Mr. Hession Mr. Hession">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hession</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my very few remarks with a hearty céad míle fáilte to this Bill.  I welcome it with open arms, because, although it is not a good Bill, so far as the West of Ireland is concerned, in that it does not meet our requirements and cannot possibly hope to do so, I am more or less of a stoic and believe that one crumb is better than no bread at all. I am prepared to welcome any Bill which will put one man more in employment in the West of Ireland and will give full support to any measure which will create a set of circumstances in the West which will induce one person alone who would otherwise decide to emigrate not to do so.  I will also give unstinted support to any enactment or statute which will induce or cause one more £ to be siphoned into the West of Ireland and that is one of the prime reasons why I must welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago, I submitted a question to the Tánaiste concerning the possibility of the establishment of an industry in or about the town of Tuam and I was more than pleased when he informed me that he intended to introduce this Undeveloped Areas Bill in due course.  I was also more than gratified to learn that the Bill had a place of high priority on the Government programme. One can only imagine my disappointment and my chagrin when I discovered that the amount of money being set aside for the development of seven counties in the West was £2,000,000.  I was really more than disappointed because I believe that it knocks the bottom out of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw that, I began to wonder what exactly does the Fianna Fáil Government think of the West of Ireland.  Do they regard the lands west <Col N="335" /> of the Shannon as a sort of &ldquo;hick&rdquo; belt, a place where the mountainy men live, a sort of Gaelic Tobacco Road, because it is quite obvious that £2,000,000 cannot possibly meet the requirements or satisfy the needs of the West?  I imagine that the main purpose of the Bill is in some way to stop or diminish the flow of emigration which undoubtedly is a very disturbing feature of life in the West.  There is no need for me to outline the extent or the evils of emigration, because these have been discussed almost <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House; but I was impressed by the very eloquent speech delivered by Deputy Cafferky some weeks ago, when he painted a picture of the flood of emigration from the western counties at the moment.  Some people may think he exaggerated, that he overstated the position, that he applied a heavy brush, but I, who live in the West of Ireland, do not think so.  I think the picture he painted here was merely a cameo or thumb-nail sketch and did not give the over-all panorama at all.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when he came on his famous visit to Seapoint Ballroom some weeks ago and painted his Hogarthian picture of the conditions in which Irish boys and girls have to live in England, must have been aware &mdash;because I believe his speech was sincere&mdash;of the great flood of people who are leaving, mainly, the western counties.  It was <i>en passant</i>, a rather dismal dirge to pipe in the twenty-fifth anniversary of Fianna Fáil at Galway. That is by the way, although it did cause resentment and pain and embarrassment not only to the boys and girls now living in England, through no fault of their own, but to their relatives and friends at home.</P>
    <P>This Bill which, I again stress, I welcome, is not in any way a sufficient measure, or a proper or adequate attempt to meet the position in the West.  At the moment, I imagine the Tánaiste as a latter-day Canute trying to hold back, with this Undeveloped Areas Bill, this flow of boys and girls from the western counties to England, and, if he is to succeed in any way, if he is to make any visible or real impression <Col N="336" /> on this unfortunate position, it is not £2,000,000 he needs, but maybe £30,000,000, £40,000,000, £80,000,000 or £100,000,000.  I do not think I am overstating the position when I suggest that that amount of money is needed, because I believe that it is, in fact, required if a real impression is to be made upon this unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>We come now to the Bill itself.  I listened with considerable interest to the Tánaiste introducing this Bill yesterday. Unfortunately, I had not experience&mdash;my experience here is not long&mdash;of listening to the Tánaiste introducing many Bills.  I did think that his introductory speech was doleful.  It was a sort of song of defeat, a song of depression and pessimism.  He outlined very candidly and very realistically all the flaws, all the difficulties and all the impediments which do and must stand in the way of the successful establishment of industries in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the Tánaiste is going to induce any industrialist, any private enterprise, any person or group of persons to leave the more favourable conditions in the East and South of Ireland and set up shop in the West, I do not think that the outlining, so eloquently done, of all those obstacles and difficulties should have been resorted to by the Tánaiste.  His introductory speech may have done more harm to the potential introduction of industries in the West of Ireland than otherwise.  I know that he was being realistic about it.  I know that he did not do it with any sinister intention.  It occurred to me that possibly it was not the best approach. I say that with all respect.</P>
    <P>If we are going to spend £2,000,000 &mdash;I understand that is only a nominal sum which may be increased or not entirely spent at all&mdash;and tackle the problem of industrialisation in the West of Ireland, it is quite obvious that, until rural electrification has extended over the seven counties mentioned in the Bill, certain large areas must now be excluded from its operation and scope.  I imagine that, if the purpose of the Bill was, in the main, to stop or diminish the flow of emigration, heavy industries of a permanent nature must be built.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> I heard with some amusement Deputy Peadar Cowan suggesting yesterday two good industries which might be established in the West of Ireland under this Bill.  One was the development of the poteen industry and the other the development of the tomato industry.  The Deputy may have a sense of humour but he asserted he was quite sincere when he suggested that the poteen industry should be developed on a large scale.  If poteen were to be distilled on a large scale and if Irish men and women were to avail of the advantages thus afforded them, I think the Border would go in the morning.  We could declare war on Russia in due course, using the tomatoes as small arms.  That suggestion of Deputy Cowan's is not worth consideration. There is no point whatsoever in erecting jerry-built affairs that will employ boys and girls until they are 19 years of age when they have to leave for fields further away.  We must have industries that will employ men rather than girls, employ them permanently and give them an opportunity of settling down to build or have built their own houses to rear their own families.  Any other industry which does not make that provision for its employees will not really meet the bill.  If this Bill is to be properly adequate we must have the type of industry I suggest.</P>
    <P>Last week, a Deputy suggested that this Bill might be a political trick. Deputy Dillon, looking over the clauses of the Bill, was able to hear the rustle of the political skeletons of the five politically deceased Fianna Fáil members as they turned in their graves. That may or may not be so.  I am not interested whether it is a political trick so long as it pours money into the West of Ireland and increases employment. I am prepared to make this prophecy, that for some months to come this Bill will not be implemented.  This Bill, if passed by the House and the Seanad, will not be carried into practical effect. The £2,000,000 will be hauled round every constituency in the seven counties mentioned in the Bill by Fianna Fáil Deputies or by Fianna Fáil supporters. It will be held as a sort of sword of Damocles over the heads of <Col N="338" /> Fianna Fáil Deputies in the country. It will be hauled round in a bag, marked &ldquo;manna&rdquo;.  They will say: &ldquo;You will get all this money.  This constituency will get £1,500,000 and that constituency will get maybe not so much.&rdquo;  I believe that will be done. I think it would be a great pity if such a practice were resorted to because I believe it is about time that Governments gave up being cynical with the people in the West.  I think we are entitled to a fair crack of the whip and sincere treatment.  I feel this treatment is not embodied in the Bill before us.  The £2,000,000 cannot practicably be spent with a hope of political gain.</P>
    <P>If, say, £100,000 is spent in the County Roscommon to-morrow morning people further down the country or people in Mayo will kick up a row. There will be delegations&mdash;T.D.s and others&mdash;coming to the Tánaiste and saying: &ldquo;What are you going to do with us?&rdquo;  I see that grave flaw.  It is no fault of the Minister's but I feel that the practical operation of the Act is going to cause crisis for the Fianna Fáil Party if they, in fact, put it into operation.  That is why I honestly say that the Bill, when it becomes an Act, will not be put into practical effect.</P>
    <P>I am not going to fall out with the mechanics of the Bill although I have seen flaw after flaw in it.  Other Deputies have pointed them out and done so efficiently.  I can see plenty of administrative difficulties and practical difficulties.  But anything that will stand in the way of this Bill not being put into real effect in the West of Ireland will not have my support. I am speaking for my constituents. They want the money and the industries and, in that respect, anything that can be done to hurry the passage of this Bill will have my ready co-operation and support.</P>
    <P>I would suggest&mdash;I do not think there was any reference made to this matter by the Tánaiste nor do I think there is any reference to it in the Bill &mdash;the establishment of an advisory body, a body which would meet delegations from the various towns and centres, hear their complaints and, <Col N="339" /> having been made aware of the potentialities and actual circumstances of these places, advise them on the type of industry best suited to their need.  I think, if the Bill is to be scientifically implemented, that the necessity for having an advisory body is more than apparent.  I would suggest that to the Tánaiste if and when this Bill in fact becomes law.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this Bill become a real success.  In conclusion, I will indulge in the heresy of quoting a Fianna Fáil Deputy who, when referring to the Undeveloped Areas Bill last week, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In so far as employment is concerned, it is most ardently to be hoped that the Undeveloped Areas Bill will in a short space of time provide employment for the second and third sons of the smallholders in the West of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that I say, Amen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker, I also hope to see this Bill meet with success in regard to the development of the West of Ireland. I say I hope.  I am not too sure at the present time that it will be of such great benefit as the Tánaiste would have us believe.</P>
      <P>In the Bill, undoubtedly there is a challenge to private enterprise.  Its terms offer to those who believe in private enterprise great help in the line of grants and financial assistance and with regard to buildings, machinery, the training of staff and so forth.  In other words, the Bill is an enticement to private enterprise to go ahead in the West of Ireland.  This is where I fall out with the Minister. I do not believe that private enterprise will meet his challenge and it will mean then that whatever Government is in power will have to step in and help to commence these industries with State aid and State control.</P>

      <P>Nobody will be better pleased than myself to see the Minister <Col N="340" /> proved correct regarding this Bill.  The sum of £2,000,000 has been mentioned and it has been splashed on the Sunday papers and other papers in order to give the impression that more money is being thrown into the West of Ireland among, as Deputy Hession put it, the wild mountainy men.  The impression seems to have been created that the people of the West of Ireland live on doles and have their two hands out all the time looking for something.  &ldquo;Undeveloped areas&rdquo;. is, I think, a good title for the Bill.  I am glad that there is no mention in the title of Gaeltacht or congested areas.</P>

      <P>I want to see the ending of the day when the Gaeltacht areas are looked upon as Indian reservations. While Fianna Fáil were in power from 1932 to 1948&mdash;I say this without fear of contradiction&mdash;no attempt was made to develop industries in the West of Ireland, the idea being that if industrialisation took place there damage would be done to the Irish language and we would lose the way of life existing in the Gaeltacht areas.  I do not believe for a moment that if industrialisation takes place in what are known as the Gaeltacht areas the Irish language will suffer.  If draining is carried out in the Gaeltacht areas or if the people receive work in factories with decent wages, instead of turning them to the English language it will entice those in the areas who speak English to take up the Gaelic language.</P>
      <P>To get back to the point about the £2,000,000 for the West, Deputy Hession has said that he believes this sum to be completely inadequate.  He may be going a little too fast.  I cannot for the life of me see how any Government could pour in a huge sum of money overnight.  There is no reason to my mind why that sum should not be increased when opportunities present themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> Let us look for a moment at the progress of industrial development in the West of Ireland since we had a native Government.  I do not think that any member of this House having heard these figures could for a moment say that the Gaeltacht areas had received more than their due.  Take what happened under the inter-Party reign in their three years of office.  In reply to a parliamentary question I put to the former Minister I was told that 156 factories had been established in the country during the inter-Party reign and that of these nine were in the Province of Connacht.  The employment given in these 156 factories was 4,000 and out of that 150 individuals got employment in Connacht.  I think that speaks for itself and shows how much the previous administration thought of the West of Ireland. Take the over-all picture when Fianna Fáil were in power, under the previous Cumann na nGaedheal Government and under the inter-Party Government too.  I am not trying to score over any political Party as I put them all in the one category with regard to the manner in which they neglected the West of Ireland.  An analysis of industrial employment in Ireland in a recent year showed that 42 per cent. of our industries were in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire; 20 per cent. were in the rest of Leinster; 26 per cent. in Munster; 5 per cent. in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan and the huge figure of 7 per cent. for the five counties of Connacht.  When we consider that in Connacht we have over 17 per cent. of the population of the Twenty-Six Counties and that at the same time their proportion of industries is only 7 per cent., that to my mind proves gross neglect of the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not going to blame different Governments but I do blame individual T.D.s representing the West of Ireland. If they had really spoken in the council chambers of their own Parties, if they had explained matters as they existed in the West, surely no Government would have been neglectful in remedying matters.  Surely this is important from the point of view of the over-all picture.  There are in <Col N="342" /> Connacht five counties and there are 25 T.D.s for that province.  For the City and County of Dublin alone there are 30 T.D.s.</P>

      <P>As far as parliamentary representation is concerned the West of Ireland never had a chance from the beginning.  As more people left the West of Ireland to go to Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Leinster, it followed that when a further revision of constituencies was made Dublin would again increase its representation and the West of Ireland lose its population. We will end up by having a dictator for all Connacht, one T.D. living in Galway City.</P>
      <P>I am almost afraid of the get-rich-quick merchants and chancers getting in on this Bill, especially when there is such an appeal in the country for industry.  There are many towns in the West of Ireland at the moment whose cry is &ldquo;we want an industry here&rdquo;.  Many people are anxious to put money in but there are many who would like to see the Government itself handing over a sum of money to groups in some of these towns so as to allow them to start the industry.  I think that that is a very dangerous business. It amounts to State money, taxpayers' and ratepayers' money, being handed over to private persons to make a success or failure as they like.  The State, ordinary taxpayers, will have no control over that money once it is handed over to these groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why the Minister should consider this idea&mdash; that where there is a group willing to start an industry and, having gone into all the difficulties, a decision is arrived at that there is a possibility of success, why should the State not go 50-50 with that group in the establishment of the industry?  When the industry gets on its feet, is it not possible that many of the workers in the industry, the ordinary men and women employed in it, would be delighted to take shares? I think it would be getting nearer to the ideal type of industrial development and employment, when you would have that factory run on a co-operative <Col N="343" /> basis.  It is only by degrees that you would get that.  Unless the example is given by the State, I cannot see how it will ever be done.</P>
    <P>There is a danger under this Bill of too many things being attempted, too many types of pressure being brought to bear on the particular people in this board.  If you like, that is another argument for the Minister in connection with private enterprise.  If he really believes that private enterprise is the solution to the problem in the West of Ireland, why not start at bedrock? To my mind he is putting the cart before the horse in giving all these grants to private industrialists, private enterprise and so forth.</P>
    <P>The best way to entice investment by private enterprise in the West of Ireland is to start at Galway City. Under the Bill, there is authority to develop the port.  I think it was Deputy Desmond who mentioned that if proper harbour facilities were made available, industries would automatically arise.  I do not believe that the right move is to put a small industry into town X, ten or 15 miles from Galway City, and another small industry another ten or 15 miles away. I think industries will automatically arise if, taking Galway City as a typical example, that port were properly developed.  I understand that the sum of £370,000&mdash;I am subject to correction&mdash;has been allocated by the Department for the purpose of enlarging the docks in Galway.  Although I am a representative of Roscommon, I know as much about Galway City as I do about my own constituency.  I am at home in Galway equally as I am at home in Roscommon.  It is on that account that I speak on behalf of Galway here and add my voice to the voice of the Deputies who represent the West.  I believe that if Galway City and harbour are properly developed, my constituency will also be developed. The development of an industry in Roscommon town will automatically arise as a result of Galway getting proper treatment, the treatment that it deserves.</P>
    <P>There is quite a possibility, given a bit of courage on the part of the Minister, <Col N="344" /> that Galway could be made one of the finest ports in Europe.  We know that it is the nearest port of call for the large transatlantic liners from America and Canada.  For many years prior to the war, American and German companies were anxious to secure facilities in Galway because they believed in crossing the Atlantic in the shortest possible space of time.  My information with regard to these lines is that they want to complete their journey in the shortest space of time and it is barely a three-day journey from some American ports to Galway harbour.</P>
    <P>I see no reason in the world why money could not be spent to develop Galway harbour properly.  If that were done, there would be the American passenger trade.  Passengers would be disembarking in Galway and air services could be provided to take them in two to three hours to London or other destinations in England.  There could also be expansion of railway services and road services.  Once the harbour is developed and transatlantic liners can berth in the harbour it means automatically that other shipping lines will follow and that cargoes and so forth will come in.</P>
    <P>Have not you there the foundation for the establishment of industry by private enterprise?  Is not that the right way to tackle it?  The moment industrialists see harbour facilities available in the port they will set up industries in Galway and will not need 50 per cent. or any other sort of grant from the Department.</P>
    <P>The trouble I see with regard to the development of Galway is that the vested interests in the Port of Dublin would be enough to prevent the expansion of Galway.  I think that is the danger.  We have at the moment a bottle-neck in Dublin, while at the same time there is an opportunity to make Galway one of the finest ports in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is familiar with some of the recommendations that were made as far back as 1923 by the Galway Chamber of Commerce and by very prominent engineers, including Professor Rishworth, that a new pier be built in Galway.  They estimated that the <Col N="345" /> whole development work would cost something in the region of £2,500,000 to £2,750,000.  I am sure that to-day the same work would cost about £7,000,000.  That sounds a large figure but the work would be spread over five to seven years.  Consider the employment it would give in the meantime. To-day Galway is a boom town. There is £1,500,000 or £2,000,000 being spent there at the moment on a hospital and sanatorium.  In two years it will be a ghost town.  The men employed on that work have brought their families into Galway &mdash; tradesmen, experts in their various departments, plasterers, plumbers, ordinary labourers.  Where will they all go?</P>
    <P>Instead of nibbling at this question of developing Galway harbour, the Minister should embark on a courageous scheme, on a big scheme, instead of this miserly scheme to spend £370,000 that will help only to fit another ship in behind the Dun Aengus.</P>
    <P>I make these suggestions to the Minister with regard to the industrial development of the West because I would not like the Bill to be a failure. That is the main reason why I am pressing the Minister to start at the foundation, that is, the development of Galway harbour.  Then there will be industrial expansion automatically. Forget about dotting little factories all over.  The real solution for Connemara after that is tourism and afforestation, but, in addition to tourism and afforestation, there is the second greatest source of national wealth all along the western coastline, namely, fishing.  There is grave divergence of opinion in this House with regard to deep-sea fishing, but I believe that Galway Port should be the headquarters of deep-sea fishing.  If you want further industries in the West, put canning industries into operation, where surplus fish would be processed and turned into fish meal, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hession said a few minutes ago that Deputy Cowan referred to poteen last night.  I am not going to stand up for Deputy Cowan.  He is well able to do that for himself.  But I wonder is the Minister aware that there was a considerable amount of <Col N="346" /> malting barley grown in Connemara in years past and, of course, that barley was used for distilling poteen. When the law began to look harshly on those who made poteen the first people the law looked at were those who grew barley.  They naturally began to get wise and ceased growing barley, but they did not stop making poteen.  Instead of barley, they turned to treacle, sugar and bluestone.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there may be quite a lot in what Deputy Cowan said.  People should not criticise his suggestion who do not know the first thing about the poteen industry.  The fact is that poteen is being made in the West and it will be made, and the more you forbid it, the more it will be made.  I think that there you have a grand opportunity so far as Irish-Americans are concerned.  Why not allow these people to grow barley there for the purpose of making poteen?  It is as good as Scotch whisky.  Scotch whisky started by being made in small houses and cabins in Scotland.  To-day it is being made by combines.</P>

      <P>It is a home industry. I see nothing wrong with sending bottles of it labelled &ldquo;Irish poteen&rdquo; to Irish-Americans; they would lap it up.  There is one question which I want to ask the Tánaiste in connection with this board he is setting up and I will be anxious to hear his reply.  There has been a lot of talk in this House for a number of years, at any rate since I have had the privilege of being here, about decentralisation.  Every Government has said: &ldquo;We are going to decentralise; we will transfer some <Col N="347" /> Department down the country.&rdquo;  I should like the Tánaiste to tell me where the headquarters of this new board will be.</P>

      <P>As this board will be dealing with the undeveloped areas, its headquarters should be in the West and I think it should be set up in Galway.  Otherwise, we are only talking foolishly in this House about decentralisation.  There can be no excuse with regard to this particular body.  It is not the same as taking the Land Commission out of Dublin. They are already established there and you would want to blow them out of it. This is a new body which has not yet got dug in in any particular quarter. I see no reason why they should not have their headquarters in Galway.  I am very anxious to get the Minister's reply to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>A large part of Roscommon, which I represent, cannot be described as a congested area. That is one of the reasons why I am glad the word &ldquo;undeveloped&rdquo; is used in the Bill.  The fact that there is not as much congestion in Roscommon as in other counties does not mean that there is full employment there or anything like that.  I do not know whether Deputies realise that there are quite a number of small towns in Roscommon and that there is not even one factory in the whole county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always understood that the people of Ballaghaderreen claim that they are in County Mayo. In the other towns in Roscommon there is no industrial employment for the young men and women in the towns and the surrounding areas.  That is one of the reasons why I like the title of this Bill.  The Minister is not confined to the areas mentioned.  If he wishes at a later stage he can apply it to areas outside those mentioned in the Bill. That is a very good thing to have included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> Finally, I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the question of the possibility of running it on a proper basis.  If there is an industrial planning group in a town willing and anxious to get a factory and they have not sufficient money to start with&mdash;I do not suppose this is really possible under this Bill&mdash;the Minister should go 50-50 with that group.  In other words, the State should take part in it as well as private enterprise.  After a lapse of time, when that particular industry gets on its feet, the State should hand over its share in the control of the factory to other local people who would buy shares in small lots.  I do not want to see any development in the West which would mean the setting up of an industry by a few speculators anxious to make a profit in two or three years and then get out, an industry that would give employment of the type that exists in certain parts of the West paying a real slave wage.  It is quite possible for industrialists to get away with that in parts of the West because the trade unions have not done anything like real organisation work there.  It is possible to get girls there to work in factories at a wage which I would be ashamed to mention in this House.  I would not like to see anything like that happening under this Bill, because it would be as well for the people who would have to work in such factories to emigrate.  They possibly would emigrate and thus the whole thing would fall through.  I wish the Minister luck with regard to this Bill and I hope that I will be proved wrong with regard to the response he will get from private enterprise in connection with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate we had in this House last week on the Estimate for the office of the Parliamentary Secretary more or less anticipated the debate on this Bill and, having contributed to that debate, I do not propose to delay other Deputies who are anxious to speak, beyond making a few remarks in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, I want to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  We have in it something that is long overdue.  It is the first real attempt ever made to give practical <Col N="349" /> expression to that high-sounding phrase we hear so often, the decentralisation of industry.  I believe the Bill contains sufficient inducements to make this scheme a success.  I do not think as other Deputies seem to think that the Bill will put an end to development along the western seaboard in other directions.  There is no reason why afforestation, the fishing industry, land reclamation and all the other schemes necessary to improve the lot of the people in these areas should not continue to be developed side by side with any benefits which may accrue from the enactment of this measure.</P>
    <P>I am not pessimistic about results.  I believe the Bill will have the desired effect.  I believe the Minister and the Government will ensure that there will be industrial development generally speaking in so far as it is possible to foster such development by Government assistance and protection.  Under the provisions of this Bill I think there are sufficient concessions and inducements to ensure that such development in future will be decentralised.  We have been waiting for that for years. We have for years watched the east coast drawing the population like a magnet from the western seaboard and leaving us bereft of the benefits and advantages we had every right to expect.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to the effect this Bill may have on the restoration, preservation and expansion of the Irish language.  Two types of areas are proposed for development under this Bill.  I believe that the Fior-Ghaeltacht requires specialised treatment and I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that Foras Tionscail will take every care that industrial development in these areas will not have the effect of anglicising them instead of helping to preserve the language.  There is that danger inherent in industrialisation of the Gaeltacht.  I do not say that with any intention of restricting the scope of this Bill but merely to instil into the Government the necessity for taking special care to prevent certain industries being established in the Gaeltacht. It is possible that a certain industry anxious to take advantage of the concessions given in this Bill might <Col N="350" /> bring with it a set of officials, supervisors, technicians or staff which might conduct the affairs of the industry through the medium of English.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Bill provides for the training of personnel I believe the Minister has taken precautions against such eventualities.  I believe the personnel in these industries should be trained native Irish speakers capable of managing their own affairs.  In that way the Bill would not tend to anglicise the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister should keep in mind the fact that we in Donegal are bordered by three unfree counties. It is vitally important from the national point of view that proper development should take place in our county.  I do not think we should be left in the position where those in Northern Ireland can point at us and say that our men and women have to go across to them to find employment. I believe Donegal requires special attention.  An effort should be made to ensure that not a single unemployed person is left along the Border.  That will be very important eventually from the point of view of solving Partition.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to the development of Galway harbour.  He said it should be utilised in order to improve the western seaboard as a whole.  In Donegal we do not require any deep sea harbour.  We have one of the best harbours in Europe at Killybegs, thanks to the generosity of the previous Fianna Fáil Government. That harbour provides facilities at the moment which compare favourably with any in Europe.  I say that without fear of contradiction.  That harbour should be utilised to the fullest possible extent.  If we are to have the desired expansion in industry in Donegal that must eventually tend towards the better development of the existing facilities there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt special note will be taken of that.  I <Col N="351" /> believe that once an industry is established in a district, even though its employment potential may be small, the hope and confidence it gives to the people is incalculable.  It inspires them with a certain pride and interest in their own native district and they come in time to appreciate the fact that they have as good a livelihood there as they would find anywhere else. I am not so pessimistic as other Deputies, who prophesy that the Bill will not have the desired effect in attracting a sufficient number of industries to these depressed areas.  I am sorry so many Deputies have wrongly assumed that this is a political stunt, but I was glad that most of them prefaced their remarks by saying that it was a good stunt.  Even if it is a political stunt it is still a good stunt.  I do not care what the Deputies opposite think.  I am inclined to think that the fact that they are condemning the Bill, or are accusing us of having political motives behind it, is in itself proof that there is something good in it, because whenever something good is proposed then, naturally, our opponents will suspect, or will try to suggest, that it is being done for political purposes.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  Under the present law relating to pharmacy, which dates back to 1875, provision is made for two classes of pharmaceutical practitioners, pharmaceutical chemists who are entitled to keep open for the sale of poisons and to dispense the prescriptions of medical practitioners, and registered druggists who may mix and sell poisons, but may not dispense such prescriptions.  The grade of registered druggist was not provided for in the original Act but in an amending Act passed in 1890.  The new grade was, apparently, created to ease the hardships caused in some parts of the country by the shortage at the time of <Col N="352" /> pharmaceutical chemists.  There is no such shortage at present and the continuation of the two grades is no longer necessary.</P>
      <P>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the statutory body controlling the registration of both pharmaceutical chemists and registered druggists, wrote to me recently stating that they and the Registered Druggists' Association, an organisation representative of druggists, concurred that the perpetuation of the druggist grade was undesirable, and requested me to introduce legislation on the matter. This Bill, which provides for the eventual discontinuance of the druggist grade, was prepared after consultation with these bodies, and is based on an agreement reached between the two organisations.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, persons who are now registered druggists will, in accordance with regulations made by the Pharmaceutical Society with the consent of the Minister, be permitted to sit for an examination to qualify them as &ldquo;dispensing chemists and druggists&rdquo;.  This examination will be held at intervals during the next three years.</P>
      <P>Those who qualify as dispensing chemists and druggists will be permitted to compound medical precriptions and, generally speaking, to carry on a pharmacy business in the same manner as a pharmaceutical chemist. Those registered druggists who either fail this examination, or do not sit for it, will be allowed to carry on as at present.  Provision is included in the Bill for the protection of the title of &ldquo;dispensing chemist and druggist&rdquo;, and generally for the application to the new class of practitioner of the provisions of the Pharmacy Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided that no apprentices may be taken by registered druggists after the date on which the Bill was introduced in the Dáil.  Persons who before that date were serving their apprenticeship will be permitted to proceed to the examination to become registered druggists in the normal way. It is also part of the agreement reached between the Pharmaceutical Society and the Registered Druggists' Association that these apprentices will <Col N="353" /> be permitted to transfer to become apprentices to pharmaceutical chemists without doing the usual preliminary examination for such apprenticeship. There is no need, however, to provide for this in the Bill as it can be arranged by an amendment of the regulations of the Pharmaceutical Society.</P>
    <P>While those who are now registered druggists or who are training to become registered druggists will have all their rights preserved, there will, therefore, be no further additions to their number and, with the passage of time, there will be but one class of pharmaceutical practitioner, namely, the pharmaceutical chemist.  This will, I think, be more satisfactory from the points of view of the society, its members, and the public.  The Pharmaceutical Society are at present considering a scheme for the improvement of the training of pharmaceutical chemists whereby there will be better provision for theoretical instruction, and a series of graded examinations, on the lines of those held in connection with the acquisition of university qualifications, will replace the present single qualifying test.  This scheme, in conjunction with the change to be effected by the present Bill, should raise considerably the future standard of those qualifying in pharmacy.</P>
    <P>As this Bill is the outcome of an agreement between the parties mainly interested in its terms, and as all existing rights are being preserved, I recommend it with confidence to the Dáil for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to this fact, that he has secured agreement from all the interested elements in a very formidable vested interest.  His colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is in the process of drafting legislation to deal with trade rings. There is no more ferocious trade ring in this country than the pharmaceutical chemists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, nobody in this House will dissent from the proposition that a man who is to be authorised to dispense doctors' prescriptions, or to handle poisons, should require to be a person with adequate qualifications so as to ensure that he will not frustrate the <Col N="354" /> physician's purpose by failing to compound his prescription correctly, or that he will not sell, without due precaution, dangerous substances to the public generally.  But I think if the Minister reflects he will agree with me that fully 70 per cent. of the trade transacted by pharmaceutical chemists at the present time has nothing to do with dispensing prescriptions, nor with purveying poisons or dangerous substances to the public.  What has actually happened is this: the pharmaceutical chemists, having established themselves within the charmed circle of the pharmaceutical association, entrance to which is controlled by an examination conducted by the association, the Pharmaceutical Society then, acting as a trade organisation, proceed to open negotiations with a number of wholesale purveyors of commodities like soap, cosmetics, patent medicines, toothpaste and a variety of other universally used articles, for the purpose of ensuring that these commodities will not be sold through any retail distributor who is not a member of the Pharmaceutical Association.  Their method of enforcing that is to say: &ldquo;If you distribute your commodities to anybody but a member of the Pharmaceutical Society, then no member of the Pharmaceutical Society will handle your commodities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I agree that common sense demands that the person who dispenses a doctor's prescription should be trained and trained under suitable supervision so as to ensure that he is competent faithfully to carry out the doctor's directions.  If I want to buy a box of Singleton's eye ointment&mdash;as a matter of fact it is not one of the confined commodities but it is one of a very large number of commonly used domestic remedies&mdash;why should I have to go to a pharmaceutical chemist for it?  I think the Minister will find out on inquiry that the distinguishing mark of all these commodities is that the retail profit margin is very very large, and the only reason why the retail profit margin can be kept at that level is because the retail distribution is confined to the Pharmaceutical Society. Now, there was this half-pharmacy and half-shopkeeper loophole in their enclave, that if you were not in a position <Col N="355" /> to pass the entrance examination prescribed by the Pharmaceutical Society you could not become a pharmaceutical chemist's apprentice at all. There used to be access to a sort of a pharmaceutical chemist business through the Registered Druggists' Association which bore, I gathered, to the Pharmaceutical Society much the same relation as the apothecaries bore to the Medical Association.</P>
    <P>We are now asked by the Pharmaceutical Society to close that loophole and we are assured by the Minister that the members of the Druggists' Association are agreed.  Why would they not? Observe, the Pharmaceutical Society has provided in the agreement that if you are a druggist they will prescribe a nice simple examination that will make a pharmaceutical chemist out of you and anyone who is apprenticed to a druggist will be helped to get into the charmed circle.  In fact no one's feelings are to be ruffled until this comfortable arrangement is given statutory effect.  Then when everyone is safely inside the stockade, out with the bows and arrows and challenge the consuming public.</P>
    <P>I have now to suggest to the Minister that this would be a suitable occasion to provide that, if the Pharmaceutical Society is to be convenienced by statutory approval of their monopoly, they would give the Oireachtas a corresponding undertaking that on the drugs they distribute there should be a fixed maximum percentage profit.  I will exclude prescriptions from that if you like.  I leave the pharmacist to sell his skill as a compounder at whatever value he himself sets upon it and the consuming public are prepared to pay for it. But apart from things which he himself compounds they should be ready to satisfy the Minister for Health that in respect of any particular commodity handled by them a maximum percentage profit is not exceeded.  Remember, and I think it is worth remembering, that if you bring a doctor's prescription into any chemist's shop in Ireland and it has been compounded once already, the second chemist to whom you bring it will look <Col N="356" /> at the back of the prescription at the first compounder's trade mark and will there see in secret figures the price charged by the first chemist for this mixture, so that there will be no wide discrepancy between the price charged by a relatively simple or honest pharmaceutical chemist and a more enterprising pharmaceutical chemist who sets a higher value on his compounding powers.  The constituents of a bottle of medicine may cost a compounder 2d.  The first compounder might value his skill at 2/4 and sell the bottle for 2/6, whereas the second compounder might value his skill higher and charge 5/-, but if you look at the back of the prescription you will see a series of hieroglyphics which will indicate that such a pharmaceutical chemist charged this fellow, say, 5/- for the prescription.</P>
    <P>Now I do not pass judgment on that practice but I do say that a long suffering public which accepts such arrangements is entitled to say, when its Oireachtas is approached for statutory sanction of what it represents to be a professional monopoly exclusively for the protection of the health and wealth of the public lest they be poisoned by unskilled persons, that while we express our profound gratuity for this solicitude for our continued health, wealth and prosperity, we should reasonably suggest to the Pharmaceutical Society, without desiring to intrude into the secrets of their trade, that they should give us a general undertaking that, excluding mixtures compounded in their own establishments by themselves, they will bind themselves not to take more than an agreed maximum percentage of profit.  I do ask the Minister, before this Bill is finally disposed of, to consider asking the high contracting parties to this alliance exclusively inspired by the public interest that they should show their disinterest by a further gesture to confirm their solicitude not only for the public health but for the public purse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify a couple of points that occurred to me from Deputy <Col N="357" /> Dillon's remarks.  I would like to know whether the old system, whereby a boy or a girl who served their apprenticeship down the country and then came to Dublin to complete their course and obtain work in Dublin at the same time, is going to be ended, or if this course, under the auspices or the aegis of the Pharmaceutical Society, will entail lectures during the day with resultant increase in expenditure on the part of the student or his parents.  I would not like to think that the path to becoming a pharmaceutical chemist will be made any more difficult because it is generally recognised at the moment that in the last couple of years it is almost impossible to qualify as a pharmaceutical chemist.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is a desire on the part of the society to keep just the select few.  I certainly had a number of cases where untold hardship has accrued both to the students and the parents in this matter through difficulty in qualifying.  Perhaps it is more desirable that standard lectures should be given rather than that these boys and girls should have to work during the day in chemists' shops and then have to attend lectures at night. Probably it would be better for their health in the long run and, perhaps, it would eventually result in their qualifying much easier than hitherto has been the experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wonder if an end will eventually be reached to the practice indulged in by a number of chemists of prescribing for patients themselves without having prescriptions from the patient's doctor.  That has been the rather undesirable practice.  I do know that the society do not look upon it with favour but, nevertheless, it goes on.  Indeed, I have several mothers of children coming in to me who tell me: &ldquo;The child is very ill.  I went to the chemist a couple of days ago and got a number of M. and B's.&rdquo;  Of course, the unfortunate mother had not the vaguest idea how to administer them. The same state of affairs exists, not only with pocket drugs, like slumber drugs, but also with proprietary preparations.  I would like to know if the Minister could give me some idea as to whether there is any provision to <Col N="358" /> be made in the Bill in connection with this matter, which is a bugbear, not so much for myself but for members of the profession generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipABrady" hpid="Mr. P.A. Brady Mr. P.A. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.A. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I want to compliment the Minister on introducing it so expeditiously.  The Pharmaceutical Society was formed in 1875 to qualify people to compound prescriptions and to sell poisons.  The Amendment Act of 1890 introduced two clauses providing for a special examination for people entitled to sell poisons only.  With all due respect to what Deputy Dillon has just said, there are roughly 1,000 chemists carrying on a practice in this State.  Looking back over the years, I maintain that these chemists have fulfilled their obligation to the public in the manner in which they have conducted the sale of poisons.  They have acted, as it were, in the capacity of liaison between the doctor and the patient.  Speaking from a statutory point of view, it is the duty of the Pharmaceutical Society to see that their students are properly educated and properly qualified to fulfil these duties.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the Bill which is before the House is an agreed measure.  There are about 50 people practising as registered druggists in this country.  The druggists and the members of the Pharmaceutical Society have been in consultation for some time.  Realising their responsibilities and in order to keep abreast of modern trends, they agreed to give any of these druggists who so wished it the opportunity of passing a special examination, so that they could qualify as chemists and be enabled to dispense prescriptions and to sell poisons.  Of course, the druggists who do not wish to pass this examination will remain as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all realise the changes that have taken place in recent years, and those that are taking place at present, in the methods of prescribing&mdash;the introduction of antibiotics, and so on. Therefore, we must step up our curriculum. With that in view, the Pharmaceutical Society are at present working on an educational programme which will entail the spending by <Col N="359" /> students of a full academic year in the College of Pharmacy for the purpose of studying both scientific and professional subjects.  Students will also have to spend a certain amount of time in a recognised pharmacy so as to get practical experience.  This educational programme will be introduced for the purpose of facilitating the student so that he will be enabled to make a better preparation for his examination and thus be better prepared to undertake what suggest themselves to me as very onerous responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I heard the former Taoiseach saying at a function recently that of all the bodies of people he had met, taking a broad view, the chemists of this country conducted their businesses more thoroughly than any other, and I agree with him fully, taking into consideration the very great importance and seriousness of their vocation. Every day of the week they are handling poisons and making up prescriptions and yet there are very few, if any, fatal mistakes made.  As I said, they are the custodians of the poison laws of this country and are responsible to the State.</P>
    <P>I will now touch on the subject of our examinations.  A Government visitor is present at all the Pharmaceutical Society's examinations, and these examinations were not at any time competitive.  I can give Dr. Maguire instances of girls aged 21 and 22 years who sat for the society's examinations, and who got the final qualifications without any difficulty whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill for this further reason: it was a great disadvantage to have a student, a quasi-student, working in a pharmacy during the day who had to attend lectures in the College of Pharmacy during the night. Naturally, he did not have the same facilities for studying as, possibly, a medical student or a law student who could devote his full time to it.  That is why we rectified the position in our educational programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Dillon is, I think, not exactly relevant on this particular Bill.  We are dealing here with the qualifications that are necessary for pharmaceutical chemists and for the Pharmaceutical Society in future.  There is another society, I think, called the Irish Drug Association, which is a sort of trade body which may have engaged in the restrictive practices to which Deputy Dillon referred.  However, I am not quite certain of that.  I think this would be a matter for a Bill dealing with restrictive practices, should the Dáil wish to introduce it. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has promised to introduce a Bill after Christmas dealing with that particular point.  I have no doubt that there would be powers in that Bill to deal with the abuses outlined by Deputy Dillon, if he is correct in his outlining of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy Maguire, this Bill makes no change whatever in the course that will be prescribed for an assistant. Deputy Brady has told us what the Pharmaceutical Society intends to do, but what they have done does not <Col N="361" /> come within this Bill.  I presume that they would have done that whether this Bill was passed or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister see that so long as the druggist loophole was open the pharmaceutical chemists could not tighten the noose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit there is the point that there was always, if you like, a loophole.  The man who felt he could not pass the more difficult examinations set by the Pharmaceutical Society could become a druggist.  I think, however, Deputy Brady is probably right in saying that for modern medicines, antibiotics and so on, it is necessary to have a higher standard of education for those dealing with medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the chemist may make a mistake which would be a desperate thing.  If you give twice the correct dose of Glauber salts, you do not cause a lot of harm but if you give twice the dose of these vaccines you might do a lot of harm.  That is why I say it is more important to have a higher standard for the newer drugs now dispensed by chemists.  Deputy Maguire mentioned that some pharmaceutical chemists prescribe themselves.  I agree that that is a reprehensible practice but I am not dealing with it in this Bill.  It is a matter for the Pharmaceutical Society.  The Pharmaceutical Society deals only with the standard of examinations, knowledge prescribed, professional conduct and so on.  They do not deal with such things as prices, restrictive trade practices or matters of that kind.  That would be a matter for the trading body, the Irish Drug Association.</P>

He points out that this Bill does not give the Pharmaceutical Society any additional powers to prescribe the course students must follow <Col N="362" /> but, as Deputy Brady has pointed out, the intention of the Pharmaceutical Society, once they have got the Bill, is to prescribe that a student must do three years' apprenticeship and one year's study whereas, heretofore, he could do one of his four years working as a fourth-year pharmaceutical student in a chemist's shop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that some of my neighbours who came up here as fourth-year students did go into chemists' shops.  It may be that one chemist would be more kindly than another and would allow the chap a little pocket money if he were satisfactory. It greatly helped the parents, sometimes relatively poor people, if their boy got so much pocket money because it is a heavy burden on country people to send their children up here to qualify.</P>

They can raise the standard so as to reduce the total number of pharmaceutical students.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to an agreement which was reached with the British Government in December, 1949. I should explain to Deputies that the <Col N="364" /> Goodenough Committee, which was set up in Great Britain in 1942 to inquire into the organisation of medical education, had recommended in 1944 that all medical students in Great Britain should, after passing their final examination, be required to serve as a junior house officer for a period of 12 months in one or more approved hospitals before being fully registered as a medical practitioner.  This recommendation was accepted by the General Medical Council in Great Britain and subsequently by the British Government. The recommendation was communicated by the General Medical Council to the teaching bodies in this country and in general they favoured the adoption in this country of the requirement of pre-registration hospital experience similar to that required in Great Britain.  The matter was also considered by a committee which was set up by the Minister for Health in November, 1947, to report and make recommendations, among other matters, on any changes required in the curricula and organisation of medical education.  In the report to the Minister for Health this committee recommended that pre-registration house appointments should be required of all graduates of medicine in this country.</P>
      <P>When, therefore, towards the end of 1949, the British Government suggested that a joint discussion of the matter be held in Dublin, in order to preserve the existing arrangement whereby graduates of the British medical schools may be registered in our Medical Register, and our medical graduates may be registered in theirs, the Irish Government were cognisant of the general feeling in our own medical profession in favour of the requirement of a period of resident service in hospital before final registration. Knowing also that this principle of pre-registration training, commonly called internship, has been accepted in several other States, the Irish Government had no hesitation in accepting the proposals in principle and in agreeing to have the discussion with the British.  The conference took place in Dublin in December, 1949, and an agreement was reached on the details of the application of the scheme in the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> It was agreed that the existing position whereby Irish graduates have the right of registration in the British Register and British doctors have the right to registration in the Irish Register would continue and the complications in the reciprocal arrangements arising out of the proposals for provisional registration were smoothed out to the mutual satisfaction of the British and of ourselves.  The agreement made envisaged the introduction, both in the British Parliament and in the Oireachtas, of legislation to implement it.</P>
    <P>The British Government have, on their side, enacted the Medical Act, 1950, which accords with the terms of the agreement, and this Bill is designed to implement the agreement in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in detail with the provisions of the Bill since the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies has pointed out the main changes which this Bill will make.  The important change is, of course, the proposal that, after a date to be appointed by the Minister no person shall be admitted to full registration as a medical practitioner unless he has had the prescribed experience as an intern in a hospital.  The Medical Registration Council will be responsible for prescribing the minimum period of intern service and for approving the hospitals in which this service may be undertaken. While, of course, I do not wish to anticipate the decision which the Medical Registration Council will take regarding the time which an intern will spend in a junior house post, I may say that a period of one year is at present under consideration both here and in Great Britain.  The internship will be used by the student to acquire practical experience both in medicine and in surgery; and there is provision for a period of training spent in midwifery to be counted towards the minimum period spent either in medicine or in surgery.  When the intern has completed such service he may then go to the university which has granted his qualifying degree and when they have issued him with a certificate that he has had the required experience in <Col N="366" /> an approved hospital he will, on presentation of this certificate to the Medical Registration Council, be entitled to be fully registered as a medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>To enable newly qualified graduates to undertake the period of intern service at a hospital they must be given power to practise medicine in so far as it is necessary for their work in the hospital.  It is therefore provided that after qualification they shall be provisionally registered in the Medical Register, until such time as they have completed their period of training and become entitled to be registered.  All these requirements will, of course, affect only those who graduate after the &ldquo;appointed day.&rdquo;  Those already on the register then will remain fully registered, with all their rights preserved.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill it is proposed to take power to appoint visitors to visit places where instruction is given to medical students.  The Medical Registration Council has had the power to attend examinations in order to satisfy itself that the standard of knowledge required at qualifying examinations is such as to ensure that the persons qualified will have a satisfactory knowledge of medicine, surgery and midwifery.  It is considered, however, that it would be more satisfactory if the council were also in a position to satisfy itself that there are no defects in the courses of training which medical students undergo in the universities and hospitals.  The appointment of visitors to medical schools will be a function of the Medical Registration Council.</P>
    <P>We are also taking this opportunity of making clear that persons who are registered in the British Register as foreign or commonwealth practitioners, that is, by virtue of reciprocal arrangements between Great Britain or a Commonwealth or foreign country, will not, because of that fact, be entitled to registration here.  Commonwealth or foreign practitioners will only be entitled to registration in the Irish Register if there is a reciprocal agreement between this country and theirs and if they have had experience which our Medical Registration <Col N="367" /> Council is satisfied is equivalent to that required of Irish graduates.</P>
    <P>The standard of training provided by the Irish medical schools and of the doctors qualifying from these schools has always been high, and can be favourably compared with that in any other country.  Medical knowledge is, however, being constantly extended and it is important that our medical graduates should be trained in accordance with modern concepts.  This Bill should help to ensure that, on beginning his practice, the doctor will be in a better position to provide the high standards of treatment which are now required, and it is on this basis that I recommend it to you for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has left a very large part of the ground that this Bill affects uncovered in his statement.  No doubt students who go through a year's hospital course immediately after qualifying as doctors will be very much better able to face their duties and responsibilities, but there are a number of matters in regard to which I should like the Minister to throw a little light.</P>
      <P>Assuming that this Bill is passed&mdash;I take it that there is no great objection to it&mdash;and the Act is brought into operation by an appointed date, can the Minister say by what year he expects that it will come into operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been agreed yet.  I think the suggested date is the 1st January, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The closeness of that date has a very important bearing on the facilities available in this country for giving this course in hospitals to students who have spent three or four years at the medical schools, and who will not qualify in the ordinary way for professional registration until 1953.  These students now find themselves with another year of studentship clapped on to their course, so that a six years' university course has been extended to seven years.  I ask the Minister to let us know the position from the point of view of the facilities available here for the giving <Col N="368" /> of this extra hospital year course.  At present, the students go to the medical schools and attend the hospitals as resident students.  I take it that to a very large extent, if not entirely, that will disappear.  But the number of vacancies that were available for resident students in that way will not at all be adequate to meet the provision that is now being made that students will have to spend a resident year in hospital after being professionally qualified.</P>
      <P>As far as I can gather, there are something like ten hospitals in Dublin City that are reckoned within the teaching group.  They would not in any way be able to provide the facilities that are required under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any idea of how many additional places it will be necessary to provide for and how these places will be provided for either in the voluntary hospitals or the hospitals run by local authorities?  If adequate provision is going to be made, a very great extension of the taking in of resident professionally-recognised medical officers will have to be arranged. Is it the intention that the local authorities will arrange that their hospitals will be open to receive such students? We must bear in mind that this measure prevents a person who up to the present would have been able to go out and earn some kind of a living from his profession from doing so for a further year.  The maintenance of such students in whatever hospitals they are resident will have to be provided for and some payment will have to be made to enable them to cover their general personal expenses over the year.  I understand that the maintenance would perhaps be reckoned, at a very conservative figure, at £100 a year and that about £150 a year would be required as a payment by way of a small bonus to the student who is doing his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the local authority hospitals are going to be opened up for the purpose of giving this instruction, will the local authority pay for the cost of maintenance and any such fee as £150 a year to the doctor who will serve there? On the other hand, what provision will be made on the voluntary hospitals' side for the payment of the cost?  Generally, however, there is a big problem <Col N="369" /> there.  Where is the hospital accommodation to give the professionally-qualified doctors an opportunity of carrying on through 12 months and where is the cost of that extra work going to come from?  There is the further problem that students who have already entered on a medical career are likely to be caught by this requirement of an extra year.  Will there be any recognition of the difficulties in which some of these students will find themselves?</P>
    <P>I understand that, at the present moment, about 70 per cent. of those who qualify as doctors in this country find their ultimate professional life spent abroad; but that is no reason why students who are required to do a hospital course after completing their university education here should not be catered for on the hospital side here, once we are introducing a measure of this particular kind.  These are matters which the Minister should give us some opportunity of appreciating.</P>

      <P>Let me say at the outset that when I started medicine, had I visualised spending seven years in the university doing it, I would never have started, for the simple reason that it would probably have resulted in putting my parents in the poorhouse.  I cannot understand the arrangement come to with the British Medical Association.  I fail to see the necessity for it.  My knowledge of the present system of medicine in England certainly does not convey to me the necessity of compelling a doctor, having spent six years in hard study, to do an extra year in a hospital in order to become a general practitioner. I admit that that remark does not apply to specialist lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I did medicine, the course was five years.  Some time ago, it was raised to six&mdash;why, I do not know. When I look back and think of the valuable time and money I wasted in wading through subjects such as botany, zoology, physics and other unnecessary matter, I honestly think that I would have been qualified just as well and efficiently had I done just four years in subjects pertinent to the profession or more closely associated with it.  It is difficult to imagine what <Col N="370" /> bearing the anatomy of a frog or the propagation of a frog has on medical practice.  In addition to these subjects, some additional ones have been tagged on, in order to try to justify the six-years' course.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that altogether too high a standard is demanded of our medical students in the universities, and particularly in one subject, anatomy, which is recognised as the Becher's Brook of the course.  In the matter of medical education generally the amending of the standard required should be seriously considered by the authorities.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of the meteoric advances made in recent years in the simplification of diagnosis and treatment, it is hard to understand why any student has to spend six years in order to qualify.  Now another year is being tagged on.  At whose expense?  At the expense of the unfortunate parents. The Minister did not divulge the fact that the British Government or the British Medical Association&mdash;I do not know which of them is responsible&mdash;it is probably both combined&mdash;have made provision for the doctor doing his interneeship in a hospital to receive a sum of £350 a year.  The Minister did not mention any figure at all in connection with remuneration, to which Deputy Mulcahy referred.  Deputy Mulcahy was not very generous when he mentioned £150, though I do not blame him, as that is the accepted salary in hospitals for house surgeons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only mentioning figures that come back to me as an echo from the walls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if the Minister has a figure in mind I certainly hope it will be nothing less than £350. Money has changed considerably since I was a house surgeon or house physician. If it is a thing that there is no provision made for the payment of those doctors, then this Bill should not apply to this country.  Again, as Deputy Mulcahy said, where are the hospitals in which they are to spend their time?  I presume the Minister will enlighten us on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the qualifying date as 1953.  I presume this does not apply to present students, or <Col N="371" /> even to a student who has done his first year, or even his pre-registration examination.  I believe they have a pre-registration examination now and a pre-registration term in a hospital before starting on the course at the university.  I never heard such nonsense in my life.  In connection with the qualifying date 1953, the Minister must remember that not every student qualifies in six years.  In fact, the number who survive, who get through in six years, is very few.  Some take ten years to qualify&mdash;there is a number of chronics, and I think they should be considered as well as everybody else&mdash; and by the time they qualify there is another year to be tagged on before they can earn a halfpenny.  The whole thing seems to me to be very unfair. Frankly, I will be glad if this Bill has the effect of deterring a large number of students&mdash;yes, and parents, too&mdash; who erroneously regard the medical profession as an El Dorado.  The Minister must remember that parents, even in the past, to say nothing about the expenses associated nowadays with putting children through the university, are put to the pin of their collar to try to squeeze and economise in order to get their children qualified as doctors.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, after six years of intensive study in university and hospitals, and in view of the advances which have simplified medicine to a great extent, there is absolutely no necessity for anybody who gets through the final examination to have to spend another year in a hospital before taking up general practice.  That remark applies either here or in any other country.  I say that with full knowledge of the standards and experience demanded in other countries and also in the full knowledge that Irish people are more critical and expect a higher standard from their family doctors than people expect in most other countries.</P>

      <P>It will be.  With regard to existing students, I had some sympathy with their position, but, on the other hand, as I mentioned in my speech, it was generally announced in 1947 that this provision was to be made and the matter&mdash;I was Minister for Health at the time&mdash;got a fair amount of publicity.  Medical students generally&mdash;they may not all have been aware of it, I admit&mdash;must have been aware that it was to come in some time in the near future.  It is not now likely to apply to any student who started after 1946, because it will not come into operation until 1953, except, as Deputy Maguire has said, that all students do not qualify in six years. There are a few unfortunate people of that type.</P>

      <P>With regard to facilities, there would not be sufficient room in all the voluntary hospitals.  The <Col N="373" /> Medical Registration Council have reviewed the matter and have taken a census of all the hospitals in the country, and they tell me that they are quite satisfied that it will be possible to place all the students whom it will be necessary to place.  Roughly about 300 per year are being qualified and sufficient accommodation will be found in the hospitals, both local authority and voluntary, for this intern training.</P>
      <P>With regard to maintenance and payment, that matter has not been decided.  The Medical Registration Council again have given consideration to the matter and have made recommendations to me, but I have not yet been in a position to decide, because it will take some time to discuss the matter with both the Minister for Finance and the local authorities.  We have to keep in mind that a number of these hospitals had house surgeons up to this and paid them.  They will have more now than in the past, but, on the other hand, they will be getting more value.  It will not be possible for hospitals to take students into residence when this comes into operation. The work done by students during residency will be done by students living out, when this comes into operation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Maguire raised a point about the course being too long.  I am afraid I have to agree with him, but I have not got the decision in that matter.  It is the medical authorities who decide what the course should be and they asked me to bring in this legislation. One would imagine that this course could be fitted in in a shorter time, but these medical schools unfortunately have got into a groove of taking things leisurely, of having long holidays and so on.  I think that if they had added a little to the teaching time each year, they could have kept to the five years, instead of six, but I have not got the decision in that matter.  It is the Medical Registration Council who decide it.  I have been asked to bring in the legislation on their recommendation, and, on that basis, I recommend the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies seemed to express doubts with regard to the survival or continuance of any industries set up under this Bill.  The people, the surplus labour and the unemployed, awaiting the success of this Bill, are people who are as adaptable to industry as the people of any other area, and perhaps more so.  When these people have emigrated to other lands, they have proven their worth in industry by their success in the various industrial avenues and notably so in <Col N="375" /> the United States where invariably they go into industrial life.  We believe that, given the necessary opportunities at home, these people are capable of making an outstanding success of any industry calling for a high standard of skill which they are undoubtedly able to give, and we also believe that the standard of efficiency which can be reached and which is necessary for the success of industries set up under the Bill, if they are to survive, is readily available in the material at the disposal of those who seek labour for these industries.  I do not agree with the Deputy who prophesied that industries established under the Bill were not likely to last long, if he had in mind that the standard of efficiency required would not be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>One of the things which the Minister might be able to do in order to encourage and assist those industries is to place Government contracts, in so far as they refer to manufactured goods which can be manufactured at home, with industries in the undeveloped areas.  I believe that preference should be given to those industries.  I have in mind contracts in respect of the Army, Post Office, the Board of Works, which are placed, from time to time, with concerns all over Dublin.  In order to encourage industries capable of or actually engaged in producing goods required by any of these Departments, I believe they should have the sole right of producing such goods.  I can visualise various products that are required by Government Departments which are produced at home.  I am sure that the city industries which have had the privilege of supplying these goods over such a long number of years would not begrudge these contracts going to the congested areas from now on, in so far as the industries concerned are capable of producing them.  That is the only suggestion I have to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  As I said at the outset, it is long overdue.  I think it will help, with other things, to alleviate the serious problem which has existed for so long.  That is not to say that efforts have not been made to <Col N="376" /> improve the lot of the people in the undeveloped areas.  Various things have been tried with a certain measure of success.</P>
    <P>These things, I hope, will be improved with the advent of this industrial arm to those areas.  I do not like the idea, evident in some of the speeches made, that other development in these areas should now be set aside and that this Bill should be the only means to serve the needs of the people in the undeveloped areas.  We are looking forward to a more generous drive in other directions as well.  I believe that these schemes will be complementary to one another, and will succeed, on the whole, in setting up in the minds of the people in those areas a feeling that they can remain at home and enjoy those amenities of life which are to be found only in cities at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have embarked on a new era in so far as the congested areas are concerned.  I hope that some of the adverse remarks made in regard to the Bill are not really meant to be serious by those who made them and that the Bill, when it becomes law, will have the active co-operation and assistance of every Deputy in the House.  I hope it will have the co-operation of those Deputies who come from the areas concerned in order to make it a success and thus prevent the serious drain on the population from the congested areas to distant lands and to the cities of our own country, a matter which is equally undesirable when examined closely.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the three persons who will be responsible for the successful administration of the Act should take into consideration the importance of ensuring that any industry established in those areas will be established on a permanent and lasting basis.  Any industry established should not be of such a nature that its collapse or failure should in any way reflect on the good motives behind the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies who have spoken so far seem to think that, as soon as this Bill is passed, a crop of factories and industries will spring up over the undeveloped areas.  That is a foolish thought and it is not correct. If this Bill passes into law, Deputies <Col N="377" /> should bear in mind that the Minister is statutorily tied to £2,000,000.  That gives me the impression that the Minister is like a horse which sets out to race and before he starts the race he is already fettered.  The money is supposed to be divided over nine counties. Possibly, other areas may be introduced as well outside those seven counties and part of two others.  If we do a simple sum in arithmetic, we will find that over the seven years this Bill is to go each county will get the princely sum of approximately £31,000 per year.  That would not even cut the foundation for one single factory or industry in each of the counties.</P>
      <P>The Minister's very attitude, not to speak of his words, did not give much hope to the Deputies who were expecting good things from the Bill.  He said that the purpose of the Bill was to establish a board which, in turn, would have power to make grants and give assistance of various kinds to establish certain enterprises or help people who are interested in establishing them.  He pointed out the very real difficulties that lie in the way of these industries. One of them was competition from similar industries in other areas.  The second was the bogey of transport and freightage charges both for raw materials and finished goods.  Both of these are hefty difficulties but they are not insurmountable.  If we are going to make a genuine effort to ensure the successful working of this Bill and try to establish industries in what have been described in the Bill as undeveloped areas, the first thing we must do is to develop the harbours and ports along the western seaboard.  We have some of the finest harbours in Europe from Donegal to Kerry and in Cork also.  We all know that the Port of Dublin has become the bottle-neck for all the commerce of the country.  Córas Iompair Éireann, in its present condition, naturally enough, has to transport all that commerce and trade from Dublin down to the farthest ends of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It happened.  Take the case of lorry traffic.  We have harbours along the western coast which were doing a big and thriving <Col N="378" /> business and handling a vast volume of traffic 20 or 30 years ago.  They have fallen into disuse and, in most cases, the grass is growing on these quays and harbours.</P>
      <P>If we want to make a genuine effort to develop particularly the West the first thing we should do is to try to restore the trade, traffic and commerce that these harbours are capable of handling.  It would need a very small outlay.  Several Deputies have mentioned these harbours and there is no need to go into them in detail.  We have them all along the west coast. Galway Bay handled ocean-going liners before the outbreak of the last war. While I do not advocate building up harbour facilities for ocean-going liners to dock, it should be possible to develop the port to handle normal cargo traffic at least.</P>
      <P>I think that this Bill has met with approval on all sides of the House, but that approval has been qualified and given hesitantly by Deputies.  They do not seem to think that it meets the problem.  Personally, I do not think so either.  I do not think that the Bill is even a good beginning.  I regard it as a plunge in the dark by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;I hope that the Minister will not think I am saying it disparagingly&mdash;is the wrong Minister to handle this problem.  The Minister for Lands or the Parliamentary Secretary, whose office was established here the other day, would be a more proper person to handle this problem and also the other allied problems that face us if we are to give the undeveloped areas what is their due.</P>
      <P>I think that, side by side with this Bill, we should examine another problem that confronts us.  What is it? The very first thing we find is that there is emigration on a terrific scale from the West.  I think that all sides are genuinely anxious to stop that, at least as far as possible.  I do not think it will ever be possible without encroaching on the constitutional rights of the individual completely to stop it, but we should and could go a long way towards ending that heavy volume of emigration, particularly from the western areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> I would like to have seen something in the Bill which would enable the board to make a survey of the resources of the undeveloped areas first. Bear in mind that the undeveloped areas as described by the Bill are not a barren sheet of rock.  They have their resources.  Apart from the industrial development envisaged in the Bill&mdash; because the Bill ties the Minister and the board down to industrial development alone&mdash;we can do a great deal towards putting an end to the flight from the land and to the conditions which are forcing young people particularly to fly from it.  First and foremost we have the very land or ground within these areas.  We have the sea, which gives us fish, and there is also a certain industry in seaweeds that could be very usefully developed.  We definitely have minerals, perhaps not in abundance but minerals that were worked in the past, and the mines in most cases have now fallen into disuse. We have turf and we have electrical development, either by developing our watercourses or, as was mentioned at Question Time to-day, by the development of wind power to help the present network.  I mentioned the harbours. We could develop those harbours, decentralise the commerce of the country and, if possible, establish a coastal trade.  Last, but by no means least, we have tourism.  These are the advantages, the raw materials, we have at our disposal.</P>
    <P>While I certainly give my blessing to the Bill and wish the Minister and the board he will set up under it God speed in its implementation, it falls very short of what I would like to see and even at this late stage I would like to see the Minister withdrawing the Bill in its present form and introducing a fresh one which would embody some of the proposals I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>If we take the land which is the most valuable asset we have in the undeveloped areas, the first thing that must be attended to is rearrangement and the work of the Land Commission. That does not come within the scope of the Bill and the Minister for Lands cannot possibly use the Bill to speed up the work of the Land Commission. Secondly, the reclamation under the <Col N="380" /> Department of Agriculture of certain lands is absolutely essential.  I do not intend to go into details because I do not think I would be strictly within the rules of order and I am afraid I would stand accused of straying from the debate, but seeing that the Bill has primarily been brought into the House for the development of the undeveloped areas I think that as one coming from those areas I might give a few hints and ideas.  As I might claim to be fairly familiar with the problems there it will not perhaps come amiss if I make some suggestions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will take heed of one of the most important industries we have apart from the work of the Land Commission in the rearrangement of holdings and the elimination of congestion in so far as it lies within their power to eliminate it.  This industry which was getting a grip during the period of the inter-Party Government is afforestation.  I hope that Deputies will not take it that I am sounding my own horn when I say that the Parliamentary Secretary in his opening speech a few days ago mentioned the fact that he found a lively interest among the people in these areas in afforestation.  As ex-Minister for Lands may I say that I met with a response in the drive for afforestation in those areas that literally took my breath away because fast as I was inclined to go I found that the people wanted to drive me still faster?  We would be foolish if we disregarded this enthusiasm among the people for an industry that does not need bolstering up or subsidising.  It utilises the land of the area and further it will establish industries and give a healthy, clean form of outdoor work to the men.  It will contribute more to the stabilisation of the population in the Gaeltacht and in the areas prescribed in the Bill than any other industry the Minister can establish.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say that the Minister, being in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce, knows what a pretty huge drain on our resources is the supplying of our needs of timber and of timber and wood products.  In these years I think it has soared into the region of <Col N="381" /> £8,000,000, and while afforestation will not give us timber to go to the sawmills inside 25 years at the very soonest, nevertheless I would say that the Minister in his effort to tackle the problem of the flight from the land in these areas would be well advised to use the land in the development of afforestation along the line I was developing it.  If he tackles the problem it will be money well spent and well invested.  I know that the argument will be put both to the Minister for Lands and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce: why bury money now that will not give a real visible return for 20 or 25 years?  That is true.</P>
    <P>Afforestation is, if you like, sinking money, but it is wrong to say that it does not give a return.  It gives an instantaneous return in the form of employment and the circulation of money in those areas with its corresponding flow into the Treasury in a very short time as a result of the increased purchasing of dutiable goods. I want to impress on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whom I would not expect to be very familiar with the problems at least of the particular areas which he is tackling now, that afforestation is the kingpin of the whole lot.  I do hope that any financial consideration about investing money in such a way that it might not show a visible yield for 20 or 25 years will not influence him.  That is not the proper way to look at it.  If a Government 20, 25, 30 or 40 years ago had established afforestation in this country we would save that £8,000,000 which we pay out annually to countries that do not take 6d. worth from us in return and we would be very thankful to them.</P>
    <P>We would say that at least they were far-sighted in having established them. It is the one way to keep men at home. Views were expressed here that if industrialisation of the congested areas takes place it may have the effect of killing the Gaelic language.  I do not know.  I shall not venture an opinion as to whether it would or not.  It might do the language no good.  We must admit that it does appear that if we are to save the language it is in the rural areas it must be done.  That would appear to be the trend so far, <Col N="382" /> but I am not in a position to speak on that subject.  It does appear that, if the language is to be preserved in the Gaeltacht, it is in the rural areas rather than in the towns or in the vicinity of factories that the language lives best.  That is one added reason why I would impress on the Minister that afforestation is one of the best means of providing employment, utilising the land that does not give much yield at the present time.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of the inter-Party Government I got figures from the Department of Agriculture or some other place.  I recollect that the figures given for sheep population of most of these areas showed that there is one sheep per three and a half acres, taking the valleys and the barren mountain tops.  One sheep per three and a half acres is a poor way to use the land.  Having been only a short time in charge of the forestry division, my opinion is that forestry properly developed in these areas will maintain the same population in the same comfort and prosperity as a similar acreage of the best land that is utilised for agricultural purposes. That is a pretty stiff claim, but if the Minister has a talk with some of the higher officials in the forestry division and reviews what has been done there already he will find that I am not exaggerating by one iota.</P>
    <P>Next comes the question of the deep-sea fisheries.  These are well worth developing.  In my opinion, the way to develop deep-sea fisheries is not by giving boats or this, that or the other.  Secure a steady market and a price for the fish and the sea fisheries will develop.  Then, if the fisheries section of the Department of Agriculture have the boats and the gear ready for the fishermen, it will give good employment.</P>
    <P>In that connection may I say that there was a sea rod industry established during my time?  It had been begun some few years before that but it was only in the early stages.  It was put on a firm foundation during the years 1949 and 1950.  The sea rod industry is capable of further expansion, perhaps not to a much greater extent but at least to some <Col N="383" /> extent.  Experiments were made during my time in connection with what the people who live near the seashore call bladder weed but which is officially known as ascophyllm.  Alginic acid can be produced from it.</P>
    <P>Minerals are well worth investigating and there are minerals all over the west coast from Kerry up to Donegal. The Minister knows as well as I do that industries for which the raw material is available in the locality are certain of success, while industries, the raw material of which has to be brought into the area, may not be so sure of success.  That is why I am stressing the importance of using in the first instance whatever materials are available locally, whether they are in the sea, on the land or under the ground.</P>
    <P>In Connemara there is a very valuable kind of marble.  I do not know a great deal about it, but it seems to have gone the same way as some of our slate quarries in the West.  There are slate quarries in the West which should be opened up and developed properly.  A wrong approach has been made to slate quarries, particularly in Mayo and Galway.  The Killaloe slate quarries seem to have met with greater success, although the quality is no better than the quality of the slates in Mayo and Galway.  I believe that a wrong approach that was made in the past has led to two quarries being abandoned.  One is at Louisburgh and the other is in County Galway, right across from the Mayo border. That matter needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The question of turf production has been a controversial one in this House. Turf production should be and could be developed.  Let me say to the Minister, as I said to him years ago, when he was Minister for Supplies, that the principal way to ensure the development of turf production is to see that turf reaches the consumer in good condition.  That was not the case during the war years, but perhaps there was a good explanation for that.  It might not have been so easy to ensure that turf reached the consumer in good condition.  If the consumer in the city or town got turf of a good quality, as good as every farmer gets it, that is, <Col N="384" /> dry as a bone, that will make a cheerful fire, the people would be glad to take it, and there would not be the clamour that arose in 1946 and 1947, as soon as the war was over, to bring in coal at any cost.  It was not Fianna Fáil or the inter-Party Government, but it was the way in which turf was given to the consumers in the cities and towns during the war years, that was the principal cause of the setback that the industry suffered.  Even at this late stage that difficulty can be overcome. The people down the country will produce the best of turf, and put it on the train or lorry in the best condition. It is not fair to ask consumers in the city to pay for water.  Turf which left the bogs in a dry condition became soaked with water, and if the city consumers had to pay for it, it is no blame to them if they are disgusted at the very mention of the words turf.</P>
    <P>I do not know what can be done on the lines of development of water power for generating electricity in those areas, but I am sure there are still sources that are untapped.  There is one lake near Newport, North Mayo. It is a vast expanse of water and reasonably above sea level.  I do not see why it should not be developed. Perhaps it is that the E.S.B. are engaged in developing greater waterfalls in other parts of the country and have not yet reached it.  The matter is worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary might contribute something useful, particularly to the Gaeltacht areas, by further expansion of the various industries that are already established.  No doubt they are small industries but nevertheless they are very useful and give a nice form of employment and there is a ready market for their products.  There is one near Belmullet which is employing almost 100 hands.  There is one in Crolly, County Donegal, employing 70 to 80 hands constantly.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware of the fact that the toys that they turn out are considered second to none in any market in the world.  The same applies to other industries. I would like to see them developed to a much greater extent.</P>
    <P>I want again to impress on the Tánaiste that, in my opinion, while this <Col N="385" /> Bill provides for the establishment of a board, the board cannot do a great deal.  It gives me the impression that it is a plunge in the dark but in the right direction.  Let us take care, however, that we do not miss the bigger things under our eyes&mdash;that we cannot see the wood for the trees.  The last Government were paying attention to the points I have mentioned.  They were travelling along these lines and developing these things.  These are the right lines on which to go if you want to stabilise the population in those areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the establishment of industries, the Minister's speech rather left me with cold feet with regard to the Bill.  He pointed out the difficulties which would beset the establishment of industries.  As I read the Bill, the board cannot operate or start an industry.  All it can do is purchase land and, if necessary, erect buildings, and then induce industrialists to come in.  I cannot see industrialists taking that bait.</P>

This board which is to be established will be tied hand and foot.  They will only have £30,000 or £31,000 per county for each of the seven years' duration of this Bill.  I believe I am correct in saying that before the sum to be provided can be increased the Minister must come into this House with an amending Bill.  There was great criticism of Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture because he proposed to spend £40,000,000 on the reclamation of land.  In my opinion, to do the thing in a big way like that was the right way to tackle the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot ignore the problem.  I am not familiar with the figures with regard to other counties in the West, but I do know that, from 1936 to 1946, the population of County Mayo fell from 161,000 to 148,000, and by the end of the present year it will have fallen a further 5,000 or 6,000. There will be no need to develop those areas after a while unless the problem of re-establishing the people on the land is dealt with.  I want to point out to the Minister the best way to stabilise the present population there. He will not do it in a month or two months or in a year or two years.  But if he makes a start on these lines, he will be going in the right direction. The utilisation of the raw material we have on the land is the first thing. The second is to give men useful <Col N="387" /> employment and to sink money on a big scale in reproductive work.</P>
      <P>Do not mind the gibes and sneers which have been hurled against Deputy Dillon's reclamation scheme, not alone by the Minister for Lands but by the Taoiseach himself at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.  Any member of the Land Commission will tell you that one acre of land is more valuable in the eyes of the people there than ten acres of the best land in the Midlands.  Whatever arable land is in those areas should be reclaimed.  Do not stultify the director in charge of the land rehabilitation scheme.  Do not spend money on reclamation in order to try and grow cabbage or corn on top of a mountain 1,000 feet high.  There is the afforestation scheme to provide employment there.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to have a good heart-to-heart talk with the forestry officials, who know their job and who will not be induced by any Minister to plant trees where they will not grow.  He should have a talk with them and get the facts and figures with regard to the employment given and the way the plantations are thriving in those areas.</P>
      <P>The one thing I do not like about this Bill is that it does not go far enough.  The Minister will probably gibe at that when he comes to reply. It certainly is ignoring the raw materials which we have here.  It is not taking these into account.  It is not proposed to avail of these.  We can go ahead with this and talk about it from every platform and say that we are going to do great things for the Gaeltacht, but we are ignoring the plight of the people in these areas. We can do all that and yet not do what we set out to do, stop the flight of the people from these areas.  The lines I have pointed out are the right lines to follow.  The Tánaiste may consider the existing machinery good enough, but that is the way to tackle the problem.</P>

I intend to confine my remarks to the actual Bill before us, while noting in passing the interjection of Deputy Corish when he used the words: &ldquo;To Hell or Leinster.&rdquo;  It is perfectly clear that the inter-Party Government could not agree on the development of the undeveloped areas when Deputy Corish uses this opportunity, when the West is batting on a sound wicket, to interject that it is the aim of the Fianna Fáil Government to drive the people out of Leinster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is significant that the title of this Bill, the Undeveloped Areas Bill, has not been seriously questioned.  If the areas are undeveloped then surely <i>ipso facto</i> they should be developed.  This is the first real attempt at the development of industries in the West of Ireland by means of State assistance.  I am not too well versed in the history of this, but I believe this is not the first attempt to give assistance to private enterprise in the West of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hession referred to cynicism; the people who were cynical were those industrialists who used State subsidies during the war for the formation of new industries for the purpose of retaining men in employment.  These were industries they could drop immediately the war finished and revert to their original industry which they could not continue while the war was in progress.  I do not believe there is any other element of cynicism and, <Col N="389" /> while I believe that politicians and everybody else should cease to be cynical about the West of Ireland, I do not agree that there is any element of cynicism in the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The fact that it has been welcomed by the Opposition is sufficient evidence that the Opposition does not regard it as a cynical Bill.  I suppose it is only natural that they should say the Bill does not go far enough.  If it does not go far enough, how far does the Opposition want the Bill to go?  Following that argument to its logical conclusion one will inevitably have to ask, if the Bill should prove a failure, why did it fail?  Will it fail because of the laziness of the people for whose benefit it is designed?  Will it fail because industrialists will refuse to go down to the undeveloped areas and exercise their talents there?  Will it fail because they, even though they are indemnified against loss, will still prefer to make their living and their money in Dublin and its environments in which the vast majorities of our factories are at present situated?  I refuse to believe that will happen.  I refuse to believe that if you indemnify people against loss they will continue to show a prejudice against a particular part of the country.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope this Bill will be a success.  I believe it will be.  I would not like to face the consequences&mdash;and I am not speaking about political consequences but social consequences&mdash;if the Bill should be a failure.  To some extent we are dealing with undeveloped ideas as well as undeveloped areas.  We cannot prophesy with any certainty what will happen.  We cannot go down to the people in the West and tell them that we are giving them the promised land, that they will be spoon-fed and that they will have their El Dorado in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>This is a vast project towards developing these particular areas by using the natural resources in the areas.  This project will involve work stretching beyond the lifetime of many of us here.  It makes a real effort at solving the problem in one of its aspects for the most significant contribution in it is the provision whereby the young men who will be trained for <Col N="390" /> industry will be paid the maximum union wage during their period of training.</P>
    <P>I have not discussed this Bill with very many people but I did hear a good deal of praise for that particular provision. Our young men to-day are attracted by easy money in England. Some of them are attracted by other factors besides easy money and not all the blandishments we can offer them will persuade them not to emigrate. But they are only a percentage and we are not really concerned with them. These young men, when they come to 17 or 18 years of age, naturally go for easy money in England.  They can get it without being skilled.</P>
    <P>In these industries it is obvious that a certain amount of skilled labour will be required.  Our young men will now be offered an opportunity of staying at home and being trained more or less at the expense of the State out of the £2,000,000 provided under this Bill.  I do not agree with Deputy Blowick's division of this £2,000,000.  I do not think it is fair to divide it.  It should be treated as an entity.  It should not be split into 63 different parts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>The Bill has specified a particular sum.  I do not agree there is not a sufficient incentive in the <Col N="391" /> Bill to induce people to assist the State in the same measure as the State is now willing to assist them.  Business at the moment is going to the bad. Business people in the towns are complaining about the activities of travelling shops, but they know very well that is not the real explanation.  They know that the prosperity of the town depends to a large extent on the prosperity of the surrounding countryside. If the two or three sons to whom I have referred can find employment in their local town they will bring back a certain amount of money into their own home and in that way the money will be kept in the area.  It will eventually find its way to the town thereby increasing the volume of business and the profit to be derived from it.  Surely then there is a sufficient incentive to these people to open their purse strings now that they are being indemnified against loss by reason of the fact that they are located in the West of Ireland. Surely they have a sufficient incentive now because trade is not what it used to be during the war years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan took his stand on the basis that private enterprise will not solve the problems of this country. If it does not, I do not know what will, or whether the democratic foundations of the State can remain.  He mentioned also, to the amusement of the House, the establishment of a poteen industry.  I must confess that I have a certain amount of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Cowan on that, although I realise quite well that nothing can possibly ever be done about it.  It is certainly not an industry envisaged by the Bill or one that could be developed with profit.  I do not agree with Deputy Hession that rural electrification is necessary before the objects of the Bill can be adequately implemented.  The important thing about the Bill is that sound provision in that direction is being made for the people, because I think so long as electricity has reached the urban areas, the towns and villages, that will be sufficient for the purposes of the Bill.  It will take many years before the entire <Col N="392" /> country can be covered by a scheme of rural electrification.  If what the Deputy suggested were true, it would be pointless to introduce the Bill at this stage at all.</P>
    <P>The real benefit, in my opinion, which a rural electrification scheme will confer is that it will encourage the young people who are emigrating at the present time to remain at home; it will enable them to make their lives at home a little bit brighter, and their homes a little pleasanter.  If the young people who contemplate emigrating can, as a result of the passing of this Bill, get employment in their nearest town, that surely will be an encouragement to them to remain at home.</P>
    <P>All that, of course, will depend on the people who have money and who are now being given an opportunity under this Bill to release some of it by putting it into circulation through the establishment of local industries. If we can achieve that under the Bill, then there will be no need for people to emigrate.  Of course, you will always have a small percentage who, for reasons of their own, will still emigrate, but I suggest that the vast bulk of the young people will, in the new situation that we envisage, remain at home.</P>
    <P>The big question is whether the people who have the money, and who are now being given an opportunity to invest it in their own country, will show a desire to open their purse strings, and to do their part in making the objects of this Bill a success.  My belief is that those people, if only from selfish motives, will make the money available.  I believe they will have to make it available because, otherwise, the trade in their areas, which is now so much smaller than it was in years gone by, will continue to deteriorate, and their own country and their own lives will deteriorate with it.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which, I think, we should have from the people who will be trained by means of moneys voted under this Bill, and that is a guarantee that they will work in one of the industries established under it, subject, of course, to their being honourable and suitable in every other way.  In <Col N="393" /> that way they will be giving a return to the State.  They should not be given the opportunity of leaving the area to find work elsewhere.  I agree that will mean that, to a certain extent, they are prepared to forgo their natural rights, but it is not too much to expect from them in return for what the State has given to them.  In addition, they would be ensuring that the money voted under the Bill would not have been voted in vain and that full advantage was being derived from the use of it.  I should hope, too, that people in charge of industry who might see an opportunity of locating these qualified persons elsewhere, will not have an opportunity of shifting them off from an area in which they should be giving service in return for the advantages which they had received.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that we from the West will get many chances of speaking on matters concerning this for some time to come.  We have, I think, aired most of our grievances.  We have made a number of appeals.  Perhaps it might not be out of place if I were now to make an appeal to the people in Galway that they should put their shoulders to the wheel.  There is a limit to which you can spoon-feed people.  It may be that the soft money which some of them got in England during the war years has given false ideas to some of our young men in the West of Ireland.  I have made what everybody knows to be a sincere appeal on their behalf already.  Perhaps it might not be out of place if I were now to make the appeal to themselves that they should discard any false ideas which they may hold, such as that this country can be built up overnight, and to forget about the easy money they made in England, a highly industrialised country with a long tradition.  We are a young nation with a short tradition as a separate entity, and we all have something to contribute to it, just as the State itself has.  Therefore I do not think it is out of place, when thanking the Government for introducing this measure, to appeal to the people themselves not to ask to be spoon-fed.  The definition of democracy is supposed to be that condition in which every person has an equal opportunity.  If perhaps for the <Col N="394" /> first time, those people are now being given an equal opportunity with the rest of the nation, I sincerely hope that, as I have promised on their behalf, they will not let the State down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I am very glad indeed that this measure has been introduced.  At the risk of being told that we speak with different voices from this side of the House, I want to say that I do not agree with some of the criticism which has been offered to this Bill.  I think this measure is a step in the right direction.  I am not concerned at the moment as to the motives which inspired the introduction of the Bill.  I do not give a hoot what they were, whether they were political or otherwise. I am concerned with the measure itself, and concerned only with the hope that, when it becomes law, no effort will be spared to see that advantage will be taken of it in full.  I should like also to say that my concern is not that the £2,000,000 is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>I am much more afraid of the fact there would not be enough people to take advantage of the provisions of this Bill and to use up the £2,000,000, even within the seven years.  I am sure the Minister would be a very happy man if he, or whoever may be in his position then, had to came back to this House and look for another £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 within two, three, four or five years.</P>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Blowick wished to be unfair or had any intention of being unfair, but I would say to him that it is not exactly fair to put the expenditure at £31,000 per county. This £2,000,000 is an incentive.  Incidentally I do not agree with Deputy S. Flanagan when he says that it is an indemnity against loss.  I do not think that even the Minister himself would claim that for it, or even attempt to write that into the Bill.  What it is is an incentive to the people of this country who are interested, or who ought to be interested, not merely in helping undeveloped areas, because it is not a matter of helping undeveloped areas alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy meant that.  What we ought to face up to is that this Bill is an effort to bring about a position whereby the inhabitants of undeveloped areas, and particularly those living in congested areas, will get an opportunity of earning a livelihood in their own land.  That is point number one. It is also an effort to bring about a balance in the economic life of the nation.  It is a further move to prevent the City of Dublin from becoming any bigger and from becoming any greater menace than it is at present. If the Minister can get the co-operation from existing and prospective industrialists that he is entitled to get, I think that this measure can do a tremendous amount of good for the country.  I am convinced that there are very valuable incentives contained in this Bill and that a real attempt is being made here to bring about, as far as it is possible to do so, a balance as between the industrialists in the city or large town and the industrialists who will start a project in one of the undeveloped areas.  When I say that, I am not to be taken as agreeing that the Minister has gone the whole way or anything like the whole way.  I think it would be impossible for him to do that at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If every effort is made to work this scheme, and if every advantage is taken of it, I feel it will be found in the working out of it that there are many concessions which can be given which would be of tremendous value.  I appreciate, perhaps as much as anybody in the House, what a difficult problem it is, for instance, to try to bring about an equalisation in freights <Col N="396" /> and other charges as between those who are located at the port of entry for raw materials and those who are located in the big centres of consumption. I do not think that this is a difficulty which is insuperable.  Now that we have, so to speak, a certain amount of the transport of the country in our own hands, as distinct from having it in the hands of private people, I see no reason why the Electricity Supply Board, Córas Iompair Éireann and any other service which it is within the competence of the Minister and of the Government and this House to determine, should not be brought into play so as to help, to the fullest possible extent, thus ensuring that this Bill will be a success when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>One matter of which I might be slightly afraid is that we are concluding, and some Deputies have concluded, that the only undeveloped areas in this country are the ones described in the Bill.  Unfortunately, we have 26 counties, all of which are undeveloped areas in the real sense of the word.  I do not think that any Deputy in this House, be he from Leinster, Munster or that part of Ulster which is left to us, would question the fact that priority must be given to the congested areas.  These are the areas, generally speaking, which are west of the Shannon.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say this to the Minister, but there is no harm in repeating these statements from time to time: where it is not possible to induce, for one reason or another, an industrialist to go into one of the areas contemplated in the Bill, to which the Minister has given priority, another offer, even to the full extent provided in the Bill, ought to be given to him, and he ought to be given a second choice to establish an industry somewhere as far away from Dublin as possible.  I might even say in Cork, at the risk of being attacked by the Cork people in this House.  There are many counties that could be well served by industries.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have found fault with this measure because the board is not to have the power to initiate industries. May I say that I am very glad that they have not?  If this <Col N="397" /> measure can only succeed, and if the Minister and the House can only achieve the object which it has in mind, by a number of factories initiated or worked by the State or by some State-controlled bodies in this country, then we might as well throw our hats at the whole thing.  It has been said by some Deputies in the House that private enterprise will never solve our problems in this country.  I have yet to learn that nationalisation has solved the problems of any other country.  I believe in private enterprise.  I believe that private enterprise should be given the incentives which are sufficient to put it on a competitive basis with those industries which are more fortunately located both in regard to the importation of raw materials and with regard to the distribution of their products to the big centres of consumption.  We will find people who are anxious to get away from the cities.</P>
    <P>I believe it was Deputy Brennan of Donegal who made the point that our people have shown, not merely when they have gone abroad, but even here at home, that, if given a chance, they are able to adapt themselves readily to new processes and that they can pick up technical skill in manufacturing processes at least as quickly as can the workers of any other country.</P>
    <P>We know that is quite true of those who have gone over to America, to Britain or elsewhere and who have gone into industrial work.  During my time in the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;and I am sure the present Minister has been told this more often than I was&mdash;over and over again I was told, not merely by our own native manufacturers but by outsiders who came in to start industries in this country, that they found that Irish workers&mdash;men and women&mdash;picked up the threads of the particular process at least as quickly, if not more quickly, than did those others untrained in Britain or any other country.  On more than one occasion the heads of firms who had come in from outside to start industries here came to the Department of Industry and Commerce to volunteer that information to me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> On that point I ought to add this. I said it before; I think the present Minister has stated it more than once, and Deputy Flanagan and, I think, Deputy Brennan touched on it. Whether industries in this country, located in the undeveloped areas or elsewhere, are going to be successful or not depends in the main, if not almost entirely, on having the requisite skill and knowledge in the factory, both from the administrative point of view and from the operative point of view.  If there were a proper examination or analysis of the industrial position in this country, I think it would be found that, where industries failed, they failed, if not in every case, in the vast majority of cases, because there was not at the head of that industry the necessary technical knowledge, the necessary administrative ability and that efficiency which would be required in this or any other country to make it a success.</P>
    <P>It was not a question of money or of not getting sufficient protection or sufficient urge from the State.  In most cases&mdash;and I think I am right in saying this&mdash;it was because people launched into industry who had very little, if any, knowledge of the particular project on which they were embarking and who had not even the common sense to realise that they had not got that requisite skill and administrative ability which was required to make a success of the industry and try to obtain it from elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister&mdash;and I want to say this more by emphasis than because there is any necessity to tell the Minister what he already knows&mdash;that unless these projects are going to be sponsored by people who themselves have the knowledge of the particular project which they hope to produce or are prepared to obtain that knowledge, that skill, whether it is in the undeveloped areas or elsewhere, the chance of that particular industry surviving will not, in my opinion, be very great.</P>
    <P>I am a bit worried about the board. I can see certain reasons for the Minister's line, that the board must be composed of officers of the State.  I have a very high regard, perhaps as high a regard as anybody in this <Col N="399" /> House, for the higher officers of this State, but I do not think it is fair either to them or to this Bill that the board to operate it has to be composed entirely of officers of the State. I do not know whether I misunderstood the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say entirely. I do not think it should be entirely composed of officers of the State. There must be people who are free of commercial interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I think they must be free of commercial interests, and the Minister knows that that is one of the first difficulties he is going to be up against because the men you might like to get to put on that board, if they have to free themselves completely from commercial interests, will be only going on that board at a very heavy loss to themselves.  On the other hand, I would like equally to see the officers of the State who will be on this board, if at all possible, completely free from the State and from red tape in so far as they can be free from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a project that cannot be approached upon a strictly commercial basis.  If we are talking about having anything in the undeveloped areas on a strictly commercial basis we are simply wasting our time here, and I think we must recognise that.  We must measure this not against the sort of balance sheet that is turned out at the end of the year in pounds, shillings and pence.  Industries could be started here and could cost the taxpayers £2,000,000 or £5,000,000, or even £7,000,000 in seven years and still be an excellent investment, not merely from the point of development but ultimately from the point of view of hard cash.  That is the reason that I would be very concerned if this board were to be composed entirely of officers of the State, who would feel anyway that they had to act in accordance with their life's training within the State, and having regard to all the regulations by which the State is necessarily bound.  However, I am somewhat relieved that the Minister tells us that he does not intend that <Col N="400" /> the board should be composed entirely of officers of the State.  I need hardly say that anything I have said in that connection is not to be and cannot be construed as a reflection in any way whatever upon the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, apparently, seem to think that this measure is to be in substitution for other measures and other activities which are in motion throughout the country, particularly in the undeveloped and, still more particularly, in the congested areas.  I would be very sorry to think that that was so.  I do not think it is so.  It seems to me that there are four major ways in which we can help the undeveloped areas and, as I say, in particular the congested areas.  There is land rehabilitation, afforestation, fishery, and there is this project that we are discussing.  There is no reason in the world why, under those four headings, the work should not be proceeding side by side.</P>
    <P>Let me say on that point also that I do not agree with my colleague, Deputy Blowick, that all those activities should be grouped under one Minister.  Far from it.  Still less, may I say, do I agree with the suggestion that this particular Bill, instead of being sponsored by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, should be sponsored and under the care and protection of the Minister for Lands. If it were introduced by the Department of Lands&mdash;let me deal with the Department in case anyone might think I was referring in any sort of personal way to the Minister in charge&mdash;I might be looking at it in a much different way from the way I am looking at it now.</P>
    <P>May I say that I am not satisfied&mdash; and I do not hold myself forth as an expert; I know, I suppose, as much about this matter as the ordinary man &mdash;that we have up to the present, since the State was founded, made the efforts which we ought to make to improve the land in the congested areas?  I believe far greater efforts could be made.  I believe also that the fact is not grasped by the people of this country, indeed it is not grasped by members of this House, that an additional acre, or the conversion of an acre of land which is at the moment <Col N="401" /> useless, into an arable unit, would make all the difference in the world to the economy of the man living in parts of Mayo and Galway.  It would mean much more to him than ten acres would to many of my constituents in Tipperary or to many farmers living in Meath, Westmeath, Cork or Limerick.</P>
    <P>I suppose that for 28 years I have been talking in this House about afforestation and I am not satisfied that either the Government or the people in the Forestry Department&mdash; for the moment I am not dealing particularly with this Government&mdash;has ever faced up to that question in a really sensible and courageous way.  I do not know whether it is still the view, but I remember being told in this House, year after year for the last 28 or 29 years, that trees could not be grown in the West of Ireland or along the western seaboard and that trees could not be grown above a certain altitude.  Then you go down into the very areas in which you are told trees cannot be grown and you find that in places where some rich Englishman came in, spent money on the land and planted proper trees, there are acres under woods.  There is no question in the world about it; it can be done.</P>
    <P>I know my views will be countered by Deputies and by experts in forestry. I do not claim to be an expert on forestry though, perhaps, I did more work in woods and with timber than most Deputies and perhaps more work than some of the fellows in the Forestry Department, and I know a good deal about it.  I may be told that it is a question of climate and so on. I have not been very often on the Continent but I was there once or twice and I saw trees growing there on mountains, right up to where they met the snow, almost growing out of rock and in a climate, taking one thing with another, that was not so free from extremes as our climate is.  I agree with Deputy Blowick that afforestation, tackled in a courageous way in the congested areas and along the western seaboard, could be one of the most valuable contributions we could make towards providing a decent living for the people there and towards helping to keep them there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> So far as fishing is concerned, I know absolutely nothing whatever about sea fishing and almost next to nothing about inland fishing.  I know something, however, about inland fishing, because I have knocked about a little for the last few years and I have talked with people who devoted their lives to fishing.  I have seen a number of people, both our own people and people from outside, who spent most of their time in salmon and trout fishing and even in coarse fishing.  I have some idea of the amount of money spent on fishing and of the amount of employment given by these people.  It could be increased enormously but, even as it is, it is very considerable, notwithstanding the fact that our fisheries, having regard to their financial value, are the most neglected probably in Europe.  I say nothing about sea fishing as I know nothing about it, but I say that these two, taken in conjunction with this Bill, would go a long way towards remedying a position that has been allowed to continue for far too long.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to tell me that this Bill is not going to solve all the problems.  I know it is not, and I venture to say the Minister knows that also, but I believe it is a good start. I believe that it goes as far as we can go, at present anyway, to provide inducements to those who are contemplating starting industries in this country to get away from the cities. I am satisfied that if an effort is made to utilise the incentives provided in this Bill for the purpose of starting industries and if those who will be connected with these projects show that they are really in earnest, and if there are any further incentives within reason which they require, this House will be prepared to give them.  Somebody talked about spoon-feeding.  A good deal of spoon-feeding has been done in this country but it must be always remembered that it was not done, if ever it was done, for the sake of the people into whose mouths the spoon was put.  It was done for other purposes and for other reasons.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is fortunate in two respects in introducing this Bill.  I think he is fortunate in the time <Col N="403" /> chosen to introduce it.  Notwithstanding all the talk we hear about the financial situation, both internal and external, I think he is fortunate because Irish industry, as we know it in this country at the moment, is, as I said on a former occasion, perhaps more firmly rooted and deeply respected than it has been at any time in the past.  I have said over and over again in the last three or four years that we are importing millions of pounds' worth of goods every year which could be, and should be, manufactured in this country.  I see no reason why they cannot be manufactured here.  I want to go further and say something with which perhaps some Deputies may not agree, and other people may try to twist.  If the Minister finds that, for any reason you like, Irish industrialists, with the skill and the knowledge they have acquired, are unable or unwilling to take advantage of this Bill, then the Minister, if necessary, should go outside this country and should get people who have the necessary knowledge and skill and who are prepared to come in here and produce with Irish labour the articles which we now have to import and which are produced abroad by foreign labour.  I am saying that although I know some people will misunderstand it and others will be glad to misrepresent it.  These are my views for what they are worth.</P>
    <P>The second ground on which the Minister is fortunate in the introduction of this Bill and in his effort to make it a success is that all sides of the House welcome it, all sides approve of it and all sides wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire at the outset to congratulate the Minister on having introduced this Bill and upon his speech in introducing it.  If I may as an Independent Deputy be permitted to do so, I should like also to compliment Deputy Morrissey on the very enlightened and sensible speech which he has made and on his very sensible approach to the Bill.  There were Deputies in this House who condemned the Minister's speech as being too realistic.  I do not think that any man with the knowledge and general <Col N="404" /> experience of industrial development which the Minister has would come in here and make a flamboyant speech indicating that with the passage of this Bill factories would spring up all over the undeveloped areas in this country. Everybody knows that that is not going to happen.  Everybody knows that the fight to establish industries in areas where they have not been established is going to be an uphill fight.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the object of the Bill is to offset the natural disadvantages and the natural hazards that exist and that have prevented industrial development in so many areas in the country.  Some people say that this Bill is purely a political Bill but I think very few Deputies share that view.  When he was introducing the Bill the Minister made it clear that this is a logical development of the legislative and administrative efforts which were made to distribute industries fairly through the country and particularly in areas which suffer from economic disadvantages. All that the Bill seeks is to give to the potential manufacturer some advantages which will offset the disadvantages of being, perhaps, far from the biggest centre of consumption and far perhaps from some essential raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steps outlined in the Bill appear to be those best calculated to achieve the results which the Minister has in view.  We all know that over the past 20 years industrial centres have grown up simply because there were buildings in the areas in which they grew up, plus a certain amount of development in those areas which was conducive to the establishment of manufacturing industries there.  About 20 years ago I visited Newbridge, in County Kildare, and the town seemed to me then to be like a ghost town.  There were huge buildings there which had been evacuated by the British Army. I suppose that there were sewerage and water schemes there too, but certainly there were very substantial buildings there.  As a result of these substantial buildings being there a group of thriving industries sprang up in that town.  It seems to me that if the Government, through this Bill, were to provide some of the fundamentals in the way of building and <Col N="405" /> development in certain undeveloped areas the same results would follow as followed in the case of Newbridge.</P>
    <P>I think that the Bill is sound.  It does not guarantee or seek to guarantee to the newly developed industries any immunity from competition or any security against losses incurred, perhaps, through inefficiency or through any adverse circumstances that might arise in the future.  No Government can set out to shelter and protect any industry in this country from any other industry which may be established within the country.  The most that a native Government can do is to seek to protect the manufacturer producing in this country from unfair opposition or competition from outside this country.  If we were to carry protection a step further, as some people suggest, I think we should be heading for chaos and that we would put an end to industrial development in this country.</P>
    <P>There was a striking contrast between the approach of the Tánaiste to this matter and that of Deputy MacBride.  I think that Deputy MacBride outlined clearer than any other Deputy the airy, frothy and insubstantial approach to industrial development which has done quite a lot of harm in this country in the past. Deputy MacBride said he did not approve of the manner in which the situation was being dealt with in this Bill.  He said that instead of seeking to encourage private enterprise in the undeveloped areas by giving the potential manufacturers some initial help we should approach this matter in an entirely different way.  He outlined his ideas on how the problem should be faced.</P>
    <P>He set out under three headings the steps which he considered should be taken.  First of all, he said that we should have a thorough and comprehensive survey of the whole problem. Do we not all know where that suggestion would lead us to?  A thorough and comprehensive survey of the industrial problems of this country is the work of a lifetime or, perhaps, of two lifetimes, because so many aspects have to be taken into consideration. Conditions change so <Col N="406" /> rapidly from year to year that a body investigating this matter would have security of tenure for many years. Deputy MacBride's second point was that, having discovered what industries ought to be established, he would go a step further and decide where to locate them.  I think that here, again, he would come up against a very difficult problem.  Having notified all and sundry to apply to have the proposed industry located in their particular area, he would have an immensely difficult problem in choosing between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the second big step which Deputy MacBride suggested we should take was that we should find out where we should locate these industries.  He laid down that, first of all, we should decide what industries were required, then where they should be put and then the Government should undertake to establish those industries.  He followed that by saying that, having established them and having got them going, we should sell those industries to private enterprise at a later stage. I think that whole approach is completely wrong.  The difference between the Minister's approach and that of Deputy MacBride is the difference between the approach of a practical businessman and the approach of a man of theory.  Along the lines that Deputy MacBride suggested, I believe that no progress whatever would be made.  It is all right to have a survey of the areas, but you can carry on that survey even while this good work under the Bill is going forward.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes a call and gives an incentive to the independent individual, the man who has saved some money, to put his money into an industry and to chance it as a backing for his enterprise, his wisdom and his skill.  This House must make it clear beyond all question that it stands for the promotion and the protection of private enterprise.</P>

      <P>He expressed the view that there was nothing in America superior to that particular industry in the skill of the workers or the up-to-date machinery employed.  Before the interruptions, I was indicating the vast difference between the approach of a realistic, practical mind and the approach suggested by Deputy MacBride.  I am not saying that in any unfair way to Deputy MacBride, as I think he was endeavouring to be as constructive as possible.  He was endeavouring to suggest&mdash;as it is right for an Opposition Deputy to suggest&mdash; something better than this Bill, but I feel that he did not suggest something better, but something infinitely worse. If the board constituted under this Bill were to go to any undeveloped area and establish an industry there, that industry inevitably would remain in Government hands for all time.  The nett result would be that the taxpayers would be milked to keep that industry going, and perhaps to cut out other industries established by private enterprise.  We have seen what happened in regard to the Irish News Agency.  There you have the taxpayers' money used to cut out independent enterprise.  The same thing would happen if the State were to establish industries in the West of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> We know that under the Department of Industry and Commerce we have a number of State-owned monopolies which are of vast importance to the nation.  We have the Electricity Supply Board, which provides for the generation and distribution of electricity; we have Bord na Móna; and we have the Forestry Department.  These big governmental enterprises are all fulfilling the fundamental needs of the community.  I would like to see a real attempt made to co-ordinate the work of those State-owned enterprises with the development of privately-owned industries in undeveloped areas.  For example, the work of the Forestry Department could be made to fit in with the establishment of many privately-owned manufacturing industries depending on timber and its bye-products as a raw material.  It might be necessary for the Forestry Department to take a step forward, to ensure additional planting, perhaps not always of a very high type of commercial timber but of a type which would provide the raw materials required by an industry&mdash;as is the case in Athy, where hardboard or wallboard is produced from timber.</P>
    <P>Again, the fishing industry must be assisted by the State, but it could be fitted in with the development of auxiliary industries for the processing, canning and preservation of fish.  In the same way, the effort which the State makes through various Departments to reap the harvest of the seas in regard to seaweed and products of that kind, could be fitted in with the development of manufacturing industries.  Thus, while on the one hand we endeavour by every possible means to push forward the work which is being done through State enterprise in the fields in which the State can operate, on the other hand we should encourage private enterprise and leave to private enterprise the fields which it can best develop.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna in its efforts to revive a native produced fuel could also help in the establishment of industries which are turf-fired and perhaps it could help further by extending into some of the undeveloped areas generating plant for the production of electricity, <Col N="409" /> I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Inasmuch as the only request which is contained in this motion is that a Select Committee should be appointed to examine the desirability of abolishing capital punishment, I do not think it is necessary to go into all the factors that make the abolition of capital punishment desirable.  Since this motion was moved, I have received a number of letters from different persons and organisations expressing interest in the question and there is one letter I received from Senator Douglas from which I should like to quote, as it deals with a certain historical aspect in regard to capital punishment in this State.  In his letter, Senator Douglas says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It has always been a matter of great regret to me that it was not abolished in 1922.  The Draft Constitution submitted to the Provisional Government and signed by Hugh Kennedy, C. J. France and myself included a provision that the penalty of death shall not be attached to any offence.  I discussed the question with Michael Collins and he said that he would endeavour to get the Provisional Government to accept the abolition of capital punishment.  He told me that he was opposed to the death penalty for treason and that he had an open mind as to whether or not it should be imposed for murder.  He said that abolition was worth a trial and expressed the view that it might be a <Col N="410" /> very good thing if for the first few years at least we had no executions in Ireland.  The Draft Constitutions submitted by the first Constitutional Committee were never published but I still have my copies.</P>
    <P>In 1923 the late Senator Duffy and I tried, without success, to have the death penalty removed when the Public Safety Bill was before the Seanad.  In 1925 an amendment was moved by Senator Haughton and supported by me to the Treasonable Offences Bill which, if it had been passed, would have removed the death penalty for treason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thought that the passage from that letter dealing with the original intentions of the framers of the 1922 Constitution was of some historical interest.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, I was unable to give the House the full list of the countries where capital punishment had been abolished and I should like to remedy that position now by giving the list as complete as I have it.  In Holland, capital punishment was abolished in 1870 and no executions had taken place for 10 years before; in Belgium, there were no executions since 1863; in Norway, there were no executions since 1876, and capital punishment, as such, was abolished in 1905; in Denmark, there were no executions since 1892 and capital punishment was formally abolished in 1930; in Sweden, there were no executions since 1910, and, in 1921, capital punishment was abolished; in Italy, capital punishment was first abolished in 1889 and reintroduced in 1926 for political or semi-political offences and, in 1931, extended to bring in the more serious cases of homicide: it was again abolished, and is abolished now, in 1948; in Finland, there were no executions since 1826 and capital punishment was formally abolished in 1949; in Portugal, there have been no executions since 1867.  I think I indicated on the last occasion the American States in which capital punishment was done away with and I need not go over the large number of central and South American countries which have done away with capital punishment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> It does seem to be a strong argument in favour of the examination of the whole position that such a large number of countries throughout the world have found that capital punishment is not necessary or essential.  On the last occasion on which this motion was before the House, I suggested that it should be whether or not it was essential for the preservation of society to enforce the death penalty. In these countries, apparently, it has been found that it was not necessary for the preservation of society, save probably in exceptional times, such as wartime, to take life by way of punishment.  I would submit to the House that circumstances as they exist in Ireland to-day do not indicate that there is any need for capital punishment in order to preserve society.</P>
    <P>Very briefly, I should like to go over quickly the arguments that are adduced in favour of capital punishment. There is, first of all, the old doctrine of vengeance.  I imagine that few in this House will suggest that vengeance is a sound reason for the taking away of human life.  While that is so, I have often noticed in discussions of this question that the most charitable and kindly people will frequently get away from the general question of principle involved, and, pointing to a particularly horrifying murder case, say: &ldquo;Do you not think that at least in that case it was right to inflict the maximum punishment on so and so?&rdquo;  I know that those who put forward that argument are very kindly, good-hearted people, good Christians, but nevertheless that line of argument is not very far removed from the concept of vengeance.  In other words, one is horrified by a particular deed which is surrounded by circumstances which make it particularly repellent, and one's tendency is to seek vengeance&mdash;in other words, retribution&mdash;for a particularly ghastly deed.  We have got to get away from that basis of approach, and should try to consider the issues on a much higher plane.</P>
    <P>Another argument which is put forward is the necessity or the value of capital punishment as a reformative agent.  There is very little reality in <Col N="412" /> that line of argument.  A man whose neck has been broken at the end of a hangman's rope is beyond reform. Another argument is that capital punishment is necessary as a deterrent. That argument, I think, does not bear very close examination.  For instance, over 200 people a year are killed on our roads by motor cars.  Probably a large percentage of those are killed by people who have had too much to drink.  We all deplore that, and we are all horrified by the fact that 200 lives a year are lost on the roads by carelessness, criminal negligence or drunkenness.  Yet, would we suggest that we should impose capital punishment in these cases as a deterrent? To be logical, there might be much more force and reason in saying that in order to protect the lives of the 200 people who are killed every year on the roads, we should impose capital punishment on any motorist who kills anybody else on the roads while under the influence of drink.  There might be much more force and logic in that line of argument.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much more I can add.  I hope we will have an opportunity, if the House agrees to this motion, of discussing the whole question much more fully at a later date.  I, therefore, have great pleasure in proposing this motion.</P>

      <P>I intend to be very brief on this motion.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal before the House because the view expressed by Deputy MacBride is one which I held very strongly at one time.  It is one which I advocated in this House but I must confess that my views on this matter have been somewhat shaken in recent years.  I have some doubts as to the wisdom of the complete abolition of capital punishment to-day.  I was particularly struck by the fact that in Great Britain capital punishment was abolished some years ago and was almost immediately reintroduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know by whom but I think there was a fairly strong <Col N="413" /> public opinion in favour of the reintroduction of the death penalty.  I agree with Deputy MacBride that the idea of vengeance or of punishment as a motive for capital punishment may be ruled out completely.  The only one justification for the imposition of the death penalty is that it might possibly be an effective deterrent.  I think it is only on that ground that capital punishment may be justified, if it is to be justified at all.</P>
      <P>I also agree&mdash;it is a reasonable point to make in support of the abolition of the death penalty&mdash;that there is always the possibility and the danger of a miscarriage of justice which, when the death penalty is carried through, cannot be rectified.  We all know that there is a terrible danger involved in the imposition of capital punishment. It is very hard to reply on human judgment, on human memory or upon evidence based either upon the memory of a witness or upon the powers of identification of a prisoner.  Mistakes can be made and the utmost care must be taken to ensure that a terrible miscarriage of justice would not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree on all these points with Deputy MacBride, one point in connection with the abolition of the death penalty has worried me.  That is, would not the removal of that dire penalty give an undue encouragement to the ordinary lesser criminal, who might be engaged in the commission of a felony such as housebreaking, burglary and offences of that kind, to take a step further and eliminate any person who might surprise him in the act of committing a crime?  If a housebreaker, for example, is caught after breaking into a house by a night watchman or some citizen passing by, he knows that, if he is brought to justice, he will get a sentence of penal servitude. If he eliminates, by murder, the person who surprises him, whether that person be a Guard or a law-abiding citizen, he can escape that penalty. Under the present system, he will hesitate to eliminate the witness or the Guard because he realises that by so doing he puts his own life in jeopardy. I think that was the consideration which influenced a great many people in Britain to be seriously worried about the complete abolition of the death <Col N="414" /> penalty.  They felt that by abolishing it completely they would be exposing the officers of the law to more grave perils than they at present encounter.</P>
    <P>It is true that the person who has committed murder may possibly, in order to evade arrest, commit a further murder by attacking the Guards or any citizen who come to arrest him for his crime.  But the number of these is limited compared with the number of lesser criminals who engage habitually in crime such as robbery and housebreaking. The danger I see in the abolition of the death penalty is that you convert&mdash;or should I say pervert&mdash; a large number of the lesser criminals, burglars, housebreakers and criminals of that kind into murderers when you remove the danger of execution.</P>
    <P>I think that that is the most serious consideration which I would submit to the proposer of the motion.  He may be able to suggest some way out of the difficulty.  My theory would be that instead of the complete abolition of the death penalty we should aim at its gradual elimination by enforcing it only on very rare occasions.</P>
    <P>There is an argument in favour of the abolition of the death penalty which I overlooked, and that is that sometimes a jury may acquit a prisoner the more readily when they feel that he is liable to be executed.  When they have even the slightest doubts or not even that, but when there are some extenuating circumstances, they will acquit, whereas if the prisoner before the court is not in danger of execution he is more likely to be convicted.  That is perhaps one of the arguments which may be advanced in support of this motion.  I am trying to look at this as fairly as I can.  The effects of the removal of the threat of capital punishment may be offset by greater efficiency in the enforcement of the law, as witnesses will be more inclined to come forward and give evidence, and juries will be more inclined to convict, when they know that the prisoner will not suffer death.</P>
    <P>There are strong arguments for this motion, but I am unable to convince myself that there is an effective answer to the argument which I have put up that the abolition of the death penalty <Col N="415" /> might in effect bring about the imposition of the death penalty on those who are charged with the enforcement of the law in a large number of cases, and that is a matter that must be considered.</P>
    <P>If the death penalty is to continue I feel that certain reforms are urgently necessary.  Trial by jury must, of course, be preserved.  It is essential to a fair trial, but I feel that there should be a court of appeal equal from the prisoner's point of view to the court which tries him.  There should be a higher central criminal court composed, perhaps, of a jury and two or three judges, who will review the whole case.  From every point of view I would suggest as a reform that that court should have power to retry the case.  The question then would arise of who should impose the penalty.  In order to safeguard the prisoner no prisoner should suffer the death penalty unless he has been convicted by the Central Criminal Court and by this higher court.  In all cases he should have this double trial as a safeguard against the possibility of error.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say that, in order to protect the public from the wrongdoer, not only should the prisoner have the right to appeal to the higher court but the prosecution also. There are many cases where people who are obviously guilty are acquitted by the jury and they cannot be retried. I know that I may be going against all legal procedure in this matter.</P>

I was one of those who, with Deputy Donnellan, sponsored a motion for the reform of our prison treatment. I got a lot of abuse from the Fine Gael Party, particularly from the legal lights in the Fine Gael Party, for taking that stand, but I do not regret it.  We should be strictly just to the criminal, to the law-breaker and to the person who, while he may not be either a criminal or a law-breaker, happens to be caught within the toils of the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I approach the discussion on this motion with the mind, not of a lawyer who is more or less used to the idea of people being tried for their lives, but rather of the ordinary layman who is appalled at the thought of any unhappy human being having to go at the dawn of some morning to meet his doom at the end of a hempen rope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this motion has a great deal in it which should commend it to the House.  The mover, Deputy MacBride, outlined the very large number of eventualities wherein it is quite possible that, through some error which may occur during the trial of a <Col N="417" /> person charged with a capital offence somebody may be hanged, executed, in the wrong.  To my mind, that argument alone is sufficient justification for this House to vote, unanimously to agree, that the whole question of capital punishment should be examined with a view to seeing if it can be entirely abolished.  I believe it should be abolished.  If one accepts the idea that mankind has been progressing over the centuries, and will progress in the centuries to come, towards a higher civilisation, one must also accept the idea that the old jungle law and principle of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is one which we must reject.</P>
    <P>The picture which one can call to mind of a person who is brought to trial and found guilty of murder and who must await the day that he or she knows will surely come when, without any chance of reprieve, he or she will go to meet the Creator is so terrible that it must cause every thinking person to question whether society is justified in taking human life no matter what the reason may be.</P>
    <P>The mover of the motion has referred to many aspects of the various arguments for and against capital punishment.  This Dáil is peculiarly well qualified to discuss this matter, because we have, on the one hand, a large number of Deputies whose daily occupation is the defence of persons who are brought to court, sometimes on capital charges, and, on the other hand, there is quite a respectable number of Deputies who at some time or other of their political career have had the death sentence hanging over them. In the light of those facts the Dáil is peculiarly well qualified to discuss the motion.</P>
    <P>The ordinary person who reads in the daily paper that some unfortunate man or woman has been found guilty of murder and has been sentenced to death, while perhaps momentarily inclined to be indignant, having read the details of the crime&mdash;and some crimes can be brutal and some crimes cause public indignation&mdash;thinks of the awful punishment which is about to be inflicted upon that person.  There is a growing feeling amongst the public that the person who takes human life <Col N="418" /> is not a normal person, and cannot be said to be normal at the time he committed that awful act.  Some persons may say that premeditated murder is the act of an average or sane individual. I would never subscribe to that belief.  I could never accept it nor do I believe that any thinking person would accept the proposition that the average individual in society, no matter in what country he may live, will in his sane, sober senses calmly plan to take the life of another.  That is not a normal act.  Therefore there should be consideration of the punishment to be meted out to a person found guilty of such a crime.</P>
    <P>We often hear, when murder trials are under discussion, mention of the name of this or that hangman, but is it not true that, on the awful morning when a man goes to his execution, society is the hangman?  The entire population of the country takes part, as it were, in spirit, indirectly, in that execution.  It is an unnatural thing, an unchristian, an inhuman thing, in my view, to take life in any circumstances other than those outlined by the mover of the motion, where society may be definitely threatened if life is not taken, or where a principle such as national principle may be involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any substance in the reasons which have been adduced here by Deputy Cogan for his opposition to this motion.  I do not think that the petty criminal would be encouraged to commit greater crimes if there were no death penalty.  Does anybody suggest that a person who is about to commit a murder ever thinks of the possible result of his action? Does anybody consider that a murderer, before he commits that awful crime, gives any thought whatever to the possibility of his own life being taken?  I cannot see that that could occur.  I do not believe it does occur. The argument that capital punishment is a deterrent is absolutely unreal and without foundation in fact.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Dáil would be doing a good day's work if it decided to set up the committee asked for in the motion.  The motion is a modest one.  It does not propose that there should be immediately complete <Col N="419" /> and revolutionary change in the law so far as convicted murderers are concerned. It asks that a select committee of the House should be set up with a view to discovering what steps ought to be taken to bring about the abolition of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the list of countries read by Deputy MacBride which have abolished capital punishment, not to-day or yesterday but many years ago.  It is notable that at least some of them, in fact, the majority of them, are amongst the most cultured and most progressive countries in the world.  It may also be said that they have the supreme quality of having a Christian outlook on this important matter.</P>
    <P>Literature and history abound with testimony to the cruelty of taking human life.  Anyone who has ever dwelt inside the walls of a prison, in this country or elsewhere, and who has had the misfortune to be there when some person was being brought to the gallows knows the awful dread that pervades such a place when such a thing is happening.</P>
    <P>That is not new.  Oscar Wilde, in the &ldquo;Ballad of Reading Jail&rdquo;, gives a graphic description of the terror that permeates the mind of every individual, no matter how low a criminal he may be, who is in a prison on such a morning.  It is degrading to think of a person being brought to his doom to expiate a crime which he perhaps committed in a fit of anger, a crime which he committed, perhaps, when in a condition of abnormality.  That should be remembered by every one of us when considering how we shall vote on this motion.</P>
    <P>I feel that the people of this country and the Deputies on all sides of the House are as humanitarian as people in any part of the globe.  I feel that they would be as anxious to preserve the principles of justice as the people of any nation.  I think justice can be preserved and society can be preserved and the spirit of justice can be improved by the abolition of capital punishment.  I consider that it serves no purpose as a deterrent to crime and <Col N="420" /> that the day upon which it is abolished will be a good day, because it is lowering and degrading and has little to commend it, except, as I said, the doctrine referred to by Deputy MacBride, the doctrine of vengeance. I commend this motion to the House and I hope it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride should rest on his motion and not be vexed because I am taking a completely different line.  In fact, the one thing that I have taken a very strong pledge to do since we reassembled is to endeavour to avoid being in conflict with Deputy MacBride.  I ask Deputy MacBride to respond to that Christian spirit.  I am only suggesting, as a matter of tactics, that we might have considered the matter by way of a Bill.  What I am worried about is this: are we sufficiently civilised to agree to the abolition of capital punishment? That is really the point.  If we have reached a certain stage of civilisation, then capital punishment should be abolished.  Have we reached a stage where we all live within the law, within the Constitution?  That is a stage of civilisation.  If we have reached it, then we can abolish capital punishment. If we have not reached it, can the State deprive itself of that power that it may need to maintain the law and the Constitution?  I want to put forward that particular point of view. I want Deputy MacBride to correct me <Col N="421" /> if I am wrong, but I gather from the opening part of this motion that he was not in favour of the abolition of capital punishment&mdash;that he thought capital punishment might be maintained in the case of treason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think that.  I pointed out that it was a matter which could be discussed separately. My own view is that I would do away with capital punishment, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that, because I got the impression that capital punishment may be abolished except in cases of treason.  That, of course, is the great trouble, because the number of executions we have had in this country for crimes outside of what one might term treason or political offences have been very few.  We have not had so many of them over a period of 25 years.  There have been quite a number of executions in cases where the charge was, although it may not have been expressed in the same words, treason or opposition to the State.  I think that if any type of capital punishment ought to be abolished that is the type that should be abolished, provided, as I say, we have reached the stage of civilisation that we can deal with all matters in a lawful way within the limits of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a discussion on capital punishment we can always consider the type of person who is guilty of serious murder surrounded by revolting circumstances. I do not think that is the particular type of murder in which the death penalty should be imposed, because, obviously, in that type of case there is some mental derangement, there is something wrong mentally.  If there is something wrong mentally, then it is wrong that the person concerned should be executed.  But there is another type of criminal, the crafty type of criminal, the poisoner who over a long period will give to some person that he or she is determined to do away with small grains or drops of poison day after day or week after week, something of the Seddon type. There is only one way of dealing with a person of that kind and that is to <Col N="422" /> treat that person the way you treat a mad dog.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that whatever one may say about the motion in general terms nobody could say that it would be right that that person should not be properly punished.  One may say why not put that person in prison, lock him up and leave him there for the rest of his life.  That might be one way of dealing with it. I do not agree that it is the right way. I think that in dealing with that particular type of person it is necessary that there should be a punishment <Col N="423" /> which will make that person afraid. The poisoner hopes to escape punishment and there is a danger that many more people might endeavour to poison if the penalty were simply to lock them up in prison for a period of years.</P>
    <P>Imprisonment has now very little terrors.  Conditions in our prisons are improving day after day.  Prisoners may smoke.  They may have their radios.  They may have their newspapers.

      <P>A good number of them.  There are people who believe that capital punishment ought to be abolished.  They believe it is wrong. They believe it is unchristian to execute a person.  I do not think that is right.  I seem to remember that Joan of Arc was executed by Princes of the Church.  It was not unchristian then, so that executions are not an unchristian method of dealing with a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What really does happen here or in England?  I am not so much concerned with what happens in America, because there they have a different standard altogether: there they keep people in gaol for years and execute them after that.  Here, or in England, before a person can be executed&mdash;that is when they are tried by process of law and not in a back room without their being present&mdash;in our courts they are entitled to be defended in the first instance by counsel provided by the State.  It is the only case in which the State does provide counsel.  That person must be tried by 12 of his fellow-countrymen, not lawyers, but ordinary persons, who hear the evidence, observe the demeanour of the witnesses, hear the arguments for the prosecution and the defence, and the summing-up of the judge.  After that they retire to decide on that evidence whether or not a person is guilty.  They cannot decide that by a majority.  Every one of the 12 must himself be of the opinion that the accused is guilty on the evidence, and <Col N="424" /> the 12 must bring in a verdict that he is so guilty.  That is the first step.</P>
    <P>Secondly, when the 12 come to that decision the accused has then the right of appeal, which is generally exercised in capital cases, to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  If that appeal is dismissed there is the right of petition to the Minister for Justice, to the President through the Government, on which all the relevant evidence concerning the medical condition of the accused and the medical history of his family comes under consideration, and where our Minister for Justice and our President&mdash;people like ourselves&mdash;have a dreadful responsibility cast upon them for the time being.  They consider all the aspects.  Eventually they say &ldquo;the law must take its course.&rdquo; Therefore, in the case in which capital punishment is the penalty every possible opportunity is given to the accused person under the law and the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that.  I am aware of some of them myself.  There have been miscarriages of justice.  If every person does his duty in the way in which it should be done there ought to be no miscarriages of justice.  To find an accused person guilty before a jury is very difficult but I do admit that some judges, both here and in England, have been responsible for miscarriages of justice.  I say some of the judges; they took a line entirely contrary to the one they should have taken as impartial judges established under the law for a particular purpose. Fortunately the number of cases is very small.</P>
      <P>As I was pointing out, all these precautions are taken and when, in the last analysis, a person has to pay the extreme penalty it is merely a matter of society protecting itself against one of its own members who has acted contrary to its best interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for us to talk about the taking of life, but there have been cases in this country and in England where the most dreadful atrecities have <Col N="425" /> been perpetrated by individuals, where children particularly have been mutilated, ravaged and destroyed.  We cannot overlook, or we ought not to overlook, these things.</P>

When people assume the power to deprive citizens of their lives, not within the law, then I think the law and society must be in a position to protect themselves against that.  If that situation does not exist, then we are a civilised community, and as a civilised community we can probably do without the death penalty.</P>

      <P>Most of the arguments that have been made in the last few speeches could, in my opinion, be more fittingly put before this commission of inquiry if it were set up.  What is before us is the setting up of a commission of inquiry to consider this matter and make recommendations to the Dáil as to whether the death penalty should be abolished or whether it should not.</P>
      <P>This commission of inquiry, if set up, will find out, amongst other things, whether we have reached that stage of civilisation or not.  I do not know whether it will be qualified to judge of that, but let us hope that the commission, if set up, will be of such standing and quality that it will be able to give a decision on that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> Commissions of inquiry have been held in many countries on this very important subject.  There is much information available relating to it in our own library.  Commissions of inquiry have been held in Britain in recent years.  The information they have gathered together on the subject is available.  I would say that the number of people who have made a study of such information as is available is very small.</P>
    <P>The object of this motion is to have an inquiry into the subject.  I think it would be wise to have the inquiry, so that at least in our time this question could be settled one way or the other. For that reason I am in favour of the setting up of the inquiry.  I am not going to go into the question of whether I am in favour of the abolition of capital punishment or not.  If I were a member of the commission, or if I were giving evidence before it which, as a citizen, I suppose I would be entitled to do, I could express some views which I have on capital punishment. Let me say here and now that I do not regard capital punishment at all in the spirit that it is punishment. I think it is the most humane system known to mankind.  As I say, I would rather not go into that now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan referred to the case of the poisoner.  Over a long period, designedly and with intent, the poisoner sees his victim writhing in pain and agony.  He will not send for a doctor and he conceals the fact that he knows what is wrong.  He is convicted and, if capital punishment were abolished, he would be imprisoned for life.  I think that the harshest punishment that can be imposed on a human being is imprisonment for life.  I ask Deputies to look at the other angle of it.  A person is condemned to death. He gets a fair trial.  First of all, there is a trial before a judge and a jury; there may be a second trial by way of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and what we may describe as a third trial takes place before the Supreme Court.  We have all known of cases in which three trials have taken place.  Yet he is convicted. According to Deputy Cogan, he would execute that fellow once three courts had agreed that he should die.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> After his conviction, he is given the unique opportunity of making his peace with God and of preparing himself for death on a particular day and at a particular moment, unless God calls him before the day of execution.  He knows what none of us knows, the exact second that he will have to stand before his God in judgment.  He gets every opportunity to prepare for his last end.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, his victim was sent before his Maker without a second's notice, while a person, who has been poisoned, is left writhing in pain for so long that the mental faculties are so impaired as to give that person little time to prepare to meet God.  The culprit, in the case of judicial hanging, gets, as I say, the unique opportunity of preparing for the moment he is to die.  His victim did not get that opportunity.</P>
    <P>If we were debating here the question as to whether or not capital punishment should be abolished, then the arguments one way or the other could be more positive.  This is not a motion to abolish capital punishment, but rather to set up a Select committee to make an inquiry and report to the Dáil.  On the question of capital punishment, I think that any Government in office in this or any other country will have at its disposal a great deal of information to enable it to make up its mind as to whether or not capital punishment should be abolished.  I do not think a commission of inquiry will be very effective because who is going to give any evidence before it?</P>
    <P>It is true certain people who have very strong views on the abolition of capital punishment will go in but may find it very difficult to get witnesses to go in to give evidence against it or to make a case for its retention.  Therefore, I do not know that such a commission would be effective.  But, as the demand for a commission has been so continuous in this country since the State was established, I think that the Government and the Dáil would be well advised to set up the commission to settle the matter once and for all, and in that way we could see what is the right line to take.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> I am impressed by the fact that quite a number of countries have abolished capital punishment, but I regret to say that in these countries there are still violent murders or homicides of a dreadful nature.  If they have abolished capital punishment they have not abolished the crime for which it is inflicted.</P>

      <P>I am only answering the point that our standard of civilisation is not as high as that in other countries.  I think it is, and even higher.  Furthermore, I believe that our philosophy, and the faith that the overwhelming majority of the people of this country practise, tends to that high standard.  I am perfectly satisfied that we have a very high code and a very high ideal here that is lived up to.  Owing to revolutionary and other causes there were certain lapses but those things, I hope, are nearly past and if we once get these fully eliminated I think we will show exactly how high our civilisation is.</P>
      <P>What I am saying now is evidence that should be before the proposed commission of inquiry.  The question here is not whether you should abolish capital punishment, but whether you would set up a commission of inquiry. I am satisfied that we should and, therefore, I am supporting the motion that we should have an inquiry.  If everybody going before that commission advocates its abolition, and there is no one left but myself to advocate its retention, I may feel called upon to advocate the retention of capital punishment.</P>

He then went on to review some of the principal grounds upon which he considered the imposition of capital punishment can be attacked, in his view, at any rate.  This view is of the highest importance and, in my view, of the greatest gravity.  The motion, I feel, cannot and should not be discussed merely because of academic considerations nor on any basis of personal feeling that we may have in regard to executions, the method of carrying them out, and so on.  I think it is the interest of the community which we ought to bear in mind, and I am sure I have only to mention that to get Deputies to approach this issue in that way.</P>
      <P>There is a certain false humanitarianism which is full of compassion for a murderer but has none for his victim.  Our people need not be in the least degree ashamed of the natural feelings of horror and resentment which a brutal murder must arouse in them. Neither should they have any regrets that they are unchristian or lacking in sentiments of humanity when these feelings are accompanied by the conviction that, so that justice may be done, the murderer should get his deserts.</P>
      <P>The Dáil is being asked to take a very grave decision upon grounds which, I suggest, are entirely unconvincing and inadequate.  I should like Deputies who may share Deputy MacBride's views to indicate whether they consider that there is any considerable body of opinion here which favours the abolition of capital punishment. I do not believe that there is.</P>

In this case it is plainly the proposer's intention to try to secure a recommendation from a Select Committee in favour of abolishing the death penalty for the crime of murder.  So that police officers in the discharge of their duties, householders defending themselves against persons with burglarious and more serious intent, women and girls coming home from their work, the ordinary citizens in their avocations, would certainly have a feeling of perturbation if this motion were carried. Certain fears and doubts will be raised in their minds.</P>
      <P>The arguments for and against capital punishment are fairly well known.  It is quite obvious from Deputy MacEoin's short speech that he could just as easily have made the case in favour of capital punishment as the case he made in support of the motion.  The subject has been rightly discussed and inquired into and, as recently as 1948, the matter was discussed in the British Parliament. If this committee were set up one would imagine that in the ordinary way, as is customary, the committee would send for expert opinion and consult with those experts on the matters upon which it had been asked to report.  Deputy MacBride has already warned the Dáil in advance against the views of lawyers, urging that in most countries, and certainly in England, lawyers as a whole and judges, in particular, have always been strongly in favour of the retention of capital punishment.  We know that lawyers hold themselves out as experts in dealing with industrial problems and such matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the past they were strongly in favour of maintaining capital punishment for the offence of larceny...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should imagine that, in the field of criminal law, nobody is likely, least of all one of their colleagues, to question the competence of Irish lawyers and of Irish judges to give their valuable views, and the information at their disposal, on this matter.  Are we to take it also that the official views, that is, the views of the officers in the Department of Justice, are to be ignored and that <Col N="432" /> they should not be consulted by this committee if it were to be set up? Presumably, on the other hand, these organisations with high-sounding titles, which we have been hearing about and whose support from public opinion is often in inverse ratio to their assertiveness and their eloquence in bringing forward their particular case, would be given a free field before this proposed committee.  Deputy MacEoin has pointed out that there is information at the disposal of the Government. The Government are in a position, surely, with the information that is at their disposal in the Official Records over the period since the Irish Government was first set up, and before that, to come to conclusions on this matter. They are free to consult the Attorney-General's Office and the judges, and, from time to time, that has been done.</P>

      <P>In another part of his speech Deputy MacBride told us that our penal code is very outdated, and that we have not kept pace with the alterations that have been made elsewhere.  May I point out that some of the supposed reforms which have been adopted in some of the so-called civilised countries (including some of those in which the Deputy has told us that capital punishment has been abolished) are not such as are likely now, or at any time in the future, to commend themselves to the Irish people.  There is no necessity to reassure Irish public opinion that it should not be in the slightest degree ashamed for lagging behind in the march of civilisation, as I dare say some would suggest we have, when we fail to take the direction which those have taken of plain immorality in social life.</P>

We could follow them if we so wished, but I consider that the primary consideration should be to have regard to our own circumstances, and to what we consider to be right and proper in the interests of our own community.</P>
      <P>In his reference to lawyers and judges, Deputy MacBride may have in mind, although he has not said so, that, as a result of the powerful and eloquent speeches made against it by the Law Lords in the House of Lords a few years ago, an amendment of the criminal law designed to suspend the operation of capital punishment for five years was thrown out.  The amendment had been proposed and seconded by two private members in the House of Commons and, although it was opposed by the Government, all the members of whom voted against it, it was carried in that House on a free vote by a narrow majority.  If I may be permitted to say so, I have not the slightest doubt, as subsequent events have shown, that in this instance the Law Lords represented public opinion in Britain more truly than did the Commons majority.</P>

In our view, there is no necessity whatever to set up this committee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, and for some time past, I have sought to elicit from a multitude of Ministers&mdash;all of whom contradict one another&mdash;what had become of the 48,000 tons of superphosphate that were held at the disposal of the Minister for Agriculture when I left office on the 14th June this year.  We have travelled through a whole gamut of answers without getting any satisfactory explanation.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce who said there never had been any &ldquo;super,&rdquo; that I had never <Col N="435" /> provided any &ldquo;super,&rdquo; and that it was all a figment of my imagination.  Then Deputy Smith, the Minister for Local Government, took a whirl at it and he had the assistance of the dignified figure of Deputy Corry.</P>
      <P>Then the acting-Minister for Agriculture downfaced Deputy Corry and told the Minister for Health to shut up.  I took an hour off from my parliamentary duties yesterday to see Burgess Meredith in a gangster film. I noticed with great interest that one of the elements of horror introduced into that drama was the continuous employment by the gangsters of a kind of double talk that left every honest man wondering did they mean &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or did they mean &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Every time an unfortunate victim questioned them to that end, they hit him in the left eye, and when he asked why, they replied: &ldquo;Why what?&rdquo;  This treatment of their victim continued for some time until the wretched citizen was expected ultimately to collapse and to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to anything addressed to him when the conversation had quite got beyond him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I put it to the House, having heard all the answers I got in the course of the last week or fortnight from the Tánaiste, from the Minister for Agriculture and the various Deputies who function for him: was not the impression created in the mind of every Deputy in this House that there never were 48,000 tons of &ldquo;super&rdquo; available?  Even Deputy Hickey rose, like the honest man he is, in the midst of the tumult to make the modest request that the House and the people should be told the truth about this matter.  He asked: &ldquo;Who is telling the truth here?&rdquo;  I do not blame him. It would have been an act of faith on the part of Deputy Hickey to have accepted my asseveration against the confused tumult on the Front Bench opposite, but it would have flattered me if Deputy Hickey had made that act of faith and not paid me the doubtful compliment of testing the weight of my words against the tumult of that collection there.  Now I do not want to follow all their confused asseverations in regard to this matter. <Col N="436" /> I shall content myself by referring the House to Volume 127, No. 9, of the Official Report, column 1595:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: May I again advise the Deputy to advise the farmers to buy up these fertilisers, because the price is not going to get less?  These fertilisers come from a part of the world where there is likely to be trouble.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: What about the 48,000 tons of fertilisers I left to the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: First of all, there were no 48,000 tons.  When I inquired about that I was told that you were talking nonsense.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I left 48,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: You did not.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I would have made £250,000 if I kept it in my pocket. I left it in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: He could not find it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: It is not the first time he could not find something until I showed him how.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, here is the patina of verisimilitude spread over that cross-talk from the Minister for Industry and Commerce:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: When I asked the officials from the Department of Agriculture about that they said they did not know what you were talking about.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am bound to go on record as saying that I do not believe any official of the Department said any such thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to say A Chinn Chomhairle, that I do not believe any official of the Department of Agriculture said any such thing, but let the Tánaiste and I at least agree on this point.  Let that be the last reference between us to the Department's officials.  His quarrel is with me and mine is with him.  We accept responsibility personally for anything done by the officers of any Department. Most of what we achieve is their work <Col N="437" /> and we take credit for that, so let us take any blame that is coming in this matter.  The Tánaiste's shoulders are broad enough to bear it without assistance from them.  The report goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: Tell him to try again.</P>
      <P>Mr. Browne: I think I am entitled to ask the Minister this question: If there are 48,000 tons along with the 100,000 tons that were imported last year for stock&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: There are not.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: There are.</P>
      <P>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan: The Beet Growers' Association have it.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: When I asked them about it they said they had not got it.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: Go and snoop around.</P>
      <P>Mr. Browne: The point I want to raise on this question is that if there are 48,000 tons in stock and if there is an increase per ton £35s. this year as compared with last year, then there is £156,000 due to the farmers and, therefore, manure at a lower price should be made available to them.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: The two prices will be related one to the other.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: The two prices of what?</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: The compound fertilisers.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: He has let the cat out of the bag.  He is going to marry the price of the 48,000 tons to the price&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: There are not 48,000 tons.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: What prices are you going to marry?  You have got to have two to have a wedding.</P>
      <P>Mr. Browne: No matter what will transpire, the farmers will have to pay through the nose for it.  They are not going to get the benefits of the £156,000 that should be there to their credit.  He brought in 100,000 tons and we are given to understand that there are 48,000 tons available to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> Mr. Lemass: There are not.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: He must have hidden them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think on that extract I am entitled to assume that the Minister for Industry and Commerce shrewdly suspected that there were 48,000 tons of superphosphate available to the Minister for Agriculture on the 14th June. Now I must trouble the House to turn to columns 1573 and 1574 of the Official Report of Thursday, 12th July, 1951&mdash; Volume 126, No. 10:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: Is the Minister making arrangements to import superphosphates himself?  The Minister will recollect that we imported 89,000 tons super last year, of which 48,000 tons are in his possession at the present time.  Does he intend to bring in further supplies this year so as to ensure that the domestic ring will not exploit the consumer?</P>
    <P>Mr. T. Walsh: The Minister is aware that the Deputy made no provision whatsoever to have manures in this country in the autumn and winter and in the spring of next year, but I am taking the precaution now of having fertilisers here for next autumn, winter and spring.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Is the Minister aware that he himself has in store at this moment 48,000 tons of superphosphates?</P>
    <P>Mr. T. Walsh: Quite so.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the meaning of the words &ldquo;Quite so&rdquo;&mdash;or have we reached that stage in gangster double-talk when &ldquo;quite so&rdquo; mean &ldquo;not at all&rdquo;?  I confess that I am as bewildered as Burgess Meredith appeared to be bewildered when the gangster kicked him in the left eye last night.  He would have been even more consternated if he were told that the words &ldquo;quite so&rdquo; meant, in fact, &ldquo;emphatically not.&rdquo;  Certainly it leaves me bewildered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are as follows.  I be spoke a memorandum shortly before I left the Department of Agriculture in <Col N="439" /> regard to the supplies we brought in. The history was this.  A representative of the Dutch cartel came in to me some time last year, I think rather to pull my leg and bluff me, and offered me 100,000 tons of super at a price which worked out at about £9 15s. per ton c.i.f. an Irish port.  I rather imagine that he thought that, under our constitutional procedure, a Minister could not call that bluff so that they would be in a position to say: &ldquo;Well now, we made you a very good offer and you did not take it.&rdquo;  Fortunately, there came under our notice at the same time a careful computation made by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann of the price per unit of phosphates from every source in Europe that could be priced at the time, and it appeared that this Dutch offer was substantially lower. I got authority from the Government to use £1,000,000 to purchase these fertilisers.  I at once directed the senior officers of the Department to reply to the Dutch firm which offered us the super and to effect a legal acceptance which would be binding on that firm.  I then asked the Board of the Irish Sugar Company to come and see me.</P>
    <P>I explained to them that we had bought this 100,000 tons of super which the people wanted but that it was extremely difficult for a Government Department to distribute it because we had no machinery for retailing it to the country.  I said that I would not trust the domestic manure ring as far as I could throw them and that if I could get Johnnie the dog to distribute them I would sooner it than the domestic ring.  The board were solicitous to take every prudent precaution.  I said to them: &ldquo;If you bring in this super on my behalf and attend to its storage and distribution I guarantee the board on behalf of the Government against the possibility of loss.  I guarantee the board that in no circumstances will the Government see them out of pocket as a result of the distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pointed out that I looked to the board, through their machinery, to bring in the fertiliser and to distribute it to retail distributors at a price which would go as near as humanly possible <Col N="440" /> to a line ball transaction, without profit or loss.  The sugar company brought it in.  I undertook with the Dutch company to take so much in the three autumn months and so much in the three spring months.  Despite their best endeavour, the sugar company could not bring it in in the autumn months and we lost 13,000 tons of the 100,000 tons we purchased&mdash;because the Dutch had the right to cancel it.  However, we brought in 87,000 tons.  The sugar company bespoke a part of that which was the high phosphate content &mdash;the 40 per cent. phosphate content super&mdash;to use in their compounds.  They distributed through the ordinary trade channels.  An advertisement was inserted in the paper that anybody who wanted to buy the super could do so and that we would sell it, if they wanted it, at a level price.  I think it was a level price c.i.f.; then there were carriage and unloading charges, if my memory serves me right.  I am not sure now, but certainly it was open to everybody to buy it.</P>
    <P>I think that this is what happened. The sugar company distributed as much as they could.  I was told there were 48,000 tons left when the sowing season last spring was over.  I was very glad to have it because the price had gone up.  Subsequent to my leaving office, Deputy Corry, who told the Tánaiste a fantastic story about Córas Iompair Éireann and the distribution of lime&mdash;which I will deal with on another occasion&mdash;demanded an extra price for beet.  Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, kicked him out. Deputy Corry then went and bared his teeth to my unfortunate successor and frightened the life out of him.  Evidently the Minister said: &ldquo;I can get no good out of Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance.  I will give you the cheap super.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let the sugar company blend it with the compound manures to sell to the beet growers and you can then get the manure for about £16 a ton although the current price is about £23 a ton. That reduction in the price of fertiliser to the beet growers is as good as an increase in the price of beet, which Deputy MacEntee will not sanction.&rdquo; I am only surmising that that is what <Col N="441" /> happened.  That is the way the super went.  I got it in to keep the domestic price down.  If he had the super to distribute you would think he would give it to the poor counties in the West who want it badly and where it would be a great advantage to get it cheap.  I have proved to the House that Deputy Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture, stated we have it when I asked him about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's story of the origin of this business was edited slightly.  It all began at a &ldquo;hooley&rdquo; in America.  There he met a Dutch Cabinet Minister and told him he wanted to purchase 100,000 tons of superphosphates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Dutch Minister went home and sent a representative of a Dutch firm here to see if it was serious business.  The Dutch representative asked what it was for and was told it was for the land project. He went to various people in town to find out if Deputy Dillon was likely to be serious and on being told that he probably was, the contracts were signed.  That is the origin of the 100,000 tons purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that Deputy Dillon then decided to inquire from the director of the land project how much superphosphate was likely to be required under that part of the scheme and he, being optimistic, said it might reach 10,000 tons.  In fact about 1,000 tons were so used so there were 99,000 tons of superphosphate which had then to be described as imported for stockpiling, but anyone proposing to stockpile anything would first of all ask where he was going to put it.  There was no storage available in this country for the stockpiling of that quantity of superphosphate.  So Deputy Dillon left to the officers of his Department quite a considerable problem with this purchase of superphosphate which <Col N="442" /> began at a &ldquo;hooley&rdquo; in America and ended with a contract in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There was, as the Deputy said, a cancellation of part of the order&mdash; 16,225 exactly.  The sugar company took 37,000 tons and 6,218 were disposed of to other merchants.  The balance was sold otherwise and there were left, on the date on which the matter was first discussed here in the Dáil the 14th July, 18,086 tons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Walsh said that, in reply to interruptions during a speech, he was wrong.  Let us get this clear.  Why is it important to get this matter cleared up?  The reliability of Deputy Dillon's memory does not matter a rap.  Deputies opposite have in various speeches referred to the existence of 48,000 tons of superphosphate, purchased at last year's price, and have created in the minds of the farmers the idea that there is this stock of cheap fertiliser available for purchase by them during next season. As a result of that impression the sale of this year's production from Irish factories <Col N="444" /> is slowing down and workers are losing their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of workers have already been disemployed in Irish fertiliser factories because of that false impression created around the country.  My only concern is to get rid of that false impression.  According to this communication from the sugar company there are at this moment in store held by them, 18,000 tons.  That fertiliser is being sold in conjunction with fertiliser which is being imported this year, and which will cost much more, to the beet growers under contract to the sugar company, at £16 10s. per ton delivered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At least that is the company's proposal.  The advice I give to Deputies is to tell the farmers in their constituencies that they would be well advised to buy fertiliser now, as it is not likely to be cheaper next year. If they give that advice now, not merely will it benefit their constituents but it will put back into work a number of fertiliser factory employees who are now out of work and it will also help to resolve what will otherwise be a very acute transport problem next spring, if orders which are not now coming in to the sugar company or to the manufacturers of fertilisers all pour in then at the same time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
