This return will, I trust, supply the information asked for by the Deputy. <Col N="969" /> As regards the second part of the question, the average cost of work as between different holdings and different types of land varies very considerably, and to be of value any figure furnished must be related to the type of work involved and the nature of the land to be reclaimed.  To give a figure showing the overall average cost per acre without also giving relevant descriptive particulars would, I feel, be misleading and would, therefore, not be in the best interests of the working of the land project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following recommendation:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
      <P>1.  That before Section 19 a new section be inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  This section applies to every conveyance or transfer and every lease (whether a conveyance, transfer or lease executed before or after the passing of this Act) of a house in respect of which a grant has been or will be made under Section 16 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948 (No. 1 of 1948), or under Section 6 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950 (No. 25 of 1950), being a conveyance, transfer or lease&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  which under the enactments in force immediately before the passing of this Act would have been proper to be charged with stamp duty by reference to sub-section (1) or sub-section (3) of Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947 (No. 33 of 1947), or sub-section (1) or sub-section (3) of Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1949 (No. 13 of 1949), and</P>
      <P>(b)  which is to a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  who is the person to whom the said grant has been or will be paid, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> (ii)  who is a member of the public utility society to which the said grant has been or will be paid,</P>
    <P>as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, and Sections 24 and 25 of the Finance Act, 1949, shall not apply and shall be deemed never to have applied to any instrument to which this section applies and, where the amount of duty paid in respect of any such instrument exceeds the amount which would have been chargeable if those sections had not been enacted, the excess may be repaid.</P>
    <P>(3)  An instrument to which this section applies and which is stamped at a rate less than the rate which, but for the provisions of this section, would be chargeable by reference to sub-section (1) or sub-section (3) of Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, or sub-section (1) or sub-section (3) of Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1949, as may be appropriate, shall be deemed not to be duly stamped unless the Revenue Commissioners have expressed their opinion thereon in accordance with Section 12 of the Stamp Act, 1891.</P>
    <P>This is a recommendation from the Seanad which relieves the taxpayer who was charged stamp duty on the conveyance of a house and land at the rate of 5 per cent.; the relief proposed is that in certain circumstances the Revenue Commissioners will reduce the stamp duty to 1 per cent.  I ask the Dáil to agree with the recommendation which has been made by the Seanad, and if the House is disposed to accept the recommendation to-day I shall be grateful.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, grants are payable to persons who purchase new <Col N="978" /> houses from builders.  The documents transferring such houses from the builders to the purchasers are liable to an <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty on the purchase of the houses.  Under the Finance Acts of 1947 and 1949 the rate of this duty would have been 5 per cent.  In the average case, the duty would amount to between £90 and £100.  The House will appreciate that this would have meant that a person getting a grant of £275 from the Government to help him to purchase the house would have been obliged, at the same time, to pay out in stamp duty a sum representing a considerable proportion of the grant.  To remedy this anomaly it was provided in the Housing (Amendment) Act of last year that a national buying a house should not have to pay stamp duty at a higher rate than 1 per cent. on the price of the house with the proviso that the relevant document should have endorsed on it a certificate, under the seal of the Minister for Local Government, that a grant would be paid to the purchaser in respect of the house.</P>
      <P>It has happened in some cases&mdash;very few&mdash;that solicitors have presented documents for stamping which did not bear as an endorsement the certificate of the Minister for Local Government. Accordingly, these documents were marked and stamped 5 per cent.  Subsequently the documents were endorsed and a claim made for the refund of the duty.  The Revenue Commissioners, under the Stamps Act, could not make the refund.  One of the purposes of this section is to relieve that hardship and to enable them to refund the difference between the duty as paid at 5 per cent. and the duty which would normally have been payable if the conveyance had borne the endorsement of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case has arisen.  Normally no stamp duty is attracted in respect of a house qualifying for a grant under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, because what the document usually does is to deal merely with a plot of ground on which a house is to be built by the purchaser.  In some cases, however, the lease or conveyance has been delayed until the house has been built <Col N="979" /> and it has been a condition of the bargain that the lease would not be granted until the price of the house had been paid to the builder.  In such cases, the documents would attract duty at the <i>ad valorem</i> rate of 5 per cent.  Here again, we have a similar anomaly to that to which I have already referred&mdash;where, on the one hand, a grant of £275 is given and, on the conveyance being stamped for paying at the <i>ad valorem</i> rate of 5 per cent., the Government takes back with the other hand between £90 and £100. The second purpose of the proposed recommendation is to enable the duty upon the house and lands in this case to be assessed at 1 per cent. instead of 5 per cent. which the document would otherwise bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first point which the Minister has mentioned on this recommendation, I think it largely arose in the beginning because, though the Housing Act of 1950 was passed somewhere about the end of the Session last year&mdash;about July last&mdash;copies had not got down the country in sufficient time and the machinery in operation for the affixing of the seal of the Minister was not then fully operative.  I know of cases where solicitors were afraid that if they did not stamp the month during which every deed must be stamped would have run out and therefore they stamped the documents at 5 per cent., believing they would be entitled to get back the 4 per cent. afterwards.  It was then found, as the Minister said, that the enactments did not provide for that refund and, accordingly, the provision that the Minister is now making covers that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second, as I understand the Minister, where a lease is being made in consideration of the expense incurred or to be incurred by the lessee in the erection of a house and in consideration of the covenants included, the effect of this will now mean that the expense incurred could only be assessed at 1 per cent.  The position in that regard was, until recently, I think, that the Revenue Commissioners did not assess duty on <Col N="980" /> the value of the house to be built in accordance with the building covenant. I have heard complaints recently from solicitors that the new departure by the Revenue Commissioners is a departure for which they cannot ascertain the legal reasons.  I can quite understand the case where the Minister mentions that the lease actually provided and expressed a stipulation that the money was to be paid over to the builder or to a building society, but I would like the Minister to make this clear to the House if he can.</P>
    <P>If a lease is made of a site and at the time that the lease is made there is no building on the site but the lease includes a covenant that a house, say of the value of £2,000, will be erected by the lessee after the date of the lease, will that lease then bear the stamp duty on the value of the covenant or will it not?  I submit it should not. I submit that if the lease merely provides that in future the lessee will, in pursuance of his covenant, erect a house, then there is no authority for assessing stamp duty on the value of that covenant and the stamp duty can only be assessed on the rent reserved. If, on the other hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy himself made his point after me and did not interrupt me, it would be easier to <Col N="981" /> discuss the matter in a non-political atmosphere because I might be tempted equally with Deputy Flanagan.  If the lease includes the provision to which the Minister refers, namely, that the house had actually been built and that the money must be paid over before the lease attained validity, then I can appreciate the position.  But if it is purely a covenant <i>in futuro,</i> then I suggest to the Minister that the practice which I am told by other solicitors to have been experienced by them may be remedied.  These solicitors were asked to lodge the lease for adjudication and when it was being adjudicated upon stamp duty was charged on the value of the house that was being erected.  It may be that that provision arises because of the section which the Minister is now clearing up in this recommendation which comes from the Seanad.  If so, the matter will be resolved for those people for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is where, as Deputy Sweetman has said, the lease provides that the building is to be erected and the lease is actually granted even with a covenant in it.  In those circumstances, the stamp duties charge is only on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, on the rent, but cases have arisen where the lease was not actually granted until the house had been erected and the builder had been paid.  In that case, some solicitors raised the point following on articles which appeared in the <i>Irish Law Times and Solicitors' Journal.</i>  They insisted upon the Revenue Commissioners directing their attention to the particular point that was being raised in these articles.  As it appeared, on investigation, that the lease belonged to that class, the Revenue Commissioners had no option except to charge the stamp duty at the 5 per cent. rate.  One of the purposes which will be attained if the House adopts the recommendation from the Seanad will be to enable the Revenue Commissioners, in that particular type of case, to mark the lease for stamp duty at 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us why the County Boroughs of Dublin and Cork are unable to secure loans from the Local Loans Fund.  They have to pay a much higher rate of interest when they are looking for these loans.  That is a hardship on the ratepayers in the areas concerned.

They also have to pay a very high rate of interest and they experience a great deal of trouble in finding suitable loans on the market.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies are rather inclined to forget what was the original purpose behind the establishment of the Local Loans Fund.  Local loans were originally granted in order to enable those local authorities who might be weak financially to finance works of capital development.  That applied to practically every local authority outside county boroughs.  When I established on a formal legal basis the Local Loans Fund in 1935 I made it quite clear to the House that the purpose of the fund was to enable local authorities which could not raise money on the open market to secure the finances necessary to enable them to carry out works of public importance.  Nobody can say that the Corporation of Dublin or the Corporation of Cork is not in a position to go to the open market and raise the necessary finances there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will bear with me.  If the public have the money I think they are just as likely to lend it to the Dublin Corporation as they are to the Government, and there was a time when the credit of the Corporation of the County Borough of Cork stood, I think, even higher than that of the Corporation of the County Borough of Dublin.  If recently the Cork Corporation and the Dublin Corporation have found it difficult to raise money from the investing public they are not in such a very different position from that in which the Government found itself recently.  During the last year, as the <Col N="984" /> House is aware, a loan was floated with disappointing results by our predecessors. What would be the consequences then if the Government assumed the responsibility which at present rests on the shoulders of the larger corporations and municipal authorities to raise their own money for the financing of their own undertakings? What would be the consequences if we had to assume the responsibility, say, that properly attaches to the corporation of the capital city for raising its own finances and if we were to permit that corporation to have recourse to the Local Loans Fund in exactly the same way as that in which county councils, urban district councils and the smaller housing authorities are permitted to utilise it at the moment?  That would simply mean that the requirements and demands of the smaller authorities would tend to be neglected, because the demand of the Corporation of Dublin and of the City of Cork would swallow up virtually all the resources that the Government could make available to the Local Loans Fund and instead of having, as we have at present, a rather reasonable distribution of such financial resources as are available among the smaller local authorities, the county councils and the smaller corporations, we should find that the larger corporations would get the lion's share of what was in the Local Loans Fund and the needs of the smaller local authorities would tend to be neglected.</P>
      <P>We cannot overlook the fact that the City of Dublin is after all by comparison with any other local authority a very wealthy corporation.  It owns a considerable amount of property.  Virtually the whole administration of the country is centred in Dublin.  A great deal of the taxation which that administration collects throughout the rest of the country is spent in the City of Dublin, and I think it would be unreasonable to expect the taxpayers in the remainder of the country to subsidise, because that is what it would amount to, both the ratepayers and the Corporation of Dublin when they required money for their own particular capital projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the general considerations which have since the establishment of the Local Loans Fund compelled successive Ministers for Finance to say to the Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;If you want to carry out capital works and development works then you must go to the open market and raise the money upon your own credit.&rdquo;  It has happened on occasions&mdash;it happened in connection with the recent loan of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;that the State or the Minister for Finance has had to underwrite the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It happened in the case of the last loan issued by the County Borough of Cork.  I think that when the Minister for Finance underwrites a loan of, say, £5,000,000 for the Dublin Corporation and takes the responsibility upon himself of finding the money for that corporation, that is of very great assistance to the corporation and goes as far perhaps as we can reasonably ask the rest of the country to go in assisting the capital city to carry out the works which it requires for its own particular purposes.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I think there should not in future be any departure from the policy which has been adopted in the past of reserving the Local Loans Fund for the benefit of the smaller local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be just as helpless in this as any other Minister for Finance if we continue to carry on in the same way.  The Cork Corporation is in the position that it asked for a loan of £500,000 a couple of months ago and it got less than half that amount.  It issued 3½ per cent. at 97, practically 4 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Less than half of what it asked.  There is a municipal debt of over £1,750,000, and every man, woman and child in Cork carries a debt of £21 2s. 3d.  The Dublin Corporation carries a municipal debt of £16,000,000, equivalent to £35 6s. 0d. on every man, woman and child in this city.  I can well understand the helplessness of the Minister in the situation in which he finds himself.  Unless we make a change we will not be able to carry on.  I think the members of this House should consider the question of finance more seriously and fundamentally rather than try to continue in operation a system which is wrong, unjust and immoral.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in reply to points which were raised in the debate referred to the last Government's difficulty in raising money by means of loans.  He referred to the particular difficulty which was experienced last year.  If the Minister cares to study the situation in relation to Government loans over the past three years he will realise that last year's loan was an outstanding success in the circumstances in which that loan was floated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the third loan&mdash;that is, we had one running each consecutive year &mdash;and it was launched unfortunately at the time of the outbreak of the Korean War.  We need not have gone on the market at that time looking for the money because other funds could have been switched to provide the money necessary but it was felt that probably money would be cheaper in 1950 than in 1951 or 1952 and that we should try to syphon out of public savings each <Col N="987" /> year's loan and get other funds for public investment and that perhaps it would be undesirable to go on the public market at a later stage because of the high price which would have to be paid for money.  When you consider that last year's loan was the third loan in three years, and that it coincided with the outbreak of the Korean War, with a war neurosis all over the world, and when you remember, in addition, that State funds which could have been switched into that loan were in fact withheld from the loan, I think it will be admitted that the loan in the circumstances was a particularly successful one.</P>
    <P>Deputies have raised questions affecting the financing of housing schemes in Dublin and Cork.  I think these issues raise matters of serious moment, so far as housing is concerned. I remember that the Dublin Corporation two years ago found it difficult to get money on the open market and they were enabled to get money subsequently only as a result of direct Government intervention with the banks.  If the Government on that occasion had not intervened strongly with the banks, and told the banks that they were expected to come to the aid of the Dublin Corporation and assist it in carrying out its worth-while activities in the matter of building houses, the Dublin Corporation would not have been able to get the money at that time.  It was only the positive action of the Government which succeeded in getting any money for house building for the corporation. On that occasion I was one of the members of the Government who saw a deputation from the corporation.  We suggested to them what was a sensible line of policy, namely, that they should go on the open market having regard to their assets and stability, and try to get whatever public savings were available and that the Government would buttress their invitations to the public by giving a kind of collateral Government guarantee so as to encourage public subscription.  We said to the corporation: &ldquo;If that fails, an entirely new situation is opened up and we will have to face up as a Government to the responsibility of finding <Col N="988" /> money to finance your house building activities because house building is not going to be allowed to stop for want of money.&rdquo;  A positive assurance on these lines was given to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>It has not been necessary, happily, to implement that policy because the corporation has been able to raise the money on the open market but this House should remember and realise that if there is that danger to the Dublin Corporation, the Cork Corporation or any other body, because of failure to get the necessary money by appealing for public subscriptions, then the State as the central body responsible for the direction of house building activities, must be prepared to find the money to enable the local authority to continue its house building activities. I think it a reasonable enough approach to the problem to tell the body concerned that it can raise the money and that it should go on the public market and there endeavour to attract subscriptions to its loan.  I think that is more easily done in Dublin than in Cork.  So far there has been no big problem so far as Dublin is concerned, but there may be a problem and, if it arises, it should be met.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can put Cork in the same category as Dublin.  Stock of the Dublin Corporation has been a common feature on the stock exchange for many years, a commodity for which there has been, over a long period of years, a constant demand and recognition. I do not think that Cork Corporation stock&mdash;I do not wish to cast any reflection in making this statement on its stability&mdash;has the same attraction on the market as Dublin Corporation stock.  I think you have got to recognise the disparity between the two boroughs&mdash;one with a population of almost 600,000 and the other with a population of 80,000.  If the investor goes for the stock offered by the bigger body, he is only following the normal pattern.  There may be fears on the part of those who have money to invest that the Cork Corporation might be loaded up with liabilities which it may at some time find it difficult to meet or, at all events, that the financing of its activities by this <Col N="989" /> method might cause a drop in the day to day value of the stock.  I think the situation revealed by Deputy Hickey, that on the flotation of a loan of over £500,000 the Cork Corporation only got £200,000, is very serious.  It is redlighting the dangers into which the Cork Corporation will be driven if it is unable to get money on the open market.  I think the Minister ought to give an assurance that if that situation continues, at all events the Cork Corporation will get a guarantee that, if it cannot get money on the open market, the State will step in and either, by providing more positive collateral security or by raising the money itself, will ensure that house building and other essential activities will not be stopped owing to want of money because there is an abundance of money in the hands of the public available for investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, generally known that the investment of capital in various directions by a municipality provides assets.  Therefore the debts to which Deputies have referred are not debts in the usual sense of the word because there is a certain income from these investments. As well as that, there is provision made by the municipality by the expenditure of these moneys for the health of the people which is also a very considerable national or local asset which cannot be measured in the terms of the money spent.  It has unfortunately been the experience of the Borough of Cork that it is difficult to get money on the open market if the rates which generally apply to money transactions in the local markets at the particular period at which the loan is sought are not offered.  On the security and credit of a city where a penny in the £ produces only approximately £1,100, you cannot expect to get money on as favourable terms as would apply to the City of Dublin, or even, as Deputy McGrath said, on as favourable terms as the County Cork, which covers a much larger area, and a penny in the £ there will produce £4,500 or more.  The position, however, is that up to the present, even though these difficulties have prevailed, <Col N="990" /> it is not want of money which has held up building in the City of Cork.  The difficulty is there undoubtedly and ought to be guarded against in future and provision made for it, and money at reasonable rates should be made available so as not to be adding to the rents of the houses.  In a municipality of the size of Cork we should have money available from the Local Loans Fund.</P>

      <P>At the moment, the Dublin Corporation is raising £5,000,000.  As the Minister says, we have a guarantee from the Government that that loan will be underwritten by the Government, so that we are certain to get the £5,000,000 anyway.  From my own experience in the Dublin Corporation I know there is a general desire that money required for constructive purposes&mdash;and I take it this applies to the Cork Corporation&mdash; should be provided from some fund such as the Local Loans Fund, because that fund will be an easier form of machinery for raising the money required than the troublesome method of raising money in the open market. The general feeling is that, if all the money required for constructive purposes by local authorities of all sizes were raised in a central way, money could be made available cheaper to the local authorities and in that way the rents of houses could be reduced.  I know that Deputy Hickey, like myself, would like to indulge in a discussion on higher finance here.</P>

      <P>The Minister will realise that it is difficult to get money at 3½ per cent. at an issue price of £97 <Col N="991" /> while industrial concerns are guaranteeing 6 per cent. and, some of them, 8 per cent., and when you find that a company quite recently asked for £200,000 and in less than 15 minutes were offered £7,000,000 in this country. I refer to the Athlone Woollen Mills. How then can we expect to get money for municipal authorities at 3½ or 4 per cent.?  These are the facts which the Government will have to face sooner or later, and the sooner the better.</P>

      <P>For once in my life, I am supporting the Minister for Finance.  We object to their coming into the Local Loans Fund because they would dissipate that fund very quickly just as they dissipated money which they had before.  If these people want to get a loan, by their fruits they will be known to the people who are prepared to put up money.  They will want to show that they will do something with the money, not like the Cork Corporation who, over a number of years, have only built 400 houses. I approve of the Minister's attitude in this matter.  I hope he will be adamant and make these people row their own boats.</P>

      <P>I fail to see why this cannot be considered as a serious <Col N="992" /> problem, not alone for the Corporations of Dublin and Cork, but for every local authority which has the responsibility of providing houses for the people.  This whole matter will have to be gone into more deeply and more seriously by the Minister for Finance. There is a growing demand in Dublin and in Cork for houses, and I have always believed that shortage of money should not prevent houses being provided for the people.  For that reason, I think the Minister is endeavouring to work a system, and his predecessors have endeavoured to work the same system, which has proved to be a failure and that until such time as the whole system of finance is changed we cannot hope to have any remedy for the grievances voiced to-day by Dublin and Cork Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have anything to add to what I have already said, except to say that I will consider the arguments advanced on behalf of the Corporation of Dublin and of the Corporation of Cork in relation to borrowings from this fund.  Let me say, however, that I doubt very much whether, if we were to relieve the Corporation of Dublin of the need to finance its own operations, the credit of the city would be enhanced, because it would be an admission, both on the part of the Dublin Corporation and on our part, that the city, with all its considerable properties, was not as credit-worthy as the Government.  There was a time not so many years ago when it was possible for the City of Dublin to raise money at cheaper rates than it was possible for the Government to do it.  It is possible that, in the course of time, when the demands become perhaps a little lighter than they are, that position may recur.  I do not guarantee that it will; I do not foresee that it will; but it is a possibility.  It is not certain, therefore, that it would be entirely advantageous to the City of Dublin if we were to throw open the Local Loans Fund to it.  After all, there is some virtue in expecting people to do things for themselves which are going to be for their own benefit and I think that, as the expenditure on housing and on other public works considerably enhances the property <Col N="993" /> of the city and makes it much more attractive from a social and business point of view, we might expect that the returns would justify the trouble imposed on the corporation when we ask them to provide for their own finance.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the question of the City of Cork.  There are many aspects of that problem to be considered. For instance, there is the big problem of the city boundary.  I do not know whether the fact that 1d. in the £ in the rate of the second city in Ireland can produce only £1,100 is at all creditable to the management of the city.  It would seem to me that there are two aspects of that problem: first of all the revaluation of the city and, secondly, the extension of the city boundaries.</P>

      <P>Grave dissatisfaction exists among certain sections of the community who have applied for telephones and have not got them. The Minister last night gave us a list of people whose applications would be given special consideration, according to their profession or occupation.  I would like the Minister to repeat the list of persons who are being given priority, at a later stage in the debate. I would ask him to have very close inquiries made concerning applications by persons for whom a telephone is absolutely essential for the efficient discharge of their duties.  I pointed out last night and I wish to reiterate that, in the past year and a half, a number of recently qualified solicitors have applied for telephones to be installed in their offices and that these applications have not been attended to as they might have been.  I am asking the Minister to see to it that, with the least possible delay, within the next three months, those people, whose livelihood depends on their having telephones in their offices, will be provided with the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthy of note that we are reaching the stage when tradesmen should be placed on the priority list for the telephone service.  Take the case of plumbers.  If a plumber's house is not connected with the telephone, <Col N="996" /> grave difficulty may be experienced in summoning the plumber to carry out urgent work.  A leaking pipe cannot be left unattended indefinitely.  It is a matter of urgency.  I respectfully recommend to the Minister that any plumber who applies for a telephone should be put on the priority list and that no time should be lost in providing him with the service.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a regulation in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that anyone who employs six or seven persons will be provided with a telephone, on application.  I would make a plea on behalf of a number of undertakers who have applied for telephones and who have not got them.  There are undertakers who employ four or five carpenters, drivers and other employees.  Such people are worthy of more consideration than they have been given.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us last night that the village of Horseleap, half of which is in his constituency and half of which is in mine, was about to be provided with a public telephone.  Would he tell us what other areas will be provided with telephones within the present financial year and what number does he expect will be completed, and in what areas, by the 31st December of this year?</P>
    <P>In the Midlands, there has been very much dissatisfaction due to the delays that take place in connection with phone calls.  The Minister will find a file in his Department which contains complaints from the traders in Edenderry as to the unreasonable delay that takes place in getting a call through from that town to Dublin.  The distance by road is 37 miles.  I have known traders there who had important business to do in Dublin.  They found that it took less time to make the journey by car from Edenderry to the city and back than wait to get a phone call through.</P>

      <P>It is with regret that I have again to direct the attention of the Minister to the most unsatisfactory state of affairs which prevails in Kilcormack, Mountbolus and Rath districts.  I understand that, in the case of a call to Dublin, it has to go first to Birr, then to Athlone and from Athlone to Dublin.  I fail to understand how this service cannot be improved, and thus help to remove the grievance which the people in the Midlands complain of in this respect.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Minister will endeavour to see that, as far as possible, every country post office will have a telephone connection with the least possible delay.  I believe that the Department has a scheme in hands to enable that to be done.  It was prepared by the Minister's predecessor.  I hope that no time will be lost in carrying out the work planned by the previous Minister, and that the scheme will not be left on the shelves in the Minister's Department to be covered with dust and surrounded with cobwebs. I am hoping that the scheme which was prepared by the Minister's predecessor for connecting up country post offices with the telephone system will be put into effect without delay.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me what would be the approximate cost of the erection of one pole for a telephone line?  I should also like to have from him an indication of the total amount of the damage that was done in the Baltinglass area as a result of poles and wires being cut there.</P>

The Minister must now find himself in the position when he should lose no time in providing information of that character. It was bad taste on the part of anyone to dream of tampering with the telephone service.  I hope that, despite whatever difficulties we may find ourselves in in the future, or what personal prejudices may prevail, no one will ever again dream of interfering with the telephone service.  It was bad taste that such a thing should have been indulged in there.  I feel sorry that it should have happened in any part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in that district would, indeed, have been very serious if, as a result of the damage done, it was impossible for people to call a doctor in an urgent case or to summon an ambulance.  Those who did the damage can be properly described as a group of blackguards.  I cannot understand how those who did it were not discovered by the Gardaí, why they were not arrested and why they are not in jail to-day.  I look upon it as a grave reflection on the Garda Síochána in the area.  Every effort must not have been made.  Men who would go out and cut telephone wires and cut poles should have been brought to justice.  I look upon that as a failure on the part of someone.  Now <Col N="999" /> that it did happen, I hope that anything of the kind will not be experienced in the country again.  I trust that the Minister will give information to the House as to the amount of damage that was done, and of what it will cost the taxpayers to replace the damage done by the blackguards in the Baltinglass area who are now looked upon as champions and heroes by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>The Minister will remember that when I was speaking on another Bill for his Department a few weeks ago, I referred to the Claremorris Exchange.  I reminded him that for a number of years back this House, the Minister and his predecessor had been subjected to very severe criticism because of their failure to have a modern exchange erected in Claremorris. We are still awaiting a development in that direction.  The Minister was recently appointed to the office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. He is a young man, and I hope that he will take my remarks into consideration. I trust that, at the first opportunity, he will do something to ease the situation in that part of the country.  Apart from the capital city and some large cities and provincial towns, I do not think there is any other county more deserving of consideration than the one I represent.  It is a county which is thickly populated.  A large amount of cross-Channel business is transacted in the County Mayo.  The amount of inland business that is transacted there is also very large.  The deplorable state of affairs which exists there at the moment is beyond description. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be able to do something shortly for Claremorris by providing it with a modern exchange which will help to ease the present situation and be of benefit to the general community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints have been made by speakers that it takes 20 minutes and upwards to secure a call for certain distances. The distance from my county to here is something like 120 miles.  If I want to put a call through to Dublin, it takes something like two to three <Col N="1000" /> hours to secure that connection.  I think that is very primitive.  I do not believe that in any country in the world, whether the people be black or white, there is anything to equal the primitive system we have here at the moment.  If we intend to spend a large sum of money, some millions of pounds, on the development of our telephonic communication, I hope the Minister will give prior consideration to those areas most deserving.  In doing that, he will be doing some good and that good will be appreciated.</P>
    <P>I would further like to ask the Minister, as Deputy Oliver Flanagan, who preceded me, has done, to give prior consideration, over and above the ordinary private individual, to the various categories the Deputy has outlined&mdash;doctors, solicitors, business people, clergymen and certain classes of tradesmen.  I would like him also to consider the erection of public telephone boxes in every village worthy of note.  The Minister will appreciate that in rural Ireland post offices close at 7 p.m.  It is after that hour that many people wish to make calls when they are free to do so, but they are prevented, due to the fact that post offices are closed, and that they are not permitted, under certain rules and regulations, to use the phone in the barracks.  For that reason the Minister should recognise that it is absolutely essential that he should have erected in every village and town a public telephone box in order to facilitate the public.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that the general public must place themselves at the mercy of the Garda Síochána.  As far as I and a number of other people are concerned, the Garda Síochána are very obliging, but it is unfair that the people should have to impose themselves upon their generosity.  The Garda Síochána are tied by rules and regulations and they are infringing these rules and regulations by obliging the public, thereby endangering their own position.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to consider in the near future the provision of the necessary facilities in every village.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress too much the need for a modern exchange at Claremorris. Since I spoke here on the Estimate for <Col N="1001" /> Posts and Telegraphs, I have been informed that a similar situation exists in the town of Ballina.  That means that the whole of the county is suffering from the need of reorganisation of the telephone system.  I know full well that the Minister is aware of that, having spent holidays in my part of the country, and having had reasons to put calls through.  Perhaps he got priority, being a member of this House and being a Parliamentary Secretary in past Governments.  The ordinary individual cannot get priority although he is as much entitled to consideration as any Parliamentary Secretary or any member of this House. His business may be equally important and it is unfair that he should be hampered by having to spend hours waiting in a town or village to secure a connection with Dublin or any other city or town.  As I stated at the outset, Mayo is a county where large business transactions are carried out daily due to the fact that we have a large number of citizens who live outside this country.  If we wish to contact Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh, London or any of the other principal cities and towns in Great Britain, the delay is deplorable.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I would impress upon the Minister to give, at his earliest convenience, prior consideration to Mayo.  There are two constituencies in that county, north and south. We do not mean to be too hard on the Minister, but rather to give him ample time and ample consideration.  He is new to his office and has undertaken new responsibilities.  Let us wait and see, and time will tell.  However, if he is not in a position to present a different case this time next year from that which has been presented over a period of years, he is going to fall into the same position as his predecessors have fallen, and to merit the same criticism.  I hope that will not be the case.  We do not wish to criticise any Minister.  We wish to co-operate with and to assist the Government.  We do not wish to be in the position to criticise.  Indeed, we wish the opposite was the case.  We desire to be able to congratulate the Minister, his <Col N="1002" /> Department and the Government as a whole.  There is nothing to be gained by obstructive criticism or even by constructive criticism, and it would be much better if both could be avoided. I hope that by this time next year I will be in a position to rise and congratulate the Minister, on behalf of the people whom I have the honour to represent, for having erected new exchanges in Claremorris and in Ballina.</P>

      <P>I rise to add my appeal to the Minister in connection with one particular point, that is with regard to the provision of telephone services for the heavily populated areas that have no such connections.  I think that the time has come when the Department should give more consideration to the equitable distribution of telephone services generally.</P>
      <P>In my own constituency there are, as is well known, very thickly populated parishes which have no telephone services.  I do not expect the Minister, as do other Deputies, to accomplish impossibilities.  The start has been made, and I hope that the Minister will keep before his mind the urgent necessity of those rural areas rather than concentrate on urban areas which are already sufficiently provided for. Of course, there may be occasional pressing cases in towns and in larger villages where people are clamouring for telephone services, but I sincerely think that the people in thickly populated rural areas are most entitled to prior consideration.  I would impress upon the Minister the necessity of keeping that point in mind when he comes to the distribution of the new telephone services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene briefly in this debate to put the following point to the Minister. His predecessor, some time back, furnished, in reply to a question, details of the sub-post offices throughout the country to which it was intended to give telephones during the present year.  I contend that we have had, since then, developments of an economic character, in relation to our agricultural industry in the constituency which I represent&mdash;North Cork&mdash;and in <Col N="1003" /> some adjoining constituencies, which demand favourable consideration of the Minister.  I maintain that these areas deserve post offices before other areas do.  The agricultural developments to which I refer are in connection with the extension of artificial insemination. Ordinarily, those offices are used, possibly, for social contacts and, on occasions, for matters of more importance. Now it is essential that the offices in the areas in question should be supplied with telephone connections with the very minimum of delay.</P>
      <P>I would further ask the Minister to give attention to the overloaded trunk lines in the areas where telephone connections are already established.  I know that in my home town we have to wait on a call for hours.  I agree with the Deputies who spoke before me that it is fantastic the amount of time which people have to spend in post offices waiting to get a connection, often to a city not 40 miles distant. Much of the delay would be ameliorated if we had some education in the proper handling of the telephone.  Many people are phone shy.  We could make a start in the schools.  That may be outside the orbit of the Minister, but it could be raised on the Vote for Education.  This would apply especially to the rural towns where we have now dial phones, such as Castleisland.  I would ask the Minister to consider the question in relation to sub-post offices in agricultural areas where artificial insemination is now spreading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to look into the whole question of telephone organisation as soon as he can get down to his job.  During the last 12 months I have heard innumerable complaints about delays in the city as well as in parts of my constituency.  I have heard of people waiting for a long time in the case of calls to places a very short distance away, in the case of getting through from Portlaoise to Mountmellick, of which Deputy Flanagan was speaking. Not having any expert knowledge of the technical side, I cannot explain the delay to myself and I am not sure that the Minister could explain it either, <Col N="1004" /> but I know it has taken over half an hour for a distance of four and a half miles.  I did not intervene to criticise the present Minister or his predecessor in connection with this.  I do not know whether the delays are due to the shortage of efficient staff or whether there is any check up by supervisory staff.  If there are doubts about statements made here, as to the justification of the complaints, there should be a periodic check by supervisors.</P>
      <P>The last Deputy talked about the overloading of the telephone system in certain towns.  That must be correct. I appeal to the Minister to look into it, as he understands the meaning of the word &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; better perhaps than many who have taken part in the debate.  He has long commercial training and experience, as well as experience as Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy and should be able to say whether there is an improvement or not.  I had an experience recently, which I did not report, where I had to dial six times before I got an answer when seeking a trunk call.  That may be an unusual experience and there may be a justifiable explanation.  I do not know if many complaints are received from the public, in the Department responsible for supervision, but the majority of those who complain to Deputies and others do not take the trouble of confirming the complaints in writing.  Now that the Minister is getting increased capital for development, there is a good case for an investigation into the present organisation, to see how far the telephone service can be improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that most Deputies are requesting installation of telephones all over the country.  I do not think there is any use in doing that, as it would create only greater confusion.  County Meath exports a lot of cattle as well as other commodities and telephones are in great demand, but in the case of Trim, Navan, Kells or Oldcastle you would reach Dublin more quickly in a car than through a telephone message. Something must be done, though I am not in a position to say what should be done.  I think there should be more lines and a bigger staff.  The telephone <Col N="1005" /> is a comparatively modern and extremely useful invention.  There may be difficulty due to the shortage of materials, but I understood the previous Minister to say there was an unlimited supply of telephone machines.  We have not seen them.  I am sure the present Minister knows exactly what he has.  It is wrong to deceive the people and if these instruments are not procurable they should be told so.</P>
      <P>The business people require telephones, and since we must have more tillage and since machinery breaks down, an efficient telephone system is absolutely necessary.  If it is not efficient, it is better to close it down. I would like the Minister to tell us if he has any supply, or any guarantee of a supply, of instruments, or whether wire is short, or what is wrong.  From Trim it takes two or three hours to get Dublin by phone.  That may be due to need for another line, which I suppose could be suspended, as the posts are there.  The community would be satisfied if they knew what the difficulties were and there would not be such an appeal then for telephone boxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident that there is a shortage of telephones and particularly of kiosks.  During the emergency the Department of Defence at considerable expense erected lookout posts all round the coast, each connected with the public telephone.  So far as I am aware, the telephones and poles are still there, though the posts are no longer in use.  The Minister should seriously consider whether it would be to the benefit of the public if those posts could be used.  In Donegal, one of them would be most beneficial, and I think the officials should look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Six Counties it is customary to find telephones at cross-roads.  We know the Automobile Association down here have a number of telephone kiosks on the road, which are most useful to the locals and to travellers. Where possible, kiosks should be erected at cross-roads, as they would be useful to motorists and travellers and would also serve as a local convenient <Col N="1006" /> meeting place.  I join with Deputy Flanagan in asking the Minister to give priority to my colleagues&mdash;solicitors setting up in business.  It is an advantage for a solicitor to have a telephone, and a considerable disadvantage if he has not got one.</P>
    <P>Even at the risk of being told I am quoting the rag, tag and bobtail, I would appeal to the Minister to have telephones installed on all the islands. In West Donegal we had an unfortunate tragedy on Arranmore 16 or 17 years ago, which would not have occurred if we had a public telephone service to the mainland and those lives would not have been lost.  The service is needed particularly at night.  At the moment, we have a limited service, but it is really when the islanders are in the dark that they require some communication with the mainland, as when the boats are out the islanders are anxious to know whether they have left the mainland or not.  I appeal for a 24-hour service for all the islands off our coast.  Until that proves possible, I appeal to him to include in the 10 o'clock news each night fishing news from all over the country.  It is impossible for fishermen and buyers to contact the market in Dublin by telephone&mdash;I have waited six hours for a call to Dublin&mdash;and it would be beneficial if there were a daily broadcast of the fishing news.</P>
    <P>There seems to be something wrong with the line between Dungloe and Ballybofey, where the wires are evidently connected in some way with the telephone service used by the railway company.  Particularly after a storm, one finds railway officials butting in in the middle of a telephone conversation.  Possibly that could be remedied, but although I have personally made several protests about it nothing has been done.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials would look into the matter.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to him to give priority to the sub-post offices.  If it is essential to open a sub-post office, surely it is equally essential to install a telephone there.  There are three in West Donegal &mdash;Meenbanad, Meenacross and Dunlewey. If they require a doctor in Dunlewey, they have to travel ten miles to <Col N="1007" /> get one, and a telephone service would be very beneficial.  The Minister by introducing this Bill is doing something which may improve the service and I appeal to him to pay particular attention to the points raised by Deputies to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the same complaints as other Deputies regarding the telephone service.  Undoubtedly, there are delays at times but they are often unavoidable.  I appreciate the services that are given and the effort made by this particular Department since I came to know of it intimately three and a half years ago.  They have tried to install telephones at the places most advantageous to the community. I have seen only two telephones installed in farmers' dwellings.  I am amazed that people who claim to represent farmers have not made some suggestion, constructive or destructive, since we have brains listening on the other side which could put the suggestions together and arrive at something tangible.  Deputy Cafferky, in particular, might have referred to the farmer's need of a telephone in his house.  There may be a lack of instruments at present or a lack of labour, but the Minister should remember that the agricultural community all over the country need telephones.  I am not confining this to my own area, which is an intensified dairy area, or the area Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about, where artificial insemination is carried on on broad lines and where they have even a wireless station with their own cars operating for 20 miles and in touch with the station, about which I am sure the Post Office know the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have cases where farmers apply for telephones and if these were given even in a mild way, it would fill the needs of many of the population in that area.  The Irish farmer is both hospitable and generous and if a neighbour wants a phone call he would be obliged.  There is too much talk about the towns and villages.  In the area I come from, the towns and villages are pretty well provided for.  In the town where I live, there is an automatic service. I believe that automatic services would get over the difficulty of delays. <Col N="1008" /> The Minister is a young man and should face up to this problem immediately.  Whilst we have switches, we will have young ladies and if there is a little delay, well, we were all young one time ourselves.  I have not heard many complaints and never had reason to complain myself, unless I drew on my imagination and said five minutes was 20.  Those delays will be there while you have switches.  Conversations go on, or there may be priorities, or there may be one call or even 20, before mine, and it is a case of first come first served.  As an experiment, the Minister should pin point a certain area, so as to give service to farmers who require a telephone installed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound the reveille as far as Deputy Cowan's fusiliers are concerned, but I suggest to the Minister that this thing as far as we are concerned is dead.  Should an emergency arise and should the forces of the State not be in a position to meet it, remember that you have Deputy Cowan's fusiliers ready for action, ready to protect the lives and property of our citizens and, if necessary, to fight and conquer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to depart from the system which is in operation at the moment.  I made representations about the installation of telephone services in Kerry and I was informed by the late Minister that the system arranged was that each county would be done in its entirety. I understand that they established some sort of zoning system and in that way it might take ten years before our people in Kerry or in any other county could avail of these services which are urgently required.  That is why I make this suggestion at the very outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that in Kerry the system is antiquated.  In our small towns and villages it is not unusual to find people waiting for hours to get calls through.  They are informed by the postal authorities that there is a one-line service but they should have a double line service such as exists in other areas.  One case in particular which has been under consideration for the past 13 years is that of a rural district touching on the seaboard where we have a fishing industry, Cromane, <Col N="1009" /> County Kerry.  I was informed last year that under the zoning system the Department might be able to consider that case next year.  Fancy being informed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that a scheme which has been under consideration for 13 years might be dealt with next year.  I am quoting that as an example of the Department's antiquated methods.</P>
    <P>It was a grand thing to read the Minister's statement that £8,000,000 would be provided for telephone services. It would be better to get down to business if it is at all possible, and to get technicians, staff and equipment and develop immediately even if it means going outside the country for these technicians and trained staff. Where is the good in broadcasting to the nation that you are providing £8,000,000 for telephone services if you are not in the position to live up to your promise and embark on immediate development?</P>
    <P>In our county we have made representations over and over again for the extension of telephone services to outlying districts.  There is an area adjacent to Killarney called the Black Valley across the hills, and the people in that valley have no telephone connection with the outside world.  We have asked for a connection.  The place is only six miles from the nearest centre, but although the question has been under consideration for a long time nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise these points because people in towns and cities are well organised and very well able to look after themselves, but people in the rural districts have no organisation and no one to speak for them, so it is up to us to insist and to ask the Minister and his Department to get down to business at once and put the scheme into operation immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak on this, but yesterday I had the experience of wanting to make a telephone call from the North Wall area here in Dublin.  I searched around the North Wall, the property of the Ports and Docks Board, and the Liffey dockyard, but I could not find a public <Col N="1010" /> telephone anywhere in the area.  The Minister knows the importance of the area; thousands of people are employed there who have occasion to use the telephone from time to time and many hundreds of people visit the area on business every day who naturally may need to get in touch with their employers or head office as matters arise.  I was so astonished to find such inadequate public telephone facilities that I decided to take the matter up with the Minister and would have done so privately were it not that this opportunity arose of putting my case on the records of the House in connection with this Bill to which it is so relevant.</P>
      <P>While I agree, as I am sure the Minister agrees, with the case for the extension of telephone facilities all over the country, I must say that in Dublin there is still an inadequate telephone service in so far as the people who have to use public telephone services are concerned, and I think that there should be a drive now to provide a public telephone or kiosk in the vicinity of every important crossing in the city.  The population of Dublin being what it is there is a very heavy demand for public telephones and one must occasionally travel a good distance to make a telephone call from the street.  I would ask the Minister to look after that important area I mentioned and also to consider the extension of public telephones in the city.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin mentioned to-day an experience he has had and I think it is the experience of every Deputy and every person who has occasion to make trunk calls at certain hours of the day. One dials the number to get trunks and one has to wait a very long time, sometimes ten minutes, sometimes longer. That is not just an isolated experience; it is quite a common experience at particular hours in the day.  There may be some explanation for it; it may be due to changing of staff or shortage of staff or something else.  To people who have to get telephone messages through quickly, that is an unreasonable delay.  I support Deputy Davin and the other Deputies who have drawn the Minister's attention to this matter.</P>

      <P>I want to deal first with the matter of telephonic communication in rural Ireland.  I am sure every Deputy in the House is proud that our people are becoming telephone minded, so to speak.  We are all glad of the demand for the installation of telephones.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the number of subscribers and he stated that it may be necessary to withhold the installation of telephones for private subscribers until the development of the telephone system proper is carried out.  He used the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I should not wish to deprive any member of the community of having a telephone installed in his house, but I should like to point out to the Minister that the necessities of certain rural districts deserve his prior attention.  I find very often in my own town that I have to wait an hour or an hour and a half to get a trunk call through to Dublin.  Sometimes a person has to wait even as long as an hour and 40 minutes and, eventually, cancels the call because the business house he wishes to contact has closed for the evening.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan mentioned that the people of Dublin have to wait ten or 15 minutes, but just consider the position of a person in a rural area who has to go to a sub-post office in order to make the telephone call.</P>

      <P>I was trying to bring home to the Minister the necessity for the erection of extra telephone lines in rural districts before he gives permission to increase the load on lines that are already overloaded.  I am sure that the Minister and his officials know the areas that I have in mind when I ask him to speed up the provision of the necessary extra lines in order to carry the demand that the public expect and so that our people will not have, on occasion, to wait an hour or an hour and a half or an hour and 40 minutes on a cold winter day in a small <Col N="1012" /> sub-post office, smoking cigarettes in order to try to keep themselves warm, only to find, eventually, when the call comes through, that the business house in Dublin which they wished to contact had closed for the evening.</P>
      <P>For years those of us whose business it was to bring the matter before the respective Ministers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been pointing out that in certain rural areas there is no telephonic communication, no minister of religion, no doctor or nurse.  The people in these areas have to travel maybe eight or nine miles for medical or spiritual attention and sometimes those who need the medical or the spiritual attention have not the wherewithal to hire a motor car to transport them, and a horse and cart, or often a bicycle, must be used.  I have referred to this matter on previous occasions and while the requirements of certain portions of County Wicklow have been met there are still some small villages which need to be attended to.  I hope that when the necessary lines to carry the extra load have been provided, immediate steps will be taken&mdash;following up on that work&mdash;to have installed in the different villages the telephonic communications which are so essential to the people in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this matter the Minister should have regard to what I believe is a very important aspect, and that is the apparent difficulty experienced by the Department in obtaining the services of skilled technical staff.  We may make plans for increased telephone facilities in this country, but I suggest that such plans may prove unreal unless we determine to remedy that great deficiency.  I believe the Minister should address himself in the future to the inadequate rates of remuneration at present made available to the technical staff.  Anybody who has come into contact with this question at all is aware that the wage rates applicable to the skilled manual staff and semi-skilled and even unskilled staff in the employment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not such as would attract the type of skilled technican required in the extension of the telephone <Col N="1013" /> service.  I trust that the Minister will give consideration to that matter.</P>
      <P>It was recently announced that large numbers of State employees would receive increased remuneration by reason of the Civil Service award.  It is my hope that the Minister will avail of that opportunity of an upward trend in wages to improve the rates of pay being offered to workers in the Post Office and to remedy the very unsatisfactory position, especially in regard to casual workers employed in the store department of the engineering section.</P>
      <P>It is neither right nor equitable that the provision of telephone kiosks generally should be approached always from the point of view of their financial success.  It must be obvious that the provision of telephones in this day and age is an essential matter.  It should not be entirely a question of whether a telephone kiosk will pay or not, nor should that be the determining influence as to whether it should be erected.  Very often, when you have a small community of people, it is quite probable that a telephone kiosk would not pay for itself, but that does not take away from the importance of the service to the people concerned.  Even if it means that some degree of sub-sidisation must ensue for isolated areas, I still think it would be a progressive move for the Minister to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have talked about different parts of the country.  It is not my intention to go into details as to my own constituency which surrounds the capital city, but in the case of many villages and towns&mdash;towns such as Swords and small villages such as Loughshinny&mdash;telephone facilities are just as inadequate, within five or ten miles of the heart of the City of Dublin, as they are in the heart of Deputy John Flynn's constituency in the very remote parts of the County Kerry.  This springs from the fact that, when a local need becomes apparent for the establishment of a telephone kiosk and when a local demand is made, the yardstick or test applied by the Department seems to be: &ldquo;Will the kiosk pay for itself or not?&rdquo; That might be all right, that might be sound economics, but it is not socially good for the people.  I hope the Minister <Col N="1014" /> will endeavour to get away from that particular point of view as far as he can.  I hope that telephone facilities will be provided on the basis of the need that exists for them rather than on the probable financial returns they will give when they are provided.</P>

The applications as at the 1st March, 1951, were 5,300, of which 3,000 were in Dublin.  This shows that although people in the country are looking for telephones, the greatest demand and urge for a telephone service is in the metropolitan area.  There were 5,873 new subscribers in 1950. <Col N="1015" /> There were really 6,800, representing the number of entirely new subscribers' lines, plus removals.  We are beginning at least to keep fairly level with the demand.  It is impossible to promise that that state of affairs will continue, because it depends on what the current demand for phones will be when the service improves through the various developments that have been carried out, details of which I gave in my speech on Second Reading.</P>
    <P>So far as priorities are concerned, it would be very difficult to add any large categories of persons to those with priorities.  If we did so, the point would be reached where three-quarters of the applications would be in the nature of priorities of one kind or another and that is virtually equivalent to there being no priorities.  From that you would approach to a position whereby engineers could not do any planning on an area basis because they would simply have to rush from one place to another.  There has to be a certain amount of restraint in the admission of classes of persons to the priority list with the hope of maintaining the highest possible speed in joining subscribers' lines.  It is impossible for me to make any promises in regard to adding priorities to the list that I have already given.  I will read out the list: doctors, chemists, veterinary surgeons, dentists, hospitals, nursing homes, journalists, midwives, clergymen, public utility companies, radio-graphers, hatcheries registered with the Department of Agriculture, and firms giving a considerable amount of employment, or giving employment to more than seven hands all the year round.  In some ways the list is flexible. There are bound to be exceptions here and there.  It is the object of the officers of my Department to be human in their attitude and, at the same time, to accept the difficulties.</P>

      <P>I have said I am not prepared to add to the priorities at the moment.  The priorities are based on the experience of the Department and already priority applications amount to <Col N="1016" /> 43 per cent. of the total.  If we go on increasing that number the subjoining of lines on a planned basis will simply come to an end.  If we add to the priority list the work will simply be slowed down, more time will be taken in joining the lines and the difficulties of the engineering staff will be increased.</P>

      <P>I made a little investigation as soon as the debate finished yesterday of the position in Offaly and I find that a solicitor who started business in 1945 made an appeal through Deputy O. Flanagan&mdash;I shall not mention the solicitor's name.  He applied for a telephone in December, 1949, and he was supplied with that telephone in accordance with the area arrangements in Offaly on the 19th June, 1951.  I have no complaint to make with that rate of progress at all.  So far as the undertakers he mentioned are concerned, one of them never at any time employed seven people constantly; he had been in business for 35 years without applying for a telephone and another for 20 years. The latter applied on 19th June, 1949, for a telephone and was linked up in March, 1950.  I shall not give any further details on this point except to say that Deputy O. Flanagan is quite capable of exaggerating the case merely for the sake of making an impression, if I may put it that way.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly willing, if I remain Minister, to consider in the next few months this whole question. If one goes on increasing the list of priorities to bring in classes of persons such as plumbers, solicitors and so on, how can one continue having priorities at all?  One would then have to bring in business people employing six all the year round, five all the year round and so on.  Once we increase the range, there ceases to be in effect any priorities at all.  However, I am willing to <Col N="1017" /> examine every suggestion put up.  More than that I cannot promise.</P>

Between 130 and 150 call offices will be established this year.  If Deputies wish to see the plans for their particular constituencies all they have to do is to consult Volume 124 of the Official Report, 14th March, 1951, at columns 1851 and 1852, where they will find the list published for the current year.

      <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan said that all the planning, the extensions that have taken place and the huge increase in the number of telephones was due to my immediate predecessor. As I have already said, I give credit to the previous Minister for developing the very, very extensive plan that we had prepared in 1946.  I think I was reasonable in doing that.  But the plan was prepared in 1946, and the first Telephone Capital Bill was passed in 1946.  In the year we went out of office no less than 6,025 telephone lines were joined.  Most of the work in connection with these telephones had already been planned in 1947.  Between 1939 and the close of war and up to the year 1948 we managed somehow to get 17,000 subscribers joined.  The suggestion that an enormous amount of work was not planned or carried out during our period in office, even during the war years, is quite untrue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan also availed of this opportunity to raise issues in connection with Baltinglass Post Office.  My reply is that, unless Deputies force me to answer questions here by way of parliamentary question, I will not speak on that issue ever again except in public in order to encourage some other Deputies to say a few things in public where they will not be in the privileged position in which they find themselves here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been complaints by some Deputies in regard to the state of the telephone service in the Claremorris area.  Deputy Cafferky <Col N="1019" /> referred to that.  We have constructed a co-axial cable via Portlaoise to Athlone and the next stage in order to improve the telephone services will be to construct carrier circuits to the western towns.  The service in relation to Tuam, Westport and Galway has already been improved, but there has been a delay in the extension of these circuits from Athlone towards Claremorris.  The work will be carried out as soon as possible.  Claremorris exchange is not one of the worst in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

      <P>What about Ballina?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballina exchange is not unsatisfactory in quality.  There are delays in Dublin.  There again there will be additional circuits from Athlone as a result of the laying of the new cable which will have the effect of improving the service from Ballina.  A number of Deputies, including Deputy L.J. Walsh, spoke generally on the problem of improving services in the rural areas.  We are doing all we can.  As I have said we have embarked on a programme of establishing call offices at the rate of about 130 to 150 a year. We have constructed, as I have already stated, a number of co-axial cables on the line to Cork with branches to Waterford and Athlone.  All along that route there should be improvements in other circuits with corresponding benefit to the people in country towns and villages.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the telephone services in parts of Cork.  Out of the 130 call offices in construction under this year's programme, Cork is going to get 29.  That number is not quite exact, as it might possibly include call offices with connections to offices outside County Cork, but, anyway, it is the approximate number.  I dread to think what would happen if, with the tremendous increase in the number of calls we have every year, we were to adopt Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion to give free instruction in the use of the phone.  I think that is a matter which we might well delay because the increase in the use of the phone is so tremendous at the moment that it <Col N="1020" /> would be rather frightening to think of the several more million calls that would be instituted through adopting Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion to give free education, in the schools above all places, in the use of the phone.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin referred with a number of other Deputies to delays in calls and so forth.  As I have said, the last Minister adopted the policy of joining subscribers' lines as quickly as possible and of employing a large section of the engineering staff with that end in view.  The position is that the number of calls has increased as a result of the joining of the subscribers' lines and of the change in economic conditions generally since 1932, and particularly since 1939.  The more lines that are joined, the greater becomes the overloading of the service.  Deputies will perhaps bear these figures in mind, that somewhere about 6,000 subcribers' lines were completed, transferred or altered in 1950.  Between 1949 and 1950 there were nearly 500,000 more trunk calls in the one year.  There were 5,430,000 more local calls in the one year, showing that more and more people use the telephone.  We have to wait to see the full results of the introduction of the co-axial cables but the fact that people are using the telephone in ever increasing numbers naturally tends to add to our difficulties.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Reilly made some observations in regard to the service to Meath.  There have been some additional lines constructed from Dublin to Navan and Dublin to Kells but nevertheless we find that sometimes there is overloading.  That applies to virtually every county.  I think it right to say that a number of new circuits have been introduced to various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been two additional circuits installed from Dublin to Sligo since the 1st January, 1947, but they have not been sufficient to cope with the demand.  From Dublin to Kells there has been one additional service introduced.  There were previously three.  We have added another one, that is an addition of 33? per cent. Deputy O'Donnell referred to need for telephones in Donegal.  I should take this opportunity of saying that one of <Col N="1021" /> my duties in future will be to see what we can do in general to provide phone services in tourist districts.  It may not be possible to effect a great improvement but we shall at least make an examination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn referred to the telephone services in Kerry.  I should like to tell him that there are 11 call offices planned for Kerry this year.  He might also like to know that there are a considerable number of seaside resorts where there are now telephone facilities after 10 p.m. or all night long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Everett, as I have said, was Minister when a large number of improvements were effected and when earlier plans were examined still more closely and carried out but, as I have already said, Deputy Flanagan is not going to get away with the suggestion that all the fundamental plans were not made in 1946 and 1947 by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated, the call office development is based on sound engineering ideas and no priorities.  It is based on the best way of carrying out the service with the least possible expense and, above all, of effecting it without causing further overloading.  All the relevant factors are taken into consideration. I am glad to say that, so far as I can gather, both the previous Minister and the Minister before him, were able to resist all political pressure in regard to call offices.  It is not so easy for a Minister to resist some political pressure in regard to joining subscribers' lines.  I believe in being quite frank in that matter but, at least, in connection with call offices, both Ministers were able to resist such pressure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan referred to call offices at the East Wall. I must say that I had no idea that there was an absence of telephone facilities in that thickly populated and busy area.  If Deputy Cowan will give me the necessary indication as to where he was speaking about, I shall have the matter examined.  There have been a considerable number of kiosks erected over the area.  It is the view of the officers of the Department that kiosks should be self-supporting because so far as social services are concerned&mdash;and the telephone is a social service&mdash;it is preferable to regard call offices as units where if you require a telephone, it is at your disposal whether the office is profitable or not.  At night time if there are special difficulties the Garda Síochána are always willing to provide telephone services of an emergency character.  I do not know that we could adopt Deputy Dunne's ideas.  The telephone must be at all times regarded as serving a social need, but the telephone service must in the long run pay for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no other solution of the problem.  The charges for telephoning, to a 99 per cent. degree, are paid for in exact proportion to the wealth of those using the telephone, with certain exceptions; there must be exceptions <Col N="1023" /> to every generalisation of that kind. It is in the interest of the community at large, therefore, that kiosks be kept as self-supporting as possible, and that the social purpose of the telephone should be served by facilities at Gárda Síochána stations and the opening of call offices in sub-post offices regardless of the receipts likely to flow in relation to the expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

I will be anxious to receive from him the complaint he made so that I may investigate to see how many telephones he may have unconsciously walked past before I deliver final judgment on the matter.  Deputy Brennan referred to delays in the establishment of telephone services in County Wicklow.  I am aware that there have been delays.  There are six call offices planned for Wicklow county in the coming year.  As I have said, these are very approximate figures because the actual carrier lines go over the county boundary.  As far as I know, there are about six.  I know that the service in Wicklow has improved because I telephoned from a certain Wicklow area where my family live.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin referred to the question of staffing.  I should like to say that, although we had some difficulties in securing staff, the increase since the immediate post-war period in the staff of the telephone service is 1,200 more men and 250 more women, making 3,460 in all, which is a considerable staff for a small country like this.  The conditions in regard to the staff have improved.  The salaries of the engineers are based on Civil Service grade salaries.  It is not for me to argue whether they are sufficient or not, but they are in line with the salaries of engineering officers in other branches of the Civil Service.  There has been no holding back, no reduction made in the salaries, so that if there is something about which Deputy Davin complained it must reflect on the general salaries paid to various grades of engineers in the Civil Service.  I might add that the salaries compare favourably, at least to some degree, with the salaries paid by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>With regard to casual workers, I myself feel that all grades of casual workers deserve at least the same increases in salaries and wages as have been paid in many other cases.  The figure I worked out roughly was about 9 or 10 per cent. since 1948 for certain classes of industry, and applications made for increases for casual workers employed in the Post Office will, no doubt, have sympathetic consideration. I think I have answered all the questions I am able to answer, except that a Deputy from Mayo wanted to know something about the improvement of the telephone service in Mayo.  There are five call offices to be provided in County Mayo in this financial year.</P>

Could the Minister also give an assurance that workers on night duty in the telephone service will receive a reply to their application for an increase of pay?  A number of men in County Kerry recently made application for some increase in their remuneration for night work.  I would be grateful if the Minister would answer these two questions.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can reply to the question about the plan of 13 years ago.  I will have to investigate that.  So far as officers of the telephone service are concerned, they benefit by the recent award which was made and the increase will start as from January 15th last, so that the night workers will benefit in that way. In regard to plans for the future telephone services in Kerry, it would be impossible to go into detail as to what is planned in regard to the development of new circuits and trunks. I will have to examine the matter, but Kerry will undoubtedly benefit under the general expansion of co-axial cables and other forms of trunk circuits throughout the country.

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to amend the existing enactments relating to old age and blind persons' pensions.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost, I think I mentioned already, but it is no harm to repeat, that it is estimated that the full cost of the Social Welfare Bill for 12 months would be £1,422,000.  That is divided in the following way: under Section 2, that is the point dealing with landholders and the transfer of land to the children of landholders, there is an extra cost of £200,000; clause 3, dealing with the disregarding of allowances and disability pensions as means, will cost £50,000; the extra 2/6 costs £1,172,000&mdash;that is in a full year.</P>

      <P>We saw the Minister for Social Welfare last night putting on an act of bluffing and blustering in order to try to conceal the perfect <Col N="1027" /> somersault which he was doing in connection with the Social Welfare Bill.  The Minister has now admitted that, in March, 1948, he believed in a scheme of contributory old age pensions, payable at 65 years of age. Whatever maturity has set in in the Minister's mind in the meantime, he now confesses that he is opposed to retirement pensions at 65 years of age, in 1951.  In 1948, Fianna Fáil published, as I said before, elaborate advertisements in the Press saying that they had a plan for security and part of the plan was contributory old age pensions at 65 years of age. That admittedly was the Fianna Fáil policy in 1948.  The Minister admitted that was so last night, but, now that he has got out of his Peter Pan days and Peter Pan ways and is a little more mature, he thinks that that is a wrong thing entirely and has made it clear that, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, there will be no retirement pensions at 65 years of age.  Let Fianna Fáil Deputies get that into their heads.  The Minister has said, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, that he is going to throw overboard the idea of retirement pensions at 65 years of age.  Therefore, when you see in future advertisements in the Press, particularly around about election times, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, indicating what their policy is to be, you have got to understand that, just like the businessman who prints at the bottom of an invoice, &ldquo;Errors and omissions excepted&rdquo;, with the Fianna Fáil plan you have to read into the advertisement this hidden declaration, &ldquo;liable to be varied or substantially altered without notice once the election is over&rdquo;, because that is what Fianna Fáil has done.</P>

      <P>You will hear something about the means test before I finish to-day and I hope you will not go out while I am talking about it.  In any case, Fianna Fáil election advertisements for the future must be read against this background that when the election is over they may be varied without notice to anyone, that they are not expected to run to any consistent texture, that they are just there for the period of an election and that when it is over they may be jettisoned in the same way as the plan to provide retirement pensions at 65 years of age has been jettisoned by the Fianna Fáil Party during the discussion of the Social Welfare Bill.  These advertisements clearly are only for unwary people.  They are intended only to ensnare simple people during the period of the election.  When the election is over, the Party managers will make sure that the electors do not get unduly excited about asking for the implementation of the promise made by Fianna Fáil because the policy will be altered once the election is over.</P>
      <P>That is what the Minister for Social Welfare has done.  He has done it in an open and a naked fashion.  He says now there is going to be no retirement pension at 65 and that is to be the Fianna Fáil policy for the future&mdash;no retirement pension at 65 years of age. Instead, he has got a hotch-potch scheme worthy of a mental home in which he says that, instead of giving a man a retirement pension at 65, he can get sickness benefit or unemployment benefit.  He may not be sick in any sense of the word but a device will be arranged, the Minister thinks&mdash;we can wait with patience to see the promise implemented&mdash;by which some provision will be made for him to get sickness benefit although he is not sick.</P>

      <P>If all that fraternity can get pensions when they retire, to which many of them do not contribute, what is wrong with letting the ordinary working man get a pension if he decides to retire at 65 years of age?  Why cannot the ordinary man who works in a field, in a factory, in a shop or in an office, or why cannot the masses of the people who work for wages and salaries who have no pensions whatever to-day, and no indication that their employers will ever pay them a pension&mdash;no indication that their employers can ever pay a pension to them&mdash;why cannot they be allowed in under a Bill of this kind to pay a contribution which will enable them to have a pension if they so wish to retire at 65?  We have got no explanation from the Minister as to why he is so bitterly and, apparently, so unalterably opposed to the provision of pensions at 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>I want to make my position, and the position of the Labour Party, clear in this matter.  If this country can pay pensions to judges, civil servants, Army officers, the Gardaí and the employees of local authorities&mdash;I do not begrudge them pensions because they well deserve pensions in return for faithful service&mdash;I see no reason why the worker who works for a small man or a small farmer and is unable himself out of his own resources to make provision for a pension, should not get a pension from the State at 65 years of age to which he, his employer and the State have contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to hear the Minister&mdash;I hope we will hear from the Fianna Fáil back benchers&mdash;what is wrong with giving the ordinary working man a pension at 65 if he elects to retire. Mind you, it was promised in the famous plan for security.  The Minister himself has run away from that promise. Have the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party also run away from it?  At all events, the latest stop-press&mdash; the hot news from the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;is this: &ldquo;Take note, citizen, we are now in office&mdash;our tenure will be as long as we are allowed to hang on by any method, questionable or otherwise&mdash;and you will get no retirement pension at 65 years of age even though <Col N="1032" /> we promised it to you.&rdquo;  That is the declaration made by the Minister for Social Welfare, and it was to try and wriggle out of the embarrassing position in which he now finds himself, due to his own incompetent handling of the matter, that he put on the bluster and the bluff act which he did last night.  I want to nail the Minister's ear to the post of truth in this matter, and the post of truth in the matter is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will make you earn it harder, if necessary, on this Bill. There is no use in getting annoyed. This is a deliberative Assembly.  On the Second Stage of that Bill the Minister said that to anyone who had £2 a week he would give him an old age pension of £1 a week, and to the <Col N="1033" /> farmer with a holding, the valuation of which was not more than £25, he would give a full pension.  You went to the trouble of setting that out in a speech and, later, to the trouble of saying that to the Press as a declaration of policy.  What I want to ask the Minister is this: Why did he not put these two provisions in this Bill instead of slavishly adopting a proposal for which I was responsible in this Dáil? This is not his Bill at all.  I said last night that the Minister is in secondhand clothes on this Bill.  This is not the Minister's Bill at all.  This Bill is merely doing everything, and just everything, which I promised in the House on Second Reading the Social Welfare Bill would do.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an exact copy of proposals which were submitted to the Dáil, but there was nothing to prevent the Minister from introducing a section saying that anybody with £2 a week would get the full old age pension. There is no reason why the Minister cannot do it still on this Bill.  There is no reason why he cannot say to every farmer who has got a holding with a valuation of not more than £25: &ldquo;We will give you the full old age pension.&rdquo;  He promised that on the Second Stage of that Bill.  Now he has the opportunity of implementing his promise, and he can do it, but the Minister will not do it.  He has run away, therefore, from promise No. 2. That promise is being abandoned.  Instead, the Minister is introducing into this Dáil a Bill which is merely a copy of the proposals which I formulated and submitted to this House in my capacity as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Promise No. 2 is being abandoned.  Even when the Minister came to write the amendments to the Social Welfare Bill he wrote another set of amendments to the proposals which I had submitted.  He has run away even from the third set of amendments, so that promise No. 3 is being abandoned.  Now it may be that the Minister is mentally lazy; it may be that he is tired after the election campaign; <Col N="1034" /> it may be that the feeling of political instability in which he is engulfed does not induce him to strenuous efforts.  &ldquo;I prefer, therefore, to take the Bill that is there and to say: the Dáil knows that this was promised; let us put through the previous Bill; do not excite me or worry me about thinking out or giving effect to my own amendments.&rdquo;  If that is his mind, and one knows what human frailty is, then one can understand the kind of mental and physical laziness that is consuming the Minister.  Is that the explanation for it, or what is the explanation, because there is no reason in the world why the Minister cannot make the modification which he promised here on the 2nd March and, subsequently, in the amendments which he submitted to the House.  I want to know will the Minister not do the things he promised to do then?</P>
      <P>We had a dissertation on a motion which was introduced in 1947, a motion designed to secure a modification of the means test.  We need not waste time on the trimmings or on the various technicalities which make up the means test.  The Fianna Fáil attitude to the means test can be ascertained by reference to this cold fact, that the cost of that modification was half a million pounds per year. The Fianna Fáil Government of the time voted against that motion, although it would cost only a half a million pounds per year.</P>

As I said, the cost then was £500,000, and it could not be found or provided to implement a motion of that kind.  The Fianna Fáil Party were afraid then of an inflationary tendency if old age pensioners had the means test modified.</P>
      <P>In 1948 I introduced a Bill in this House which gave old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows and orphans, non-contributory, an additional £2,500,000 per year, which they have been getting every year since. When one contrasts what we did in providing an additional £2,500,000 per year since 1948 with the scrooge-like attitude of refusing to provide £500,000 to implement the 1947 motion, I think we are entitled to look back with pleasure and with a certain amount of pride on the achievements which the 1948 Bill brought to old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows and orphans throughout the country.  Let us see the way in which we provided old age pensions and blind pensions under that Act.</P>
      <P>In 1916 a British administration, hostile and alien though it was, paid old age pensioners at the rate of 10/- per week.  Between 1916 and 1948, a period of 32 years, the old age pensioners in the rural areas, and that is four-fifths of the old age pensioners of the country, received an increase of 2/6 per week in their pensions, making them 12/6 per week.  Therefore, 80 per cent. of the 149,000 old age pensioners had only 12/6 per week in 1948 as a right, and it took them 32 years to get the extra 2/6.  Within six months of taking office, the Social Welfare Bill, 1948, which I put through the Dáil, gave them an increase of 5/- per week, but those now responsible would give only 2/6 to old age pensioners in rural areas, that is 80 per cent. of the total number of old age pensioners.  I do not think that ours was a bad achievement. At any rate, it was better than anything that has been done before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being done now in the Social Welfare Bill which is before the Dáil is part and parcel of the plan which I had in mind for meeting old <Col N="1036" /> age pensions.  When Fianna Fáil comes to talk about its achievements in respect of old age pensions, let this be clear, that never before did so many old age pensioners and so many blind pensioners get such a substantial increase in their pensions as they got under the 1948 Act.  In so far as I had any hand, act or part in that, I look upon it as a credit-worthy achievement. So when the Minister strives to trip the Labour Party with not having done this or that, let him keep under his hat that we did more during three and a quarter years for old age pensioners than was ever done in the 32 years preceding our assumption of office, and that is not a bad achievement.</P>

      <P>The Minister said Deputy Norton in his Bill never proposed to give an old age pension at 65. What I proposed to do in the Social Welfare Bill for which I was responsible was this.  I was covering 750,000 workers, whether they worked for wages or salary, in a field or in a factory, in office or shop.  I was covering 750,000 men, women and employed boys and girls for insurance purposes under the Bill.  In so far as they were adult men and adult women I was covering their children as well.  In so far as they were married men I was covering their wives and children.  Therefore, a very substantial number, well in excess of a million, was being covered under the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I proposed in the case of the employed man or woman to give them the right to retire at 65 years of age if they wished to exercise it.  Nobody to-day can get an old age pension at 65, but they would be able to get a retirement pension at 65 under my Bill. To that extent I gave them old age pensions by providing for old age pensions or retirement pensions for them at 65 years of age.  The masses of the people who work for wages and salaries had within their grasp under my Bill&mdash;they could see it there in black and white&mdash;the right to retire on a pension with the dependent's allowance at 65 years of age.  That is gone <Col N="1037" /> now.  It is going forever if the disaster should happen that this Government is ever given responsibility for implementing a comprehensive Social Welfare Bill.  I would like to see the Bill in the House, and if the present Government is not badly rocked and shipwrecked before that, they will be shipwrecked on that Bill if they bring it back here without providing for retirement pensions at 65 years of age.</P>
    <P>My Bill gave every man employed for wages or salary the right to a pension at 65 years of age.  It did not matter who he worked for, how many he worked for, or what the varied character of his employment was.  So long as he worked he paid contributions and when he reached 65 years of age, he had not to find out who he worked for.  His age determined the right to retire on pension.  If that can be granted to other classes in the community even without contributions, what is untouchable about ordinary working men and women that they cannot get it?  What is wrong with paying it to ordinary men and women who are separated from the workhouse by their ability to earn a week's wages?  What is wrong with giving them the pension if it is right to give it to people who make no contribution whatever?  I hope we will get an explanation from some Deputy, particularly some Deputy who represents a Dublin working class constituency, who will tell me and tell them why it is undesirable to allow them the right to retire at 65 which we grant to many other sections of the community. At all events I promised retirement pensions at 65 and my Bill implemented that promise.  Having got a Government for which they never voted and do not want, the country is going to be refused the right of retirement pensions at 65 years of age.  The Minister accused Deputy Flanagan of delaying this Bill.  The Minister knows perfectly well that certain preliminary work has to be done before these pensions can be paid.</P>

      <P>And I take it that the Minister, who is so concerned about this matter, will support that amendment. Let me warn the Minister about a matter about which I warned him last night and which he did not seem to understand.  Under the Army pensions regulations, persons are entitled to special allowances, provided their income does not exceed a certain limit or provided their income, if it amounts to a certain sum, does not, with the special allowance, exceed an overall maximum.  Unless there is complementary defence legislation in respect of this Bill, you cannot give effect to the provisions relating to the special allowances payable under the Army Pensions Act, and, if the Minister makes inquiries from his officials, he will find that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this thing examined home.  Under the Army Pensions Act, a man may be entitled to a special allowance of up to £97 in a year.  If we give him an old age pension at present, the old age pension is taken into consideration against him and he gets only the difference between the old age pension and the £97.  Will the Minister deny that that is correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct and cannot be challenged.  This Bill says that a man who has a special allowance will have that allowance disregarded as to £80 of it when he is looking for an old age pension, so that, if a man has £80 special allowance and seeks an old age pension, the £80 is disregarded; but the Army Pensions Act does not say that if he has an old age pension that old age pension is disregarded.  The Army Pensions Act takes into consideration his old age pension and unless you get the complementary legislation from the Department of Defence, the more you give him in old age pension, the less he will get on the special allowance, if he is entitled to it.  It, therefore, will need complementary legislation and the Minister ought to realise it.  I know it so well because I pointed out the fact to the Minister for Defence when I was dealing with the Second Stage of the Bill and the Minister for Defence, I know, approached the Department of Finance at that time with a view to getting that complementary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is portion of the Bill we offered to the House on 2nd March last.  It is not as big or as widespread a Bill.  It does not provide the same coverage as we provided, but it is a good part of a good Bill and to the extent to which it improves the lot of old age pensioners and blind pensioners, to the extent to which it eases the burden on people who are in receipt of wound or disability pensions and does not reckon against the old age pensioner the small sums he receives from charitable organisations &mdash;all proposals which I initiated as Minister&mdash;it has our goodwill and our benediction; but let the Minister <Col N="1040" /> realise that all he is doing is implementing a Bill which is our unaltered declaration of policy and which we would have introduced as part and parcel of the comprehensive Bill.  Let me mark this for the Minister's observation: the old age pension portion of this Bill would have come into operation long before the main Bill.  If the Minister doubts that, let him consult his officials and let him call for the minutes of a conference which I held in the Department of Social Welfare within the past three months at which I told my officials to anticipate the passage of this section of the Bill and to get on with the job of printing the new old age pension Orders and doing everything possible to implement the scheme, so far as old age pensioners were concerned, at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a copy of this Bill, when it has been passed, should be sent to every old age pensioner in the country in memory of good times because it is the last of its character that will ever be passed here while Fianna Fáil are in office.  It is a Bill which brings a certain amount of relief, but for which the present Minister can claim no credit.  That has been repeatedly said from this side and I am saying it again.  I want to express my complete dissatisfaction and I want to have registered on the records of the House my complete disapproval of the fact that the Minister and the set-up with which he is associated have deprived the people of the right to pensions at the age of 65. There can be no doubt whatever that the Minister and his supporters and followers in the House have departed for all time from the principle of providing pensions for people at the age of 65.  I quote from the Official Records of the House of 20th June last, column 230:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. MacBride: Did I gather from the Minister that it is the intention to drop the retirement allowances at 65 years of age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: Yes.  When dealing with this matter on the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill introduced by the last Government, I said that <Col N="1041" /> my alternative proposal was that between 65 and 70 a man would receive unemployment insurance or sickness benefit at the same level as retiring allowances.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That statement was made and it is right that it should go out from this House, on the word of the Minister, that, so far as the people are concerned, while the present set-up holds office, there can be no pensions payable at the age of 65.  I find it hard to grasp what the Minister means and would like to know what rate of sickness or unemployment benefit people are to get when they reach 65.  As Deputy Norton pointed out a moment ago, assuming a citizen is not ill, will the Minister press sickness benefit on him?  If he is employed in a job where the salary is so small that he cannot provide for himself, and if between 60 and 65 he is no longer fit for heavy and hard work, what allowance does he get from the unemployment benefits that the Minister tells us he is going to receive?</P>

I read that in the <Col N="1043" /> morning papers.  I now assure him that if he is anxious they should not be at a loss, as a result of this Bill being delayed in its passage through the House, it is in the hands of himself and his followers, comprising the set-up of which he is Minister, to give those allowances from the 13th June last, or from whatever day he so desires.  I doubt that there will be one word uttered from these benches as a protest against the Minister making those allowances payable from the 13th June last, or even, if he is so generous, if he agrees to give those allowances for the past three months.  I again assure him that, if it is his intention to have those payments retrospective to any particular day, when he so suddenly finds himself as the champion and the only man who has a sincere interest in the old age pensioners, he can display that interest by letting the old age pensioners see how honest and sincere he is.  He can improve their conditions by paying them these allowances as from the 1st June.  Then there can be no blame on Deputy Norton, Deputy Flanagan or any other Deputy for depriving them of anything, as a result of this legislation being properly scrutinised here before it is passed through the House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Did I gather from the Minister that it is the intention to drop the retirement allowances at 65 years of age?</P>
      <P>Dr. Ryan: Yes.  When dealing with this matter on the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill introduced by the last Government I said that my alternative proposal was that between 65 and 70 a man would receive unemployment insurance or sickness benefit at the same level as retiring allowances and that the allowances would be given at 70 instead of 65.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I said that I did not agree with giving retirement allowances to a man between 65 and 70.  If an insured person is unemployed he gets unemployment benefit.  The reason I said that was that while it may be hard for a man to get work he will get unemployment benefit and if he is sick he will get sickness benefit.  I said that I would make it easier for a man to qualify for unemployment and sickness benefit.  Deputy Norton said and repeated twice that I said I would give sickness benefit to a man whether he was sick or not.  I never said any such thing.  If Deputy Norton wants to ram that down the throats of his followers in order to get a few more votes than he got at the last election let him have it.</P>

      <P>And lost three seats.  Why have we this misrepresentation?  What is Deputy Norton's motive?  Is it going to do the old age pensioners any good or the people between 65 and 70?  Is it not only Party politics to try to get some benefit out of this misrepresentation? Will Party politics do the people any good?  That is the only object Deputy Norton has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a few of these points again.  There is one thing which <Col N="1048" /> Deputies do not understand, and that is quite evident from Deputy Flanagan's speech although he got right on it in the end.  The point is that there is a difference between old age pensions and contributory pensions, as we understand them.  I do not know, if you go to a dictionary, that you will find a difference, but in legislation, as we understand them, there is a difference. Old age pensions have been paid for years to people who qualified for them and they are paid out of taxation without any contributions.  Retirement allowances are paid or will be paid to those who contribute to them and we must keep that in mind.  No Government in this country, neither the inter-Party, the Fianna Fáil nor any other Government ever proposed that old age pensions should be paid at a lower age than 70.  It was never proposed that they should be paid at 65.  We are dealing with an Old Age Pensions Bill and it is altogether beside the point for Deputies to say: &ldquo;Why do you not pay them at 65 as was promised or provided by So-and-so?&rdquo; because no such thing was ever promised or provided.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear.  Old age pensions were never paid at a lower age than 70 and it was never promised by any Government that they should be paid at a lower age.  Retirement allowances are a different matter.  It was proposed in the Bill brought in by Deputy Norton, then Minister, that retirement allowances should be paid at 65 and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I said that I did not agree.  Deputy Flanagan wants to know why.  I gave my reasons on that occasion.  I said, first of all, that it would be a big burden on the people who pay for them, that is, the workers themselves who pay a considerable part, and the employers who pay the rest.  I held, therefore, that it should not be done unless it was necessary.  I said that from statistics it could be found that there would be a very high proportion of the population over 65 years of age from this on.  I was not able to lay my hand on it but in some paper read, I think, at the Statistics Society, I saw that a very high percentage of the population would be over 65 in 25 <Col N="1049" /> years' time.  When Deputy Norton was Minister he could have found that. Perhaps I could find it but I have not got it yet.  I said, what is more, that the health of the people is improving as time goes on.</P>
    <P>These chronic diseases which prevented men from working into their old age are gradually disappearing. Rheumatism, bronchitis, digestive diseases and bad stomachs are not so prevalent as they were.  Things are improving, and men are able to work better now than they were in the past. I gave all these reasons.  My only objective was to encourage men to go on working between 65 and 70 years of age rather than discourage them.  I pointed out that in the scheme brought in by Deputy Norton a man was discouraged from working from 65 to 70 because if he got sick he got no sickness benefit, and if he became unemployed for a month or so he got no unemployment benefit, and he would, therefore, be forced to fall back on the retiring allowance if he became sick or unemployed.  These were the reasons I gave.  They can be argued between one Party and another.  There may be men in my own Party who do not agree with me, and there may be men on the other side of the House who do agree with me.  However, it is not a matter that should be made a gospel for any Party; it should be argued amongst ourselves in order to enable us to discover the best thing to do.  I am not afraid of Deputy Norton's making this an issue for the country.  I should not be afraid, if it could be arranged, to take a referendum of the working men of this country&mdash;even, if you like, of those who are over 45 or 50&mdash;and to ask them if they agree with Deputy Norton's provisions or with my provisions.</P>

It only shows the mind and the disappointment of Deputy Flanagan that this Government is here and that he is sitting on the Opposition Benches. It does not show anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton talked about my retreat from something that was promised in 1948, namely, retiring allowances at 65.  As I explained here <Col N="1051" /> last night, if the Fianna Fáil Party came to the conclusion, in the course of the three years, that it would be better, in the light of further knowledge, to provide that men should work until 70, if possible, and if they are able to work until that age&mdash;and if they brought that in as an amendment to the scheme proposed by Deputy Norton when he was a Minister&mdash;surely no great fault can be found with the Party if they asked less when in opposition than they were prepared to give when they were in Office.  It is usually the other way round.  We asked less when in opposition, according to Deputy Norton, than we promised as a Government.  When that was published our scheme was well known to the country.  The canvassers of the Labour Party did not neglect to make that known&mdash;without putting it, perhaps, to the voters in the best light, either, from our point of view.  Even so, we got on all right&mdash;better than the Labour Party.</P>

If we could combine here and do the best we can for social welfare, surely it would be better than misquoting one another and trying to put the blame on the other person for what was not done and taking credit for what is done on both sides.  I hope we will get down to a better basis of work in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton was in the House last night when I was talking and he must have heard what I said.  Yet he comes along again and wants to know why I did not bring in the means test I promised on the discussion here in March. Deputy Norton brought in that comprehensive Bill.  He put in these proposals that are here&mdash;they are practically the same: there is only a slight change&mdash;into his Bill in a hurried manner.  Deputy Norton knows very well that I spoke on that motion from the point of view of making a full comprehensive scheme.  When Deputy Norton brought along these proposals, <Col N="1053" /> some of the people on our side&mdash;some of the Independents and others&mdash;said: &ldquo;Keep them aside and put them into operation immediately.&rdquo;  It is because we agreed that these old age pension proposals should be put aside at that time and put into operation immediately that we did so when we became a Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave three points on the means test on that occasion.  I said (1) that those who were insured would get the old age pension without any reference to means; (2) those who were less than £25 valuation would get a pension without reference to means. Where they have now to make over the farm, when the new scheme comes into effect they will not have to do so; and (3) I said £100 in cash.  Deputy Norton says that in my Second Reading speech I gave the impression&mdash;I admit I did&mdash;that he will get the full old age pension as well as £100 means.  When I came to put in my amendment to that Bill, the £100 was the top limit of means.  I suppose Deputies know what happened there.  The Party to which I belong decided that £100 should be the top limit.  I forget what was the lower limit, but I put my foot in it, if you like.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton was a member of the last Government which drew up the ten points.  One of the ten points was that the means test would be materially modified.  I think that all the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, when they went to the election, claimed that they had succeeded in covering a number of those points, including the one to modify the means test.  As far as an old age pensioner is concerned, if he had over 6/- a week before the Coalition Government came into office his old age pension was mitigated to some extent.  Under this proposal it is 8/6 a week.</P>
      <P>With regard to a motion brought in in 1947&mdash;there may be some Deputies present who were not here last night. Deputy O. Flanagan is here&mdash;I said last night that I was Minister when that motion was brought in by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  Deputy Norton did not speak on it but he voted.  Ever since October, 1947, Deputy Norton has again and again drawn attention to the fact that I voted against this motion, as did all the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I suppose that every Deputy opposite is under the impression that Deputy Norton sincerely voted for that motion.  If a man is sincere and if he goes on for years afterwards accusing his opponents of doing some wrong in voting against him, then when that man becomes a Minister should he not have made the matter right?  Is not that a fair question to put to Deputy Norton?  I put that question to him last night and again he is mentioning the thing to-day. Is there any way of curing Deputy Norton of his misrepresentations in these matters?  I put it to the gentlemen of the jury on that side that if I am accused by Deputy Norton over and over again of doing the wrong thing in 1947 and if he claims he did the right thing, is it not only fair that he should have made things right when he became Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were these matters?  They were <Col N="1055" /> (1) he wanted to have the means test altered in this respect, that gratuities paid to a pensioner by members of his or her family, whether in cash or in kind, should not be counted.  He never referred to that.  Why?  Because it was done already.  The second point concerned any benefits received otherwise than in actual cash.  He did not bring that in either, because it was done already.  Thus, as I pointed out on that occasion, two points out of the three were already covered.  The third point was that casual moneys earned by the pensioner should not be taken into account in assessing the means test.  I remember at the time giving the example that you might have a retired journalist over 70 who could earn big money casually.  If we are going to have a means test we cannot permit that.  Over and over again, Deputy Norton has given as an example of our unsympathetic treatment of old age pensions the fact that we voted against that motion in 1947.</P>
    <P>Yet he never referred to that in any of his legislation because, when he became Minister, he had sensible officials to advise him.  They told him that it would be madness to put that in.  I must say for Deputy Norton that he did take the advice of his officials as a rule.  Deputy Norton refers to the motion of October, 1947, and I am sure he will refer to it again because he is incurable.  He has got a set speech on social welfare and I come into it in several places.  He is like the man who has learned a prayer, unless he goes through it quickly he will go astray.</P>
    <P>I said here last night that I complimented Deputy Norton on maintaining the progress set by Fianna Fáil.  I gave him the figures.  Let Deputy Flanagan look up those figures. He need not laugh.  Deputy Flanagan will find these figures correct.  If he puts down a question, I will give him the figures.  During 16 years in office, Fianna Fáil increased its expenditure each year on social welfare by £500,000.</P>

      <P>Social services increased by £8,000,000; that is equivalent to £500,000 per year over 16 years. Deputy Norton kept up that level.  He increased expenditure during his three years in office by £1,500,000, which is equivalent to £500,000 per year over three years.  He kept up the high standard we had achieved during his three years.  I do not believe he would have kept it up for 16 years.  It is no mean achievement, perhaps, for a man of Deputy Norton's capacity to maintain for three years what Fianna Fáil maintained for 16 years.  He said himself that he gave £2,500,000 to the old age pensioners.  One might be tempted to ask where then is the £1,500,000 in three years.  Let me explain.  In 1947 we gave increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The bargain was that he would give more to the old age pensioners but, in order to balance that, he would take in more in contributions from those who were insured against sickness, unemployment and so on.  He took exactly £1,000,000 off them each year in lieu of what he gave to the old age pensioners. Old age pensions are the only item relevant for discussion under this Bill, but social welfare covers the sick, unemployed, children's allowances and other things.  Taking them all round, Deputy Norton did just as well in his three years in office as Fianna Fáil did each year during their 16 years in office.</P>

Is it not fairly obvious that they will continue to go up if there is any change at all?  It is absurd then for a Deputy to accuse me of being puerile.  It is puerile that an ex-Minister should claim that he brought the old age pensioners up higher than they ever were before.  I could make the same claim for sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, children's allowances and other things.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made some statements in his attempt to defend his running away from his own proposals to modify the means test which cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged. I do not propose to allow those statements to pass unchallenged. The Minister is endeavouring to vilify Deputy Oliver Flanagan by saying that he is responsible for delaying this Bill for a week.  Nobody but a registered fool would believe that because it is quite an easy matter for the Minister on the Committee or the Report Stage of this Bill to say that any pensions granted under Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 will be granted and have effect as on and from 13th June.  I propose to give the Minister an opportunity of considering and accepting an amendment of that character in order to ensure that the people affected will get the increased benefits as on and from 13th June.  If the Minister has an abundance of tears to shed for the old age pensioners, I am sure he can spare some of them to wash away his normal objections to an amendment of that kind.  We can ensure this evening, tomorrow or next week that nobody will suffer one penny loss by the simple expedient of putting an amendment into this Bill stipulating that everybody who gets an increase under this Bill will get it from the day on which the Minister for Social Welfare introduced the Bill or made his Second Reading speech.  Payment can be ante-dated to that date.  There is no insuperable difficulty in doing that.  So, let us bury that phantom while appreciating that it is merely something put up to play upon the fears of the credulous &ldquo;old maids&rdquo; of both sexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no justification whatever for <Col N="1060" /> a statement of that kind.  I wonder what would have happened in 1948 if, by any chance, Fianna Fáil had been returned to office?  We were told by Deputy Lemass in 1948 that Fianna Fáil had a social security plan.  We were told that all the details had been worked out.  If it were true that Fianna Fáil had a scheme for the payment of retiring pensions at 65 in 1948, presumably that clause was in the plan.  Was it in the plan then?  If Fianna Fáil had been returned in 1948 would they have implemented the plan for retiring pensions at 65?  The Minister for Social Welfare said they will not implement it now.  Would they have implemented it in 1948?  If it was right in 1948, what makes it wrong to do in 1951 what they promised to do in 1948?  I suspect there is more than meets the eye in the objection to providing a retiring pension at 65. I am painfully aware of the fact that the big private insurance companies are opposed to a plan to provide pensions at 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You have heaps of time. We can sit until 10.30 to-night and to-morrow again.  If it is right for private insurance companies to invite people to pay premiums in order that they can get a pension at 65 years of age and thus be enabled to provide for themselves, what is wrong with permitting an ordinary working man in receipt of a weekly wage, possibly a low wage, to pay his small weekly contribution with the rest of the community to a State insurance scheme, aided by his employer and aided by his State, to get his modest pension at 65 years of age because he is not able to pay the substantial contributions that would be necessary if he were to ask a private insurance company, with its tests for age and its tests for health, to provide for him by their high premium charges?  If the ordinary well-to-do person thinks it wise and good business to provide for the payment of a pension to himself from an insurance company at 65 and to pay premiums of £50 to £100 a year for that purpose, why not let the ordinary working man insure through the State so that he may get the modest pension which would render him independent to some degree at 65?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is going to be jettisoned so far as the Minister is concerned.  That promise is going to be abandoned. That is going to be a ghost to the Minister in the house of Social Welfare in future.  I want to know what is inherently wrong in permitting an ordinary working man getting a retirement pension at 65 when we are providing that substantial sections of the community can get that without any contributions whatever?  Why should not the ordinary working man be given similar facility to render himself in some degree independent, and in some <Col N="1062" /> measure less an object of pity and charity, as he inevitably would be when he reaches an advanced age and is no longer able to make provision for himself by his own exertions?</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the diminution in the incidence of certain diseases.  He said they were not as bad now as they were three years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear that you meant three years ago because you thought the scheme necessary three years ago?  You said you were going to give them retirement pensions three years ago and that it was necessary to give them retirement pensions then. Now you think it is not necessary. People are just blobs of uranium.  I suppose that after another three years we shall be told that at 90 they are cross-country runners, they are so healthy at 65 for the purpose of throwing out this scheme.  Does not everybody know that with machinery developed to the stage which it has reached to-day, with one industry after another going over to methods of mechanisation and rationalisation, it is harder for the elderly worker to keep his place in industry?  Let anyone go into a cotton mill and see the position of the woman worker at 60 years of age, where the standard of speed is not regulated by the desire or the will of the woman to work but by the speed at which the machine works.  Let anybody go into a woollen mill or any other type of factory which is highly mechanised and he will see how difficult it is for the elderly worker to keep his place in that industry and how hard it is to get back to it, if he should ever lose his place in it.  It is because these are everyday considerations in thousands of homes up and down the country that it is necessary that the State should provide some method for the ordinary worker, whilst he is working, to cover himself against the inevitable risk that one day he will lose his place in industry so that when that day arrives he will at least have made provision for his old age with the assistance of the State and thus at <Col N="1063" /> least maintain a measure of his independence.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us, in the course of his efforts to extricate himself from the embarrassing position in which he finds himself as a result of having run away from his promises on the means test, that we have not done certain things in respect to a modification of the means test.  Let me say this to the Minister.  There was no modification in the means test from 1932 until we modified it in 1948.  For a period of 16 years there was no modification in the means test.  We modified it once in 1948 and, as this Bill shows, we had made provision for a further modification now so that within a period of three years we made two modifications in the means test for old age pension purposes.  There was not one modification in the years between 1933 and 1948.  That cannot be denied.  What is the effect of it? When we went into office, a person with 16/- a week could get no old age pension whatever.  Under the Bill before the Dáil, the Bill fashioned by us and planned by us, a person can have £1 per week and get an old age pension of 10/-.  Is not that a considerable improvement on the 1948 position which we found there?</P>
      <P>Finally, let me deal with one point. The Minister said that I took the advice of my officials.  In so far as that advice was good, I took it.  In so far as I did not like it, and it did not run in line with my policy, I rejected it.  One of the things that astounded me when I went into the Department of Social Welfare was to be told by officials, when I wanted to introduce the 1948 Bill to increase old age pensions, to increase widows' and orphans' pensions, to increase blind pensions, that my predecessor had been persuaded not to embark on that course until they got after the comprehensive scheme, and at that stage there was no determined comprehensive scheme in the Department, and the Minister clearly indicates it by showing that in 1951 he has thrown over what he promised to do in 1948, and which he did not enshrine in proposals in 1948.</P>

The only situation under which all stages can now be given is that the Minister publicly states here that whatever <Col N="1071" /> apprehension he has about a loss of £5,000 caused to the old age pensioners by Deputy Flanagan's speech is not justified because he is now getting the full facility of this House to have all stages.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath is right. I said that the extra 2/6 will not be affected because preparations are being made and that is governed by the appointed day but the extra money that will be given on account of the alterations of the means test to special allowance people and in the case of disability pensions would come into effect immediately the Bill is passed.  I said that Deputy Flanagan had delayed that by a week.  If, as Deputy Collins said, we get the remaining stages now, I suppose we will have made up for that loss and it will be all right.</P>

The Minister would know perfectly well that, regardless of whether it was finally discussed last week on the Second Stage or not, it could not have been passed through all its stages until this week.  The Minister must know that, having regard to the date on which it was circulated, it could not have been passed with any proper consideration of its terms until this week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I want to state our attitude to this Estimate.  It was framed by the previous Government and, in common with any other Estimate that was prepared by us, we are prepared to agree to its passing.  Consequently, we do not intend to divide the House on it.  It is true that, to some extent, this Estimate differs from the Estimate which was approved by the previous Government.  The Minister, in his opening speech, omitted to indicate in any way what the Government's policy on agriculture was, or would be, with the exception of milk.  I suppose it is reasonable to assume&mdash;the Minister is new to ministerial office&mdash;that it might be expecting too much to ask for a full statement on agricultural policy.  The debate has now lasted for over a week. Now that the Minister has got over his initial surprise at being appointed Minister, and with the benediction of <Col N="1074" /> all sides of the House in wishing him success in his appointment, the House, I think, is entitled to expect a statement on agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party is opposed to the proposal to increase the price of butter.  That matter can be more appropriately raised on another Estimate. In pursuance of the agreement which has been reached to conclude the business by the 19th of this month, further opportunities will be available for discussion of that question on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.  There is only one matter on which, I think, we are entitled to some explanation from the Government, and that is the rapid decision to abandon compulsory tillage.  As I understood the Minister's policy, stated here when he was an Opposition Deputy on the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture which, as Deputies will remember was somewhat protracted, he then announced himself in favour of compulsory tillage.  I think that any Deputy is entitled to change his mind, but when he changes his mind he should say that he has changed his mind.  As we understand it, Deputy Lemass, as he then was, went to Tipperary in the course of the general election, and announced that Fianna Fáil were not in favour of compulsory tillage in peace times.  That announcement coincided with the alteration of Fianna Fáil policy on compulsory tillage. I suppose it is reasonable to infer that they were finding the going a bit sticky, and it was deemed desirable that Deputy Lemass, or somebody else, should go to some rural area and make that pronouncement.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the present Government has retreated on so many fronts makes it difficult for one to keep up with its various changes in policy, but, before the debate concludes, I think the House is entitled to some information as to the manner in which the present Government abandoned compulsory tillage, because it was one of the main planks in the programme of the Fianna Fáil Party when in opposition, and as late as the discussion on the previous Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>If one makes a study of history one does find that certain single individuals have to hold the fort, and I happen to be in that position at the moment.  I should just like to make one comment in regard to milk and the price of milk, and the price of butter as a result of the increased price of milk.  I agree with what Deputy Dillon stated very often in the House that it is essential that the milk yield of dairy cattle should be increased and that, from the point of view of the dairy farmer, it is much better that he should have another 100 or 150 gallons a year of milk produced from his dairy cow than that he should get, say, a penny increase in the price of milk.  I think that is perfectly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Dillon was perfectly right in his efforts to increase the milk yield of the dairy herds, he must realise, and everybody else must realise, that that cannot be done in a day, a week or a month.  It requires a considerable time to bring about that change, that increase in the yield of <Col N="1078" /> the dairy herds.  If the dairy farmers were unable to make ends meet on the present milk production of the herds, it was no use to say to them: &ldquo;You will just have to struggle along until such time as you increase the yield by 100 or 150 gallons per cow.&rdquo;  I think that the Minister was right in his immediate step to give an increase in the price of milk.  At the same time, I hope he and the farmers concerned will see sound common sense, philosophy, if you like, in the teaching of Deputy Dillon, that we must increase the milk yield of our dairy herds and our dairy cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that to the practical farmers in the House.  I am only putting forward my point of view as to what I think is necessary. Clearly it is ridiculous to be feeding cows giving 300 gallons of milk when you can, with the same amount of feeding, get cows that will give you 500 gallons of milk.  However, that is a matter that will require a commonsense approach, in which a good deal of the teaching of Deputy Dillon will have to be followed and in which the sound common sense of the present Minister will be joined together with the enthusiastic co-operation of the dairy farmers all over the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting forward a point of view that seems to me to be eminently sensible.  Perhaps, it is not sensible, but it seems sensible to me, at any rate.  As a city Deputy, naturally, I did not welcome the recent increase in the price of butter.  I would much <Col N="1079" /> prefer if the Minister and the Government had taken the decision to carry that increase by means of subvention or assistance from the Central Fund rather than by charging it entirely on the consumer.  Our city people must realise, and everybody who buys butter must realise, that if the producer is to get a just price the consumer will have to pay, whether he pays directly or indirectly.  I asked the last Minister for Finance, on one occasion, if he could give me figures as to how the subsidies affected individuals, whether the individual benefits by having these subsidies collected in general taxation and paid out to the producers, or whether the consumer would, in fact, be better off if he had to pay directly over the counter for the increase in the price of the commodity.  I was never able to get the figures, and I have certain doubts about the whole matter myself.</P>
      <P>I do think that every person, particularly workers who have got increased wages in the years since the war, should realise that, when agricultural workers have got an increase in their wages, when the price of feeding stuffs have gone up and the price of commodities to the farmers have gone up, it follows that there must be an increase in the price of the articles that the farmer himself produces.  Consequently, while we city people object strenuously to any increase in the price of feeding stuffs, we realise that this Irish community is not only a community of city dwellers, but a community of city dwellers and of rural dwellers.  We also realise there must be co-operation between all sides and if it is necessary to give increased prices to the farmer, and particularly to the dairy farmer, that this increase must be borne by the consumer whether he lives in the city or in the country.</P>
      <P>These are only some scattered thoughts of mine on this problem of agriculture.  I simply intervened for the purpose of wishing the new Minister every success in a very difficult, a very onerous and a very responsible task.</P>

I am anxious to elicit positive information from the Minister on certain facets of agricultural policy.  I want to know, in the first instance, whether he proposes to continue and develop the ideas of his predecessor with regard to the replacement of uneconomic cows by two-year-old in-calf heifers and whether he also intends, as an adjunct to that scheme, to continue the expansion of artificial insemination centres for the purpose of improving the milk yield.  In addition we desire to know, in a positive way, whether there are any strings attached to the Minister's abandonment of compulsory tillage.  One of his recent speeches left the door open to himself to beat a hasty retreat if he so desires, because he suggested that his Party was not in favour of compulsory tillage unless certain conditions arose.  Will the Minister indicate to us how the circumstances under which he would endeavour to justify the policy of compulsory tillage again and whether the speech to which we listened here recently still reflects his real mind as distinct from his ministerial presentation now?</P>
      <P>We are anxious to know if the Minister proposes to continue and develop the schemes already in operation and particularly the scheme in connection with the improvement of grasslands and the expansion of the ground limestone scheme.  We are anxious to get not negative assertions from the Minister. We want to know, if he proposes changes in the general approach to agriculture, what those changes are. We are anxious to know what particular facet of the former Minister's policy he disagrees with and in what particular way he proposes to change it. These are our Estimates as the Minister has said and we do not propose to divide on them, but at a later stage, on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach, in the full debate on Government policy, we intend to raise certain issues with regard to agriculture; but we must at this stage have a statement from the Minister as to whether or not he has become a convert to the Dillon approach to agriculture or whether he has some peculiar Walshian views of his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> The people, and particularly the farming community who are sensitive to changes of Government, may be experiencing an unnecessary amount of unrest.  That unrest can be allayed very readily by a policy and effective statement by the Minister as to what his policy is going to be.  We have not been exactly reassured by the vagueness of the statement by the Taoiseach that England would get stuff if she paid prices.  The Minister, to allay unrest in the country, will have to take an early opportunity of assuring the agricultural community that we are not going to start another economic war and chase will-o'-the-wisp markets in continental countries.</P>

There is unrest and we want an assurance&mdash;I think it is due to the House and to the country&mdash;from the Minister that he is not going lightly to interfere with long-term agreements and long-term policy which is already bearing fruit in the content and prosperity of the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan has objected to the increase in the price of butter.  I want to know from the Minister if the penny is the best he could do.  He was contemptuous of the action of the late Government.  He and Deputy Corry vied with each other in being cynical about that penny, and grandiose and fluent promises emanated from Fianna Fáil and their new satellite, feather No. 1, Deputy Cogan, about 3d. and 4d. per gallon for milk.  It was no trouble at all&mdash;&ldquo;The minute we get in we will give it to you.&rdquo;  I wonder does Deputy Cogan, in his heart, now feel the same cynicism with regard to this Minister's penny as he did with regard to ours.  Is this penny the maximum proportion of <Col N="1082" /> the grandiose promises the milk producers can expect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Chair.  It is only a short ten weeks since the Minister for Agriculture, then <Col N="1083" /> Deputy Walsh, was preaching a very different story here.  I am not interested in what Deputy Walsh was then. I am interested in Deputy Walsh now as Minister for Agriculture making a statement as to what changes or departures he intends to make and having the courage to say, as he can and should say, in the interests of the agricultural community, that much of what he said about Deputy Dillon's policy was the invective and satire of politics directed against what was, in fact, a sound agricultural policy for the Irish people.</P>
      <P>We want information from the new Minister as to whether he intends to develop and bring to fruition many of the experiments started by his predecessor. We want to know how soon will we have&mdash;and what nature it will take&mdash;a development of veterinary services throughout the country.  We want to know whether it would be possible to conceive, as there must ultimately be conceived, a plan whereby veterinary services will be made available to people of very limited means and with very limited stock at no cost &mdash;perhaps on the basis of a veterinary dispensary.</P>
      <P>We want to know, not in any spirit of acrimony or with any desire to give rise to heat, what his approach to the problem of cereals is going to be.  Is he going to indicate fixed prices over a range of cereals, and is he going to indicate these fixed prices for a period, or is he going to embark on a willynilly type of policy which will not enable the farmer, on the basis of guarantees of time and price, to plan his economy?  We want to know whether the farmer coming out of a period of government in which he got not all done for him but a great improvement in his economy, can expect a continuation of the type of outlook that enabled him to build a sensible economy on the basis of sound economic planning.  We want to know if there is to be a continuation of help and of encouragement as distinct from coercion and interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to know whether the growing self-respect and the position of importance which the farmer has rightfully got in society is going to continue. <Col N="1084" /> We want this information to be given in a positive ministerial statement by a Minister with a background of agricultural education and practical farming.  We want him to give it in a forthright, straightforward way so that the farming community may know what the plan is.  We do not mind if you take all our plan and add a few trimmings to it, but at least tell us what that plan is, so that the unrest which the farmer and farm worker are feeling will be allayed.</P>
    <P>We want to know, and to know quickly, what his attitude is going to be towards the poultry and turkey trade during the coming Christmas. Will he give an assurance to the people that he will not impose controls or any type of prohibition on the conditions of sale and marketing which existed in respect of these commodities last year? In a situation in which there is a scarcity of turkeys&mdash;considerable difficulties have arisen in regard to the feeding of young turkeys and there has been a high mortality rate&mdash;is he going to clamp down on whatever profits might be available to the turkey breeder?  The position is that the Minister has a chance of putting himself right, apart from putting the House right, in the country if he comes forth with a courageous and forthright statement of policy and not a mere indication by way of accident of a change of heart here and there.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister in his reply to give us an emphatic and positive statement of what his approach to agriculture is going to be.  I will say this to the Minister in all sincerity, on my own behalf and on behalf of my Party, that, if he approaches it in the right way, if he intends to improve, by way of a continuation of the grants and the many other beneficial schemes in operation, the improvement of credit facilities and so on, the lot of the farming community, he will have the whole-hearted benediction of this Party and our wishes for his success in his office, be his period there long or short, will be crystallised into reality by a conscientious support of every advance he makes which is of positive benefit to the rural community.</P>

      <P>I want to <Col N="1085" /> offer my personal congratulations to the new Minister and to wish him luck in the tremendous task he has undertaken in accepting the office of Minister for Agriculture.  I want also to say that, so far as this Party is concerned, he will have our utmost co-operation when we believe that he is acting in accordance with the policy for which we in this Party stand.  I should like also to congratulate Deputy Cowan on his explanation of his reason for supporting this Estimate.  On behalf of our Party, I have to say that we are challenging a division and voting against the Estimate and if Deputy Cowan is the great Labour man he professed to be to-night, I trust he will follow the Labour Party into the Division Lobby.  It was an admirable effort by Deputy Cowan to try to sit between two stools.  He may imagine he succeeded in performing that feat, but I think he is recognised here; and I am sure he will be recognised in his constituency and in the city, as having failed miserably and fallen very heavily between these two stools.</P>
      <P>We are opposing this Estimate and our opposition to it will not be a condemnation of the policy pursued by the former Minister or the policy of the Government for the past three-and-a-half years.  We in the Labour Party, and more especially when on the Government side, opposed Deputy Dillon as Minister in many of the things he said and did, but by and large and over all&mdash;I want to repeat this&mdash;I consider him to be the best Minister for Agriculture this country has seen.  Deputy Corry may take exception to that and may regard my speech as the speech of a townsman, but at least I go through my constituency and I have been in other constituencies and I know that the most dishonest farmer in this State will agree that over the past three-and-a-half years advances have been made such as were never made in a similar period since an Irish government took over here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheorais</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry can make his smart points and <Col N="1086" /> play to the gallery with interjections of that type, but he must agree that great advances were made in these three-and-a-half years.  He may have taken exception to things which were done and Fianna Fáil may have taken exception to things which were done, but the main opposition by Fianna Fáil to any measure dealing with agriculture introduced during that period was not so much to the policy as to the person who introduced it.</P>
      <P>We are opposing this Estimate because the price of butter has been increased.  I remember that, in the general election campaign, Fianna Fáil made great play with the increased cost of living, with the accent on the increased cost of butter, and many of their advertisements will show that butter is mentioned as one of the things in respect of which the Government of the day was blamed in connection with the increased cost of living.  If Fianna Fáil were sincere in their plea that the Government were responsible for increasing the cost of living by increasing the price of creamery milk and consequently the price of butter, I do not think it was fair to those who sent them into Dáil Éireann that one of their very first acts should be to increase the price of creamery milk and consequently the price of butter.</P>
      <P>That is why I say that Deputy Cowan is dishonest with himself, if he does not&mdash;and he describes himself as a free and independent Deputy&mdash;walk into the Division Lobby with the Labour Party.  He has paid his tribute to Deputy Dillon and if he should think that the people of Dublin or of the country would interpret his action in voting against the Estimate as a disapproval of the policy of the Minister, he need not be under any illusion or misapprehension, because he can state, as I am now stating, that I am voting against the Estimate because of the introduction of this new proposal by the Minister to increase the price of butter by increasing the price of creamery milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy with the farmers. I do not believe that it is on creamery milk alone the farmers live and I do not believe that this is an opportune <Col N="1087" /> time to transfer that increase to the consumers.  The farmers live by and produce other commodities, and, so far as the past three-and-a-half years are concerned, the farmers have done reasonably well and have done better than the people in the towns and cities who are expected to pay this increased price for butter.  That is as much as I have to say on that matter, except to indicate again that we propose to challenge a division and to vote against this Estimate because the price of butter has been increased.</P>
    <P>I want to give a small piece of advice to the Minister.  It relates to a matter in which I was particularly interested during my short term in the Custom House, the matter of drainage.  The local authorities works schemes operated by the county council took some time to get under way and it took the county councils some time to prepare and arrange the schemes so that they would dovetail into the general scheme of drainage which the Government proposed to operate and which, I assume, the present Government propose to continue.  Some months ago I wanted to see closer co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and Local Government because as I know, as Deputy Allen knows and as other Deputies from Wexford know, many farmers were prevented from availing of the grant under the land rehabilitation scheme because certain rivers were not drained, widened or deepened and generally were incapable of taking the water that would be drained off the farmers' land.  If there was discussion with the officials of the Department of Agriculture who were responsible for the land rehabilitation project they could give very good advice and a great deal of co-operation and help to the county engineer and staff with regard to drainage because they could point out the benefits that would accrue if a certain stream were drained, deepened or widened and they could show where drainage work on a particular river would help farmers who wanted to avail of the drainage grants under the rehabilitation scheme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that if <Col N="1088" /> nothing else were done as an improvement in the agricultural sphere in the last 12 months two things were done which were very important, and for which we in the Labour Party had striven for a very long time.  One is the granting of a week's holiday to farm labourers.  We never made any bones about it, but proclaimed our policy for a long time, and our most bitter opponents on the other side will agree that we were consistent with regard to the weekly and yearly holiday. I am particularly glad that agricultural workers on the State farms are receiving the differential of 5/- because of the piece of legislation promoted by the Labour Party, introducing the half-holiday, and that they are now required to work no more than 50 hours during any one week.  I think that those are two improvements as far as agricultural labourers are concerned, and I am glad to say that we in the Labour Party can claim 100 per cent. of the credit for the introduction of the half-holiday, and the major portion of the credit for the legislation which gives agricultural labourers a week's holidays during the year.</P>
    <P>I should like once again to congratulate Deputy Tom Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture, and to wish him luck so long as he holds office.</P>

It is an extraordinary about-face on the part of the Labour Party, but it is what one would expect.  The previous Minister for Agriculture increased the price of creamery butter by the same sum that the present Minister had done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time I have received complaints in regard to the distribution of lime.  As lime has been heavily subsidised by the Minister's Department, it is felt that there should be a reasonable distribution of it so as to give everyone who needs it, especially in the Spring, a fair share, and so that nobody will be able to get 200 or 300 tons while at the same time other persons who require lime are unable to get even ten or 20 tons. Every farmer with tillage land should get some lime and they should not be refused their share while a number of large land-holders are allowed to monopolise it.  That works to the detriment of the smallholders who may want only ten or 20 or 30 tons.  Last Spring quite a number of small tillage farmers could not get any lime although they knew that some of their more fortunate neighbours could.  Every applicant should get a share, rather than that some people should be allowed to monopolise it to a large extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a subsidy being paid on lime at present.  The scheme is all right and I hope it will continue.  I have been asked to make a few observations in regard to the Land Rehabilitation Scheme.  The scheme should be spread as fairly as possible while it is in operation so that a large number of acres will not be done on a small number of farms while there are a great number of people waiting to benefit by the scheme.  It would give general satisfaction throughout the country if the Minister would have a check-up and find if all the land on which considerable sums of money are being spent can be considered economic within the next ten or 20 years, or whatever number of years you like.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me, and I have observed myself, that goodly sums of money are being spent on draining a certain amount of land which it is doubtful whether in one or two generations it will be worth the money spent on it.  Sub-marginal land should be kept under close observation so as to see if any land drained is worth draining.  In the first instance, of course, one must consider whether it is worth draining.  Some people hold the view that money should be spent on any land, whether it be bog or anything else.  I do not say that that is exactly what is being done but a very close check should be kept on the expenditure of this public money so as to discover whether the land it is spent on is worth reclaiming.  There are considerable tracts of land in this country that will go back into a bad bog, no matter what is done.  Great care and consideration should be given to the expenditure of that public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked to mention the question of horse-breeding to the Minister.  It has been pointed out to me that very little has been spent in the matter of providing thoroughbred horses.  Only £2,000 is provided in respect of thoroughbred horses and £1,000 in respect of Irish draught horses.  It is felt that these amounts should be increased considerably.  I would ask the Minister to give more consideration to that.  I would ask him to give more <Col N="1095" /> of an incentive to people to continue breeding horses.  The breeding of hunters at the present time is not a paying proposition.  It should not be allowed to go out of existence.  Were horse breeding to come to an end, it would be detrimental to the future economy of agriculture.</P>

We believe that there cannot be any criticism of the Estimate. We believe it is a good Estimate. It is an Estimate that has set a pace for the present Minister, but I am afraid, even though I wish him well, that the Minister will not keep up the pace.  I was one of those, who, for the past three years, had many associations with Deputy Dillon and, whatever Deputies on either side of the House may think, I thoroughly agree with Deputy Cowan when he said that Deputy Dillon, as a Minister, was a good, sincere, true and honest worker.  Any amount of officialdom would not bar him from doing what he thought best for this country.  I wish to congratulate the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh.  I have known him on fields other than on the political field.  They were happier fields.</P>

      <P>There were just two changes made by the Minister.  They are&mdash;an increase in the price of milk and an increase in the price of butter. As far as we are concerned, I do not think that the extra 1d. a gallon for milk is any great boast at all.  I think that it was not even enough, having regard to the increased cost of production. We have no objection whatsoever to the increased price for milk. We fully agree with it and say that, to a certain extent, the price should be higher.  There is one thing, however, with which we completely disagree and that is the method adopted in regard to the increased price for butter.  I was one of those who campaigned quite a lot in the West of Ireland during the last election and I am proud to say that I polled as big a percentage of the votes in my constituency as any candidate in the Twenty-Six Counties. During that campaign the one thing I heard from every Fianna Fáil platform was talk about the increased price for butter.  I have here a copy of the <i>Irish Press</i> dated 28th May, 1951, in which is displayed a picture of a poor housewife.  The advertisement refers to the increased cost of clothes, shoes, soap, electricity, coal, butter and gas.</P>

      <P>As far as members of this Party are concerned, we are opposed to the increase in the price of butter.  We believe that there are many other means by which the money could be found.  The present method is one of robbing Peter to pay Paul. We believe that it is putting the burden on the very poor sections of the community.  There is an extra 2d. on butter to-day and God knows on what there will be an increase to-morrow. We will probably have more on gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> I want to make it quite plain that we are not opposed to this Estimate. The Estimate, as it stands, has set a pace with which, I hope, the present Minister for Agriculture will keep up. We are opposed to the increased price for butter because the increase falls upon a section of the community who, we believe, are unable to bear it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen spoke about the farmers and said they were gone with the tide now.  The best way to ascertain the conditions under which the farmer works is to go amongst the people on the land to-day.  I speak in this House for the farmers.  I represent the farmers. The honest farmer who is worth his salt will tell you to-day that he was never so well off.  Every good farmer will tell you that.  That is the answer to Deputy Allen.</P>

I know the Minister is a good tillage farmer and I know that he wants plenty of tillage. But the Minister knows what to do.  Give the farmers a good price and they will do all the tillage that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Minister that we will give him all the support we can provided his policy is favourable to the farming community.  If it is unfavourable he will meet with our solid opposition. But we will not adopt the attitude that the present Government adopted when it was in opposition towards the policy of Deputy Dillon.  No matter what he did, it was wrong.  He cannot have been so very wrong since the present Government have accepted his Estimate with only one change.  I think that change is a contemptible deception on the people.  I think the increase of 2d. per lb. on butter is a very mean deception in comparison with the advertisement to which I have already referred.  Those promises have been made null and void in three <Col N="1099" /> short weeks.  Possibly this will have the effect of making the people lose hope.  I hope it will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a matter which concerns County Kerry and other counties also.  There is a glut of store cattle and the farmers in these counties find themselves unable to get rid of them.  For two years I have been advocating an adjustment in the grading system.  There are certain very limited areas which can produce special grade or grade A cattle.  They are the Golden Vale, Kildare, Dublin, Meath, Westmeath and a few others. The counties on the southern and western seaboard cannot produce special grade or grade A cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, the counties along the western seaboard produced stores which were sold to counties in the midlands and for export to England.  At one time, the Kerry bullock and the Kerry cow were exported in large numbers to mining districts in England and a certain quota was sold to buyers from the midlands and the richer counties. Deputy Dillon made an arrangement, when he was Minister, with the British authorities whereby a special grade, or what he called super-grade, of cattle was instituted.  I submit to the Minister that there is very little difference between this super-grade and grade A.  In fact, I have been told by people in the trade that there is really no difference and that this is a system that should not have been introduced at all.  The result of it has been that Irish feeders have to finish their cattle up to this very high standard and only the very best cattle are bought for the <Col N="1102" /> export trade.  The smaller type of cattle that would have been bought heretofore are now excluded completely under this grading system.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon had done as we suggested a few years ago there would now be a different outlook for producers of this type of cattle.  He made the statement that he wanted only the very best cattle for England but he forgot that under this system, he was creating a glut of stores in this country which cannot be disposed of.  In the ultimate result it was a very shortsighted policy.  The price of grade A cattle or of the special grade, works out at 22¼d. whilst the price for grade B cattle is 18d.&mdash;that is a difference of 4¼d. a lb. while the difference under the previous Government, before Deputy Dillon took over office, was only 2d. per lb.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon had adopted my suggestion and adjusted that grading system, there would be a difference of only 2d. between Grade A and Grade B and he could cut out the special grade altogether.  The agreement that he made with the English authorities was that he would send over only the best. They got the best of our cattle at a comparatively cheap price and we were left with a surplus of somewhat inferior cattle which it is very difficult to dispose of.  There is only one solution to that problem and that, I suggest, would be to grade down this standard to that which existed before Deputy Dillon took over and eliminate this highly-specialised standard set up by the British Ministry of Food.  In that way we would gradually work down to the level of our economy here.  That would be the proper course, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that the difficulty might be met by allowing a higher price for hides.  That was a compromise put forward so as to balance any loss incurred in the export of these cattle.  When the British were asked to increase the price of carcase meat, they refused on the grounds that it would result in subsidising the tannery industry in this country.  They substantiated that statement by pointing out that while their tanneries were paying 3/6 per lb. for hides, the Irish <Col N="1103" /> tanneries paid only 10d. per lb. Subsequently, Mr. Dillon increased that to 2/6 per lb. for hides derived from cattle exported as carcase meat. There is a peculiar anomaly there at the moment because the butcher exporting cattle to England as carcase meat will get 2/6 per lb. for the hides of those cattle, while for the hides of cattle utilised for Irish use he will get only 10d. per lb.  There is certainly some need for adjustment in our own economy there.  If the Minister could see his way to examine the whole position in regard to the price of hides it would help him to adjust the price of cattle and also assist him to arrange a better price for the small cattle and find a market for them in certain areas in England.</P>
    <P>The British people, so far as I understand, got away with quite a lot under Deputy Dillon's arrangement because they took the very best and he agreed to give them the very best, but Deputy Dillon took no cognisance at all of the export of small cattle.  I know that the statements I am making may not be received very favourably by Deputies from the Midland counties and the fat cattle-raising lands of Meath and Westmeath who want the small stores from the south-west of Ireland and from counties along the western seaboard from Kerry to Donegal. It suits their economy all right to get these cattle at a low price but it is detrimental to producers along the western and southern seaboard who have to dispose of these cattle under the present system at a considerable loss.  People in the Midlands, of course, would not welcome the adjustment which I seek but it is imperative on us to ask for it.  I am asking the Minister to examine the case which I am making.  I have consulted farmers, people who are in the export trade and several others and I can assure him that this is a very urgent problem. It is a matter that should be adjusted at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>If we examine the whole agricultural policy we will find that in many respects it was unbalanced heretofore. We often had controversies with Deputy Dillon in regard to the creamery industry and to development <Col N="1104" /> in the different areas down there.  We had to fight hard to get justice for the farmers concerned.  As one who represents small farmers, I appreciate the new Minister's approach to these matters. He has experience enough to understand that our economy down there is quite different from the economy in other counties and that what suits the people in the Midlands would be completely out of place in the small farming areas.  That is why this question I raise is so vital to us.  It is a matter which must be adjusted somehow. If the Minister can see his way to absorb this glut of small stores of different grades, he will be doing a great day's work, not alone for my county but for all the counties on the southern and western seaboards.  I shall confine myself to that statement this evening in regard to the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and I have full confidence that the Minister's approach to it will be a proper one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to wish the Minister the very best of luck in his new Department.  It is a very responsible office and he has taken over a very serious responsibility.  If he is a failure in that office, not alone will it affect the farming community, but every citizen of this State.  For that reason I wish him success in his new Department, and he can rest assured that he will have my fullest co-operation in any good measure he brings forward in this House for the betterment of the Department over which he has control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to this debate with interest and I have come to the conclusion that there is too much political bickering in this House and that the matter is not being approached in the proper manner.  I feel sure that if some of the people whom we claim to represent were in this House during this debate they would not be impressed by the manner in which it has been conducted by some Deputies.  I am not concerned with the politics of the Minister, but I am very much concerned, in the interest of the people not alone in my constituency but throughout the whole of Ireland, that during his term of office he will make <Col N="1105" /> a success of his Department.  At this stage we cannot form a very good opinion, but I am reasonably confident that he will make a success of that Department, because I understand he is a practical farmer.  We must, however, wait and see.  I can assure him that he will have my fullest co-operation and support in anything I consider is good or in the best interests of the farming community as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is too bad that men of different shades of political opinion in this House take the opportunity of furthering their own political interests by bringing matters into this debate that do not really concern it.  I do not propose to do that.  As one who was reared among the farming community and who has engaged in agriculture and knows quite a lot about it, both from the point of view of working on the land and being engaged in the export of agricultural produce, I claim to know something about many aspects of agriculture. As I have said, if there is any way in which I can help the Minister by constructive criticism or advice I will be always ready and willing to give him advice and assistance regardless of the political Party to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he wants to put agriculture on its feet, he must first of all set about the task of long-term planning.  The farmers of this country over a long period of years have been given very lavish promises about what was going to be done in regard to the price they would receive for the various items of farm produce and many times when they have offered their produce for sale at a fair or market they were disappointed in the price they received.  I fully realise that there is a lot of uncertainty in the world to-day and that it is not easy to get long-term agreements. I will be reasonable with the Minister, but I advise him as far as possible, in every section of the Department under his control, to try and provide for long-term agreements and be in a position to tell the farmers that they will receive five years hence a certain price for their produce, be it potatoes, oats, barley, wheat, or live stock.  If he can do that and if he can continue along those lines, I <Col N="1106" /> have not the slightest doubt that in the time that lies ahead the agricultural community will be much better off and we will be less dependent on foreign supplies.</P>
    <P>I am not a bit parochial minded, but I want to refer to a few matters affecting my constituency of North Mayo, and no doubt other constituencies as well.  First of all, I should like to refer to the fall in the price of potatoes late last year.  In many parts of North Mayo and Mayo generally many farmers were disappointed at the poor price they received for their crops of potatoes at the end of the season.  It is true that the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, made a move to dispose of the potatoes for these farmers.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the farmers have not as yet received the balance of payment for potatoes supplied to alcohol factories and other places.  I would ask the Minister when he is replying to make a statement on that subject and to let the farmers know exactly what they will receive, what the price will be and the exact deductions, if any, for bags, carriage or any other item.  It is unfair to the farming community that they should have to wait long periods before they receive final payment for a crop with which they have so much difficulty.  Any Deputy who is conversant with farming knows that the potato crop above all others engages the attention of the farmer over a long period of the year.  For that reason I would appeal to the Minister to make a statement on the matter so as to clear the air and let us know the position.</P>
    <P>Compulsory tillage has been discussed here several times.  I am very familiar with the viewpoint of the various farmers in my immediate neighbourhood. Practically all the farmers in that neighbourhood favour compulsory tillage.  I am not advocating compulsory tillage.  On the contrary, I believe that the farmers should be perfectly free to grow whatever crop they wish. Farmers, being the intelligent people that they are, should know best the crop that is suited to a particular area. Compulsion is not the best method.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Farmers should be as free as any other section of the community to do what they consider best in their own interest and in the interest of the nation.  I can well understand that during periods of emergency we must bear with various regulations and regimentation.  Defence forces are told what they must do. They may have to spend longer hours at their work.  It is quite understandable that during a period of grave emergency, emergency conditions should prevail so far as the farming community is concerned.  Business people and others have to do a lot of form filling and have many other headaches in such a period.  These are things that in peace time such as we enjoy, thank God, at the present time should be dispensed with.  For that reason I am glad that the Minister, regardless of what he might have said six weeks ago, is reasonable enough not to impose compulsory tillage.</P>
    <P>Lime and fertilisers are very important commodities for the farmers.  Any device that the Minister might bring into effect for the improvement of the land would be welcomed.  I am quite prepared to state in this House that the former Minister did quite a lot along those lines.  He did perhaps more than previous Ministers did.  I shall not go into the merits or otherwise of men who served in the Department over a number of years but I would appeal in all sincerity to the new Minister to do what he can to have land that is deficient in lime treated with lime and see that we have sufficient supplies of lime if at all possible.  I know there are certain difficulties in the way of providing fertilisers but I would ask the Minister to concentrate on that matter, to look ahead and to see that there are sufficient supplies of fertilisers in the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the question of machinery.  It might seem out of place for me to refer to that matter because in my particular area tractors and modern implements are not used as extensively as they are in other parts of the country for the reason that most of our holdings are uneconomic.  Quite a number of farmers, in North Mayo particularly, are in the £4 or £5 valuation class, and quite a number are in <Col N="1108" /> the £6, £7 or £10 valuation class.  Any reasonable person can understand why, under these circumstances, modern methods are not employed.  We are not so well equipped with tractors, modern ploughs and other implements. The cost of farm machinery prevents farmers from adopting modern methods, and therefore deprives us of supplies of agricultural produce that we would otherwise have.  I would ask the Minister to interest himself in this matter.  The manufacturers of farm machinery are very wealthy.  They are able to make vast sums out of this business.  Many of the agents, garage owners and others, receive vast sums in commission or discount for the sale of these implements.  If the Minister could devise some method whereby machinery, tractors, ploughs and all the rest of it could be procured at a more economic price, it would give a very good return to the country in future.  I fully realise that it is very easy for me to get up and say this here, and that it is quite another matter when the Minister contacts these people with a view to getting reductions in the price of these implements. I throw that out as a suggestion which the Minister might consider. I believe that if the Minister considers it, it will have the desired effect.  As I said at the outset, it is a serious matter that we have to import so much that could be produced at home if the farmers were given a fair chance.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on the note on which I started, by wishing the Minister the very best of luck.  I suppose the Minister is quite a good man, but at the same time he is liable to make mistakes.  If he makes mistakes, they will be serious from the farmer's point of view and very serious from the point of view of the national economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to open up on a note of congratulation and good wishes to the Minister because he would know quite well that I did not mean a word of it.  I desire to be a little more honest than the Deputies who have extended congratulations, success, good luck and prosperity to the Minister.  I believe that his appointment was the sounding of the &ldquo;Last Post&rdquo; for the farmers <Col N="1109" /> and that the march which made him Minister was a dead march for the farmers.  In that parade there was Deputy Cogan, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Flynn, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll.  These men participated in the sounding of the &ldquo;Last Post&rdquo; for the farmers by the removal from office of the best Minister for Agriculture that Ireland has ever seen, the best Minister for Agriculture in any country in Europe, and that was Deputy James Dillon. No matter what may be said about Deputy Dillon by the Fianna Fáil set up, it must be admitted that, at least, he had the courage of his convictions, that he was not afraid to talk or to act irrespective of whether any item of his policy or that of his Department was popular or unpopular.  He had the courage of his convictions to do what he thought and what he said.</P>
      <P>The present Minister, when speaking from this side of the House on the 19th April last, on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is my own personal belief that we should have compulsory tillage in this country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reference is Volume 125, No. 8, page 1132.  Would it not be a grand thing if we had a Minister for Agriculture who could steer our agricultural policy more in accordance with his personal beliefs and not one who is steering an agricultural policy which is against his own wishes, his desires and his beliefs?  Deputy Walsh, as Minister for Agriculture, is working the Department of Agriculture against his own beliefs and opinions and against a method of farming which he honestly believes is not in the best interests of the farmers.  That can be borne out by the fact that he has now departed from his own statement which is on the records of this House that he believes in compulsory tillage. He does not believe in it any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is a convert.  Since the 19th April last his beliefs have changed, or else he is being compelled to pursue an agricultural policy which is against his own conscience.  Which is it?  I believe that the Minister is like a fish swimming <Col N="1110" /> against the current and that he is most uncomfortable.</P>
    <P>I believe that the policy which the Minister is pursuing is one with which he himself disagrees, because he honestly believes that the farmers, or a section of them, should be compelled to till portions of their land.  I think it is disastrous for the country that we cannot have a Minister for Agriculture who can act in accordance with his beliefs, his wishes and his desires.  But that is not the best of it.  On the formation of the Government, one of the Deputies who was responsible for the appointment of the Minister for Agriculture expressed the opinion in this House that the best Minister for Agriculture we ever had was Deputy Paddy Smith, and that one of the reasons why he was voting in Fianna Fáil was to have Deputy Paddy Smith back as Minister for Agriculture. Again, how disappointed that Deputy must be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would remind the Deputy that the Minister is not responsible for the statement of any other Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture knows quite well that if he were to attempt to pursue his own agricultural policy he would be removed from the office of Minister for Agriculture within 24 hours by the members on his own side.  That is why he cannot act in accordance with his own beliefs as stated on the records of this House.  He knows, further, that the farmers would not stand for compulsion. We all know that the farmers have reached a very advanced and very educated stage.</P>
      <P>They have had three glorious years of freedom in which they could do what they liked, when they liked, how they liked and as often as they liked.  The ten fields of inspectors threatened on them by Fianna Fáil were told by the former Minister for Agriculture that they dare not trespass on the fences of the farmers, and that they were only to trespass when the farmers invited them to cross the fences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that, on the last occasion on which he had a Fianna Fáil Government, no farmer could work his <Col N="1111" /> land in accordance with his own wishes and desires.  The farms in this country were run, and the farmers were dictated to, by the pen and ink farmers in Government Buildings in Merrion Street.  But for three years we had the happy experience of having a Government under which the farmers enjoyed a measure of prosperity.  They could walk around as freemen in a free country. They could say what they liked, and that is the way we hope and trust the present Minister will pursue whatever policy he has to pursue.  I want to say that any attempt by Fianna Fáil, or by the miscellaneous characters and supporters responsible for having them in office, to compel the farmers to do anything but what they want to do themselves, will be met by the strongest and the fiercest opposition from this side of the House, because we believe in, and always have been believers in, freedom.  Surely, if a man has not freedom on his own land and to work his business as he thinks best himself he cannot call himself a citizen of a free country.  On that aspect, the Minister does deserve a word of congratulation, the aspect of being a convert from compulsion to non-compulsion.  Whether his term be long or short as Minister for Agriculture, I hope and trust that he will keep his hands off the farmers, that he will assist them and advise them where they need advice; but, as I say, if he tries compulsion with them, it will be disastrous for himself and for those who sit behind him.</P>
    <P>We also have on the records of the House a statement made by the Minister when speaking, again on the 19th April last, from this side of the House. He was dealing with the dairying industry and on the progress of the creameries.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I happen to be closely connected with the creamery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and Deputy Dillon interjected&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;God help it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. T. Walsh: It is doing very well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an admission that there was at least one creamery in this country doing well under the policy pursued by <Col N="1112" /> Deputy Dillon when Minister for Agriculture. In my opinion, every creamery in Kilkenny was doing well during that period.</P>
    <P>I wish to join with my colleagues, who have already spoken on this subject, in looking with disgust on the action of the Minister for Agriculture in increasing the price of milk at the cost of depriving of butter the workers of Dublin and the workers of this country, as a whole.  This commodity has now reached a price at which it is out of reach of the working class people.  I challenge any Fianna Fáil Deputy or any of the five feathers in the tail of Fianna Fáil to tell us in this House that 3s. per lb. for butter is reasonable so far as the working class people are concerned.  I challenge those Deputies for not stating prior to the General Election that it was part of their programme and policy to increase the cost of living of the working class people, for it has already gone up for them during the course of the past 14 days as a result of the increased cost of butter.  School children are suffering because local authorities who administer free school meals are seriously affected.  Children who are particularly advised to consume butter are now feeling the pinch of the Minister for Agriculture's act, and every ex-tuberculosis patient in receipt of an allowance of butter is now faced with the position that he has to pay more for it as a result of Fianna Fáil taking over the Department of Agriculture and the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>Is it not an extraordinary somersault that the very set of men who were criticising Deputy Dillon and the valuable work that was being done by the inter-Party Government, the very set of men who were, in fact, criticising them for not bringing the cost of living down to a lower level, should, with their very first action, increase it by giving the dairy farmers of this country an increased price per gallon for milk at the expense of the unfortunate workers of Dublin, Cork, Galway and of the remainder of the country?  Can the Minister for Agriculture be really honest in telling us that he could not otherwise finance the <Col N="1113" /> giving of this additional sum per gallon for milk to the farmers of the Golden Vale, North Cork, North Kerry and of other constituencies?  Could he not have found the money otherwise? Why on earth was it that it was the poor man who had again to accept the punch below the belt?</P>
    <P>I am surprised at Deputy Donnellan expressing amazement and horror at this happening 14 days after Fianna Fáil taking up office.  Deputy Donnellan should be long enough in this House to know that nothing but such tactics could be expected of Fianna Fáil.  I only hope and trust that the Minister for Agriculture will see his mistake, and I believe he will see it.  I am confident that the working-class people and other sections of the community who are already heavily burdened without having to bear this additional burden, will cause this Government to rue the day that they have increased the price of butter.</P>
    <P>Now let us take the statement which Deputy Allen made in this House to-night. Listening to Deputy Allen, one would think that every farmer in the country was queueing up outside the workhouses and that there was no such being as the farmer who could stand on his own two feet.</P>
    <P>I have said it in my constituency, and I say it here, that the farmers of this country never enjoyed such prosperity as they have enjoyed for the past three years.  Yet we heard Deputy Allen standing up in this House and telling us that production has gone down and that there is less land under tillage.  Be that as it may, if there is less land under tillage, there is more food grown.  From the statistics of the Department of Agriculture, which the Minister has available at his hand, he can see clearly that there was never as much food grown in this country as has been grown in recent years. Fianna Fáil were in office in 1939.  For the information of new Fianna Fáil Deputies I might point out that, in 1939, in this country there were 255,280 acres under wheat; in 1950 there were 366,012 acres.  That was a substantial increase.  Deputy Allen cannot deny these figures.  Deputy Allen cannot deny that there was more wheat grown in this country under the inter-Party <Col N="1114" /> Government than was grown in 1939 when Fianna Fáil were in office.  These figures may be obtained from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Let us take oats.  In 1939 536,749 acres were grown, and in 1950 the acreage increased to 614,363.  There we see again that there was a larger acreage under oats during the term of office of the former Minister for Agriculture than there was in 1939 when Fianna Fáil were boasting of all that was being produced.</P>
    <P>Let us take barley&mdash;and I am sorry that Deputy Martin Corry is not here for this.  In 1939 there were 73,784 acres of barley grown in this country; in 1950 the acreage increased to 123,241. That is something of which the inter-Party Government can be proud.  In regard to rye, in 1939 there were 1,728 acres grown; in 1950 an increase to 3,968 acres is recorded.  Those are figures in which I should like Deputy Allen to interest himself.  Those are figures which even the mildest backbencher in Fianna Fáil should study and ask himself how it was achieved. It was achieved without compulsion, with encouragement, with good and fair prices and by showing reasonable consideration for the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>Let us take beans and peas, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture's colleague, has increased by 2½d. a packet within the last week.  In 1939 there were 402 acres grown; in 1950, 1,506 acres were grown.  Can those figures be denied?</P>

      <P>The year I am comparing is 1950, not 1951.  In 1950, 1,506 acres were grown.  As a result of the increase which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has imposed, and for which the Minister for Agriculture has no responsibility except as a colleague, peas and beans have been <Col N="1116" /> increased by 2½d. a packet within the last ten days.  I move to report progress.</P>
