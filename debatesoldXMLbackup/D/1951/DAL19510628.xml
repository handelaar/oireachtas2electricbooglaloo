      <P>On the question of the Finance Bill, if it is desired and if it is possible to take all the stages to-day, we would ask for a break between the Committee Stage and the final stages.  If the Committee Stage finishes before 1 o'clock we would ask that the final stages be taken at 1 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to charge and impose certain duties of customs and inland revenue (including excise), to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provisions in connection with finance, it is expedient to authorise that a sum of £653,594 to redeem borrowings, and interest thereon, in respect of capital services shall be charged annually on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof in the 30 successive financial years commencing with the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so easy.  If the Deputy will look at paragraph (b) of sub-section (1), he will see that it provides that where an individual who would, but for the fact that his total income exceeds £500, be entitled to an allowance, he shall be entitled to have the amount of the income-tax payable in respect of his total income reduced, where necessary, so as not to exceed a sum equal to the sum of the two following amounts, the amount which he would have paid if his income did not exceed £500 and the amount which <Col N="652" /> would be payable, in fact, if the rate of charge upon the income in excess of £500 were to be 10/- in the pound.  The position, accordingly, will be that proportionately to the amount of other allowances which he may receive whether as a single or as a married man, the relief will taper off until it completely disappears for all cases. For instance, it will disappear in the case of a single person who has an income of about £685 and is entitled to no other allowances.  If a person is married, and has other allowances, the relief will taper off much more rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As this section deals with the Conversion Bill, would the Minister answer the question I asked relating to that Bill, as to whether the power to exempt the bonus from income tax should be included here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the exemption of bonus is concerned, it does not require legislation.  In the ordinary way, profits made by people who habitually deal in stocks and shares would be liable to income-tax, but Section 6 which is a relieving provision now enables them to claim, if they so desire, that the bonus will not be taken into account until the actual conversion stock has been realised.  So far as ordinary individuals are concerned, it is not necessary to have any provision exempting their bonus from income-tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have already explained it on the Second Stage but it was not a very detailed explanation.  As will be seen, the main purpose of the section is to amend Section 74 and Section 95 of the Spirits Act, 1880, which apply to liqueurs which, I am told by those who are familiar with the technique, are a form of compounded spirits.  Spirits of this type made in the State and intended for home consumption may be deposited under the section in bond on drawback duty.  The section also revokes sub-section (4) of Section 95 of the Spirits Act, 1880, which provides that no compounded spirits of a strength exceeding 11 degrees over-proof may be warehoused on drawback for home consumption.  Sub-section (3) amends sub-section (5) of Section 95 of the Spirits Act of 1880 so as to permit the warehousing on drawback in bottle of certain forms of compounded spirits which could otherwise be so warehoused only in cask.  That is in fact the principal provision.  The purpose <Col N="654" /> is to enable manufacturers of these liqueurs to bottle them and maintain a stock in bond without having to pay duty until such time as the liqueurs are released from bond for the purposes of consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It will mean that the liqueurs when consumed are more mature?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, not that I have found that of any consequence in connection with compounded spirits in bottle.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 12 to 24 inclusive, and the First Schedule agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain how the repeals of the subsections of the two Acts mentioned are to be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They are consequential on Section 14.  This is of course the schedule referred to in Section 22.  Section 22, with the Second Schedule, provides that Section 16 (3) of the Finance Act of 1894 and Section 13 (2) of the Finance Act, 1914, are to be repealed in relation to the estates of persons dying after the 2nd May, 1951.  The reason for these repeals is that Section 14 substitutes new provisions for those repealed.  I should like to emphasise, because the question has been put to me, that the new section applies only to the estates of persons dying after 2nd May, 1951. That is the date on which the Budget was introduced.  The estate of any person dying before that date will be chargeable at the old rate of duty. Death must have taken place after the 2nd May in order that the estate may-become entitled to the benefits of Section 14.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was dealing with this matter last night we had very fluent objections from Deputy Dillon to having the question of white flour debated on this Estimate.  I can quite understand the reason for his objections. We all know that in rural areas the ration of bread is never sufficient for the ordinary working countryman or the ordinary man engaged in heavy work.  That ration has to be supplemented and the manner in which it was supplemented by the late Minister is something to be deplored.  The late Minister, Deputy Dillon, told the farmers that they would have no more inspectors&mdash;and then he came along and threw those inspectors into the bakeries of this country in order to prevent an ounce of bread over the ration being supplied, particularly in the rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past year I have received, practically every week, appeals and complaints from bakers in my constituency in regard to the manner in which they were being driven out of business as a result of the activities of the Minister for Agriculture, who took from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and arrogated to himself this particular branch.  He knew that the people who needed extra bread were the poorer sections of our people and the depressed classes in agriculture, and yet he came along with a black market tax of 10½d. a stone on that flour.  That action was contemptible and unjust. When our new Minister for Agriculture is concluding, I hope that he will be able to inform the House that that black market tax is coming off, together with the black market tax on sugar.  It is wrong for any Government to put a special tax on food needed by the ordinary worker in this country.  The ordinary worker in this country cannot live on the ordinary bread ration.  We know what happened to our rural bakeries.  Gradually, one after another, if they were in the vicinity of a large town or city, their customers were whipped from them. The rural bakeries have been wiped out as a result of the late Minister's manoeuvre.  Everybody knows that city dwellers do not consume the full ration of bread.  There is a large quantity of spare bread, over the ration, in the cities.  City bakeries rush outside the city areas with the bread which they have left over&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The late Minister for Agriculture&mdash;with the emphasis on the word &ldquo;late&rdquo;&mdash;was the gentleman who sent the inspectors to the bakeries to inspect the ration cards and the quantity of flour supplied so as to ensure that not one ounce over the ration would be supplied.  That is the matter I am dealing with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be worried, and gravely worried, because this matter has been handed back, probably, to the place which it should never have left and which it would not have left were it not for the vindictiveness of the Deputy, the late Minister, who wanted to get one up on the bakeries and, incidentally, to rake in revenue by a kind of black market tax.  I should not have raised this matter at all except for my anxiety to have this black market tax wiped out immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also anxious that, now that we have a new Minister for Agriculture, we shall have a definite policy as regards essentials in this country&mdash;essential foodstuffs, in particular. I notice that in to-day's public Press, particularly in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> there are statements which are not true&mdash;particularly statements in connection with the price of imported butter which, they say, is in the region of 360/-.  If they will get their own journal, which I quoted here last night, and consult it they will find that the price given by creamery managers for imported butter is from 450/- to 550/-per cwt.  That would allow for a price to the Irish farmer of 1/6 a gallon for milk.  I only wish that the Press might have an opportunity of correcting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the difficult position in which the Minister is.  I also realise the hard work that is before him.  I want to know now what the Minister's attitude is towards milk production in this country.  I want to have his policy <Col N="658" /> with regard to milk production declared. I want an end put to a policy under which the ratepayers and taxpayers are required to pay in rates and taxes for beef bulls which have no useful function except for the production of beef.  Nobody can say that those beef bulls are kept for the improvement of any herd, that is, a permanent improvement.  If premiums are given in respect of Hereford, Polled Angus and beef Shorthorn bulls, I would like to know what justification there is for refusing premiums to purely dairy herds and dairy bulls. After all, these latter are required for milk production, but the State, through the Department of Agriculture, says that there shall be no premium.  There is a decided advantage in getting a premium bull of the type I have mentioned, because by so doing you will improve the milk production of the herds.  Yet the State, using public money, gives premiums out on Aberdeen Angus, Hereford and beef Shorthorn bulls which cannot make any permanent improvement on the live stock of this country because they are only bred for export or for beef.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any justification for the continuance of that policy.  This is one of the matters which the Minister for Agriculture will have to consider seriously.  At times I smile when I hear Deputy Dillon talk about increasing the yield of cows to 560 and 750 gallons per cow.  Deputy Dillon was going to increase the yield of cows, but how did he propose doing so?  Was it by giving premiums for Hereford bulls and by pursuing a policy of inducement to the Irish farmer to turn to beef?  I gave one instance of this yesterday evening which any Deputy travelling from Cork could see for himself.  By looking out of the carriage window, he would see a herd of cows in the fields, every one of which had two calves.  There was no one to milk them.  This is just an example of Texas ranching.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister's definite policy in regard to that matter, if possible, now, but if not, as soon as may be.  I think this House and the people of this country are entitled to know what is the policy of the Department of Agriculture in regard to milk production.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasure of listening to a very distinguished gentleman from the Department who spoke last week on the question of artificial insemination. He stated that, although the insemination station had been set up and was working, the demand was not for dairy bulls but for Hereford bulls. That was the statement made by a learned doctor who came down last week to give a lecture on artificial insemination to the County Cork Committee of Agriculture.  If that is the manner in which the people's money is being spent, the people are entitled to an explanation.  There is no use in any Party coming here mouthing, with glib tongues, about the improvement in milk production if subsequently it pursues a policy of the kind I have referred to.  There is no justification for it.  If we want a cow that will yield from 500 to 700 gallons we have got to change our attitude.  The Department of Agriculture must definitely change its attitude.  There is no good pretending otherwise.  I want a definite reason from the Department of Agriculture why premiums are given for Hereford bulls and refused for dairy bulls.  If that is the policy of the Department of Agriculture, let it be stated in this House and then let us fix a price for milk on the basis of a 200-gallon cow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You are very nearly down to that.  You have almost reached 100 gallons per cow during the past three years, owing to the activities of the previous Minister for Agriculture. Deputy Hickey is living in a city.  He has removed himself completely from the old happy days when I knew him in Mourne Abbey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hickey has removed himself altogether and he is now a city man.  I want to warn the Minister that there is a clear belief among the agricultural community engaged in dairying that there is a definite bias against them in this respect, that dairying is the one branch of agriculture in which they can never get a decent price.  That belief has been driven in by the action of Deputy Dillon in the past three years. There was some hope in previous years because you went to a Minister, put up a case and got something anyway.  I want the Minister to endeavour to disabuse&mdash;and he will have a difficult job in this respect&mdash;the minds of the dairy farmers of the idea that this is the one branch of agriculture in relation to which any endeavour to bring the price up to the cost of production, plus a fair profit, is going to be opposed tooth and nail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That belief is prevalent and it has led to our present unfortunate position as regards butter and as regards milk supplies in certain towns.  The farmer to-day is not a man who will plod away year after year on the same old line. When he finds that some product does not pay, he cuts it out.  When he finds that it does not pay him to milk cows and send the milk to the creamery at 1/2 per gallon, he goes to the nearest fair or market and buys 15 or 20 calves, drives them in among the cows, letting <Col N="661" /> the cows rear them and lets those people who opposed his getting a fair price for milk go to Denmark and New Zealand and pay 4/- per lb. for their butter.</P>

      <P>For the record, Deputy Corry stated that the price paid for imported butter was 480/-.  At column 1268, Volume 125(9) of the Official Reports, Deputy P. O'Reilly asked the Taoiseach for particulars of the quantities and prices of butter imported and Deputies can see there the Taoiseach's reply.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The total quantity of butter imported from the 1st November, 1950, to the 31st March, 1951, was 60,198 cwt.  Of this, 20,017 cwt. originated in Denmark and 40,181 cwt. originated in New Zealand. The average c.i.f. prices paid per cwt. were £18 14s. 6d. and £18 16s. 0d. respectively.&rdquo;</P>

I mention it to show what a contemptibly unreliable person Deputy Corry is; how the time of this House is wasted in listening to his fantastic misrepresentations; and for the purpose of returning to it later when I have dealt with some other matters which call for examination.</P>
      <P>I felicitate the Minister on his appointment to the most important position in the Irish Government, after that of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. I hope his efforts for the agricultural community will meet with success.  I fully appreciate the magnitude of the burden he has undertaken, and, no matter who he might be, there can be no question that he is entitled to the forbearance of this House, certainly until the autumn, while he masters the complexities of a very large Department and anyone who seeks to take advantage of him by proposing trick questions in the initial stages of his tenure of office really exposes himself as being unfamiliar with the nature and magnitude of the task which it is the Minister's duty to discharge.  I hope I shall not be guilty of any such unworthy folly as attempting to make inquiries of the Minister which no Minister after two or three weeks in the Department could conceivably be in a position to answer off-hand in the House; but there are some queries which I think it proper to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted with amusement my predecessor, Deputy Smith, being cast overboard by Deputy Lemass when he went to Tipperary during the general election and I waited to see if there was going to be any reaction.  I discovered that there was not going to be.  Deputy Smith kept very silent and bowed his neck most dutifully to the yoke laid upon it.  Then the leader of the Opposition, now the Taoiseach, went to Castlecomer and brought Deputy T. Walsh with him.  Deputy T. Walsh was required to make a speech in his presence and the theme of that speech was: &ldquo;I never advocated compulsory tillage.  I am not in favour of compulsory tillage.  What I said in Dáil Éireann was that if Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="663" /> did not exercise greater diligence and prudence, he might create a situation in which the only means of producing food in Ireland would be compulsory tillage.&rdquo;  That was Deputy T. Walsh in the presence of his own leader, seeking the suffrage of his own neighbours.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to have reference to column 1097 of Volume 125 of the Official Debates.  Deputy T. Walsh was addressing the House and Deputy Davin asked him: &ldquo;What does Deputy Walsh want?  Compulsory tillage?&rdquo; Then:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Donnellan: We do not know yet.</P>
    <P>Mr. Davin: He is silent on that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Walsh broke his silence:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. T. Walsh: I am not silent. Yes, compulsory tillage for this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I will ask the House to turn to column 1132.  Deputy Walsh adjourned the debate on the first occasion and when it was resumed the following day he was asked to open it.  He began by accusing me of high treason and, having been told by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that that was going a bit far, Deputy Walsh said: &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Davin: He is doing it for publicity, of course.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This fired Deputy Walsh:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Walsh: I mentioned last night, in reply to Deputy Davin&mdash; the admission was not forced from me, because it is my own personal belief&mdash;that we should have compulsory tillage in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think public life sinks to a very low level indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy Dillon has brought it to a very low level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when a Deputy puts his personal convictions on record in Dáil Éireann in the first week of May on a matter which is one of acute difference in the national election campaign and suffers himself to be dragged down to a platform in the middle of his own neighbourhood, not for the purpose of saying to his neighbours: &ldquo;I have changed my mind; certain <Col N="664" /> factors have been brought to my attention which I had not thought of before and I now desire to tell you before you go to the polls that my statement in Dáil Éireann was founded on insufficient knowledge; with the additional information I now have I have changed my mind, and I ask for your votes in consideration thereof.&rdquo;  He was not asked to do that, but he was made to come down and get up in the presence of his neighbours and say: &ldquo;I never said that; I never said I was in favour of compulsory tillage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture &mdash;Deputy Walsh, as he then was&mdash; should be ashamed of allowing anybody to drag him before his neighbours for the purpose of misleading them as to what he himself had said when representing them in Dáil Éireann.  So long as Deputy Walsh is in public life he will find people will look askance at him for having allowed anybody to force him into that deplorable strategy.  When we come to Dáil Éireann and find that the man who has been so humiliated before his own neighbours is appointed Minister for Agriculture, we cannot divorce from our minds the horrible suspicion that the price of his promotion was that he should seriously tarnish his personal honour in the presence of those amongst whom he was born and reared.  It reflects no credit on the Deputy; it reflects no credit on the Head of the Government; and it is something of which Dáil Éireann is entitled to have an explanation.  Either Deputy Walsh misled Dáil Éireann when he spoke here on that subject or he misled his constituents&mdash;what is worse, his own neighbours&mdash;when he spoke in Castlecomer.  I do not think our people can be expected to overlook a transaction of that kind.</P>
      <P>A week ago, the Minister for Agriculture was asked what his attitude was on milk prices.  He said the matter was under consideration and he hoped to be in a position to deal with it in about six weeks' time.</P>

Then an interesting and significant thing happened: the Agricultural Estimate was produced for this week and there was an announcement that the price of creamery milk would be increased to 1/4 in the summer and 1/6 in the winter.  It is interesting for this reason, that it is evidence of the fact&mdash; which I mentioned during the general election and which is amply confirmed by what has transpired since then&mdash; that the Fianna Fáil Party is breaking up.  Fianna Fáil has broken in Cork; it has broken in Dublin; and I understand that there is blue murder in Limerick; and the discipline of the Party is breaking up in this House.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I now return to a subject to which I have already directed the attention of the House, that is, the price payable for butter on the international markets of the world.  In the circumstances under which we had to buy butter last autumn those who sold it to us made no secret of the fact that they were asking a higher price than they got from any regular customer because they did not believe that we were going to be a regular customer for butter.  Therefore, they were going to get from us the maximum price that they thought the trade would carry and in one case in the course of bargaining they stated quite frankly that they aimed to get from us for the parcel of butter which they proposed to sell us a price which would in some measure compensate for selling the rest of their butter at the best price they could get in the normal butter export markets of the world.  On that basis and in those circumstances of scarcity the export price of butter fluctuated between 380/- and 360/- per cwt.  The economic price of butter manufactured from creamery milk at 1/4 per gallon in summer and 1/6 in winter is 440/- per cwt. and if we ever produce more butter than our own people require for consumption and we <Col N="668" /> have to resume butter exports the difference between 440/- per cwt. and the current price of butter in the world market which is about 280/- will have to be found somewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is that price paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the current average price for butter exports to the butter manufacturing countries which are exporting butter at the present time.  New Zealand and Denmark, put it at 300/-.  If they sell a parcel to somebody who wants it badly enough they clap on the price as much as they can, but for the long term contracts under which the bulk of the butter is sold that is about the average price. Put it at 300/-, and it means that if we ever succeed in producing surplus butter for export over and above what our own people are prepared to consume we will have to pay £7 per cwt. to whatever customer buys it to eat our butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the House of something.  Last year, 1950, we sent 222,000,000 gallons of milk to the creameries of this country.  The last time we came anywhere near that was in 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937.  Let me remind the House of what happened in those years: in 1950 we produced in Ireland out of that 222,000,000 gallons of milk approximately 700,000 cwt. of butter, every ounce of which was effectively consumed and paid for by our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but the reason they were able to do it was that they had the earning and the purchasing power.  In 1934, however, we produced about 800,000 cwt. of butter, and our people were able to consume only 350,000 cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We shipped to Great Britain 453,000 cwt., more than half. <Col N="669" /> For each cwt. of butter which we shipped to Great Britain in that year the British put down 52/10 and the Fianna Fail Government put down in subsidy and export bounty 82/10 of the Irish taxpayers' money.  The British ate the butter and the Irish got the empty boxes.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

The British put down 65/9 and the Fianna Fail Government put down 44/-of the Irish taxpayers' money and again the British ate the butter and we got the empty boxes.  But remember, if we had to export butter tomorrow on the basis of the price fixed, not by the Minister for Agriculture but by the Fianna Fail Party and the five legs they have behind them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we should have to put down £7 per cwt. to induce them to buy it, not £4 2s. 10d. as in 1934, but £7.  What does that imply? It implies that, in effect, we have put a ceiling on the quantity of butter that the Irish creamery industry is going to be allowed to produce, because it is manifest that this Parliament or no other Parliament will long tolerate an arrangement whereunder we have to pay £7 a cwt. on every cwt. exported. I want to say to the dairy farmers of this country that if there is an axiom in trade and industry it is this &mdash;no business can ever stand still; it either goes forward or it goes back. You cannot say to any expanding industry: &ldquo;Up to that point you can expand and then stop,&rdquo; because the moment you do that the industry does not stop, it begins to go back.  Therefore the net effect of yesterday's announcement is to say to the dairy industry: &ldquo;You may produce such butter as is wanted in this country and in respect of that you can levy on the Exchequer and on the consumer, but you are finally and irrevocably out of the export market.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my predecessors as Minister for Agriculture (Deputy Dr. Ryan) deliberately <Col N="670" /> stated in Cork University four or five years ago that he believed we were out of the export market. Deputy Dr. Ryan stated that when Minister for Agriculture and warned the public that his judgment of the future was that we were out of the butter export market for evermore and the decision taken by the Fianna Fáil Party yesterday confirms that view.  They have simply thrown in their hand and announced that they have abandoned all hope of ever building up the dairying industry into an industry capable of limitless expansion, without which the economic life of this country cannot go on.</P>
    <P>If we have made up our minds that agricultural exports are to be virtually abandoned and that the primary function of our agricultural industry is self-sufficiency, remember this, the day that decision is taken we start our people on the road to a low, miserable standard of living analogous to that enjoyed by the agricultural communities of eastern European countries. We in this country enjoy a relatively high standard of living because we are an exporting country, and we are an exporting country because we are peculiarly situated and have the advantage of being able to put into the British market perishable agricultural produce in fresh condition which they can get from nowhere else in the world. I say advisedly that a large part of that perishable agricultural produce is in the form of meat and fowl and the by-products thereof which they cannot get from the Antipodes in fresh condition because it will not come in fresh condition except at an appalling price, and which they cannot get from the Continent of Europe for veterinary reasons which do not apply to this country, because these two countries of Great Britain on the one hand and Ireland on the other have always had a common veterinary practice which made it possible for us to exclude certain of the continental veterinary diseases from these territories and which enables us to ship these commodities to Great Britain which Great Britain is afraid to import from continental sources of supply.</P>
    <P>If we, by our price policy, turn our <Col N="671" /> backs on the market and price ourselves out of it deliberately, we are going to travel the same accursed road we travelled from 1932 to 1947.  Remember, that in 1948, when I became Minister for Agriculture, there never were fewer cattle, there never were fewer pigs, there were never fewer sheep in Ireland and the state of the agricultural land in Ireland had reached a depth of degradation and impoverishment unknown since the famine year of 1847.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Within three years of that date we are in a position to say to-day that for the first time for a century the human population of this country is going up and that on the 1st June this year there were a greater number of cattle, and I believe a greater number of cows and in-calf heifers than we ever had before.  The pig population is going up and the sheep population is going up.  The output of the agricultural industry is going up and the state of fertility of the land is steadily improving.  Self-sufficiency, founded on the doctrine that it is safe and sensible to price ourselves out of our export markets, is as certain as we are here to-day to initiate a cycle which will bring us back exactly to the same position in which we were in 1947, and that is where this political policy&mdash;for it is not an agricultural policy; it is not an economic policy; it is a political policy&mdash;is heading the agricultural industry at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not speak of the sorry madness of any Government which injects into our economy at the present time £2,500,000 of extra spending money without increasing production by an ounce, but I pause to think of this&mdash;this change announced yesterday is going to cost our people, the consumer and the taxpayer, £1,400,000. Now, it is not going to produce one gallon extra milk on the basis of that outlay.  Pause and think what is being done.  If the milk yield of each cow supplying milk to a creamery had been increased by one pint a day, the <Col N="672" /> farmers would have got more out of it than this increase of 1d. in summer and 2d. in winter.  What might the Minister for Agriculture not have done if he had secured from the Government £1,000,000 a year to spend on veterinary services and live stock improvement? What could I have done if I could have got even £100,000? How much might the average milk yield of our cattle have been increased if we had £1,000,000 a year to spend on veterinary services and live stock improvement?</P>

The more you produce of dairy produce the better for the country.&rdquo;  But, do not forget that out of every 100 gallons of milk that go to the creamery for the production <Col N="673" /> of butter there is a by-product of 80 gallons of skim milk wherewith to feed pigs which every farmer in Ireland knows cannot fall below 220/- per cwt. for the next five years and which are at present making £13 per cwt. and every pig of which could be bred, reared and finished on that skim milk, barley, potatoes, oats and fodder beet, every ounce of which could be grown on our own land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Fianna Fáil Party are embarking on doing, because they are blinded by the crazy political stunt of self-sufficiency.  It is the schizophrenia of politics and economics. The schizophrenic is the kind of lunatic who first does not recognise his friends, who next refuses to leave the house, who lastly retires to his bedroom and is ultimately found in bed under the clothes and will not come out because that is the one place where nobody can get at him and he thinks he has at last found security and then they put him in Grangegorman.  The Fianna Fáil economist first wants to produce everything at home; his next state is that he does not want to produce anything except what is used at home; the next state is that he does not want anything produced in the parish except what is going to be consumed in the parish and the next thing is that no farmer ought produce anything except what he will eat himself. Finally, you find him sitting by the kitchen fire with one flower pot and one oat growing in it, triumphant that <Col N="674" /> at last he has reached the very essence and apotheosis of economic self-sufficiency for the agricultural community <i>a la</i> de Valera for out of this solitary oat he can produce oatmeal, oaten bread and light beer with which to wash them down.</P>
      <P>That is economic schizophrenia and that is the ultimate end of the economic madness of pricing yourself out of your own export markets.  The final destiny of an agricultural community which turns its back on its own natural markets, having no other resources, as we are in Ireland, is to be found sitting by the kitchen fire of turf, in pampooties, with a sheepskin tied around his middle, brooding on one oat growing in a four-inch flower pot&mdash;and that is the real economic goal of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I say that it is not agricultural policy, it is not economics, that dictated yesterday's decision.  It is the panicky politics of a disrupted political Party tossed on a stormy sea of politics with no more substantial life-belt than Deputy Cogan and Deputy Dr. ffrench O'Carroll.</P>
      <P>The policy of the inter-Party Government was and continues to be to raise the average yield of our cattle from 365 gallons per cow ultimately to an average somewhere between 400 and 800 gallons, fully conscious of the fact that to arrive at anything like an 800 gallon average was a very long term policy, but that to arrive at a 500-gallon average was a reasonable objective. The plain truth is this, that the attempt to build an economic dairy industry on the 365-gallon cow is as daft as trying to get a tractor to fly or an aeroplane to plough.  It cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum milk yield upon which an economic dairy industry can be operated in this country is 450 gallons, and it ought to be, if the farmers are enjoying the standard of living to which they are entitled, about 600 gallons. We could do that if we went the right way about it, but it is certainly not the right way about it to set a standard for creamery milk prices which gives a <Col N="675" /> man with a 350-gallon cow a miserable peasant standard of living, which is a standing temptation not to make the extra effort to attain a proper average milk yield, which would bring with it a proper standard of living to every dairy farmer in this country.</P>
    <P>It is true that with a 350-gallon cow, at present milk prices, any farmer can stagger along.  If that is to be the destiny of the agricultural community of this country, just to stagger along in inefficient and sordid penury, my advice to any enterprising young man in this country would be to leave the land like a scalded cat.  But it ought not to be the destiny of agriculture in this country.  The agricultural community ought to be the people who count in this country.  They never will be rich, and no one but a liar will hold out to them the prospect that any economic policy operated by any Government will make the farmers, or anybody else in this country who is honest, rich; but it is eminently possible to make them prosperous, secure, and dignified as independent farmers on their own holdings, earning their own living, and beholden to nobody.</P>
    <P>I wonder is that the purpose of Fianna Fáil, or do they desire to reduce the farmers of this country to the same disgusting condition of dependency that I found them in three years ago?  Is it the policy of Fianna Fáil to restore the situation, in which Fianna Fáil made the claim, as of right, to break down the farmer's gate and to break down his fences, and to send ten fields of inspectors in to flog him into the proper user of his land?  That was the policy of Fianna Fáil in 1947 after 16 years of their administration. After three years of the inter-Party administration, the farmers of this country compelled them to recant on the public platform.  Why?  Because they were so circumstanced that they were beholden to nobody for their right to live; they were independent, they were prosperous, and they had not to beg the right to live in their own country or on their own holdings from any Fianna Fáil T.D.  The cities put Fianna Fáil back with the help of the seedy five.  If Fianna Fáil intends to <Col N="676" /> restore its right to do as it thinks best with the gates and fences of the farmers, an essential preliminary to that is to make them dependent again.  I do not think they will succeed.  I think this seedy conspiracy will break up before it can get the chains on the farmers of this country just as the Cork Corporation caucus broke up, and just as Deputy Alderman Butler broke out of the compound and is now a maverick on the political prairies of Ireland.  I hope the disintegration of the scrubby political conspiracy known as Fianna Fáil will continue, and that we will be able to sweep it out of the public life of this country before it gets the chance of bringing our farmers to the depths of degradation in which I found them three short years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputies in this House may not realise the significance of a transfer of one-fifth of the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Industry and Commerce within a week of this Government coming into office.  When I left the Department of Agriculture it was organised in five divisions, one of which dealt with cereals and feeding stuffs.  Why was that division transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Department of Agriculture by the inter-Party Government?  Because Deputy Morrissey and I agreed that feeding stuffs were the raw material of the agricultural industry and that bread grains were the product of the agricultural industry, and he wanted me to be in a position to watch over these things, not from the point of view of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which was the protector of industry, of the millers and traders, but from the point of view of the farmers whose raw materials these things were.</P>
    <P>The millers did not like it and the traders did not like it because, whenever prices relating to cereals or cereal products fell to be determined they were determined from the point of view of the agricultural community. They will not be so determined any more.  They will be determined from the point of view of the mill, the miller, the merchant and the middleman, and that is why they are being transferred back to Kildare Street.  It <Col N="677" /> makes me apprehensive not that the new Minister for Agriculture cannot answer every query that is addressed to him with the facility that the Minister for Industry and Commerce can answer queries addressed to his Department.  It did not matter who was made Minister for Agriculture, if he was a new Minister, he could not have that facility.  No industry could give it to him without a period in which he could familiarise himself with the work.  There were whole segments taken into the Department of Agriculture for a reason&mdash;because there were powerful vested interests waging war on the agricultural industry of this country and because it was necessary that the Minister for Agriculture should be the final authority as to what the price of Indian meal should be, what the price of pollard should be, what the price of bran should be, what the price for wheat should be and what the conditions should be with which the farmer would have to comply when he delivered his wheat into the mill and that these conditions would be laid down to meet the requirements of the farmers and not of the millers. That is why it was transferred to the Department of Agriculture.  Does this House blame me if I note with apprehension that, within one short week of the new Government being formed, responsibility for these matter has been transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>
    <P>No matter how inexperienced the new Minister for Agriculture naturally may be in the problems of administration, he should not have let that happen.  He was entitled to demand that a decision on that matter should be at least suspended until he had time to examine it and to determine for himself as to whether or not he was prepared to concede the propriety of that procedure.  He ought to have known from his own knowledge of the work of that Department that no sane Minister for Agriculture would draw into that Department any more work merely for the fun of having it there. He ought to have known that there must have been a reason for the change that was made.  He ought not <Col N="678" /> to have started selling the pass in the first seven days of his occupancy in office.  I exhort him even now to stick his heels into the ground and to at least insist on time in which to review proposals of that kind before he hands his whole Department away to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the three caballeros who have been attached to his person.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister now certain specific questions.  I asked him yesterday if the rock removal programme in Connemara had been initiated and he thought it proper to sneer and to say: &ldquo;Yes, on six acres.&rdquo;  I am proud of that.  We started out on the 1st June on a completely new departure that no one had ever attempted before and that every Fianna Fáil Deputy from Galway said could not be done.  Is there any reason to hang our heads because in the first three weeks of June we cleared six acres of rocks from the land in Connemara? If it added one acre to each of six farms in Connemara in three weeks was it not worth doing?</P>
    <P>I remember when I first adumbrated this plan at the Galway County Committee of Agriculture I said to that committee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know that anyone who attempts anything in Connemara will expose himself to ridicule, to insult and to misrepresentation but I think this is worth trying even if it should have that effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know that to ask men to take machinery down to Connemara of a kind unprecedented and of which no one had ever dreamt and to bring it to bear on the special problem of that part of the country was bound to evoke obscurantist ridicule and derision.  I do not think it ever would have been done had I not started it in the middle of the general election.</P>
    <P>Remember, there was no advantage in starting it then.  It could not produce results.  It was bound to excite derision and lead to misguided people talking about pushing Slyne Head into the sea.  What it did produce was six modest acres of land cleared in Connemara, land which was rock-strewn and <Col N="679" /> useless heretofore.  I wonder will the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bartlcy from Clifden, speak so slightingly of that modest programme now that he has become charged under Deputy Lynch, in collaboration with somebody else, as a triumvirate to woo back with public funds to the shattered ranks of Fianna Fáil the western seaboard of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us does he propose to wind up the Connemara division of the land project scheme?  I want to go on record as saying that I am proud of the work, microscopic as it yet is, that has been done in Connemara and grateful to the pioneering officers of my Department, as it then was, who faced the possibility of failure and the certainty of ridicule in making the attempt.  I am proud of the success that attended their efforts in helping that section of our people whom heretofore it was found much easier to provide with doles and pensions as if they were unwanted poor relations but which the inter-Party Government felt were entitled to expect from their own Government such facilities as would enable them to live in dignity and decency in their own homes.</P>
    <P>It is a gratifying tribute that the new Government should think it necessary to provide three Parliamentary Secretaries and a Minister to undertake the programme of work which I, all inadequately, was struggling to perform all alone.  If numbers bespeak success, the Department of Agriculture ought to be a tornado during the next 12 months.  I sincerely trust it will not be a repetition of the oft-told tale of two many cooks spoiling the broth.  I urge on the Minister to remember that, in the last analysis, no matter how many Sancho Panzas there may be he should be the Don Quixote of that Department, not afraid even to tilt at windmills or, in the poetic and prophetic words of his leader, to dream dreams and to achieve performance.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what he is going to do about the land project.  Is it going to be <Col N="680" /> abandoned?  I believe he was quite flattering at Carlow, and said that he was lost in admiration of the work he had seen it do in his native county.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he would also tell us what provision he has made, or intends to make, for fertilisers in the autumn of this year and in the spring of the year to come.  Now is the time to look to this matter.  If our farmers are left to the tender mercies of the Fertiliser Trust in this country, aided and abetted by the Department of Industry and Commerce, God help the farmers. I imported 89,000 tons of superphosphates this year as Minister for Agriculture, of which I left approximately 48,000 tons in store for my successor's disposal.  I would be interested to know what proposals he has in mind for the provision of adequate supplies of ground North African phosphates for farmers this autumn for application to grassland and what provision he proposes to make in respect of superphosphates for the spring tillage crops. I would exhort him not to allow himself to be dominated in the decisions which he will have to make in regard to this matter by the Fertiliser Trust in this country, than which there is no more irresponsible combination in operation anywhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>Further, I would be glad to know if and when the Minister intends to inaugurate the parish plan.  I think he will find in the Department a request from the committees of agriculture of South Tipperary, Westmeath and Longford.  He will also find, I think, that there are 27 parish agents in the process of appointment for the servicing of that scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like him to tell me if the ware potato growers who delivered potatoes to the alcohol factories to the order of the Potato Marketing Board have yet been informed of the amount of the bonus which they are to receive at the end of the season.  My recollection is that they receive a basic price of £4 a ton and that it was hoped to be able to pay them a bonus of from £2 to £2 10s. per ton at the end of the season.  I would be grateful if the Minister, at his convenience, would <Col N="681" /> indicate to the House on what basis that bonus will be payable.</P>
    <P>I do hope the Minister's term of office will be attended by success.  I do say to Deputies on every side of this House that, when debating with the Minister for Agriculture, they have a duty wherever they sit to see in the Minister for Agriculture two distinct persons.  One is the politician, which we all are and which we are all proud to be.  In that rôle it is our right and duty to exchange the ordinary cut and thrust of politics.  But he has a second rôle, and that is as the Minister who represents agriculture in this House. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce sits in that bench, those who are in this House purporting to represent industry, trade or business will always rush to his aid and support against anyone who challenges the interests of that body in our community. Wherever they sit in the House they are all prepared to join hands on the strictly business basis that they are all businessmen and he is their Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the farmers in this House, wherever they sit, so long as Deputy Walsh is Minister for Agriculture in this country, the farmers should bear this in mind, that if he has to spend, in the course of his duty, one half of his time appearing to fight farmers, far the most arduous portion of his life is spent fighting off the vested interests who perennially seek to batten on farmers.  Even at the time of the hottest struggle with vested interests, supported by all the resources of finance and power, who are doing their best to break in on the agricultural community in order to rob it, it is not made easy for the Minister for Agriculture, who mans that gap alone, when he finds behind him the vocal elements in the agricultural community stoutly asserting that they repudiate him and condemn the measures that he seeks to take in their defence.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture hereafter finds himself engaged in that variety of struggle, I hope he will look confidently to me to give him all the help I can to defend the agricultural <Col N="682" /> industry in this country against those who seek to exploit it, and that any previous or subsequent passage of arms in the normal field of politics should not induce him ever to believe that where he is deeply engaged in the service of protecting the agricultural community of this country he need ever apprehend that he will be stabbed in the back from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I see the office of Minister for Agriculture as a great adventure in which any man should be privileged to be allowed to engage.  It is an adventure in which I wish my successor the best of good luck.  I do not think he will think it amiss if I tell him now that I am shocked at the terms on which he took it, belying his own declaration here.  I am shocked at the price he has, perhaps, been tricked into paying when he surrendered a vital fifth of his jurisdiction to a colleague whom the farmers of this country have no reason to trust.</P>
    <P>I am dismayed by the evidence given yesterday of his apparent preparedness to allow politics, and not economics, to guide him in administering the agricultural policy of the new Government. Nevertheless, when he is fighting for the farmers against those who seek to rob them, I hope he will look to me, and to us on this side of the House, to help him but it is fair to tell him that if he follows the course of abdication, of repudiation of his own past and of surrender, abject surrender, to the pressure of any pressure group that threatens him with their power if he does not give in, he will get no sympathy on this side of the House and we shall do our best to remove him from the office he holds.</P>

      <P>To the farmers of this country it is refreshing to know that the Department of Agriculture now rests in the hands and under the control of a farmer, of a man who is one of ourselves, who has come from the agricultural industry, from inside the agricultural industry, and not from outside. It is refreshing to know that we have a Minister for Agriculture to whom and with whom we can talk as a fellow farmer, with whom we can <Col N="683" /> discuss our problems and difficulties. We are glad that the Department of Agriculture is now removed, I hope for ever, from the atmosphere of hysterics and high jinks, but to those who entertain ordinary human feelings of sympathy for a fellow Deputy, I think the outstanding feeling in regard to Deputy Dillon is one of sympathy. I know that he did look forward to being Minister for Agriculture for a long time and I know that he feels deeply disappointed that his term of office has been shortened, but I think that the ex-Minister for Agriculture, and certainly the Deputies of this House generally, will agree that the downfall of Deputy Dillon was his own handiwork and his own handiwork alone.  He approached the farmers from, as it were, a high pedestal, looking down upon them as mere ignorant peasants upon whom he was conferring a tremendous blessing by stretching forth his hand to help them.  I do not think that the new Minister for Agriculture will ever regard the farmers of the country in the same light.  I think he will look upon them as his equals and that he will hope to be regarded by them as their equal.  That is what the farmers expect and what they hope for.  If the farmers band themselves together in a vocational organisation to defend their interests or to put forward their just claims, I am sure he will not describe that organisation as a political ramp designed to overthrow or embarrass him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in opening his speech, referred to the humiliation which he claimed the Minister had to suffer in changing his policy, as he alleged.  I wonder did Deputy Dillon ever consider the humiliation which he himself had to suffer when, as Minister for Agriculture, he had to go before the people and appeal to the farmers of Ireland to grow more wheat?  How these words must have stuck in his throat! They did stick in his throat, because it is clearly evident that he knew last winter that it was a matter of vital importance that the acreage of wheat should be increased but the then Minister for Agriculture could not bring <Col N="684" /> himself to appeal to the farmers to grow more wheat until after the 1st April, long after the period in which, in the ordinary course of events, wheat should be in the ground.  I think listening to the ex-Minister for Agriculture it has been brought home to every Deputy in this House that he suffered from a terrible obsession&mdash;perhaps it dates back to 1917 or 1918&mdash;an obsession and a hostility to the whole idea of national self-reliance as shown by his bitter denunciation of the policy of self-sufficiency.  I think nobody in this country, certainly no leading member of the old Sinn Féin movement or any movement that succeeded it, ever advocated complete self-sufficiency for Ireland, but they did advocate, from the time of Arthur Griffith and long before his time, that there should be at least a sufficient measure of self-sufficiency in this country to make the country economically safe and economically sound That, I think, is all that has been advocated by progressive nationalists of this country.  Yet the ex-Minister for Agriculture spurned that policy down through the years to such an extent that he built up a fallacious case against the growing of wheat and found all kinds of arguments to advance against it.  To my own knowledge at a meeting in Carlow he publicly demanded that wheat growing should cease.</P>
    <P>On another occasion he suggested that it would be a good thing if the sugar factories were blown up.  To-day he seems to be reiterating that policy, a policy of depending upon foreign ships to bring to the people of this country the things we require from the furthest ends of the earth and of depending on ships to bring our surplus supplies to the furthest ends of the earth in exchange.  He seems to base his whole policy in regard to agriculture on the shifting sands of a very unsettled international world situation.  For the greater part of his speech to-day he bitterly attacked the Minister for Agriculture for having dared to give the farmers who produce milk a small increase in the price that they are receiving at the creameries. What is his case against the increase? His case is that it is possible that we may have a surplus of butter some time <Col N="685" /> in the future, that the world price will be low and that we shall not be able, therefore, to compete in the world markets.  On that unsubstantial case, he fights against giving the producer in this most important industry a very modest concession.</P>
    <P>You will realise how modest is this concession when it is brought home to you that in the last week the wages of an agricultural worker were increased by 7/6 per week.  That increase will amount, I think, to almost £20 a year and the increase in the price of milk will only be about three-fourths of it.  Assuming that it takes one man to look after ten cows, the increase in the price of milk will not cover the total increase in wages.</P>
    <P>There are people who will make the case that the farmers are blackmailing the rest of the community but in this matter of a better price for milk it is not the farmers who have the benefit. The entire benefit has gone to the agricultural worker.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  The agricultural worker is the human foundation upon which the agricultural industry must rest.  I realise that while the benefit of the increase has gone to the agricultural worker in the case where the dairy farmer depends upon employed labour, in the same way it has gone to the farmer's family in the case of the many small farms where the work is done by family labour.  I am not objecting to that but I think that there ought to be a sense of proportion in regard to this matter.  We ought not allow ourselves to be fooled, as a lot of people have been fooled, by hysterical outbursts on half-baked economics which have guided the ex-Minister for Agriculture along his erratic course over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory that the new Minister has agreed to the principle of a careful investigation of farmers' costings. The farmer is not seeking to rob the rest of the community.  All he wants is justice and fair play.  He is making an honest appeal for justice and he is not afraid of any impartial investigation into his costs of production. Nothing angered me more over the last three years than the repeated <Col N="686" /> assertions of the then Minister for Agriculture that an investigation of the farmer's costings would show that he was making an excessive profit, and that he was refusing to give us an investigation into costings out of benevolence for the farmers of this country. He claimed that an investigation would expose the fact that farmers were making excessive profits.  I never accepted that view and I do not think that the present Minister will accept it. I think that the new Minister will be prepared to tell the farmer that he is entitled to a fair price for his produce and, because he is entitled to a fair price, I think the Minister will agree to the setting up of an impartial investigation into the costs of production on an officially run farm.  Nobody wants the man who is running his farm inefficiently to make a profit.</P>
    <P>All we seek is to ensure that the man who is running his farm efficiently will make a reasonable profit.  To run a dairy farm efficiently requires the application of a tremendous amount of industry and the exercise of a tremendous amount of skill.  The man who runs a dairy farm efficiently is entitled, therefore, to get some little profit out of his business.  It was also a source of anger to a great many farmers that the ex-Minister for Agriculture sought to misrepresent costings figures that were presented to him by Professor Murphy of University College, Cork.  Professor Murphy found that milk production costs three or four years ago were 8½d. a gallon in the summer months and, I think, 1/6 a gallon in the winter months.  The then Minister for Agriculture took the figure of 8½d. as being the cost of production of milk&mdash;on the assumption, apparently, that a cow would come down from Heaven on 1st May, give milk for the summer months and then be taken up to Heaven for the winter months.  He ignored the fact that a cow milking in the summer months must be maintained over the whole year.  In adopting that attitude the ex-Minister, though he knew he could not deceive the farmers, was hoping to deceive the urban population who, possibly, do not give careful consideration to these matters. <Col N="687" /> It was a shame to misrepresent and misinterpret figures that were very conscientiously secured by Professor Murphy and by the people who cooperated with him in the carrying out of that costings investigation.</P>
    <P>Having made a reasonable gesture to those who are engaged in the creamery industry, the Minister has also decided that another section of the dairying industry is not to be despised and trampled upon.  He has decided that those who are engaged in producing country butter on their own farms are to receive fair and equitable treatment.  Nobody could ever explain in this House or outside it why the man who produced butter efficiently through his co-operative society should have that commodity subsidised while the man who produced butter efficiently on his own farm did not receive a similar concession.  I think it was due to the war which the ex-Minister for Agriculture waged upon the manufacture of farmers' butter that we had to import the malodorous commodity which we have been importing at a high price from the Continent and elsewhere.  If the ex-Minister for Agriculture, instead of getting up in this House and giving us an exhibition of his abhorrence of farmers' butter&mdash; instead of denouncing farmers' butter in the way in which he denounced it&mdash; had sought to give the people who produce farmers' butter a fair price and a fair inducement to improve the quality of that butter, he would not have had to go running around the world seeking butter, as has been the case in the past few months.  When he came into office he told us that there were stacks of farmers' butter that had had to be conveyed to the ports with the aid of the fire brigade men equipped with gas masks.  Was that a reasonable way for a Minister for Agriculture to speak of an Irish agricultural product? Is it not the duty of a Minister for Agriculture in this country to fight for fair prices for the produce of the farmers of this country?</P>
    <P>If anything goes wrong with a small quantity of that produce the matter should be disposed of without proclaiming <Col N="688" /> to the world that it is of inferior quality.  I think that this question is now being approached in a reasoned way by our present Minister for Agriculture. I think he will see that the quality of country butter is again improved. There is no doubt but that the quality of Irish country butter was much superior to what it is to-day. There was a great deal more attention given to production and marketing some years ago.  That whole attitude towards country butter was completely destroyed by the previous Minister for Agriculture.  I hope that with a better price a new approach will be made to this problem.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the near future we will have the rural electrification scheme extended to almost all the country districts.  With the aid of rural electrification, it will be possible to produce good butter on the farm in districts where the creamery service is not available.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the dairying industry to which, I am sure, the Minister is directing his attention at the present time, and that is the section which caters for the supply of whole milk to our towns and cities.  I understand that some weeks ago the Minister for Agriculture received a request to meet a deputation from the Dublin district milk producers.  I am quite sure that the Minister will avail of the first opportunity to meet those people and discuss with them their particular problems and difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that, if the Minister meets the people engaged in milk production for Dublin, he will learn from them many interesting facts in regard to their difficulties and problems.  I am quite sure that he will be able to reach a satisfactory agreement with them in regard to a fair system of fixing the prices for their produce. There is no doubt whatever but that the price of milk as paid to producers, particularly in the winter months, is altogether unsatisfactory.  There is no doubt but that the price of milk, particularly during the month of April, is entirely unsatisfactory.  It is entirely unsatisfactory, having regard to the high cost of feeding stuffs in practically every county during the month <Col N="689" /> of April and more particularly in those counties which supply Dublin City. April is the most expensive month of the year in which to feed cows as everybody knows.  Yet, over the past three or four years, the price of milk has been drastically reduced.  A reasonable talk with the milk producers' representatives will convince the Minister that something ought to be done about the matter.</P>
    <P>The ex-Minister for Agriculture pleaded for consideration and support for the present Minister when he is negotiating in regard to prices for our exportable surplus and when he is fighting in the farmers' interests.  I think that everyone will agree that it is essential that the Minister should be backed up and supported to the fullest extent by all when he is making a fight for better prices for our exportable surplus of agricultural produce. Our whole economic life and our standard of living, to a great extent, depends upon our ability to secure good prices.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, the foundation of our whole economy depends upon our being able to produce, in the main, the things we require.  In addition, of course, to what we can produce here, we will have to import a certain quantity of commodities but we hope that quantity will decrease as time goes on.  In order to import those products we must export and our main product for export is our agricultural surplus.  For that reason, we should support the Minister in his endeavours to get for us the best prices that can be obtained for our agricultural surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not understand the attitude of the Minister's predecessor when he was actually engaged in negotiating with the British in regard to the price of eggs last year.  He came into the House during the time those negotiations were in progress and announced that the offer the British had made of 2/- a dozen for eggs was a very good offer and the price a very good price <Col N="690" /> for the Irish producer.  That is not the way to do business with a foreign country.  The price of 2/- a dozen for eggs represented a reduction of one-third the price which was paid when Deputy Dillon took office.  I hope that in the future an entirely different attitude will be adopted in regard to the price obtained for any surplus we have to export.  While Deputy Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture, may not be able to speak as eloquently or as flamboyantly to the British Ministers as Deputy Dillon, I hope he will keep a hard head.  This would be much more effective. Wild words may get scare headlines in the newspapers.  It is all very well to say, &ldquo;We will drown you with eggs.&rdquo;  That may get a better headline in the newspapers but it does not help to get better prices.  I hope that, when the Minister goes to negotiate with the British Ministers, he will deal with them in the same way as a prudent, hard-headed farmer at a fair deals with those from whom he is seeking to buy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that last night, in closing the debate on the Second Stage, the Minister for Finance said that the Coalition Government had spent recklessly and borrowed improvidently, leaving it to their successors to pay.  I take that to be the keynote of the new finance system which is going to be followed under the present Administration.  It answers one question which has been puzzling people for a long time, the people who have been asking from time to time where the statue of Queen Victoria which was recently removed from the <Col N="692" /> front of these buildings went.  She is quite clearly now installed in the Department of Finance and we are going to have Victorianism rampant. One has to say about that statue that it was at least old and depicted Queen Victoria at a late stage in her career when she might have derived some little learning from her experience over the years, but the dame now installed in Finance is Queen Victoria in her earliest years when she had not had time to learn anything of the world growing up around her.</P>
      <P>If the group to which I belonged as a Government did spend recklessly, one would have thought that one of the first things that would have come from the Minister for Finance would have been a halting of that situation, that some of the reckless spending would have been stopped, and if it is possible to pass the judgement that expenditure was on the reckless side, it is possible surely to have the details examined and have some amendment made even at an early stage.  When it is said that the borrowing is improvident I suppose that means that we are going to have the switch-over which was so often promised and, if the Government do not find it possible to restrict any of the schemes which the previous Government had in hand, they are at least going to have another method of paying.  In other words, the taxpayer is going to be made bend his shoulders once more to the burden from which we relieved him from 1948 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that we left it to our successors to pay.  What did we leave our successors to pay?  The piece of finance legislation under discussion covers what has been brought out in the Financial Statement and in the Financial Statement not merely was everything that fell for payment, and immediately for payment, in the present year met, but £1,500,000 was set aside for commitments which I said I had to consider as being there and as being real commitments.  I added to that that that was no fund into which people could dip, a sort of reserve on which people could draw for any new schemes and that any new scheme called for new taxes.  The people who <Col N="693" /> talk about improvidence and recklessness and leaving others to pay then come before this House, knowing that the debt for the public servants has to be met.  Is it an accusation against me that I did not provide for that?</P>
    <P>An arbitration which had started ten days before came to a conclusion about 24th May.  I suppose at the time when the arbitrator was sitting members of the present Government regarded it as a proper thing for me to include some sum in the Financial Statement ahead of there being any arbitration, and so give both the contestants before the arbitration board as well as the arbitrator himself a line on how much should be given.  I met that situation by saying that that would require new taxes and we would have found new taxes for that commitment.  The present Government have now to find them, as during the election they decided to raise the point as to whether the award of the arbitrator was going to be met or not.</P>
    <P>During the election, the Minister had to lament about what was called the Roe Report in connection with the teachers.  Last night, he went out of his way more or less to give a tip to whatever arbitration sits with regard to the teachers about giving an increase to teachers, and put himself in the awkward position that, if something amounting to the Roe award is given, he will not find it very easy to refuse to meet it.  That is still to come, however. In any event, there are £2.4 millions to be met this year, plus £x for the teachers, and that is going to be a considerable sum.  Yesterday the Government added on to the taxpayers' burden an additional £4000,000. No provision has been made for that. If it is a sin to provide for expenditure, without also making clear the means of payment, then, inside their first fortnights as a Government, the present Government have done exactly that.</P>
    <P>We add on the £400,000 to the £2.4 million already there and we get something a little short of £3,000,000 to be provided in this financial year.  There are, in addition to that, the matters which are raised in a general way by this phrase about improvident borrowing. <Col N="694" /> The amount of the Supply Services as set out in the front of the Book of Estimates this year is £83,000,000 odd.  That is divided, as I said last night, into almost £71,000,000 for &ldquo;Other Services&rdquo; and £12,000,000 for &ldquo;Capital Services&rdquo;.  If the present Government have their minds made up to the point that the borrowing for these Capital Services is an improvident matter, they should at least by this time know how much is improvident and what is the magnitude of the improvident part of it.  In other words, they should know what is the part that is either to be dropped or to be switched over to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Whatever sum it will be&mdash;and it will run into millions&mdash;must be added to the £2.4 millions for the public servants and the £400,000 in respect of the increased cost of creamery milk.  I assume, as has been assumed in the House already, that, once the price of creamery milk goes up, the price of ordinary milk will go up also.  Is that going to be met as an increased charge upon the people's costs during their workaday lives, or is it going to be a subsidy, or is it going to be divided, as in the case of the increased price of creamery milk?  Have we any idea of what the division is going to be, because, if again some part is going to fall on the taxpayer's back, that is also an addition to the bill&mdash;£2.4 millions, with the £400,000 for creamery milk and whatever will be the amount in respect of ordinary milk?  Have the Government yet cleared up their minds as to which of these capital services they are going to drop, or, if not dropped, are going to finance in another way?  I know what Queen Victoria would have said and I suppose the Minister for Finance will speak Victoria's mind and say that all this should be put on the taxpayer's shoulders in any year.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Finance was orating in that way towards the end of yesterday evening, I noticed by to-day's paper that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, was complaining that the amount of money put at his disposal for expenditure on the capital side under the Local Authorities (Works) Act had been reduced. <Col N="695" /> Presumably that is to be increased and if so, I do not know whether it will be part of the funds that can be found properly by borrowing or improvidently by borrowing, but they have to make up their minds on that.</P>
    <P>The question of off-the-ration, unsubsidised commodities&mdash;tea, sugar, butter, white bread and flour&mdash;was much discussed during the election.  If these are not to be sold off the ration and without subsidy and, if, as seems likely, the ration is to be vastly increased but remain at the subsidised rate or with some slight increase, or if everything is to be let loose at the new price, we should be told what that price is and should be told so before the Finance Bill passes.  The people are entitled to be informed at this point on certain matters.  The cost of living is one of the heaviest points of the indictment framed against the last Government, whether on the official index figure or not.  The cost of living has increased in three separate ways since the present Government came in and I suppose that, during at least a couple of times each week, there will be some further announcement regarding increased prices.  It is peculiar that, in an election fought so much in connection with the children, one of the earliest increases is on butter which weights so heavily with the family person.  One could not think of anything less suitable for a new Government to increase in price than children's foods, milk and butter, which take such a prominent place in the budgeting arrangements of parents in providing for the proper upbringing of young children.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Finance Bill last year, the greatest agitation was raised on two points&mdash;the price of petrol and the £300,000 lifted from the Road Fund.  The three people most vehement in their opposition to the taking of moneys from the Road Fund were Deputies Childers, Walsh and Corry.  Deputies Childers and Walsh are now members of the Government and Deputy Corry still remains the back bencher, although one would think he had served sufficiently long in that way to get promotion <Col N="696" /> when promotions were so easy to get.  These three divided Dáil Éireann the last time on the taking of the £300,000 from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers had a long scientific and somewhat bewildering argument to show that the roads required greater money for maintenance now than ever before, that the remaking programme instituted, he said, in 1946 or 1947 had not been fully carried out and that consequently it was something approaching a crime to make any raid on the Road Fund last year, without the raid being repeated now.  One is almost tempted to have a division, to see the parties now supporting the Government walking through the Lobbies in support not merely of the thing they were against last year, but against which they put up some most vehement arguments last year.</P>
    <P>There was strong opposition last year also to the increase of 2d.  on petrol.  That is being accepted now by those who wanted it reduced to 9d. last year and who made the argument that unless it were reduced to 9d., not merely would bus fares be increased in the city to the deteriment of the unfortunate workers using transport, but the cost of every commodity carried by road&mdash; and I was assured that most things are carried by road now&mdash;would be raised enormously.  Of course, the bleeding hearts of Deputies were wide open with sympathy last year to get the price back to 9d. from the 1/3 at which it was.  I think it is a good tax and I am not abating my enthusiasm for it when taxes have to be found.  Deputies were very agitated about this last year and said that people who have moved out from the city to areas like Kimmage and Crumlin but who must come in every day to their work were suffering under severe hardships by this extra tax of 2d. on petrol.</P>
    <P>I want to challenge again what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said yesterday regarding the surcharge on telephone rates, from 5 to 25 per cent., being a decision of the last Government. I challenge that and think it is untrue.  If I am wrong, it should be easy to counter by quoting the Government <Col N="697" /> decision and giving the date.  I know that personally I minuted a file dead against the proposal, as I did against another about raising the letter rate, as I thought both were too heavy impositions on the people.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in a somewhat deceitful way yesterday used a phrase which could bear the interpretation that there was a Government decision.  Again he is a wrong.  There was no Government decision, except to make the Post Office pay its way. It may be that, as he has been put in charge of the Post Office, he is making the point that it is for him to decide the detailed ways in which the extra revenue will be found.  I would again like to hear quoted the Government decision that Post Office charges should be raised in this way.</P>
    <P>I certainly would like to be told the date and to have the decision quoted to me whereby the raising of the surcharge on telephones from 5 per cent. to 25 per cent. was carried.  If it was carried it was carried without my knowledge and, as a matter of fact, as far as I could as an individual, I was dead against any such proposal and minuted my view on that, that I would not have it.</P>
    <P>However, Post Office charges are one of the things raised and maybe it will not hit the people in their costs of livelihood too much.  The cost of butter has gone up, the cost of milk is clearly going to go up, and the taxpayer is obviously going to be faced with a very heavy burden almost immediately. I am not sure that that burden will be placed upon him by the present Government because what happened in the last few days has shown quite clearly that Deputies are going to be asked to parade before their constituents again very soon. That is clear when one observes a procedure of cashing in as quickly as possible on promises of benefits and when one sees a Finance Minister who finds it consistent to declaim against others for an improvident financial policy, and yet to bring in financial legislation which does not cover the costs of the year.  He admits that the costs are not covered and the bill is <Col N="698" /> mounting up at the present moment to somewhere in the region of £3,000,000. That is not any exaggeration of the exact amount that has to be found for the things we already know about.</P>
    <P>Of course there are other things in the offing.  There is what is called social security.  We have the old age pensions, a piece of legislation that is going to be flashed through the House. When will the benefits come and when will the bill be presented to the taxpayer in order to met these increases? We are told that there will be new social security.  All we know of that in its preliminary stages as announced by the present Government when they were in opposition is that they are going to keep the rates of contribution by employers and employees as they are and that any difference either in costs of administration or in greater benefits is to be met by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Somebody in the Government can add up.  I cannot because I do not know the sums to be put on each line. In any event, however, they are the headings.  There is then the question of the off-ration sales of certain commodities and we have been promised that they are no longer to be sold off the ration.  Whether they are to be fully subsidised or sold at the economic price I do not know, but somebody might tell me what that is going to cost. We also have the offloading on to the taxpayer of services met by borrowing so far together with provision to meet the expenses of borrowing.  £12,000,000 services are going to be met by the taxpayer and taken off the loan funds. Those are two biggish items.</P>
    <P>What else will the Government add to all that?  Have they any resources other than those they had before and which broke them as a Government? During the election they were itching to say that the country could not get on without the taxation they imposed in autumn 1947 on beer, tobacco, wines and income-tax.  Are these what they have in mind again?  These are what they really will have as sources of revenue if they get through another election which they will run before the bill is presented and before anybody has to say how the revenue will be <Col N="699" /> derived.  It is a bill that will be hanging about and which somebody can meet after the election while the promise of benefits will be held dangling before the people with the view that success may come certain people's way this time.</P>
    <P>The legislation we have under discussion at the moment is good legislation which is meeting the expenses of the year in a proper fashion, legislation under which in a difficult year it was found possible to give alleviations and alleviations particularly to the family man.  The Budget was hailed as a good Budget and the Finance Bill was hailed as a good Finance Bill.  A change has since been brought in.  Those were the commitments of the year; there are now other commitments and the fact that there are is a matter which must increase suspicion and suspicion is current in most people's minds.</P>
    <P>If anybody tells me that borrowing was improvident, I would ask them to examine it in this way: the test to be applied to the capital Budget was whether it was profitable from the social point of view.  I would define that as whether the national income would be raised by as much as the interest on the cost of what was being done.  That is a sound economic test and judging by that test what we did was good.  Another ways of judging it is to think in terms of the national debt having increased; so it has.  One might say that the charges on the national debt have increased; so they have.  If the national income increases in a certain way, that is all right.  If the national income increases in such a way that the impact of the new national debt charges is no worse than the impact of the old charges was on the previous income, then the situation is no worse.  That is the test I apply.  It is a good test.  Anybody who is going to say that it was improvident might tell me by what standard, by what test, it was improvident.  Let us leave out Queen Victoria.  We got rid of Queen Victoria from outside, but certain people want to reinstate her <Col N="700" /> inside the House.  We have the old-time, moth-eaten views.

      <P>I have been told that things were bad judging by the old standards.  They may be bad by those standards but that is no criticism of what was done but a criticism of the standards.  With our eyes open, deliberately, with plenty of good economic thought and deliberation behind us, we took a particular line.  It was a good line and any change in that line will lead the people of the country into an austerity not warranted by the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputies of all sides, even the least intelligent backbencher of the Government, must realise that good things for their constituents are a thing of the past if the Fianna Fáil Government is to continue. We who supported the inter-Party Government and sat beside the inter-Party Minister for Finance gave him advice and the benefit of experience based on the sad and tragic 16 years of the Fianna Fáil Administration that overtaxed the taxpayers of this country. Just before the Fianna Fáil Government left office most ridiculous taxes were imposed.  Cigarettes, beer and spirits were taxed.  People may have thought that it was only the consumers of beer and spirits and the cigarette smoker that were directly affected by these taxes.  Little consideration was given by the back benchers in this House to the fact that the brewing industry and the malting industry were being affected as a result of these taxes, that fewer people were being employed in malt houses, and that it was possible that fewer people would be employed in the manufacture of cigarettes if these taxes had been continued. I believe that these taxes which were imposed by the Fianna Fáil <Col N="701" /> Supplementary Budget would have had very serious consequences in an indirect way if the inter-Party Government had not wiped them out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister might be inclined to tell the House what he proposes to tax.  We have not yet been told whether it is intended to tax these commodities again.  I would be satisfied if the Tánaiste would give the House an undertaking that during the coming year there will not be any attempt by the Government to reimpose these taxes.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill is an excellent piece of legislation which brings a certain measures of relief to taxpayers. I have always maintained that legislation which gives relief even to one citizen is good.  I cannot hope to see any such favourable legislation coming from any Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in the future.  I was convinced that Fianna Fáil had been taught a very good lesson as a result of the three years during which they were on this side of the House. Listening to the speeches of the present Minister for Finance when in opposition, I thought that he was anxious to occupy a position in which he could bring down the cost of living and lighten the burden on the taxpayers. But, within two weeks of this Government taking office, they have concentrated all their energies on raising the cost of living.  The cost of living is certainly being increased for the very poorer sections of the community. The increase in the price of milk at the expense of consumers of butter will have very serious consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste at an election meeting in Waterford complained that the inter-Party Government had not given the slightest possible consideration to the question of the ever-increasing cost of living, despite the fact that they had removed the taxes which his Government imposed before they left office.  Yet, a fortnight or three weeks <Col N="702" /> after the coming into office of the Government, the price of butter is being increased by 2d. per lb.  I wonder what is the opinion of Deputy Dr. Browne with regard to this increase in the price of butter. He has been a very strong advocate of the use of butter and milk in the homes of the poorer sections of our people.</P>

      <P>I thought it might be in order for the Minister to give us an idea whether further taxes are to be imposed.  We are all probing in the dark to-day because the Minister for Finance has not given any indication as to what he proposes to tax in the future.  During their three years of office the inter-Party Government gave valuable service.  All we want the present Government to do is to leave the taxpayers the measure of freedom they have had in the past so that when we get back into office again we will be able to say that no further taxes have been imposed.  Serious warning has been given to the Government in the last fortnight about tampering any further with the taxpayers.  We imposed no new taxes' during the last three years.  Now we find that the days of relief for the taxpayers are gone and that the days of heavy taxation are coming again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints have been made about <Col N="703" /> the road grants.  Deputy Corry and the present Minister for Agriculture were two of the Deputies who complained very bitterly about the cutting of the road grants.  Yet, Deputy Tom Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture, or Deputy Corry did not realise that we spent far more under the local authorities works in every part of the country.  Therefore, I say and I maintain that the Tánaiste should give this House and the taxpayers some idea of how they stand.  We all know very well that at a very early date the Fianna Fáil Party will consult the electorate again.  If they are going to consult the electorate they should be at least honest with them at an early date and give them some facts and give this House some facts as to how they propose to get in the funds they requite to administer the affairs of this country.</P>
    <P>My last and final warning is this&mdash; and I hope the Tánaiste will convey it to the Minister for Finance&mdash;whether their stay in Government is long or short, I advice them strongly again to keep their hands out of the taxpayers' pockets and to see that no taxes whatever are imposed that will in any way affect the working-class people.</P>

      <P>I would also like to know if it is the intention to continue borrowing in the same manner as we have been doing for years.  The municipal debt of Cork City to-day is £21 10s. 2d. per head of the population. That means that every child born in Cork from now on has a municipal debt of £21 10s. 2d. on its head. That works out roughly at about £107 10s. 10d. for an average family of five.  We have to pay £7,000,000 for the service of the national debt and that is equal to the wages of 34,000 <Col N="704" /> agricultural workers at £3 17s. 6d. a week.  In other words, the labour of 34,000 agricultural workers will have to earn the interest to pay our national debt.  I am speaking now on matters that I am interested in, not to-day or yesterday.  I know what we have to contend with in Cork City.  Deputy MacCarthy is listening to me and he knows it also.  Our interest charges have increased in Cork for municipal work from a yearly average of £56,320 for the five years ending March, 1946, to a yearly average of £70,547 for the five years ending March, 1951.  Then we are told that there is no difficulty about money and some people tell us that we are suffering from too much money.</P>

      <P>Yes. If Deputy McGilligan had pursued his historical researches a little further he would have discovered that the practice of mortgaging future revenue to increase current spending antedated Queen Victoria by several centuries, that it was not a new discovery of his.  The Pharaohs knew about it and the Caesars knew about it and look what happened to them.  No doubt, they built pyramids, Sphinxes and circuses and entertained the people of Egypt and Rome in their day but it is not evident from their history that the practice is one to commend itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This antediluvian policy of Deputy McGilligan's, of mortgaging future revenue to increase capacity for current spending is of course very convenient for individuals as well as Governments so long as it is possible, but there comes a time in the history of every individual and every Government when that policy becomes impracticable, when they are stretched to the limit of their credit or when other financial difficulties make it impossible to pursue it.  At that time a decision has to be made by each individual or each Government concerned as to whether they will meet the situation by cutting expenditure or by increasing revenue. I think that Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, had reached that situation and that he solved it for the time being last May by just ignoring the many items of expenditure which he knew he would have to meet during the current year and by making no provision of any kind to cover them.</P>

      <P>The position, so far as this financial year is concerned, is this, that having provided in the Budget £1,500,000 to cover anticipated increased expenditure during this year in respect of social security changes, the mother and child service and grants to the Tourist Board, Deputy McGilligan, the Minister for Finance, stated that if any further expenditure arose during the year it would involve a corresponding increase in taxes or other charges.  Now, at the time that <Col N="707" /> Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, was saying that in his Budget Statement, he knew quite well that there were a number of additional charges likely to arise during the year against which he had made no provision in his Budget.  He knew that this arbitration board for the Civil Service was meeting, and that they were likely to give an award which would involve increased payments in respect of civil servants' salaries.  He knew that Córas Iompair Éireann was running at a heavy loss, and that the deficit would have to be made good by a Supplementary Estimate during the course of the year.  He knew that other charges were likely to arise, and that many people, to whom money was owed by the Government, were pressing for payment, and that some contribution in respect of these debts would have to be made during the year.</P>

Deputy Dr. Browne had been a member of the Government, and he said during the election campaign that the Estimates for Supply Services were written down by £4,000,000 to make the Budget balance.  Apart altogether from any such writing down of the Estimates, there were new changes likely to reach the figure of £4,000,000 which the Minister for Finance knew he would have to meet during the year and against which he had made no provision in the Estimates.  What he did say in the Budget Statement was this, that the £1,500,000 to which he had referred &ldquo;must be regarded as already fully committed and any additional expenditure must entail corresponding increases in taxes or other charges&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Let me say that, so far as the Fianna Fáil Party is concerned, whatever support it received during the election was not upon the basis of a promise to reduce taxation, nor did we undertake that the election of Fianna Fáil Ministers would result in the cost of living generally tumbling down.</P>

This time not one of them ventured to suggest that their return to office would involve a reduction in taxation or a lowering of the cost of living.</P>

    <P>It is obvious that the Budget this year is going to close with a substantial deficit.  Deputy McGilligan knew that when introducing it in May.  We know it now, and it does not appear as if anything can be done about it now.

      <P>It is true that we have already added to the numerous items of expenditure, previously anticipated in the current financial year, one additional item arising out of the decision to increase the price of milk which will involve a further £400,000 approximately in the cost of subsidies.  I gathered from Deputy McGilligan's remarks that he did not think that the increase in the price of milk was justified. I think that the same was to be gathered from Deputy Flanagan's observations also.  That is hardly a matter to argue out now in a debate on the Finance Bill, but there are very few Deputies who seriously think that the situation which was developing in the dairying industry did not require some action.  It seems to me that the action taken was the most appropriate. A very substantial decline in milk output is the legacy which we have got from Deputy Dillon's administration of the Department of Agriculture, and naturally, of course, that is of concern to the Government.</P>

The previous Government took credit for that expansion although it would have taken place in any event.  A stage was reached when expansion stopped and a decline set in. That decline was obviously not due to any reappearance of the circumstances which had curtailed production during the war years.  It was due largely to the fact that the return which the milk <Col N="710" /> producers were getting under the existing price was insufficient to attract in creased production.</P>
      <P>That is our view, anyway.  We are prepared to defend that view and to justify the step we have taken to increase the price.  If Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Flanagan or any of the Deputies opposite think they can convince this House that the increase in milk prices was not justified, they are welcome to try it.  We think it was justified, and we have sanctioned the increase.  We recognise that the consequences of it on the price of butter are likely to be unpopular with consumers, and we have tried to minimise these consequences by bearing some part of the cost on the subsidy. But there is no use pretending either to the House or to the ordinary consumers of foodstuffs throughout the country that an increase in the prices guaranteed to producers of farm products following an increase in the cost of production on farms can be secured otherwise than by increased charges carried somewhere, carried either on prices or on taxes.  If Deputies opposite are very worried about the effect of the increase in the price of butter upon the cost of living, let me remind them that it will increase the cost-of-living index number by about a quarter of one point.  During the three months from February to May, when the Coalition Government was administering the national affairs, the cost-of-living index number increased by six points.</P>

Deputy McGilligan said that the Minister for Finance stated on an earlier stage of this Bill that borrowing for capital services was improvident.  The Minister for Finance said nothing of the kind.  Borrowing for capital services is not merely good policy but is one we intend to pursue to the limit. Deputy McGilligan, of course, was begging the issue.  The real issue is whether some of the purposes for which he borrowed could be properly described as capital services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a six-point rise in the cost-of-living index number between February and May of this year. What the rise would have been had the Minister for Industry and Commerce attended at his office during that period, I do not know.  When I came into the Department I found a stack of Price Orders waiting my signature, a stack about a foot high, some of <Col N="713" /> which had been lying there for three months and which my predecessor had, no doubt for good reasons, declined to look at.  Doing nothing about demands for price revisions is a very easy way of keeping down the cost-of-living index number.  Early last March the Prices Advisory Body made a recommendation that the price of butcher's meat should be increased.  That recommendation came to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The only thing my predecessor did was to decide in April that all inspection and all prosecutions for non-compliance with the existing Meat Prices Order should be stopped.  I am not suggesting that the Statistics Branch decided to base their cost-of-living index number upon the prices for meat fixed under the existing Orders.  That branch took the precaution of going out and buying meat at the price at which it was actually being sold and based their calculations upon what they learned in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In every respect.  There are problems there of very serious dimensions.  I do not think the way to solve them is just to heap the files into a corner of an office and leave them there.  Do you seriously think that you can keep down the cost of living by taking ten, 15 or 20 recommendations from this Prices Advisory Body that prices should be raised and sticking them in a drawer and forgetting all about them?  Do you think that will promote a better situation in relation to either prices or the trade and industry of the country?  It is very easy to dodge problems for a time in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked me if the cost of living will go up.  I think it will but I will try to control the rise as much as I can.  I am faced here <Col N="714" /> not merely with this foot-high pile of unsigned Orders accumulated during the past three months and about which my predecessor did nothing, but I know also that the Electricity Supply Board has been urging for months past that electricity rates should be increased because that board is losing £80,000 per month due to increases in their fuel and other costs.  I know that Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance was pressing on Córas Iompair Eíreann that transport charges should be increased in order to minimise the heavy loss that is occurring and I know that somewhere between Córas Iompair Éireann and the Department of Finance that instruction was tied up and put in a pigeon-hole because nothing was done about it.  I could multiply these examples one hundred fold.  Everything was left for the new Government to handle.  Every nasty job that our predecessors were reluctant to tackle was left for us.  We will face this responsibility.  We intend to do our job.  We will not try to dodge our problems in order to maintain some temporary political situation.  We have no interest in doing that.  Our view is that we must do what we as members of the Government think right and what we will be able to justify to the public whenever that justification becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said his Government did not agree to the increase in Post Office charges to which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>It is one way by which democracy could act, but I think it would be a very inefficient way.  However, on 23rd April, 1951, the secretary of the Department of Finance wrote to the secretary, Department of Posts and Telegraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance has asked me to pass to you the enclosed list of charges for various Post Office services which have been approved by himself and his Cabinet colleagues. I have marked with a pencilled tick the approved items.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he came to the telephone charges &mdash;the 40 per cent. increase which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had proposed:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;40 per cent. telephone surcharge is looked upon as too steep. 25 per cent. would be more acceptable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the next day the secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs discussed the matter with Deputy Everett, as Minister, and he recorded this note:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Scannell and I discussed this&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then there is a bracket</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(telephone surcharges) with the Minister to-day.  The Minister confirmed the first paragraph of Mr. McElligott's letter.  He intimated his agreement also to a 25 per cent. surcharge and the new minimum call charge of 3d.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The first paragraph of Mr. McElligott's letter, might I repeat, to refresh Deputies' memories, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance has asked me to pass to you the enclosed list of charges for various Post Office services which have been approved by himself and his Cabinet colleagues.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the next day, the 24th April, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wrote to Mr. McGilligan, Minister for Finance, a letter which goes as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have intimated to the departmental officials here my approval of the proposal relating to telephone charges and the other adjustments in public charges for services covered <Col N="716" /> by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Steps are being taken to implement the decision without delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the letter from Mr. McElligott, it says that charges were approved by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues.  Why was it necessary, subsequent to that approval, to send that letter to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, seeing that he is one of the colleagues of the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the answer to that.  The letter was sent. The following day the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wrote to the Minister for Finance saying that he was intimating to his departmental officials his approval of the proposal relating to telephone charges and the other adjustments in public charges for services covered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and: &ldquo;Steps are being taken to implement the decision without delay.&rdquo;  That proved to be a false prophecy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had proposed that the increase in the telephone surcharge should be 40 per cent., not 25 per cent., and the agreement was only to 25 per cent.  On the following day the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wrote to the Minister for Finance to the effect that steps were being taken to implement the decision without delay.  Does that put that question beyond argument? If any member of the former Government wants to examine these papers, they will be available for him.</P>
      <P>There are many questions which Deputies can ask at the present stage concerning the intentions of the Government which I just cannot answer. We are trying to find our way through the maze of complexities which have been left for us.  We hope eventually to get to the other side of them and to have sufficient information regarding the general position to be able to give decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to an important matter &mdash;differential prices for foodstuffs.  I can see no likelihood of that situation being changed in the immediate future. The case of butter certainly cannot be changed.  There is not enough butter available at the moment or in sight from native production to maintain the ration for this year.  That reduced output of butter from Irish creameries will have to be supplemented by imported butter this year in order to maintain the existing ration.  In the case of the other foodstuffs, there are considerations of cost and of supply which would make it undesirable to institute changes at the present time. When these food subsidies were initiated in 1947 and when the taxes on beer and tobacco to which Deputy Flanagan referred were imposed in <Col N="718" /> order to get funds to meet the cost of the subsidies, we were working on the view that a temporary situation was forcing prices into a peak and that in the course of a comparatively short time they would begin to fall again, that the subsidies would disappear without any alteration in the prevailing retail prices and, with the disappearance of the subsidies, would pass also the need for taxing to meet the cost of them.  That was our view in 1947 and the course of events showed that it was a mistaken view.  The rise in prices was not a peak due to abnormal circumstances but a permanent increase which is not likely to be reversed for a long time to come.  I think our successors should have taken that situation in hands when it became apparent what the prospects were in 1948 and in 1949 and have done something in relation to these food price subsidies.</P>

      <P>It is a scheme which has to be worked.  It is all nonsense for Deputy McGilligan to talk about an austerity policy.  None of us believes in a policy of austerity, but it is foolish to close our eyes to the fact that there is an international situation in existence which is likely to cause complications in many directions for us.  There are scarcities of raw materials which are already becoming acute.  There are rises in material costs which are complicating the whole business of industrial finance and which are bound to have a reaction upon the general level of retail prices.  Unless international conditions improve, these difficulties are likely to become more acute.  It is foolish to talk of pursuing a policy of austerity when the main task of any Government must be to try to counter these influences in the most effective way in order to maintain, and if possible to enhance, the present standard of living.  Deputies opposite may talk about the good times during the years of the Coalition Government, but if the public thought <Col N="720" /> those were good times, Deputies opposite would not be where they are or we would not be here.</P>

Will the Minister answer the question which Deputy Hickey asked him: what is the additional cost of the 17-point programme?  I am forced to ask that question now because the Minister for Health told us here the other day that he is bringing in a new Security Bill which will impose additional charges and that that Bill is going to come into operation before the end of the present year.

      <P>When I moved to report progress, I was strongly impressing upon the new Minister how essential it is to make a hard fight to secure a fair price for the surplus produce which we have got to export.  I pointed out the folly of going across to Britain and threatening to drown the unfortunate people in eggs.  That is not the way, I said, to fight for a fair price for our produce.  On the other hand, I think it is also essential for our Minister to exert himself to the fullest extent in order to secure basic requirements for this country at a reasonable price.  I think he should direct his immediate attention towards securing supplies of phosphate and other fertilisers for our land.  That is one of the most fundamental and most important of our requirements for securing increased production from the land.  It is appalling to reflect that our Minister for Finance in last year's Budget statement said that while industry expanded enormously in the last three or four years, there has been no expansion whatever in agricultural output as compared with the pre-war years.  That is a serious reflection on the Minister and his Department and upon every one who has control of agricultural policy.  It should be possible to increase and expand output from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the land reclamation project, in so far as it seeks to add to the area of agricultural land in this country, is sound but that programme could be extended and intensified if we did not concentrate alone upon land that is rocky and stony and upon land saturated with water. Attention should also be given to land which has deteriorated over a long period of years through lack of lime and phosphates.  There is an urgent necessity for the immediate application of fertilisers to land that has become impoverished and for the introduction of a reseeding programme and the application of up-to-date agricultural <Col N="722" /> methods so as to produce an increased output, greater than we can hope for from the reclamation of wet land, desirable though that may be.  I should like the Minister, while pressing forward all the pressing schemes of land reclamation, to give attention to the urgent necessity for restoring as soon as possible the fertility of land that is at present basically sound.  I think that is a matter which will require immediate and careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has indicated that it is his intention to re-establish the agricultural consultative council&mdash;I do not know what is its correct title, but a representative agricultural council to consult with the Minister is a desirable thing.  The Minister's immediate predecessor had a different technique.  He did not believe in sitting around a table with farmers and farmers' representatives. He thought it more spectacular to swoop down upon a county committee and dazzle them with some new and fantastic idea, completely bewildering that committee to such an extent that by the time they would have recovered from the effects of his exhibition, he would be sailing back to the City of Dublin, laughing at how well he had humbugged them.  It is a remarkable thing that he never visited the committee of which I was a member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have a more reasonable and same Minister and particularly a Minister who will meet representatives of the farming community around the table.  He will sit down and discuss with them the urgent problems that are facing the agricultural industry.  I have already mentioned a few of them&mdash;fair prices, the establishment of a costings investigation, the securing of the best possible prices for our exportable surplus and the securing of our essential requirements at a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>Another urgent problem which the Minister will have to discuss with representatives of farmers&mdash;and it is one which the Minister's predecessor refused under any circumstances to discuss with anybody&mdash;is the improving of the credit facilities available to farmers.  The facilities at present available are too difficult to secure for those who really require them and the interest charges are too high.</P>
      <P>If a farmer, by dint of industry and application to his business&mdash;and perhaps with the aid of the unpaid members of his family&mdash;succeeds in accumulating a small deposit account in one of our banks, he is paid approximately 1 per cent. reward for the loan of that money.  However, if he wants to secure a loan from the banks, he has to pay 5 per cent. interest.  If he goes to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and succeeds, after much inquiry and investigation, in obtaining a loan, I think the rate of interest he will have to pay is 4½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting a reduction in the rate of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in respect of agricultural loans.  There is one particular branch of agricultural credit in regard to which I think a reduction in the rate of interest is urgently necessary.  We all agree that it is desirable to improve the equipment on our farms whether it be by the purchase of tractors or of any other type of up-to-date machinery which is required.  If a farmer wants to purchase that machinery through a <Col N="724" /> loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, he will have to pay 4½ per cent. interest, apart altogether from the great difficulty he will have experienced in trying to get the loan. If he wants to purchase a tractor or farm machinery of that kind through finance companies which cater for hire purchase, he will have to pay, I think, 13 per cent.  That is a heavy burden and handicap on the farmer who wants to operate in a progressive manner.  It would be a good idea to consider the question of the operation of the hire-purchase system by the Department so as to provide for the purchase of tractors and other farm equipment at a reasonable rate of interest.  That is a very desirable thing and it would add to the output of our land by making for more efficient farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the outgoing Minister for Agriculture was very emphatic in his request to the present Minister to keep control over all the various activities over which he had control.  He referred particularly to control over feeding stuffs.  Apparently he took over control of that section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and retained it in his hands for some time.  He claimed that one of the advantages of having that control in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture would be that the Minister would be able to ensure that the farmer would get his requirements at a fair price.  I do not think that the history of the outgoing Minister in regard to that matter was very happy.  While the price of pigs went down very considerably in the early part of this year, the prices of bran and pollard were doubled, and they were doubled without any apparent justification.  It is true that there was an improvement in the quality of the pollard, but as far as the bran is concerned there was no improvement whatever in the quality even though the price was doubled.  On the very eve of the General Election the Minister found it possible to reduce the price to a considerable extent&mdash; just as he found it possible to increase the price of eggs from 2s. to 2/6.  Those might only be in the nature of a deathbed repentance.  On the very last day that the Thirteenth Dáil was in <Col N="725" /> session I referred, while Deputy Flanagan was speaking, to the fact that we were witnessing a wake, a wake over the Minister for Agriculture.  It struck me at the time that it was a very nice wake, and that it was very nice to hear Deputy Flanagan and others praise the corpse.  The only unsatisfactory feature was the fact that the corpse was inclined to interrupt at frequent intervals.</P>
    <P>However, all that is past and we are facing now a future which, I think, holds a reasonable prospect of advancement for agriculture.  I base that hope mainly on the fact that the Minister is a man who has lived on the land and by the land.  He is a man who, from the very outset, has assured his fellow-farmers that he will meet them and discuss their difficulties and problems with them.  He will not look down on them as a section of the community which is inferior to him.  As a result, I believe that we shall get that increase in the volume of agricultural output which will make for a general improvement in the standard of living of our people.  We must not lose sight of the fact that the farm workers also are receiving benefit from this concession with regard to agricultural prices. There can be no real improvement in the standard of living of our people until we get more out of the land while, at the same time, we preserve its fertility.  That is the basis of a sound agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Minister for Agriculture from time to time announced various spectacular plans to various committees of agriculture.  We heard about his parish plan and about the three-club plan.  Few people knew what the parish plan was and how it was to operate and fewer still knew about the three-club plan.  Apparently the three-club plan was designed to secure the co-operation of three young farmers' clubs in adjoining areas.  These plans seemed to have been left high and dry by the outgoing Minister.  I have never agreed with the idea of describing those additional parish instructors as &ldquo;parish agents&rdquo;. I think the outgoing Minister imported <Col N="726" /> that idea from the United States.  We have agents enough in this country.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, I never agreed with his idea of selecting specially privileged counties for the application of the scheme.  If a scheme of this kind is to be operated, it ought to be operated over the whole country and the whole country treated as one unit. I think the whole matter is at the moment in the melting pot and ought to be considered.  An additional advisory service for agriculture is desirable, but I do not think it ought to be on the lines indicated by the previous Minister for Agriculture either in his three-club plan or in his three-parish plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that it is his intention to meet representative farmers' organisations whenever it is possible and necessary to do so and discuss their problems with them.  I would suggest to him that one of the first vocational organisations of farmers which he ought to meet is the Dublin Milk Producers' Association.  They have requested an interview with the Minister and I am sure he will be only too glad to discuss their problems with them.  I hope he will be a little bit more reasonable with that other organisation in the Dublin area, the agricultural association, which is, to a great extent, concerned with the production of tomatoes and other hothouse products.  Those people were treated with a good deal of scorn and ridicule by the Minister's predecessor and I think they ought to be better treated by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention and that is the possibility of developing a canning industry in regard to horses.  A good many complaints have been made in this House and outside in regard to the cruelty of exporting live horses.  It is generally accepted that it would be more desirable to have those horses required for human consumption processed in this country and thus prevent the torture suffered by those animals while being exported alive.  When the matter was raised in this House prior to the election, the Minister's predecessor <Col N="727" /> said that the whole agitation against the export of live horses was initiated by the commercial interests engaged in the canning industry.  Every Deputy knows that there was no truth whatever in that.  The people who raised that matter were concerned mainly with the humanitarian aspect of the question and the necessity of avoiding, if possible, undue hardship and suffering to animals.  There is, in addition, the desirability of promoting in this country an additional industry. It may not be a very large industry but, at the same time, it would be a very desirable one.  I have pleasure in congratulating the Minister on his appointment to his present position.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to know whether to be amused or to be sorry for the figure cut here to-day by Deputy Cogan.  I have never, in my political experience, listened to a more laboured and a more blatant recantation of the whole of an individual's political past than I have listened to from Deputy Cogan.  It was a dismal, contemptible, crawling endeavour to crawl into a political camp which he has opposed for the last 20 years and that at the dictate of two or three individuals who have nothing in common with the people of this country&mdash;a Deputy presuming to speak as a representative of Irish farmers, in fact, speaking as the creature of three individuals living not far from here. In that miserable crawl we have an attempt to defend the transference of the management, distribution and price of the cereal material used as the raw material of agriculture from the custody of the Minister for Agriculture back to the custody of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a speech as a Deputy of this House with rights equal to the man who was passed over as a practical farmer. Apparently the Taoiseach and the people opposite do not regard Deputy Allen as such a practical farmer as he would like to be regarded.  Deputy Allen has my sympathy and if he would hold up his handkerchief we would not see the blush.  Speaking again as a practical farmer, I believe that the farmer and the profession of farming should be as dignified as any other class of work in this country, whether that of tradesmen, professional men or businessmen, and that those presuming to speak for farmers should at least adopt an attitude of expressing the dignity of a farmer's avocation.  This perennial whining; this holding out the hand for alms in good times as well as bad times is degrading to the very nature and name of agriculture in this country.  Irish agriculture has gone through very hard and depressing times.  The agricultural community has gone through long phases when it was in the public interest to come to the assistance of agriculture so that it would be able to weather the economic gale and get into the port of safety and security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no ordinary farmer who is to be met anywhere in this country, outside of Dáil Éireann, who has any whine on his lips at the present time. The farmers are prepared to admit that, on the whole, in recent years their avocation has been comparatively prosperous; that they do not want alms and that they do not want anybody whining or begging on their behalf. Yet we have this habitual whine from Deputy Cogan that the poorest people in the cities or towns or the poorest of agricultural labourers have got to come financially to the aid of the farmers; that there must be sops, doles and grants; that the worker or the poor small business person who wants to improve his holding, build a house <Col N="729" /> or buy goods must pay the normal rate of interest, but that if a farmer wants to borrow money he must get it at a cheaper rate than any small business person, labourer or tradesman who wants to do a job of work.  That is not doing good service to the farmer. Give the farmer his price and he will pay his way.  He does not want any political acrobats whining on his behalf. Deputy McGrath has got back his smile, but the Deputy did not smile on Tuesday night last.  We are now coming back nearer to the City of Cork.  We had an election in the City of Cork and Deputy McGrath and his leaders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We had all kinds of condemnation of the previous Government and the previous Minister for Agriculture because they had increased the price of milk by 1d. per gallon which resulted in increasing the price of butter by 2d. a lb. to the poorer people of Spangle Hill and Gurrane Braher.

      <P>The Deputy denounced us for increasing the price of butter by 2d.  They have now planked another 2d. on it.  Everyone knows that the most essential foods of the people are butter fat and milk.  Everyone knows that one of the most serious national disabilities we have is the weakness of our infant children, the high death rate amongst infants, the malnutrition amongst the younger children, and that the one safeguard against that is milk as a food and butter fat later on.  The Deputy chuckles at the plight of the children. There was no chuckling a month ago. The Deputy knows that I am quoting some of his late-time colleagues.  The foods which, nationally, it is essential to popularise and reduce the price of as far as possible are milk and butter. Any acrobatics in the way of political expediency do not justify the increase in the price of butter and the increase in the price of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The families of the poor in this country are numerous, the poor have large families.  Even taking the present ration of butter, the new price is a heavy imposition on the poorer families.  But the increase in the price of butter is not so serious as the consequential increase in price of fluid milk.  We had one of the three pillars supporting the Government advocating <Col N="731" /> just now the early reception of a deputation from the milk producers' association.  These people are not going there just to shake the hand of the new Minister for Agriculture.  They are going to come out of his room with the swag in their pockets, with an increased price for fluid milk in our cities.  We have the increase in butter doubled and we have that falling on large families in Spangle Hill and Gurrane Braher.  But the next step is an increase in the retail price of milk.  How much milk per day is required for an infant?  How many pints of milk should a child under five get?  What penalty is to be imposed on the parents of such children by way of weekly expenditure?</P>

      <P>A proposal to increase the flat rents of cottages erected in Dublin County prior to 31st December, 1946, on the occurrence of vacancies, by 50 per cent. subject to a maximum increase of 2/6 weekly was received in the Department on 19th April last.  It was subsequently necessary to get further information from the council in regard to the matter.  I intend to have this proposal sanctioned without delay.</P>
      <P>In addition, a scheme for a revision of the existing graded rent scheme in Dublin County was submitted to the Department by the county council on the 12th February last.  A final decision on this proposal has been delayed owing to certain difficulties in the way of applying such a scheme to rural cottages generally.

I suggest that, with the consent of the Chair, the subject-matter of these motions could be discussed upon the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach and, by arrangement, a separate vote could be taken on the motions without further discussion if a vote is desired.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1951&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Social Welfare Bill, 1951, which I now commend to the approval of the House for a Second Reading, implements the undertaking which I gave when introducing the Estimate for my Department on the 20th of this month.  It is evident that there is little, if any, difference of opinion in the House as to the desirability of the proposed improvements in our old age pension legislation, and they have been welcomed from all sides.</P>
      <P>The introduction of these amendments in respect of old age pensions does not mean that we are abandoning or delaying the introduction of a comprehensive social welfare scheme.  The preparation of the comprehensive scheme must take some time, however, and it is thought desirable to give immediate legislative effect to the present proposals and so expedite payment of the old age pension increases which are provided under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have observed from the Bill itself and from the explanatory memorandum which accompanied it that it is proposed to effect improvements in three major aspects of the current old age pension legislation. The rates of pension are being raised; the means test, to use the common description, is being modified and in the actual calculation of means certain things formerly assessable will no longer be included.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that these changes will bring in about 7,000 additional persons and that the extra cost will be about £1,422,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> The new standard rate of old age pension will be £1 per week as against 17/6 at present, and the full rate will be payable to persons whose means do not exceed £22 2s. 6d. per annum. Under the present Acts the full rate is payable only if the claimant's means do not exceed £15 12s. 6d. per annum. There will be three other weekly rates of pension, 15/-, 10/- and 5/-.  The 5/-rate will be payable to persons whose means lie between £52 5s. 0d. and £65 5s. 0d. per annum.  Hitherto such persons were not eligible for any pension.</P>
    <P>In the actual calculation of means the first £80 received by way of disability or wound pension or allowance under the Army Pensions Acts will be disregarded.  Assistance received from charitable organisations will also be ignored up to a limit of £52 5s. 0d. per annum.</P>
    <P>It is further proposed that where a farmer whose poor law valuation does not exceed £30 transfers his holding to a son or daughter, no matter for what reason, the value of the holding will not be calculated against him if he applies for old age pension.  Blind persons' pensions will be improved in exactly the same way as old age pensions.</P>
    <P>It is confidently anticipated that the improvements which will be effected under this Bill in the position of claimants to old age and blind pensions should remove many of the complaints which Deputies and others have made from time to time.  The Bill is, I think, a comparatively simple one and does not require further elucidation, but if there are any points on which Deputies may require information I shall be glad to cover them when replying to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to congratulate the Minister on following so faithfully the good example set by the previous Government in deciding to increase old age and blind pensions to a maximum of 20/- per week.  As the House knows, and as the Official Records prove, we indicated on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill that we proposed to submit an <Col N="751" /> amendment to provide for increasing old age and blind pensions to £1 per week on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  An amendment in precisely the same terms as is now embodied in this Bill was submitted by me for consideration by the House on the Committee Stage of that measure.  In fact, that amendment was printed with the official list of amendments.  The Minister, therefore, was in the position that he knew we intended to do this; our policy had been definitely revealed. He knew also that he could not run away from the legislation we proposed and he simply went into the Department, got a copy of what we proposed to do, got the parliamentary draftsman to put it into legal form and embodied it in this Bill in exactly the same terms as the amendment we proposed on the Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, line by line, word by word, figure by figure, comma by comma.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having gone to such a well-proven fount for inspiration when he wanted to do something to improve the lot of the old age and blind pensioners.  If the Minister pursues that course while he remains in the Department of Social Welfare, though I do not think he will be very long there, because he must recognise that he is really a minority Government held together by a few weak links which will not hold when the first political storm breaks, and if he follows in the footsteps he is following in to-day he may manage for a while to avert political storms in relation to social legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated in doing exactly what we told the House we intended to do but I am somewhat surprised at the line he has taken in his speech to-day and at the character of the Bill he is introducing. One finds it difficult to believe that Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Social Welfare, is the same Deputy Dr. Ryan who spoke from the Opposition Benches on 2nd March last.  On that date, Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, told the House what his views were in relation to old age pensions and in relation to the means test.  He said then that if Fianna Fáil were back in <Col N="752" /> office, they would do the things which he then wrote into the public records of this House.  Now, Deputy Dr. Ryan has been in office for a few weeks.  He could quite easily have produced a Bill giving effect to what he promised here on 2nd March in respect of the means test.  If he comes back here with a Bill, or amends this Bill, to conform with the promises he made here on 2nd March, I guarantee him the full support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Social Welfare, could quite easily have embodied in this Bill the promise he made here on 2nd March but all he has chosen to do is to put forward his own proposals for a modification of the means test and to keep blindly the proposals which I submitted to the House.  If there has been such a conversion of Deputy Dr. Ryan, Minister for Social Welfare, to the proposals which I submitted we ought to know the reasons.  On 2nd March Deputy Dr. Ryan stood here as a defender of a liberal approach, even a radical approach, to a modification of the means test.  What I want to find out from the Minister is what induced him to run away from the promises which he made here on 2nd March?  Why has the Minister for Social Welfare not stuck to his guns? Why has he abandoned the stand he made here on 2nd March?  Listen to Deputy Dr. Ryan on the 2nd March and compare his speech then with the Bill he has introduced now.  On that occasion he said, as given in column 1112:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I said that I was going to make certain proposals and that if the Minister did not implement them a Fianna Fáil Government would implement them.  Keeping that in mind, I have to be careful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it was no reckless or extemporaneous speech, bearing in mind that what he said represented a covenant with the people and with this House that he would do in the future when he came back to office what he was promising to do.  Keeping that in mind, he said he would have to be careful.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not know whether everyone should get a pension or not.  I do <Col N="753" /> not say that they should not.  At least it appears to me there is a great waste of human endeavour if you say to a young widow of 22: &lsquo;We are going to pension you and you need not work for the rest of your life.&rsquo; I think we should require that a widow would endeavour at least to get work if she is left at a certain age with no children.  However, that is a case to be considered.</P>
    <P>I would apply the same conditions to old age pensions&mdash;that they would be applied to all classes of the population except the very wealthy and that they would be paid for out of taxation.  Again, the means test arises.  But we can get over that by the same conditions as I propose for widows and orphans&mdash;that there would be no means test for an insured worker who retires and draws the old age pension, no means test for the small farmer, say, under £25 valuation, and that outside that the means test should be £100 per year in cash.  When I say £25 valuation, there might be a good argument put up to make it £30 or £20, but I think in or about £25 is fair enough, and £100 cash is in or about the sum which also should be laid down. After all, £100 cash is less than £2 per week and, if the old age pensioner gets another £1, he has not too much.  Putting the means test at £100 would not be too high in my opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, on the 2nd March last Deputy Dr. Ryan would allow the person who had £2 a week to get a full old age pension of 20/- and he said that if they got £3 it was not too much.  But he comes here within three months and says that if one has more than 25/- he will get no pension at all. I would like to hear the Minister's explanation as to why he promised this House, in well chosen language, deliberately used, bearing in mind that the quotation could be used against him at a future date, that he would introduce legislation to enable a person who had £2 to get the full pension of 20/- and on the first Bill he introduces he provides that if they have 25/6 they will get no pension at all.  Surely we are entitled to know why he changed <Col N="754" /> his mind since the 2nd March.  Why did he say then that he would implement such a promise and yet when he gets a chance of doing it he runs away from the promise?  We are entitled to some explanation for that change of front.  We are entitled to know, too. whether this is one of the first election promises that is being abandoned by the new Government.</P>
    <P>In Deputy Dr. Ryan's discourse on the 2nd March we see his views generally on old age pensions.  I do not want to go into that subject now in so far as it relates to the main scheme of social security, but as we are discussing old age pensions it might be no harm to remind the Minister that, when he was speaking about old age or retirement pensions at 65 in March last, he said he was opposed to paying old age pensions to persons at 65.  Subsequently he developed some curious opinion that they might get sick pay or unemployment benefit after 65, even though they were not sick or unemployed.</P>

      <P>That is the best textbook I can give you.  This is the <Col N="756" /> Fianna Fáil plan for social security of January, 1948, which says: &ldquo;Financial security against want&rdquo;.  Before I make the quotation, the Minister should remember that he was opposed to old age pensions and retirement pensions at 65 and that other members of his Party voted against it.  The Minister may recall, too, the statement he published&mdash;admittedly in a panic&mdash;in the papers the next day to show what the Fianna Fáil alternative was to the Social Welfare Bill which I introduced. In March last, the Minister opposed old age and retirement pensions at 65, but this is what Fianna Fáil promised in 1948.  They talked about a plan. The plan was to include in its features free sickness and disability benefit, increased unemployment benefit, increased windows' and orphans' benefit, a new form of maternity benefit and contributory old age pensions at 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>In 1948 you went to the trouble of printing advertisements of this kind, &ldquo;Plan for Social Security&rdquo;, and published the advertisements all over the country saying that you stood for a scheme of contributory old age pensions at 65.  In March, 1951, when in opposition, you said that you were opposed to old age or retirement pensions at 65.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My trouble with the Minister is that he does not know what is happening at all.  He does not know his Party's policy on these matters. Here is the Fianna Fáil advertisement for which, no doubt, he paid and I take it that he did not pay if somebody else inserted it.  It is his plan for security; he published it in the Press and paid for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We always pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see how the Minister will pay on this Bill before he has finished.  He went on record that Fianna Fáil favoured old age pensions at 65 and in the first speech which the Minister made on the Bill providing pensions at 65, he said that he was opposed to it although he had published broadcast to the nation <Col N="757" /> an advertisement saying that he was in favour of old age pensions at 65.  That is inconsistency number two.  Perhaps the Minister would explain that somersault.</P>
      <P>Let us come back to the Minister. Let us recall the declaration I have quoted earlier (column 1112, March 2nd) of a scheme by which you would pay old age pensions automatically to farmers with a valuation of less than £25 no matter what income they had and if you had no more than £2 per week you would automatically get a full old age pension.  Both promises have definitely been thrown overboard. Even between the 2nd March and the Committee Stage about a fortnight afterwards Deputy Dr. Ryan as he then was, had undergone another transformation.  Bear in mind that he promised on 2nd March full old age pensions if you had no more than £2 per week and he submitted an amendment which was printed on the Order Paper for the Committee Stage of the Bill in which he said that if you had £2 a week you would get no pension. I wonder if the Minister has really caught up with himself on the whole tangled problem of social security.  He stated in 1948 that there would be contributory pensions at 65 and abandoned that in March, 1951.  He said in March, 1951, that he would give an old age pension at 70 to anybody who had not more than £2 per week and a fortnight after he produced an amendment saying that if you had £2 per week or a penny over it you would get no pension whatever.  Surely somebody should provide a key that will unlock the secrets of the Minister's mind so that we may know where we stand on the whole question of the means test and old age pensions whether they be contributory or non-contributory.  However, I will wait with interest to hear what the Minister's answers are.  I am sure that will be interesting and I hope that we will be able to import some consistency into them.  I cannot discover any consistency in them although I have taken the time to study them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our associations with the Department of Social Welfare for three years were creditable indeed.  In December, <Col N="758" /> 1947, there were 149,000 old age pensioners whose pensions varied from 1/- to 10/- per week.  Eighty per cent. of them had these pensions increased by 2/6 per week and only 20 per cent. had their pensions increased by 5/-. Within 12 months of our taking office we gave an additional 5/- per week to over 116,000 old age pensioners and 2/6 to an additional 32,000 pensioners.  We succeeded in bringing the number of old age pensioners to 161,000 by September, 1950, which is the latest figure I have in my possession.  We brought old age pensions to an all-time high level inasmuch as during our administration old age pensions reached a level they had never previously touched since the first Old Age Pensions Bill was introduced in 1908.  Not only did we succeed in raising the level of pensions, but the modification of the means test which we introduced and the liberalisation of the administration which was a feature of our association with the Department enabled people to qualify for old age pension who had previously been disqualified.  The Minister is now merely engaged in implementing the proposals which we put before the House in April last, two months ago.  He is completely running away from and abandoning all the promises to modify still further the means test which he made when he spoke in this House on the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill.  Surely we are entitled to hear from the Minister why he did not put his own proposals into this Bill, what prevented him from doing so, why he ran away from his own proposals, and why he did not at least do them the honour of enshrining them in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on doing so promptly what Deputy Norton when he was Minister refused to do when he was appealed to by the Fianna Fáil Party and by four Independent Deputies in this House.  That was to grant this increase of 2/6 a week to the old age pensioners and blind pensioners. Deputy Norton had nothing whatever in his Social Security Bill until questions were put down to him by myself in this House to know what he was <Col N="759" /> going to do for the non-insured people. The first answer I got was that the matter was under consideration and the second time I put down a question in the matter he told me he had nothing further to add to what he had already said.  He tells us now that we are acting on what was put up to us by him.  I asked him questions as to whether he was going to increase these pensions.  He was asked by four Independent Deputies to bring forward that proposal.  He was guaranteed that the proposal would pass through the House without delay and yet he refused to do so.  Now he criticises the present Minister for Social Welfare, who, in his second week of office, has brought in this Bill to give immediate help to these people whom Deputy Norton was quite satisfied to leave waiting until after the general election.  He waited for three and a half years before he introduced his social security scheme in this House.  He waited until he knew that he was going to go before the people. He thought that it was the best plan of propaganda he could get for his Party.  The people are not as stupid as Deputy Norton seems to think they are.  They realise that that Bill was kept dangling before them for three and a quarter years and was only introduced into this House when he considered that an election was in the offing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost three years ago Deputy Norton increased the national health and unemployment contributions without giving any increased benefits to the people who were compelled to pay these increased contributions.  I am sorry to say that the workers of this country took it lying down at the time.  Deputy Norton refers to the Minister's, Deputy Dr. Ryan's, talk about not giving pensions at 65.  I remember that when the present Minister was in opposition he stated that we would give sickness benefit equal to the retirement pension if people over 65 were unable to work and that if people over 65 were unable to get work they <Col N="760" /> would get an equal sum in benefit; in other words, that the unemployment and sickness benefits would be increased to the same amount.  I am sure that Deputy Norton realises that workers in this country, tradesmen and others, who are able to earn £7, £8 and £9 a week&mdash;most of the labourers in the City of Cork earn over £6 a week&mdash;are not going to retire at 65 on the retirement pension which Deputy Norton suggested when they can continue working for these good wages.  If those people will be able to continue working why should they have to pay contributions for a retirement pension at 65 when they have no intention of retiring at 65?  In order to make sure that the man over 65 would not suffer in any way whatsoever, the sickness benefit was to be increased to the same amount of the retirement pension and the man unable to secure work would get the same for unemployment benefit.  I think it would be a far better plan to encourage men who are fit and competent and willing to work to continue doing so after the age of 65 rather than to retire at 65.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has decided that, up to £80, the Old I.R.A. pensions will not be abated.  That is a very good gesture to the men who contributed so much to the welfare of this country.  It will be appreciated that the Minister decided he would not wait and depend on the Social Security Bill and put these provisions in it in order to try to induce the people in the House to pass the Bill&mdash;a Bill which, in my opinion, Deputy Norton had no intention of putting through the House.  Deputy Norton kept it waiting there, despite all the questions we asked, simply in order to have it and to be able to introduce it as a fine piece of propaganda for the Labour Party at an election time.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to say that the present Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, is out to do injustice to the people over 65. Would it not be a finer thing that an able and willing man should be encouraged to continue working after the age of 65, and to make suitable provision for him if he is not able to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> I compliment the Minister on the promptness with which he has brought this measure before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would be able to give the House an indication of the date upon which it is proposed to make the increased old age pensions payable.  I should like to take this opportunity of appealing to the Minister to reconsider this Bill in the light of the speech which he made on the 2nd March, 1951. I think that the proposal to modify the means test to enable every person in receipt of £2 a week or less to receive an old age pension at the age of 70 is a modest one.  Likewise, the proposal to make the old age pension payable at the age of 70 to every farmer whose valuation is below £25 a year is a modest proposal.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from these considerations, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this Bill in the light of the speech he made on the 2nd March and for another reason.  I think the political Parties at elections do a bad service to public life and to the country by making promises and shamelessly breaking them within a few months.  That seems to give cause for a certain amount of cynical laughter to a number of Deputies in this House.  I wish the public could hear that cynical laughter.</P>

      <P>The people know the results, and they will know the results of the change for which you have been responsible.  Already you have decided that they must pay an extra 2d. a lb. on butter.  Three months ago the present Minister undoubtedly made a categorical promise.  That promise is recorded in the records of this House and it was quoted in full by Deputy Norton.  Surely the Minister is not going to renege on that policy now.  Surely it would be bad <Col N="762" /> from the point of view of public life in the country if a Minister were to renege on such a categorical point. Surely the Minister's own good name is also involved.  He should not renege on a promise he has made so categorically.  Besides which, who could say that an old man or an old woman who has given 50 years of hard work and toil to building up this nation is not entitled to an old age pension at 70 if his or her means are less than £2?  Surely, having regard to the value of money, the purchasing power of money, that would not be excessive.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to reconsider the proposals in the light of the promises he made on 2nd March last.</P>

      <P>Sometimes, the more inexperienced of us in this House wonder whether or not there is any limit to political hypocrisy or deceit.  It is obvious to everybody and the people of the country know that the only reason the old age pensioners will get the halfcrown is because the previous Government had guaranteed it to them and that the present Administration has been put in a position from which they cannot get out.  They must give this 2/6 to the old age pensioner.  The Minister for Social Welfare apparently, judging by his reaction to Deputy Norton's recalling of what he had to say on 2nd March, dislikes to be reminded of the statements he made.  I think it is a good thing that we should know just what policy the Minister is pursuing.  It was stated in this House by the Minister that he was in favour of not retiring aged people at 65.  At column 1115, Volume 124, Official Dáil Debates of the 2nd March, 1951, the Minister, who was then Deputy Dr. Ryan, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now, instead of retiring men at 65 I think we should make it easier for them to draw sickness and unemployment benefit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes on to say that if you retire people at 65:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;they will cast an intolerable burden on those who are working because every year the number over 65 will be increasing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no use for the Minister to try to <Col N="763" /> avoid the facts or evade the statements which he has made in the past.  All of us who sat here on that sorry day, 2nd March, and heard the rambling discourse of the present Minister for Social Welfare, the puerile attempt of the Fianna Fáil Party to present us with some alternative to the Social Welfare Bill, which was acknowledged to be the most constructive effort towards a comprehensive social security scheme ever introduced in the history of this country, have a very distinct recollection of the statement made by the present Minister, who was then Deputy Dr. Ryan, and of his pitiable onslaught on the Bill as it then existed and upon the proposals that were made for the social improvement of the more helpless sections of our community.  It was announced on that occasion in no uncertain terms, in the same terms as those we have heard to-day from the present Minister, by the then Minister for Social Welfare, now Deputy Norton, that it was proposed to increase old age pensions by 2/6 and modify the means test.</P>
    <P>We have that proposal here to-day and we are asked to accept, with a brazenness that beats all description, by Deputy McGrath and by Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Social Welfare, that this is a Fianna Fáil proposal. The people of Ireland are intelligent people and they are able to judge for themselves no matter what is said in the Dáil or outside of it.  The people of this country are very well aware who originated this proposal. They are very well aware from whence it emanated and they are also able to draw their own conclusions as to why it is being presented here.  They remember what happened in other years when Fianna Fáil had absolute power, not the kind of power it has now, a tenuous thread of power, with a few wavering souls keeping them together. They remember the time when Fianna Fáil had absolute power and they remember what happened the old age pensioners over a very long period.  It was a very sorry story.  The old age pensioners in this country, as a body, are people who acknowledge what was done for them by the previous Minister <Col N="764" /> for Social Welfare and by the previous Administration.  They will be able to judge, regardless, as I say, of what attempt may be made here to mislead them, where the responsibility lies for this very modest proposal.  It was never suggested by the ex-Minister for Social Welfare or by the Labour Party that this was to be the be all and end all of justice for the old age pensioner.  Very far from it. This was just one more step that the inter-Party Administration was taking to improve, by degrees, the position of the old age pensioner.  I wonder will we ever see again in the lifetime of this Government, whether it be long or short, and my own belief and hope is that it will be very short&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will be too bad for some of you if it is short.  The only hope for some of you will be to cling on.  I wonder will we ever see any further improvement for old age pensioners? I think it is a fair bet that this is the first and last improvement for a long time until, perhaps, the next election comes along when it may be considered politic to throw out some other sprats.  I think the Minister should, in fairness, at least, have acknowledged the debt which he owed to his predecessor and the debt which the present temporary Government owes the previous Administration for having at least provided a readymade Bill to effect an immediate improvement for the aged people.  I think it is a very ominous thing that we should have in charge of this Department a Minister who made it clear in this House that he was opposed to the idea of retiring people at 65.  Then you have people attempting to justify that kind of mentality or outlook.  Deputy MacGrath talked about builders' labourers working on building jobs in Cork at 70 years of age.  I wonder does anybody for one moment accept that the building trade in Cork has one man in 1,000, of the labour people anyway. who is over 70 years of age?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Or anywhere else.  It would not be suggested of Dublin, <Col N="765" /> surely.  A builder's labourer is a man whose very occupation is a daily tax upon his strength and energy.  The average age of a builder's labourer in the City of Dublin would range between 30 and 50 years at the maximum. We are asked to believe that in Cork, of all places, where we are used to expecting the impossible to happen as a daily occurrence, it is common to work in the building trade at 70 years of age, which is ridiculous.</P>

Our idea was that the man in the street who holds them all up, the man who works with his hands, should have the right to retire at 65.  That idea was opposed by the present Minister for Social Welfare and that fact cannot be ignored; it is written down in the records of this House.  This measure will receive our co-operation because we supported it.  It is a Labour Party measure which had to be accepted by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Let us get it through as quickly as we can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne said this Bill was forced upon the present Government by the action of their predecessors. He is entirely mistaken.  If the present Government had followed the example set by their predecessors they would have waited until they had formulated the Social Welfare Bill; they would have introduced the provision of an increase at the Committee Stage of that <Col N="766" /> Social Welfare Bill and they would have used that promised increase as a sort of bribe or threat to force Deputies to accept their Bill.

      <P>When the then Minister for Social Welfare announced at the eleventh hour, on the 2nd March last, that he intended, at a later stage, to introduce into the Social Welfare Bill a provision for an increase in old age pensions which was not in the original draft, four of us Independent Deputies immediately decided that we should <Col N="767" /> press the inter-Party Government to introduce that increase as a short non-contentious measure to be passed through this House with the minimum amount of discussion, in order to ensure that that promise would be implemented.  I think it was a cruel thing, a callous thing, to hold old age pensioners up to ransom.  It was a cruel thing to tell the old agricultural labourer who had worked all his life that he would get an increase of 2/6 per week in his old age pension if he were able, by his pressure and by the pressure of his friends and neighbours, to force the majority of the Deputies of this House to accept a Social Welfare Bill which imposed a levy of 3/6 per week on that old age pensioner's son who is working for him.  That was the proposition that the Labour Party put up to this House.  The old age pensioners and the blind pensioners were to be used as a kind of smoke screen, as a kind of bodyguard to shelter the Minister as he piloted his Social Welfare Bill through the House.</P>

      <P>Now, all that could be said, was said or was thought about the inter-Party Government and its method of conducting and introducing legislation is past and gone.  We are dealing with realities now.  We are dealing with a straightforward proposition. The old age pensioners were promised an increase of 2/6, and they should not be kept in suspense or kept waiting for months to have the Social Welfare Bill put through this House. It will go through forthwith.  No matter how much some discontented politicians may try to introduce an acrimonius note, it will go through in a short space of time.  I think the Minister for Social Welfare ought to <Col N="768" /> be complimented and congratulated for honouring the promise he gave to the electorate and for following out the stand which he took, and which I and some other Independent Deputies took, on this matter before the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; who took many steps to advance the interests of the old age pensioners.  He was inspired to take these steps by the bitter opposition, the unreasonable and determined opposition, that came from Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Social Welfare during the Fianna Fáil Administration.  Every time that Deputies spoke in favour of the old age pensioners or demanded any concessions for them or asked that the means test should be modified, their representations were not even favourably considered by the Fianna Fáil Party when they were the Government.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were made by Deputy Norton, when Minister, to have the old age pension increased by 2/6 a week. If Deputy Norton desired to be dishonest when he was Minister for Social Welfare he would have seen to it that the 2/6 would be paid to old age pensioners before the general election in order to capture any miserable vote that might be on strings as the result of the old age pensioners getting that increase of 2/6.  We did not do that, or had not to do it.  I am very glad to say that the old age pensioners at the last general election showed their appreciation of what had been done for them by the return of the inter-Party Government and the rejection of a one-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That cannot be denied.  It was said by the present Minister shortly after the 1948 election, and repeated frequently by the Taoiseach, that the then Government was not elected to office but found itself in office.  How true that is to-day of the present Minister for Social Welfare! How true it is of the <Col N="769" /> Government that is now in office! As I say, if we were anxious to bribe the old age pensioners, we would have given them the 2/6 before the elections. The Fianna Fáil Party, and the five Independents who support them, as a Government can, I think, be properly described as a set-up of strange people comprising a number of miscellaneous characters.  This set-up is now boasting of giving to old age pensioners the increase of 2/6 which was only one of many concessions which were about to be granted by the inter-Party Government to improve the conditions of old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>I am completely dissatisfied with an old age pension of £1 per week.  I made that known when the Government which I supported was in office, and I repeat it now that I am in opposition.  I hope, and I am sure there are Deputies on all sides of the House who would express the same hope, that the day is not too far distant when old age pensioners will be paid not less than 25/- per week at the age of 65.  I believe sincerely that if the inter-Party Government had been returned to power, or if they had not been sold out, steps would have been taken to ensure that old age pensioners would receive their pension at 65.  If there was one person in this House who was not surprised at the announcement of the Minister not to make old age pensions payable at 65, it was I, but I thought nevertheless he would have had a little more tact, seeing the very slender strings upon which his position swung, and that in order to encourage Deputy Cowan who represents a big element of old age pensioners, and to encourage Deputy Dr. ffrench O'Carroll and Deputy Dr. Browne who also represent a constituency in which there is a large body of old age pensioners, he would have indicated that he might give some consideration to the question of granting pensions at the age of 65.  However, it is hard to beat the old dog off his track.  The leopard can never change his spots.  The Minister could not change his ways because the old age pensioners never got any consideration from Fianna Fáil and they cannot expect it from a set-up such as we have to-day.</P>

      <P>I believe that before many months pass some steps will be taken to give a further increase to old age pensioners, but we have no guarantee or no promise has been made to that effect.  The Minister has definitely stated that he is not in favour of the payment of old age pensions at 65.  He has not given any reason as to why old age pensions cannot be paid at 65.  Take the case of a person who, say, at the age of 68, finds that, owing to the weight of years and through no fault of his own, he is unable to provide for himself.  What provision is made for him apart from home assistance?  Everybody knows that home assistance is meant only for the most destitute sections of our people.  In addition to those who are unfortunate enough to have to fall back on home assistance, there is a certain type of people who, I am sure, are to be found in the Minister's own constituency as well as in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath. I refer to the decent type of person who would be prepared to face a miserable death rather than enter the office of the home assistance officer to ask for home assistance.  In certain parts of the country, and I am sure it is true of County Wicklow as well, a person who receives home assistance is looked upon as belonging to an element known as the pauper or the union element.  There is still left amongst our people a certain sense of pride and, if it is at all possible, they do not desire to join the union element or the pauper element.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister by his refusal to grant pensions at 65 is driving decent people who have a certain sense of pride and who do not want to be the recipients of home assistance or do not want to be thrown on the sympathetic consideration of some home assistance officer into a state of chronic penury.  These people shudder at the prospect of reports as to their domestic circumstances being in county council offices.  They do not circulated from one official to another <Col N="771" /> want to have the conditions under which they live placed before the county manager to be open to the inspection of the whole staff of the county manager.  We were anxious, therefore, that the payment of old age pensions should commence at least at 65, so that an unfortunate person approaching that age might look forward with some air of independence to the future and would not be compelled to apply for home assistance.</P>
      <P>Deputies associated with the St. Vincent de Paul Society know the amount of assistance that is given by that society to certain people who are in need.  Fianna Fáil and their &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; are now placing a further burden on that society and on local authorities, who will have to pay home assistance because they have refused to give the old age pension at 65.  People who reach the age of 70 nowadays are very few, as must be admitted by any fair-minded Fianna Fáil Deputy.  A large number of the population will die before they are 60, or even 50.  Any old warrior who lives to the old age of 70 should be proud of it.  In school we were taught to respect and honour old people.  If the State does not respect and honour the old and the aged, from whom are they to expect respect and honour?  Are we now going to have a repetition of the conditions of 1938, when the most active people in the City of Dublin were those connected with the St. Vincent de Paul Society? Are we again to have a return of the conditions prior to 1948 in which an old person in County Westmeath died under very strange circumstances when a Fianna Fáil Government was in power?  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, Deputy Kennedy, recalls the circumstances of a man in County Westmeath dying from poverty and hunger.  Are we going to see a return of the shocking state of affairs which we had under the previous administration of Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must know that even since his appointment as Minister the cost of living has gone up.  An extra 2d. a lb. is being placed on butter by the <Col N="772" /> Government.  Is the old age pensioner not to have butter on his bread?  Is he expected to return to the dry crust which he had when Fianna Fáil had an over-all majority?  Is it not true that this additional half-crown which will be given to old age pensioners in Deputy Cowan's constituency and Deputy Cogan's constituency will not now have the same value which Deputy Norton intended it to have, that for every 1 lb. of butter which the old age pensioner purchases he will have to pay 2d. extra as a result of the catastrophe of Deputy Walsh being Minister for Agriculture? Is it not true that old age pensioners joined the queues to gain admission to the polling stations in order to return the inter-Party Government and voted for men like Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan under the guise of inter-Party candidates in order to secure the half-crown increase promised by the inter-Party Government?  They now find that that half-crown, small and all as it is, has considerably reduced in value in the past 24 hours.  No guarantee has been given by the Tánaiste or the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Social Welfare that the cost of living will not soar even higher.  Is it not the poorer sections of the people who will be affected as a result of that? The poorest section of the people are those who are helpless to provide for themselves through weight of years.</P>

Every member of the Government &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; should be ashamed of himself for encouraging people between 65 and 70 to continue at work.  When a man reaches the age of 60 he should be permitted to enjoy all the happiness and comfort that can be provided for him. Is it not sad that the workers in Deputy Cowan's area who are now 59 and 60 and who were expecting to labour for only five more years when they expected to get a guaranteed State pension, are now disappointed and will have to work until they are 70 or join the queues at the labour exchanges for unemployment benefit? That is bad.  It will have serious consequences.  It is unwholesome.

      <P>We prepared that Bill for you that you are trying to shove across the country as something that you are doing.  That is our Bill, and we are proud of that Bill, but we are sorry to say that the Bill that the Minister is now putting to the House is of less value to-day than it was when we introduced it.  I have given the reasons and I cannot repeat them. It would not be in accordance with procedure to repeat myself a third time, much as I would like to for the information and convenience of Deputy Cowan, Deputy ffrench O'Carroll and Deputy Cogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I express the hope that we will not have many months to wait before the Minister for Social Welfare will realise that he has an obligation to the old age pensioners and will introduce some legislation on his own initiative, not ours, that will bring about a measure of relief for those people?  Let us hope, since there have been changes in the Fianna Fáil policy with every wind that has blown for the past fortnight, that a wind will change the <Col N="775" /> attitude of the Minister for Social Welfare of encouraging people to work between the ages of 65 and 70.  Would it not be a cheerful thing if the Minister were to tell those people that they have worked well and have earned by 60 years of hard work, toil and labour the recognition of any good Government; that they can now take things easy; that they have served their country well and that they will be provided for fully now?  That is what we would expect from a soft-hearted, good, noble Minister for Social Welfare.  No matter how good his intentions may be &mdash;and from past experience we know they were never excellent as far as old age pensioners, widows and orphans, the blind, the sick, the lame and infirm were concerned&mdash;we know that, even if he did attempt to discourage people working between the ages of 65 and 70, his first opponent would be Deputy Cogan.  I am convinced that the Minister for Social Welfare would love to be able to come to this House and say that he would like to give old age pensions at 65 but that Deputy Cogan will not allow it and hence we cannot have it.  Deputy Cogan opposed any social welfare scheme.</P>

      <P>If I may continue. The House knows well and truly that on every possible occasion the present Minister for Social Welfare tried to sidestep any serious attempt that was being made by the inter-Party Government <Col N="778" /> or even now, when the Fianna Fáil Party are in office, to do something that would benefit this section of the community.  I would be long sorry for wasting the time of the House on important legislation such as this, but I cannot understand the anxiety of Deputy Cowan for the immediate payment of this 2/6 which has now been reduced to 2/- as a result of the increase in the price of milk and butter.</P>

      <P>That is what Deputy Dr. Browne said he would like to see them getting.  Deputy Cowan is anxious that this Bill should not be obstructed.  Where is the obstruction coming from?  Is it obstruction to advocate old age pensions at 65?  If it is, I am proud of the obstruction, because that is what the people of Laois and Offaly sent me here to do, to endeavour to fight for old age pensions at the rate of 25/- per week. That is a type of obstruction that we want and that we would like to see the Minister engage in. Deputy Cowan may call this obstruction, but would it not be a grand thing for the House and the country if the Minister would obstruct and give old age pensions at 65 and 25/- a week?</P>

      <P>If doctors and other professional men who are in a more fortunate position than old age pensioners can retire on pensions at 65, I fail to see why we should have this disastrous class distinction, and why the agricultural worker or the builder's labourer should not be entitled to a pension at 65.  We have heard it said here that there is a builder's labourer <Col N="780" /> still working in Cork at the age of 70. Would it not be nice and in accordance with Christian decency to have him sitting at home and amply provided for, instead of having to carry bricks, swing a shovel or carry heavy stones on a building scheme in Cork at that age?  More is the disgrace and the dishonour that Deputy McGrath should have to mention such a case.  More is the disgrace that Deputy MacCarthy should have to agree that one of his constituents is a builder's labourer at the age of 70, and that he has not been provided for otherwise.  I am ashamed to be a member of this House when I hear Deputies, in the year 1951, say that there are people at the age of 69 and 70 working as builders' labourers, and that no provision has been made for them.  We all know that a man at the age of 68 or 69 cannot be expected to give a full return to any employer. He certainly cannot give the same return as a man of 30, 40 or 50 years of age because between the ages of 65 and 70 a man's energy is lost completely.</P>
