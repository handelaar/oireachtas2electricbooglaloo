      <P>The number of marriages registered in the year 1950 was 16,173 which represents a rate of 5.4 per thousand per annum.  The corresponding rates were for England, 8.2, for Wales 8.0 and for Scotland 7.8. These figures are provisional and no data are available for the Six Counties.</P>

      <P>The number of deaths registered in the country in 1950 was 37,835, which represents a rate of 12.6 per 1,000 per annum.  The corresponding rates were: for England 11.6, for Wales 12.7 and for Scotland 12.4.  The data for the Six Counties are not available.  The number of <Col N="1622" /> deaths in the State in 1950 returned as from cancer was 3,903 and the number from tuberculosis of all kinds was 2,353.  All the figures quoted for 1950 are provisional.</P>
      <P>The complete classification of deaths by cause for the year 1950 is not yet available but normally heart disease accounts for a number of deaths in any year greatly in excess of the two specified causes and the single class with the greatest total is usually diseases of the myocardium.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will give the figures for (a) the number of births registered in year 1950; (b) the rate per 1,000 of population that the births represented and the similar figures for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; (c) the number of children who died in 1950 of one year or under; (d) the rate per 1,000 of population that figure represents and similar figures for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and (e) the main cause of death in children of under one year in Ireland and Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of births registered in the year 1950 was 63,263 which represents a rate of 21.0 per 1,000 per annum.  The corresponding rates were for England 15.8, for Wales 16.3 and for Scotland 17.9.  In that year the number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 2,866 which represents a rate of 0.97 per 1,000 per annum.  The corresponding rates were for England 0.47, for Wales 0.58 and for Scotland 0.69.  The figures quoted are provisional and data for the Six Counties are not available.</P>
      <P>The complete classification for 1950 of deaths by cause is not yet available, but the principal cause of death of infants under one year of age in 1947-49 was premature birth and for the preceeding six years diarrhoea and enteritis.  In England, Wales, Scotland and the Six Counties the principal cause of death of such infants has normally of recent years been premature birth.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he <Col N="1623" /> will indicate what nationals are classified as &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; in census returns and if the classification of &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; does not include British nationals the number of people born in Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) who have taken up residence in Ireland from 1939 to 1950, inclusive.</P>

      <P>The classification at the Irish censuses of population is by place of birth and not by nationality.</P>
      <P>At the limited census of population taken in 1951 no question regarding place of birth of the population was asked.  At the 1946 census, of the 49,444 residents who returned their birth place as in England, Wales and Scotland (including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), 11,155 were resident in the State less than seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Desmond</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that there are widespread complaints in connection with the quality of tea now sold at the ration price and, if so, if he will state if there are grounds for such complaints and whether he considers that tea of a better quality could be issued without an increase in price; and, if so, will he take steps to see that the quality is so improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to complaints about the quality of rationed tea published in the Journal of R.G.D.A.T.A. on February 10th, 1951.  I understand that the quality is as satisfactory as possible having regard to the grades, types and price of tea available but some improvement may be possible when the new season teas are imported</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to accept the statement of a reputable tea dealer that if a better quality of tea were made available, even at a higher price, it would eventually work out more cheaply because it would give 100 cups to the <Col N="1624" /> pound as against 50 cups to the pound in the case of the inferior tea, and that it would represent a saving to the people eventually?  That is the definite view of the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fairly correct to say that if a higher proportion of dearer teas were introduced the quality would be better but, of course, the price would be substantially higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Pro rata would not the price be cheaper ultimately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that.  All quality teas are purchased and sold in the prescribed proportions to the merchants responsible for the mixing of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The quality is very poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to accept samples which have been sent to me by a reputable tea dealer, have them examined, and then say if he is prepared to accept the truth of the statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past year, of the total teas purchased, 43 per cent. were described as low grade, 41 per cent. as medium grade, and 16 per cent. as good.  These different grades were mixed to get tea at the standard price. If we purchased more of the dearer grade, the quality would be better but the price would be substantially higher</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>But the yield would be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any indication as to the quality of the standard tea being sold at the present rate as against the same standard of tea prior to 1939?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the arrangements for mixing the various grades are such as to ensure a uniform distribution of the different grades of tea?  Traders and the public have the experience that at particular periods the quality falls below the normal standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1625" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that at the present time the teas being sold have been longer in stock than they would be at other periods of the year. Each wholesaler gets the same proportion of the different grades of tea and, presumably, it is in his own interest to make the best mixture in order to market tea of the highest quality.  It is true that before 1939 we had all grades of tea sold at different prices by different merchants.  Now there is a standard quality of tea sold at a standard price and, of course, that means that people who want to get a better quality tea at a higher price have not that opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that retailers of bacon are only supplied by one firm of curers conditionally on their paying an outrageous price for heads not even delivered, even though charged for their legitimate order at the full controlled price and if he will take adequate steps to eradicate this nefarious practice.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the last account of one firm of bacon curers shows an increase in profit of approximately 250 per cent. over the profit of the preceding year and if he has satisfied himself that such profits were reasonable in all the circumstances; and, if not, what action he proposes to take in reference to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the Ballinamult rural area, which includes Touraneena, was considered for selection in May, 1951, with other areas in the Waterford district.  The ratio of fixed charge revenue, however, did not compare favourably with that of other areas due mainly to the high percentage of householders&mdash;46 per cent.&mdash;who refused to take supply, and, accordingly, the Ballinamult rural area was not listed for early development.</P>
      <P>The board state that this area will again be considered in the autumn of this year but the prospects of it being selected for development in priority to other areas, are not considered to be good unless a higher percentage of householders agree to accept supply.</P>

Such acreages are 823 acres in Moorepark, County Cork; 170 acres in Lusk Government Farm, County Dublin; and 140 acres in the Ballyfair estate, County Kildare.  The enactment of enabling legislation would be required before these lands could be disposed of and proposals for this will be considered in due course.  Some other lands, for example, 4,500 acres at Kilworth, County Cork; and 335 acres at Ballincollig, County Cork, are required for military purposes.  Portion of the Curragh, County Kildare, known as the Greenlands is not used for such purposes.  It contains 2,690 acres.  The Greenlands, however, are subject to right of common of pasture exercised by a large number of persons occupying lands in the neighbourhood and there has been no question as to the suitability of any portion of the Curragh for transfer to the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>The number of hospitals to be reconstructed or extended under the programme is 128 and, of these, the number on which work has been completed or started to date is 62.  Provision has been made in the programme for the erection of 37 hospitals, of which 20 have been completed or started to date.  It is hoped that the reconstruction of 16 further hospitals and the erection of one hospital will be undertaken before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The expansion of afforestation is an important feature of Government policy.  While the main object is the establishment of the maximum area under State forests, <Col N="1644" /> the Government is also anxious to encourage and foster the planting of trees by private individuals and groups of individuals.  In many areas there is a tendency to assume that tree-planting is the duty or responsibility of the Forestry Division only, and anything which would make the community as a whole, appreciate the benefits and importance of private tree-planting, is deserving of every support.</P>
      <P>A successful Arbor Week could do much to promote tree-planting as a matter of course and also awaken a desire to maintain our already inadequate woodlands.  It is essential, however, that such a project should be carefully planned to ensure that the selection of sites, fencing, plant selection and planting would be properly done.  The forestry staff of my Department will give any advice and assistance that may be needed on these important matters.  My general support can be counted upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>If, as I would conclude, the Deputy is concerned for the growth and development of a spirit of patriotism among the pupils of our primary schools, I cannot agree that the procedure suggested offers the most effective means towards achieving that end.  Patriotism should be a natural and progressive growth in our schools and the less it is inculcated through the medium of the formality which characterises most school tasks the more likely it is to take firm root in the mind and heart, and to establish itself as an influence in future conduct.</P>
      <P>A sound knowledge of the national and cultural inheritance that has come down to us is, to my mind, the surest foundation for a spirit of patriotism. Regard and respect for the Proclamation of 1916 and the National Flag will naturally find their place in every scheme of instruction directed towards laying such a foundation, but I do not consider that symbols of national significance should be made a matter of such every-day familiarity that reverence for them would become superficial, mechanical and meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not, therefore, intend to act in this matter as the Deputy appears to recommend.  I am strengthened in my attitude by the consideration that my Department is most careful to refrain from imposing regulations on the <Col N="1647" /> schools other than those which concern matters hitherto neglected or unprovided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister has noticed that I did not suggest that there should be any regulation made in the matter.  I am merely suggesting that that proposal should come forward from the Department of Education to the schools.  I wonder could the Minister tell the House where a child at school is likely to learn of the Proclamation of 1916 or to see it if he does not see it at school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in the ordinary teaching of history in the schools such learning would come better than from the manner the Deputy suggests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <P>I wonder would the Minister tell the House where a child at school will learn of the Proclamation of 1916 or learn of the manner in which he should treat the flag of the country if he does not learn it at school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have suggested to the Deputy that I do not think that any method such as is used to inculcate the ordinary school subjects into the minds of the pupils is really the best method to utilise in inculcating the patriotism such as he and I desire.  I do not believe in the method of doing it.  That method is very much in vogue in America, but the American problem is completely different in so far as school-children in America come from homes of so many different nationalities with so many different traditions, and in America the Government, apparently, do consider that the main problem is trying to make Americans of children of a number of varying nationalities.  We have not that problem here and I do not think we should adopt the method the Deputy suggests.</P>

Where children under the control of their teachers attend and take part in such a function, the time so spent by them is reckoned as attendance at school.  As an alternative, the manager is empowered to close the school for the day.  The Department has also co-operated with the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands in bringing to the notice of the schools efforts made to stimulate public interest in the planting, the care and the preservation of trees.</P>

    <P>NOTES. &mdash; Carlow and Kildare County Councils had arranged that Bord na Móna would supply their turf requirements in exchange for the temporary transfer of council workers to the board's employment. This arrangement ceased as from 17th May, 1951.  Kildare County Council then undertook production themselves.  Carlow County Council because of lack of suitable bogs cannot undertake a scheme and are considering arrangements for the supply of turf from other sources.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council decided to procure turf from private contractors.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council were unable to engage in turf production owing to lack of suitable bog.</P>

      <P>The preparation of plans for an automatic exchange building on a site acquired behind the post office is proceeding. Removal of the telephone staff and of certain telephone equipment to this building will release space in the post office which is badly needed for postal and telegraphic purposes.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Dillon on Thursday concerning certain words which, he alleged, were unwarrantedly inserted by the Taoiseach into the Official Report of 4th July, is one for the Chair to deal with rather than the Taoiseach. Deputy Dillon should, therefore, have raised it initially as a matter of privilege and not as a charge against a Minister in the course of a debate on a Government motion.  I find from inquiries that the words &ldquo;in reply to some things that have been said&rdquo; were proposed to be inserted at the instance of the Taoiseach.  The notetaker had <Col N="1660" /> not recorded them but, as they did not appear to make any alteration of meaning in the statement made by the Taoiseach, the editor decided, in his discretion, to authorise their insertion. Any proposed alteration of substance would be brought to my attention but, in fact, this matter did not come to my notice until Deputy Dillon raised it in the Dáil.  Having considered the point fully and carefully, I agree with the editor's judgment in this case.  The introductory words used by the Taoiseach at the time were obviously intended to catch my attention as I was on the point of rising to put the question and their phraseology did not seem of significance.</P>

      <P>In speaking on this group of Estimates on Thursday last, I was dealing with the question of the supply of further generating capacity by the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister, in introducing the Estimate, criticised the policy of the Electricity Supply Board in basing a certain portion of the generating capacity on imported fuels, and he expressed the hope that there would be general acceptance of the view that the future programme should be based on native fuels and that the policy would become a national rather than a Party policy. Nobody on any side of the House will disagree with the outlook of the Minister or the views he has expressed, but translating these views into practice is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may not be aware that the total supply of electricity from hydro plant on the present basis of demand means that, in 1956, 37½ per cent. of the peak load can be supplied from hydro stations and the balance has to be supplied from steam stations fired by coal, turf or oil.  The capital construction of steam stations is low and they can be built quickly, but the running costs are relatively high, due to the variable costs of whatever fuel <Col N="1662" /> is used.  On the other hand, the capital construction of hydro plant is considerable, but there, because of the availability of water supplies, the running cost is relatively low.  As I understand the position from the information available, the anticipated maximum output of all the hydro stations is a total of 750,000,000 units.  That is on the basis of 300,000,000 units from the Shannon; 225,000,000 units from the Erne in full development; 75,000,000 units from the Lee; 50,000,000 from the Liffey; and 100,000,000 units from all other hydro schemes which may be put into operation.  It is possible that, with an additional set at the Shannon, a further 25,000,000 units can be added to the maximum output, but that, I think, is the most optimistic estimate of the fuel capacity of an additional set.  On that assumption and on the basis of the present rate of demand of 1,000,000,000 units per year, it means that, in 1956, the supply of power from steam-generating plants will run about 14,000,000 units per year.</P>
    <P>On the basis of developing the four turf-burning stations&mdash;that is, the existing station at Portarlington and the proposed stations at Allenwood and Ferbane and some other station in the west of Ireland&mdash;the total additional units that can be provided from these stations is 625,000,000.  On the assumption that 3 lb. of turf is required to produce a unit, it will require a total of 840,000 tons of turf.  That is a much bigger proposition than Deputies realise and a much bigger undertaking than would appear at first glance.  Up to the moment, the maximum quantity of turf that has been provided by Bord na Móna for this purpose is 250,000 tons.  It is true that the White Paper published in 1946 envisaged a programme of 1,000,000 tons of turf per annum, but allowing for the time which must elapse before the drainage of these bogs is carried out and all the other preparatory work that requires to be completed before the bogs are available for development, the problem of providing 800,000 or 1,000,000 tons of turf a year is a very big job and a job that requires not merely planning but a very large labour force in addition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> The other factor that must be taken into account is that the stations will have to be built on bogs sufficiently large to supply the quantity in immediate proximity to the station.  It is easy enough to talk about burning turf in turf-fired stations, but that turf cannot be brought from distant places and must be readily available at the site at which it is proposed to construct the station.  Therefore, on the assumption, and it is a reasonable assumption, that demand here will grow from the present demand of 1,000,000,000 units to 2,000,000,000 units in 1956 and possibly to 3,000,000,000 units in 1960, the problem of providing further generating capacity is one that presents practical difficulties, difficulties that the mere supply of turf in bogs cannot overcome. Not merely must we utilise the turf available by providing turf-fired stations, but there is no way out of building stations using imported fuels, whether coal or oil.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised at the Minister's statement in the course of the debate last week, in which he said, as given at column 1520 of Volume 126, No. 10:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to express here a complete disagreement with that programme. Unfortunately, however, nothing much can be done about it now.  If I could, I would reverse it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the two additional stations that have been constructed, at Dublin and Cork, were not constructed, further restrictions on the supply and use of electricity would have been necessary; and, however objectionable and however much we may regret the fact, and however unfortunate it is that imported fuels have to be used, it is unavoidable.  Even allowing for the maximum development of turf-fired stations and the maximum development of hydro-electric stations, it still will be necessary to have additional steam-fired stations&mdash;and the only fuels available for those are oil or coal.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this debate is somewhat curtailed, I do not want <Col N="1664" /> to go into great detail on this matter, but I feel that the Minister was less than fair to the Electricity Supply Board.  I had close contact with this problem in the Department of Industry and Commerce and I recognise the difficulties that have to be surmounted, the difficulties which have been created by circumstances outside the control of the Electricity Supply Board and outside the control of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The fact is that up to the present it has not been possible to secure at the peak demand sufficient quantities of turf at the first station that was erected.  That is not the fault of Bord na Móna, as they have no more control over the variable factor of the weather than has the Electricity Supply Board over the effect of a dry year.  These problems must be faced in a realistic manner and must be faced in the light of the technical information and of the circumstances that the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna have to surmount.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that he was in favour of dispersing the generating capacity rather than having it congregated in one or two areas. I think generally there is agreement with that view, but there is a loss in transmission if stations are erected far from areas in which the greater demand is felt; and not merely is there a loss in transmission but there are the other difficulties of having staff available and having the plant within easy access of ports.  Steam plant requires to be overhauled at fairly frequent intervals and if it has to be carried from the port to a rural area remote from port facilities, the added cost must be borne by the company.</P>
    <P>In that connection, a good deal of attention has been focussed recently on the increased charges which have become necessary, arising out of the increases in the cost of fuels.  A number of people expressed surprise at the fact that these increased charges have to be met at a time when electricity is rationed.  It may be possible to iron out these increases over a period and if it is possible I hope that steps will be taken to effect some sort of arrangement that will place the cost over a <Col N="1665" /> period rather than have it imposed for a short time.</P>
    <P>The substantial rise in the cost of imported fuels has placed the same burden on the Electricity Supply Board as it has placed on domestic consumers or on any other undertaking that uses imported fuel.  Although it may seem unreasonable, the rate of demand this year has been far greater than in any other year, due to the high price of other fuels and their scarcity, as well as, of course, to the protracted winter.</P>
    <P>The problem of providing further generating capacity is one that will require careful consideration, but I think that knowing the full facts of the position, the Electricity Supply Board have taken the only course open to them.  It may be that before the war when supplies were more plentiful and when opportunities of acquiring plant and equipment offered more freely than they do now, steps could have been taken.  I think it is futile at this stage to attempt to place the responsibility on the Electricity Supply Board, because responsibility for that action might lie equally with the Government of the day as with the Electricity Supply Board.  The only other matter in this connection that must be taken into account is that bogs have a maximum development. They have a limited life.  Most people are unaware that the bogs on which it is proposed to develop and erect a steam station have a maximum life of 25 years.  It may be that people take the view when that period of time elapses the problem can be dealt with then.  I suppose it is reasonable enough to take that view, but I think that on the whole the steps that have been taken have been the only ones available to the Electricity Supply Board and to Bord na Móna.  That company has also tackled the problem vigorously and energetically, but it is a much bigger problem than might appear at first glance.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate the Minister dealt with a number of other matters and, while the time is limited, I want to say a few words about a number of them.  He referred to the <Col N="1666" /> fact that the Tourist Board had suspended the grading system.  He said that he had asked for a full report on the matter but that, pending a further announcement, it was not to be taken as final that the system at present in operation was definitely suspended.  I must say that I think that that is a matter which should be left to the Tourist Board.  I take the view&mdash;a view which is shared by the Minister &mdash;that when a State board is established the internal arrangements, subject to general directions on policy, should be left to the board.  As I understood it, that is the Minister's view on this matter as well.  During the course of a discussion on the Tourist Traffic Bill, in 1939, the Minister said, the reference is column 1289, Official Dáil Debates of June, 1939:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is, perhaps, not worth while having a debate as to which is the more important: registration or grading.  The position is that when a premises is on the register it is open for business, and the proprietor can carry on hotel business in the premises.  The question of grading is a different question altogether.  On that question, I listened very carefully to the representations that were made to me in favour of having some sort of appeal board, but I felt that it would be impracticable.  I came to the conclusion, when it is a question of grading, that you must give the board certain arbitrary powers&mdash; I recognise that they are arbitrary powers&mdash;if the thing is to work properly.  I cannot say that the board will not in practice make its grading on the basis of price, as is done elsewhere, but I think we must leave that matter very largely to the discretion of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree with that view.  I think it should be left to the board.  It may be that it appears now, having had a system of grading in operation for a number of years, that it is a radical step to suspend grading altogether.  As I understand the policy of the Tourist Board, it is based on the knowledge that the board has not available sufficient technical personnel to operate a proper efficient grading system and that the system that was <Col N="1667" /> in operation necessitated too many hotels being inspected by an individual in too short a time.  I think, therefore, that any interference with the board in a matter of this nature is undesirable and it should be left to the discretion of the board.</P>
    <P>On the general question of tourist policy, I was disappointed that the Minister did not indicate agreement with the proposals which were made by the publication of the amending Bill this year.  The fact that there was an election prevented that Bill being passed into law.  I believe there is general agreement that the financial provisions which it was proposed to make available to the Tourist Board should be made available and that the board should not be restricted in any way nor prevented from embarking upon the full development policy that was outlined in the directions given to them when the board was reconstituted last year.  These instructions were based upon a very exhaustive examination of the whole tourist policy in the country.  They were based also on reports which were made available from investigations carried out by a number of technical personnel which came to the country under the auspices of the E.C.A. administration. Under these proposals, it was proposed to make available a total of £500,000 over a period of four years. In addition, there is already available £100,000 from the Grant Counterpart Funds.  I think it was anticipated that an additional £200,000 would be made available from the same source so that for the next four years the board would have a total of £800,000.  That policy envisaged the making of incentive grants to hoteliers for the improvement of their premises and for development purposes.  I think it is a policy that was adopted after mature consideration on the basis of the best technical advice that the country could secure and which was made available either to the Tourist Board personnel or to the board from the technical mission that arrived here and which carried out an investigation last summer and autumn. I hope that no delay will be allowed to prevent the board from putting that <Col N="1668" /> policy into operation and from stopping hoteliers from proceeding with the problem of reconstructing their premises.  I hope the board will be allowed to take the other steps that are necessary in order to develop to the full the tourist resources in the country. It may be that there will be some difference of view as to some of the steps that the Tourist Board should take.  I know that the view in the past was in favour of the board or a subsidiary of the board running hotels. The Government with which I was associated took a different view.  However, that is only one aspect of the whole general policy.  I hope that the Minister will allow the board&mdash;I believe the board is anxious and the staff available to the board are anxious&mdash;to get ahead with the work that must be carried out and which has already been delayed owing to a variety of circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Great Northern Railway has been the subject of considerable speculation over a long period.  The Minister in his opening remarks referred to the fact that there was some divergence of view between the Government and the Government in Belfast.  He said that at this stage having examined the correspondence and made himself familiar with the facts as disclosed by the correspondence and by the reports of the discussions, he could not say anything further on it.  I have been rather close to this problem for a long time and I recognise that it is a somewhat complicated matter.  I should like to express the hope that the Minister will find it possible to get a satisfactory solution to the difficulty.  Everybody in the House is anxious that the anxiety of those employees in the company should be allayed at the earliest possible moment, but I believe that it is equally important to state our conviction that the unity of the Great Northern Railway system should be maintained; any other arrangement would be impracticable and objectionable; it would be absurd to partition this system.  Subject to these overriding considerations, a solution of the problem is possible on the basis of goodwill here and in Belfast. From my contacts with the Ministers <Col N="1669" /> in Belfast, I believe that they are anxious to get a satisfactory arrangement. I believe that the problem can be solved if the representatives of the Governments here and in Belfast approach it recognising that the railway system serves the needs of Irishmen on both sides of the Border and that, however political difficulties may obtrude themselves on the scene, this is, in the main, a technical and economic problem.</P>

      <P>That is what I meant by economic.  It should be faced on that basis and I hope that the Minister will be able to reach a satisfactory arrangement.  On this side of the House we are anxious and willing to help and if my experience in this matter is of any assistance it is readily available to the Government in order to provide a satisfactory arrangement that will safeguard the employment of the large number of persons in the Great Northern Railway Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other big problem with which the Minister dealt in the course of his opening remarks was price control.  I must say that I have been struck by the extraordinarily mild approach of the House to this problem in comparison with the approach made to me last November and December.  Some extraordinary transformation has come over a number of Deputies who are now conspicuous by their silence although they were very much present in the debate which lasted for a month at the end of November last and the beginning of December.  Although the situation has deteriorated substantially since the change of Government, not a single Deputy on the Government side of the House and very few on this side have expressed the same condemnation of the Government and the Minister's policy as was expressed when these matters were under discussion six months ago.  I do not know whether Deputies recognise that the substantial rise which has occurred not merely in the last month but in the last few months has been greater than the rise prior to the end of November and the beginning of December last year.  The <Col N="1670" /> Minister has the advantage that if he has not vocal supporters at least they are silent, but I had the problem of being faced with criticism from vocal supporters as well as vocal opponents.</P>
    <P>Many of the speeches which one might have expected to be devoted towards promoting an understanding of the prices situation and the influences that affected prices were devoted in the main to what I regarded as ignorant denunciation of the policy and the steps which were taken to deal with the situation.  It may be that six months ago people failed to recognise and understand the influences that affected prices and caused them to rise but I must say that at that time I was struck by the large number of Deputies from opposition benches who denounced what they regarded as the two price system and the Government black market&mdash;or in some cases a grey market.</P>
    <P>All their speeches were designed to criticise and condemn the policy then in operation.  Conducting a little research I was struck by the varying approaches to the problem, but all were unanimous in their condemnation of what they called the two price system on tea, butter and sugar.  Now the Deputies opposite are responsible for the Government; they have available to them the machinery which only the Government have, and there is nothing to prevent them from putting into operation from next week the policy they advocated when in opposition in relation to the subsidising of the commodities, tea, sugar, butter and flour.  Either they were dishonest when they advocated their policy then, or they have since come to recognise that ours was the right policy and are afraid to admit that.</P>
    <P>The only explanation the Minister gave in introducing this policy was that they were stuck with it.  I must remind the House that speaking on the Supplies and Services Bill on the 23rd November last (Volume 123, No. 8, column 1309), the Minister, then Deputy Lemass, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think this system of differential prices is undesirable.  Not <Col N="1671" /> every Deputy shares that view, I know, but I would strongly urge Deputies that they should press upon the Government to get away from it as quickly as possible.  If it does mean more money for subsidies to make tea freely available, to increase the supply of bread at the subsidised price, I see no objection to voting it here.  I would much prefer to vote money for that purpose than for some of the purposes for which the Government seeks it.  It is preposterous for a Government that failed by £12,000,000 to balance its Budget to justify on the ground of economy the maintenance of this discriminatory system which says to those who are well off: &lsquo;You can have unlimited supplies&rsquo;, but which tells those who are less well off that they must be rationed in the quantity of goods they can get.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on the opposite side denounced what they described as a Government black market but they are now supporting it when they have the power to change it.  I do not think it is a bad system; I think it is a good system.  So long as the supply of imported essential foodstuffs is as high as it is and so long as the Government makes available <Col N="1672" /> a reasonable ration to the community, those who want to buy over and above that ration should be free to do so.  I want the Government to tell the House on this matter&mdash;just as in relation to a number of other aspects of public policy where we have seen a change in viewpoint since the election&mdash;when they changed their mind, what were the considerations that compelled them or influenced them to do so.  Mere shortage of money is nothing because this Government is taking the line that at the end of this year the higher they can make the deficit the better.  They propose to adopt the policy that whatever the deficit is they will blame the present Opposition for it.  Another £1,600,000 is only chicken-feed.  They might as well be honest now with themselves and with the country and give the reasons why they will not adopt the system or else admit that the system we had in operation was the right system.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Industrial Development Authority, I think that the Minister's approach is the right one.  I always favoured that approach myself. It was a mistake ever to have the Industrial Development Authority in the position in which it was, neither in nor out of a Government Department. If it was intended to be independent, it should have been independent in the sense of statutory corporations; if it was intended to be part of a Government Department then it should have been part of a Government Department. However, that is finished with now and the legislation establishing it has provided for its establishment in the way in which it has been done.  I think that the Minister was wise to withdraw from it because the Industrial Development Authority was never intended to deal with ordinary administrative functions that are peculiarly the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the services which I received from the Secretary and the other officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce during my term there.

From my experience of them I wish to express my appreciation of the help and assistance they rendered to me and I wish to recognise publicly the services that they are rendering to the community.</P>

      <P>A big problem has been confronting us for years past and that is the double problem of unemployment and emigration.

      <P>Yes, outside Dublin and Cork.  The Minister's energies and the full capacity of his abilities and those of his Department must be directed to the problem of establishing new industries.  For a long time, quite a number of people believed that if we could increase production on the land we could go some way towards reducing unemployment and stemming <Col N="1674" /> emigration.  With the mechanisation of agriculture, however, the difficulty and the problem seems to be that instead of employing more people in agriculture less people will be employed in agriculture.  Consequently, the big responsibility of providing employment seems to me to rest on the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I was seriously worried&mdash;and I have not been able to check this matter in absolute detail&mdash;by the policy of the E.C.A. administrator in this country because the policy seemed to be to develop agriculture, to make Ireland an agricultural country rather than an industrial country.  I see that the new administrator who has been appointed here has as his greatest qualification his abilities in regard to agriculture.</P>

      <P>As time is short I propose to limit myself to a number of tabloid remarks.  I take it that the Minister knows that it is the function of his Department to provide employment and to diffuse employment as much as possible.  Therefore, I shall pass over a number of platitudes in that respect.</P>
      <P>In reference to the Electricity Supply Board, I think that undoubtedly the Electricity Supply Board has done a very good job of work; but it would be unwise for us to follow necessarily the line taken by Deputy Cosgrave and, though we should refrain from unnecessary criticism, at least let us voice the criticism which is often expressed outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board is the first of our big State enterprises.  It is, therefore, very essential that we should keep its work under strict review.  One thing that occurs to one in relation to the work of the Electricity Supply Board is that that supply of electricity has always fallen very far short of the electricity requirements of the nation. If the production of electricity is an economic proposition one would expect the Electricity Supply Board not to restrict the production and sale of current but rather to encourage it and <Col N="1676" /> actually to produce more than is required.  Unfortunately, probably through under-estimation and also because of difficulties created by the war, the output of electricity has persistently fallen far short of the demand. In these circumstances I think the Minister would do well to ask the Electricity Supply Board to review its production programme very radically in the light of existing circumstances and in the light of any likely future increased demand.</P>
    <P>I have not got here the projected figures of demand upon which the Electricity Supply Board relies but I have always felt that these figures fall far short of what the demand will actually be.  I think, too, that the Electricity Supply Board has a certain bias against the utilisation of turf.  I do not think it is a political bias.  I think it is purely a technician's bias, the bias of one who does not want to work with a fuel to which he is not accustomed. It is much easier to compute figures and estimate results with coal and oil than it is with turf and therefore the technicians of the Electricity Supply Board prefer to work on coal and oil.  I think it is very necessary to emphasise that from now on the Electricity Supply Board should concentrate practically exclusively on the development of hydro-electric schemes and turf-burning generating stations.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have examined very carefully the possibility of utilising the Bangor-Erris bog for that turf-electricity production.  I asked the Minister a question some time ago in relation to it and I think he replied that there are certain technical difficulties. Of course there are technical difficulties in the development of any scheme but technical difficulties are there to be overcome by technicians if there exists a really earnest desire to overcome them.  I know that the Minister will not allow these technical difficulties to prevent these developments. I think the same applies in relation to the River Clauddy hydro-electric scheme in Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the board should be answerable to this House in relation to policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to policy, yes.  The Minister assumes responsibility for the policy of the board on this Vote.  I think, too, the Minister might request Córas Iompair Éireann to pursue very actively the experiments they have been carrying out with turf for the utilisation of turf in railway engines.  I think that would be a very important development because it would in turn enable the development of a great many smaller bogs that lie along the actual railway lines.  I understand that experiments carried out so far have proved satisfactory.  Possibly with some help from the Department, even some more financial assistance and a greater degree of co-operation between the Turf Board and Córas Iompair Éireann, it might be possible to press ahead more rapidly with the experiments that are being carried out. I know that the Minister will bear these points in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pretended to be deeply distressed when he announced in his opening statement that Córas Iompair Éireann was confronted with a very serious financial position and a deficit of something in the region of £2,300,000.  May I remind the Minister that shortly after he left office or was put out of office, whichever way one likes to put it, in February, 1948, this House heard an announcement from his successor and a request that we should pass an Estimate for £4,091,000 to clear up the mess in which Deputy Lemass had left Córas Iompair Éireann when leaving office in February, 1948?  That was a much more serious financial position than the one to which the Minister made reference last week in his opening statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything about the change of policy or attitude because it was only natural that that should follow on a change of Government in so far as the Store Street central bus station is concerned. Deputy Captain Cowan claims credit for the existence of the Government. If there is any truth in the statement that the Government is existing on sufferance and carrying on with the goodwill of Deputy Captain Cowan and one or two others, it is only <Col N="1678" /> natural that Deputy Captain Cowan must be met.  The Government must meet him in some way or other if it wishes to continue in existence.  But I do not think Deputy Captain Cowan is quite fair to other people in this matter.  Deputy Captain Cowan knows better than the Minister, and the Minister knows it well, that behind Deputy Captain Cowan in this matter are Deputy Colley and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the owner of the biggest drapery house&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the City of Dublin.  These are all strong men to have behind one, and if one is not willing to walk in front one is bound to get kicked.  That is what has happened to Deputy Captain Cowan in this matter.  I will not lie awake at night whether or not this station is permanently fixed in Store Street.  My opinion is that because of the increase in traffic in the City of Dublin during the past ten or 15 years and the chaotic condition of the traffic to-day, those who first suggested that the most suitable site for a central bus station was in front of Collins Barracks were not far wrong.</P>
      <P>If I had responsibility&mdash;I would not do these things on my own naturally&mdash; I would say that in order to cater for certain sections of the country that would be the most suitable site for a bus station.  If one required a second station to meet the requirements of the south eastern portion of the country and avoid further dislocation of traffic in the centre of the city Donnybrook garage, which is a very up-to-date building, would be a very suitable site for buses going to and from the south eastern portion of the country.  The Minister and his colleagues have made up their governmental mind under pressure from Deputy Captain Cowan and others.  I suppose we shall have to put up with that so long as the present Government remains in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything that would embarrass the Minister in the delicate negotiations he is carrying on at the moment in relation to the Great Northern Railway.  I hope the people <Col N="1679" /> in the North will be sensible enough to realise that the policy of public ownership of transport services is in the long run the only practical way out of the difficulty.  The Minister has the goodwill of everybody sitting here on the Opposition Benches in his efforts to bring about a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>We have been supplied with figures by the shareholders' association who have been inundating Deputies on all sides of the House with documents. The latest financial statement as to the position of the Great Northern Railway, which I know some parties would like to change now for their own political purposes, shows that there has been a profit in the running of the Great Northern Railway in the Twenty-Six Counties' side of the system whilst there has been a loss on the running of the system in the Six Counties.  No matter what solution the Minister is prepared to agree to, I hope he will not agree to a solution which would involve taxpayers in the Twenty-Six Counties in the payment of moneys by way of a subsidy to preserve or develop services on the Six-County side.  I do not think it would be fair that taxpayers in the Twenty-Six Counties should be asked to pay for losses of the Great Northern Railway Company on the Six-County side of the Border.  I wish the Minister every luck in the negotiations in which he will be engaged next week in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>I mentioned two weeks ago, by way of parliamentary question, that certain complaints had been sent to the Minister's Department in connection with supplies of blankets, towels and other essential commodities of a domestic character.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say, in reply, that his Department had received these complaints in the latter end of last year.  I can assure the Minister that I have read correspondence that was addressed to his Department quite recently in connection with this matter and I can produce a reputable witness to prove that he attended conferences in connection with the investigation of such complaints in March and April of this <Col N="1680" /> year.  It may be some satisfaction to the Minister if I say that the position is much easier now than it was even in March and April of this year but I can assure him that complaints of a justifiable nature were sent to his Department in March and April of this year.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the serious attention of the Minister to this matter.  Does the Minister think it fair that a reputable firm of hosiery manufacturers should, after accepting a contract, come along after a slight increase in the price of raw materials in a country far away from here, and indicate to the firm with whom they made that contract that, as a result of the rise in the price of raw materials which presumably they saw in the papers, their prices would be pushed up by 33? per cent. and that they would not complete the contract unless that were agreed to?  I will not indicate the source of the letter further than to say that it comes from a firm of hosiery manufacturers in County Donegal, a firm which caters for some 2,000 retail customers.  I am concerned in this matter because several drapers have come to me with complaints as to the difficulties which they experience in obtaining essential commodities of this character.  This letter is dated 23rd May, 1951 and, for the purposes of record, I am quoting it in this House. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In common with many industries we have, for a considerable period, been faced with steadily rising costs in respect of all raw materials and recently we have suffered drastic curtailments of our cotton yarn supplies. As a consequence of these facts, we have been obliged to review our position, and, as a result, have reluctantly to inform you that we have had to withdraw all our existing prices and cancel all our existing numbers. We shall not, therefore, be able to deliver balances of orders as originally placed by you either as to price, or, we are afraid, as to quantity, and anything we can deliver now will be under new numbers and at increased prices which are in the region of between 25 per cent. and 33? per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very big jump.  The letter concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" />&ldquo;We very much regret having to take this step, but we are sure you will realise that it is due to circumstances entirely beyond our control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that the action of a reputable firm of hosiery manufacturers or should they be allowed to get away with that kind of thing?  Prices of raw materials, so far as that firm is concerned, have gone down considerably since that letter was written, but I wonder would the firm come along, now that prices have come down, reverse that attitude and give the benefit of the reduced prices to the wholesale people in order to allow the wholesale people to pass them on to the retailers and their customers?  I would ask the Minister to inquire into activities of that kind because I believe it is not confined to one particular firm.  It is the kind of action which has been taken by a group of people in an organised way and it has had a very serious effect in increasing prices of essential commodities during the past couple of months. I quote that letter because I think it is important that a letter of that kind should be put on the records of this House for immediate examination by the Minister and officers of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave some very disturbing information in his statement with regard to the activities of the Electricity Supply Board.  I wish to say, in spite of the very strong case put up by Deputy Cosgrave in defence of the Electricity Supply Board, that I am wholeheartedly behind the Minister in his remarks.  We find, according to the Minister, that the Electricity Supply Board, in recent years, has been concerned with increasing supplies of electricity by utilising fuel that we must import.  I believe that the first place we must look for fuel for electricity development, apart from the development of electricity by water power, is from home sources, and that the Electricity Supply Board should be informed, if it is possible even at this late stage, that they should revert to the policy of utilising fuel produced here in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> There is another aspect of the activities of the Electricity Supply Board to which I should like to draw attention and that is with regard to the huge amount of material and equipment used by this State company.  Deputy Morrissey, when he was Minister, made a statement on one occasion, and I think he will bear me out with reference to it, that we import in one year approximately £66,000,000 worth of commodities that could be, and should be, manufactured here at home.  Quite a considerable quantity of that amount of goods has been imported by the Electricity Supply Board.  I feel sure that the Electricity Supply Board if they had sufficient energy and foresight could manufacture quite a considerable amount of the electricial equipment which they are importing from abroad. It is a scandal that a body sponsored by the State should be the first to set the bad example of importing equipment and other materials that could be made at home.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to raise has reference to the Arigna mineral areas. I understand that at the moment we have a team of experts from America studying industrial development and so forth.  I would ask the Minister to invite these experts to pay a visit to Arigna area and to examine the possibility of developing mineral resources in that locality.  The Minister has not to depend upon my account as to what is available in Arigna.  It is on record in the Library for any Deputy who wishes to obtain a first-hand knowledge of the mineral resources of the area and for anybody who cares to read the evidence given before the Commission on the Industries and Resources of Ireland.  Deputies will find, in the report of that commission, some very interesting information with regard to the Arigna area.  The extraordinary thing is that even since the departure of the English régime, very little has been done to develop that locality.  A recommendation was made before the Commission on the Resources and Industries of Ireland that this locality should be taken over by a State company for the purposes of development. A number of experts were examined before that commission which held its <Col N="1683" /> sittings away back in 1919.  One of its remarks was that it was noteworthy that when the first seam was discovered in Kilronan, that is near Arigna, it was considered of such immense importance that the Irish Parliament of the time voted a sum for the construction of roads in the year 1800.  Nothing, however, was done by the British afterwards, owing, I presume, to the hostility of Welsh and British mining interests.  There were various reports afterwards and, in 1872, it was stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The time has now come for a vigorous scientific exploration of the district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A report by Sir Richard Griffin states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The quality of the coal in number two seam in Arigna is excellent for domestic purposes and, if used for smelting purposes, it is the best in the empire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are just a few remarks I would like to place before the Minister.  I think there are tremendous possibilities for development in the Arigna area, but it will take the State to do the job.  All credit is due to the persons who are at present trying to develop the locality by private means, but they have neither sufficient funds nor the right type of machinery at their disposal to do the job properly.  I believe that, in order to provide employment for the rural population of that and every area, it is essential that every effort be made to develop the mineral resources of the country as a whole, with particular reference to the Arigna area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the time has come when Deputy Davin and his colleagues should take an adult view of prices.  If the cost of raw materials <Col N="1684" /> rises then the cost of manufactured goods rises, and if the cost of manufactured goods rises, retail prices will rise.  If we try to stop that, either we will not succeed or we will put a lot of people out of employment.  In the course of his remarks here, Deputy Cosgrave said that prices have risen more in the first six months of this year than they did in the latter end of last year.  The House will note the significance of that remark when it remembers that the Standstill Order was imposed on prices as from the 2nd January. It did not prevent the rise in prices because nobody was prepared to maintain it to the point of stopping production or putting people out of employment.  Prices are still rising, but they are rising now because the increased costs that occurred since the beginning of the year are only now being reflected in the retail prices of some commodities.  The recent Orders made altering the prices of some commodities are merely a belated reflection in retail prices of higher costs which became operative some time before. There is always that time-lag, and it is operating now to reflect in retail prices the rise in the cost of materials and wages which occurred last year and at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>I have not changed my attitude towards the two-price system.  I still think it is undesirable and I still think that we should get rid of it as quickly as possible.  But just as a man marries a nagging wife in a hurry and then finds it very difficult to get rid of her, so we are stuck with this two-price system.  When I say we have not money to get rid of it I mean that the total tax revenue of this year plus the total amount which the Government can borrow this year through normal sources will be insufficient to meet the expenditure to which the Government is committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the one thing that is preventing it being done this year. As regards the Electricity Supply Board, I want to see it as a board which is enthusiastic for the right kind <Col N="1685" /> of development, not merely a board which has accepted it sullenly or merely because it is told to do so.  It is not enough for the board to look for guarantees that turf will be available in two or three years' time for supplying turf burning stations.  I can offer no guarantee that coal will be available.  In fact, having regard to our recent experience with the British in relation to the trade agreement, it is easier to guarantee turf than coal to the Electricity Supply Board for some years ahead.  That applies also to the utilising of its economic power to develop industry.  I want to see it doing that not merely because it is told to do it, but because it realises it is the right thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question I cannot deal with in the short time available.  The rise in the cost of coal is bound to be reflected, not merely in the cost of electricity but in the cost of transport, in the cost of gas, in the cost of every product in relation to which coal is the significant factor.</P>
      <P>As far as the Tourist Board is concerned, I want to say this: I do not regard the decision to abandon hotel grading as a day-to-day administrative matter.  The type of grading that might be maintained or how that grading may be enforced is a matter for the board. I do not think the board should have taken a decision of that kind on its own initiative.  It certainly should not have done it a few days after the Government came into office without consulting that Government.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to consider their reasons in a fair manner, <Col N="1686" /> but until I have considered those reasons, I do not think the decision should be taken as final.</P>
      <P>So far as the Great Northern Railway is concerned, I hope it will be possible to find a satisfactory solution of the difficulties existing.  Nobody knows better than Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Morrissey how thin that hope is.  It is not merely a matter of desiring to see the unity of the Great Northern Railway system maintained.  If it was merely a matter of our wishes there would be no difficulty.</P>
      <P>Arising out of Deputy Cowan's remark relating to E.C.A., I want to say this: it has been my experience that the attitude of the E.C.A.  Mission to industrial development here has been completely co-operative and I am hoping that there will be a significant development in the industrial field as a result of the help which they are in a position to afford us.</P>
      <P>In relation to the development of working, there has, of course, been a substantial amount of money spent by the Government here on exploratory work.  The outcome of that exploratory work did not justify many of the hopes that were held in relation to the possibilities in that area.  I understand that the E.C.A. industrial survey team were in that locality during last week but, in any event, it is intended that there will now be a more systematic investigation of the mineral resources where the prospects appear to be good.</P>

      <P>That would be a possibility, but the Deputy must keep this in mind also: the coal deposits of that area 100 or 150 years ago are really no guide to the present situation if the deposits have been worked in the meantime.  Mineral resources of that kind are wasting assets, and the fuller the extent to which they are worked, the less there will be for the future. One of the problems in relation to working is that the known resources capable of commercial working are limited and if we work them too often we bring them to an end at an earlier date, which might have serious social consequences in the area.  These are all matters for examination, however.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeonfar suim nach mó ná £193,090 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfas chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1952, chun Tuarastal agus Costas Oifig an Aire Oideachais agus chun Costas a bhaineas leis an gComhairle Oideachais.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £193,090 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education and for expenses connected with the Council of Education.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liom go mba chabhair do Theachtaí é dá gcuirinn síos go gairid ar na figiúirí atá á gcur ós bhur gcóir. Agus mé á dhéanamh sin déanfad iarracht ar aon rud nach bhfuil so-thuigthe a léiriú.</P>

    <P>Ocht Vótaí atá á riaradh ag mo Roinn-se, 'sé sin ó Vóta a triocha is a naoi go dtí Vóta a dachad is a sé. 'Sé suim iomlán atá á iarraidh ina <Col N="1689" /> gcóir ná ocht milliúin, naoi gcéad triocha agus seacht míle, sé chéad agus seasca punt (£8,937,660).  Is mó é seo ná an méid a vótáileadh anuraidh, de chéad caoga agus sé mhíle, agus nócha puint (£156,090).</P>
    <P>Vóta 39&mdash;Oifig an Aire: Dhá chéad is nócha míle, agus nócha punt (£290,090) atá á iarraidh.  Méadú de cheithre mhíle agus dhá chéad é seo ar mheastachán na bliana seo caite. Trí chéad, ochtó agus ocht nduine an méid a bhfuil soláthar ina gcóir sa Vóta, 'sé sin, beirt níos mó ná bhí i gceist anuraidh.  Tá riar á dhéanamh i mbliana do Rúnaí don Chomhairle Oideachais, agus, ina theannta sin, do Bhrainse Teaghlachais le haghaidh na Roinne ar fad.  Do b'fhéidir laghdú a dhéanamh ar an bhfoirinn, áfach, i mbrainsí eile.</P>
    <P>Meastar go mbeidh seacht gcéad go leith púnt (£750) de chaiteachas ag baint leis an gComhairle Oideachais i mbliana, rud nach raibh ach chúig puint eirnéise ina chóir anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Lasmuigh den méid sin agus den mhéadú beag ar an bhfoirinn atá luaite agam, sé is cúis leis an méadú ar an Vóta ná gnáth-mhéadú tuarastail ar na scálaí tuarastail faofa.</P>
    <P>Níl áireamh déanta sa Mheastachán seo, dár ndó, ar an méadú tuarastail atá ag dul do Stát-Sheirbhísigh mar a foilsíodh roinnt seachtainí ó shoin.</P>
    <P>Vóta 40&mdash;Bun-Oideachas: Caoga agus seacht míle, naoi gcéad agus caoga punt (£57,950) de mhéadú atá sa sé milliún, ceithre céad caoga agus seacht míle, naoi gcéad agus caoga punt (£6,457,950) atá á iarraidh.</P>
    <P>Breis bheag agus cúig mhilliún go leith atá á sholáthar le haghaidh tuarastail múinteoirí, ag Fo-Mhírcheann C a haon.  Is lú de sheasca is sé míle agus ocht gcéad púnt (£66,800) é seo ná an méid a bhí ann anuraidh.  'Sé míniú atá air sin ná gur dearnadh, i Vóta na bliana seo caite, soláthar chun riaráiste tuarastail d'íoc i leith na ráithe dár chríoch an lá deireannach de Mhárta, naoi gcéad déag agus caoga, de bharr na nua-scálaí tuarastail do mhúinteoirí a tháinig i bhfeidhm ón gcéad lá d'Eanáir, naoi gcéad déag agus caoga.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> Ar an Vóta seo ina iomlán atá méadú glan de thuairim is caoga agus ocht míle punt (£58,000).  Tarlaíonn seo de bharr go bhfuil céad fiche agus dhá mhíle, agus ocht gcéad punt (£122,800) breise ag teastáil faoi Fho-Mhírcheann D&mdash;Aoisliúntas do Mhúin-teoirí, sa chaoi gur seacht gcéad seasca agus aon mhíle (£761,000) go hiomlán atá ag teastáil don tseirbhís sin.</P>
    <P>Tá trí chúis leis an méadú so.  Ar an gcéad dul amach, na múinteoirí atá anois ag éirí as an tseirbhís, is ar na nua-scálaí tuarastail a bheas a bpinsin bunaithe.</P>
    <P>Sa tarna háit, ón mbliain naoi gcéad déag dachad agus a ceathair, níorbh éigin do bhan-mhúinteoirí dul ar pinsean roimh shlánú cúig bliain agus seasca dhóibh, agus dá bhrí sin, níor tharla an gnáth-líon ag dul ar pinsean go dtí an bhliain airgeadais seo caite. Fágann sin go bhfuil an caiteachas don chuid sin de na múinteoirí imithe i méid i mbliana.  An dá ní seo i dteannta a chéile, méadaíonn siad an caitheachas de mhíle punt fichead.</P>
    <P>'Sé an tríú rud is cúis leis an mbreis airgid atá á iarraidh, cnap-shuim a bheith le fáil anois ag ban-mhúinteoirí ag dul ar pinsean dóibh, mar atá ag na fir.  Tháinig téarmaí feabhsuithe aoisliúntais i bhfeidhm ar an dáta céadna a tháinig na nua-scálaí tuarastail, sé sin, an chéad lá d'Eanáir, míle naoi gcéad agus caoga.  Ar dtúis ní rabhthas ar intinn cnap-shuim a chur ar fáil ach do na fir.  Bhí beartaithe pinsin na mban-mhúinteoirí a ríomhadh do réir an seascadú cuid den tuarastal in aghaidh gach bliain iomlán seirbhíse a bhí tugtha ag an múinteoir.  I gcás na bhfear, is do réir ochtódaithe a bhí an pinsean le meas.  Is dá réir sin a cuireadh meastachán na bliana seo caite le chéile.</P>
    <P>Cinneadh ina dhiaidh sin, áfach, na téarmaí céanna a thabhairt do na mná agus a bhí á dtabhairt do na fir. Ghlac an tOireachtas leis an socrú sin nuair do deimhníodh Scéim (Leasaithe) Aoisliúntais na Múinteoirí, naoi gcéad déag agus caoga.  As sin a tháinig céad agus seacht míle déag punt (£117,000) a bheith á iarraidh i mbliana i gcóir na gcnap-shuim, thar mar a hiarradh anuraidh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> Dá réir sin, bheadh céad triocha agus ocht míle punt (£138,000) de bhreis le haghaidh aoisliúntais.  Ach tá laghdú tagtha ar an líon pinsinéirí a chuaigh amach roimh an mbliain naoi gcéad déag agus triocha a ceathair, agus a n-íoctar a bpinsin faoi Acht na Bliana ocht gcéad déag seachtó is a naoi, agus tá chúig mhíle dhéag punt le baint den mhéadú atá luaite agam. Fágann sin tuairim is céad, fiche agus trí mhíle púnt (£123,000) de mhéadú glan i leith aoisliúntais.</P>
    <P>An méadú atá i bhFo-Mhírcheann A trí (sé sin, Coláistí Ullmhúcháin) sé míniú atá leis ná scálaí tuarastail níos fearr a bheith le fáil ag foirne na gColáistí ón gcéad lá d'Eanáir na bliana seo caite.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá an costas iostais tar éis dul i méid.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil laghdú de cheithre mhíle agus chúig chéad punt (£4,500) i bhFo-Mhírcheann A a haon&mdash;sé sin Coláiste Oiliúna&mdash;ná tuigtear as sin go bhfuil aon laghdú tagtha ar an líon scoláirí sna Coláistí, ná aon ísliú déanta ar na deontais a íocas an Stát leis na Coláistí.  Sé míniú atá air ná gurbh éigin soláthar a dhéanamh anuraidh le haghaidh riaráiste don tréimhse Lúnasa, naoi gcéad déag dachad is a naoi go dtí deireadh mí Márta dar gcionn.  Níl aon riaráiste mar sin le glanadh i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá beagán níos mó á iarraidh sna trí mhíle déag punt (£13,000) atá luaite le haghaidh carr-sheirbhísí agus bád-sheirbhísí, toisc gur dócha go mbeidh seirbhísí, nua le bunú.  I mbliana arís, tá trí mhíle punt (£3,000) den mhéid seo curtha i leith na bus-seirbhíse speisialta atá ann chun daltaí scoile a thabhairt go scoileanna i lár na cathrach ó cheanntar Bhóthar an tSairséalaigh agus ó Bhaile Fearmada, Baile Atha Cliath ó tharla nach bhfuil na scoileanna nua amuigh ansin críochnaithe fós.</P>
    <P>Tá míle agus cheithre chéad punt (£1,400) níos lú measta do Dheontas na gCúig bPunt do theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht (C a seacht) agus do chostas scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht, sé sin Scéim Choiste na bPáistí (C a hocht).  Ar an méid iarratas is dócha a gheofar atá an meastachán sin bunaithe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> Ní dóigh liom gur gá aon mhiontrácht a dhéanamh ar na figiúirí eile atá sa Vóta seo.</P>
    <P>I dtaoibh an Mhean-Oideachais&mdash; Vóta dachad 's a h-aon&mdash;sé suim atá á iarraidh ná milliún, dhá mhíle agus seasca, céad agus fiche punt (£1,062,120).  Is mó é seo de dhá mhíle déag, seacht gcéad agus nócha punt ná an méid a soláthraíodh anuraidh, idir bun-mheastachán agus meastachán breise.</P>
    <P>An bhreis atá á iarraidh i gcóir deontas do mheán-scoileanna, (FoMhirchinn A a haon, A a dó agus A a trí) sé is bun leis ná níos mó daltaí a bheith sna meán-scoileanna.  Baineann an míniú céanna leis an míle agus ocht gcéad punt de mhéadú atá ann, leis na scrúduithe (Fo-Mhírcheann C).</P>
    <P>Tá míle punt níos lú á iarraidh le haghaidh breis-tuarastail mhúinteoirí (B a haon).  Mar tharla i gcás na mbun-mhúinteoirí, tharla i gcás na mean-mhúinteoirí, leis, anuraidh: tháinig na nua-scálaí tuarastail i bhfeidhm i dtús mí Eanáir, naoi gcéad déag agus caoga, agus b'éigin soláthar a dhéanamh i meastacháin na bliana anuraidh chun riaráistí d'íoc i leith na ráithe dar chríoch an lá deireannach de Mhárta, naoi gcéad déag agus caoga.</P>
    <P>Níl i mbliana i Mírcheann G (Ciste Pinsin na Meán-Mhúinteoirí) acht deich bpúint eirnéise san áit ina raibh trí mhíle púnt (£3,000) anuraidh.  Sé is cúis leis sin ná go bhfuiltear ag súil le dóthain airgid don bhliain seo a bheith sa Chiste roimh dheireadh na bliana de bharr riaráistí áirithe a theacht isteach ó bhaill den Scéim gur mian leo a bheith i dteideal an chnap-shuim d'fháil ar ball agus ó mhúinteoirí nach raibh go dtí seo ina mbaill den Scéim, do réir mar atá leagtha amach sa Scéim leasaithe ar ghlac an tOireachtas leis le déanaí.  Siad na gnéithe is tábhachtaí den Scéim Leasaithe úd ná cnap-shuim bheith le fáil ag múinteoirí, idir fhir agus mhná, ar éirí as an tseirbhís dóibh, ach go ndéanfaidis rann-iocaíocht áirithe, mar is ar ranníocaíocht atá an Scéim féin bunaithe. Chomh maith leis sin, ceadaíonn sé deontas pósta do mhúinteoirí mná a éiríos as an tseirbhís ar phósadh dhóibh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> Meastachán an Cheard-Oideachais&mdash; Bhóta 42: An seacht gcéad dachad agus sé mhíle, naoi gcéad agus caoga punt (£746,950) atá ann, méadú é sin ar Bhóta na bliana seo caite de dhá mhíle agus dachad, dhá chéad agus fiche punt (£42,220).</P>
    <P>Suas le cheithre mhíle triochad (£34,000) den mhéadú sin, faoi Fho-Mhírcheann B (sé sin, deontas bliantúil do Choistí Gairm-Oideachais), atá sé. Tá ag leitheadú ar obair na gCoistí, agus do réir mar a bhíonn a thuilleadh airgid á sholáthar as na rátaí faoi réir Acht an Ghairm-Oideachais, bíonn ar an Stát cothrom áirithe airgid a sholáthar do na Coistí ina aghaidh sin.</P>
    <P>Oiliúint mhúinteoirí (Fo-Mhírcheann C) cosnóidh sé cheithre mhíle, ocht gcéad seasca agus chúig phuint (£4,865) de bhreis ar mheastachán na bliana seo caite.  Cúrsaí oiliúna breise bheith ann d'ábhair Múinteoirí Adhmadóireachta agus Múinteoirí Eolaíochta Thuaithe an míniú atá leis an difríocht sin.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla níos mó múinteoirí ar pinsean i mbliana ná anuraidh, beidh ar an Roinn seacht míle agus fiche, agus ochtó punt, (£27,080) a chur le ciste na bpinsean agus na saordháil (Fo-Mhírcheann G).  Méadú é seo de mhíle, céad agus deich bpuint (£1,110).</P>
    <P>Tá méadaithe ar an méid iasacht a thóg na hÚdaráis Áitiúla i gcóir oibreacha atá idir lámha ag Coistí agus bun-airgead ag teastáil ina gcóir.  Mar gheall ar sin, ní mór don Roinn míle agus naoi gcéad breise (£1,900) d'íoc, faoi Fho-Mhírcheann H, i leith na n-iasacht úd faoi réir Chuid a caoga a haon (a sé) den Acht Gairm-Oideachais, 1930.</P>
    <P>Bhóta dachad is trí&mdash;Eolaíocht agus Ealaíon: Céad fiche agus naoi míle, agus naoi gcéad púnt (£129,900) an t-iomlán atá á iarraidh dó san, sé sin seacht míle, trí céad agus caoga (£7,350) níos mó ná anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Sé nuaíocht is mó atá sa Bhóta sin ná trí mhíle agus chúig chéad punt (£3,500) bheith á chur leis an míle agus chúig chéad (£1,500) a bhí ann roimhe seo chun léirdhearcadh a dhéanamh ar cháipéisí a bhaineann le Stair na hÉireann atá i dtaisce thar lear, agus chun macasamhla a dhéanamh díobh (Fo-Mhírcheann A a seacht).  Is <Col N="1694" /> amhlaidh atá beartaithe i bhfad níos mó den obair sin a dhéanamh i mbliana ná mar a deineadh aon bhliain go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>An dá mhíle, ceithre céad dachad agus trí púint (£2,443) de mhéadú atá á iarraidh i gcóir tuarastal agus mar sin de san Institiúidí Eolaíochta agus Ealaíon (Fo-Mhírecheann A a h-aon), sé is mó is cúis leis ná tuarastal múinteoirí páirt-aimsire i gColáiste Náisiúnta na hEalaíon d'árdú, agus postanna nua a dhéanamh sa Choláiste sin, mar atá sa sníomhachán, sa bhfídóireacht, sa ghloine daite, sa mhiotalóireacht agus in obair chruain.</P>
    <P>Na Scoláireachtaí Iolscoile (Fo-Mhírcheann B a ceathair) faoin dá scéim, se sin Scoláireachtaí do mhicléinn a dhéanas a gcúrsa Iolscoile trí Ghaeilge agus Scoláireachtaí do mhic léinn ón bhFíor-Ghaeltacht, sé caiteachas atá measta dóibh ná ocht míle déag, cúig céad, dachad agus cúig puint (£18,545)&mdash;méadú míle agus chúig puint dachad (£1,045) ar mheastachán na bliana seo caite.  Tá céad agus seisear (106) mac léinn a bhfuil na Scoláireachtaí seo acu sa bhliain acadúil seo.  Is dóigh go mbeidh deireadh le hocht gcinn de na Scoláireachtaí sin an samhradh seo, agus táthar ag ceapadh go mbeidh chúig cinn is triocha eile á mbronnadh i bhfómhar na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>Institiúid Náisiúnta na Scannán (Fo-Mhírcheann B a hocht), táthar le míle agus chúig chead punt (£1,500) a thabhairt dóibh, sé sin, chúig chéad níos mó ná anuraidh.  Is mó ná ariamh an t-éileamh atá ar a gcuid scannán, ach is mó a chosnaíon na scannáin, leis. Tá beartaithe ag an Institiúid, leis, caint Ghaeilge a chur le roinnt scannán.</P>
    <P>Rud nua sa Vóta is ea an soláthar trí chéad go leith punt (£350) atá á dhéanamh chun cúrsa faoi leith a thionól an samhradh seo ar mhúineadh nua-theangan.  Táthar ag súil go mbeidh idir Bhun-mhúinteoirí, Mheánmhúinteoirí agus Cheárd-mhúinteoirí ag freastal ar an gcúrsa san.</P>
    <P>Níl aon athrú ar na deontais-igcabhair atá ann don Drámaíocht Ghaeilge, do Choimisiún Béaloideasa Éireann, do Choiste na hÉireann i leith Eolaíochtaí Stairiúla, do Chomhdháil <Col N="1695" /> Náisiúnta na Gaeilge ná don Oireachtas. Níl aon athrú ach oiread ar an soláthar a bhí ann do chúrsaí ar Choláiste Gaeilge, do Chúrsaí Samhraidh sa Cheol, do dheontais do mhic léinn atá i mbun taighde Eolaíochta, do dheontais do thréimhseacháin Ghaeilge agus do pháipéir nuaíochta a fhoilsíos nuaíocht i nGaeilge.  Tá laghdú beag áirithe &mdash;cúig puint agus seachtó (£75) sa suim atá á iarraidh don Ghúm (Fo-Mhírcheann B 1).</P>
    <P>Bhóta 44&mdash;Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus Saothair: Céad ochtó agus ocht míle, agus deich bpuint (£186,010) atá á sholáthar ina chóir seo.  Méadú triocha míle agus ocht gcéad púnt (£30,800) é sin ar sholáthar na bliana so caite.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuiltear ag súil gur lú de dhá chéad agus triocha (230) an líon dalta a bheas sna scoileanna sin i mbliana ná an sé mhíle, ceithre chéad agus nócha in iomlán de dhaltaí a bhí iontu sa bhliain seo chaite, is éigin cheithre mhíle triochad agus naoi gcéad punt (£34,900) san iomlán a chur leis an soláthar (Fo-Mhírchinn A agus B) do na scoileanna seo, de bhrí gur méadaíodh ar rátaí na ndeontas ón chéad lá de mhí Eanáir, 1951.  Ceithre scilling déag agus réal (14s. 6d.) sa tseachtain an gnáth-dheontas anois do na Scoileanna Ceartúcháin, in ionad an dá scilling déag (12s.) a tugtaí go dtí seo.  Dhá scilling déag (12s.) sa tseachtain an gnáth-dheontas i gcás na Scoileanna Saothair, in ionad an naoi-is-réal (9s. 6d.) a tugtaí roimhe seo.  Tá a chothrom sin dá mhéadú deontais á thabhairt ag na hÚdaráis Áitiúla, leis, ón chéad lá d'Aibreán i mbliana.</P>
    <P>An dachad míle punt (£40,000) de dheontas a ceadaíodh sa bhliain naoi gcéad déag dachad is a sé le cabhrú le Scoil Shaothair nua i gcóir buachaillí sinsearacha a thógáil, tá an scair deireannach de sin íoctha.  Dá bhrí sin níl aon tsoláthar dá leithéid sin sa Bhóta i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Sé tá i gceist i bhFo-Mhírcheann E ná an costas a bhaineas le cabhair airgid a bhailiú óna tuismitheoirí, agus tá léirithe i bhfo-Mhírcheann F an méid airgid a meastar a gheofar uathu.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> Tá laghdú sa dá Fho-Mhírcheann sin i leith na bliana seo&mdash;seacht gcéad punt (£700) de laghdú sa chéad cheann agus míle púnt (£1,000) de laghdú sa tarna ceann.  Bhí cuid áirithe de shíntiúsaí na dtuísmitheoir a choinníodh an Roinn, ach táthar tar éis a rialú go gcaithfear feasta an chuid sin a roinnt idir an Roinn agus an tÚdarás Áitiúil.  Sin é is bun leis an laghdú ar an méid a gheobhas an tAire (cé go bhfuíltear ag ceapadh gur mó ná anuraidh an méid airgid a gheofar óna tuismitheoirí i mbliana), agus beidh laghdú dá réir ar an gcoimisiún a gheobhas na bailitheoirí ón Aire.</P>
    <P>Bhóta 45&mdash;Tá ocht gcéad agus triocha punt (£830) de mhéadú glan, nó caoga agus sé mhíle, céad agus triocha punt (£56,130) ar fad, ar mheastachán Institiúid Árd-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Sé bonn ar ar hullmhaíodh an Meastachán, gnóthaí áirithe a bhí á dhéanamh ag an Institiúid a bheith críochnaithe agus é bheith beartaithe ag an Institiúid postanna áirithe i Scoil na Fisice Teoiriciúla agus i Scoil na Fisice Cosmaí a fhágáil gan líonadh i mbliana.  Ar an ábhar sin, cé go bhfuil Scoil an Léinn Cheiltigh ag tabhairt faoi obair nua i mbliana, mar atá, Léarscáil Chanúnacha, tá ocht gcéad agus seachtó púnt (£870) de laghdú glan san airgead atá á sholáthar sa deontas bhliantúil faoi réir Chuid a cúig is fiche (a haon) d'Acht na hInstitiúide Árdléinn naoi gcéad déag agus dachad.  Tá míle agus seacht gcéad punt (£1,700) de mhéadú sa deontas atá á iarraidh i gcóir tógála agus deisiúcháin, faoi réir Chuid a sé déag (a cúig) den Acht.  A fhormhór sin, is amhlaidh atá an obair déanta cheana féin agus na billí ina leith tar éis nó ar tí titim isteach.</P>
    <P>An soláthar i Vóta 46&mdash;An Dánlann Náisiúnta, is lú de chaoga é ná soláthar na bliana so caite.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that in the short time since I took up duty as Minister, I have not had an opportunity of becoming familiar with the various facets of the work of the Department, or of becoming fully acquainted with the departmental machinery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> I feel I should make it clear, however, that it is not my intention to make any sudden drastic changes with regard either to departmental policy or administration.</P>
    <P>When introducing the 1950-51 Estimates, my predecessor in office made reference to the establishment of the Council of Education, which held its first meeting on the 5th May, 1950.  The first task assigned to the council was to advise the Minister on the function of the primary school and on the curriculum to be pursued in the primary school from the infant age up to the age of 12 years.  The council has been up to the present engaged in the consideration of this remit.  Seven meetings of the council were held during the financial year 1950-51, and it is expected that the council as a whole will meet once a month in this financial year.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a public invitation was issued to interested persons to submit evidence bearing on the matters under consideration by the council, and it is estimated that the sub-committee selected to deal with such evidence and with the hearing and examining of witnesses may have to hold as many as ten meetings in the near future.</P>
    <P>Though I have not yet had an opportunity to meet the council, I understand that it is a live and active body, and I wish to pay tribute here to their zeal and devotedness.</P>
    <P>I assume, from the various questions which have been put to me since I became Minister, that the question of the building and improvement of national schools is one of deep interest to all Deputies.  We have 4,896 primary national schools, and this year, I think, we are building 52.  From what I know of the conditions of schools in rural areas, I doubt if we will ever have real school building, considering the number we have and the rate of building, unless we seriously attack, and have a definite increase in, the speed of building.  Under the present conditions, every effort is being made to cope with the problem of the erection of new schools and the improvement of <Col N="1698" /> existing buildings.  Deputies are aware that grants are allocated by my Department and that these grants are subsequently expended by the Commissioners of Public Works out of moneys provided in Vote 9&mdash;Public Works and Buildings.  Grants totalling approximately £699,000 were made during 1950-51, on an estimated total cost of approximately £804,000, towards the erection of 52 new schools, the major reconstruction of seven buildings, and the improvement of 332 others.  The remaining £105,000 falls to be provided locally.  This represents about 13 per cent. of the total estimated cost, and it is with regret that I have to record that it is a falling off as compared with the 17 per cent. by way of local contribution forthcoming in respect of the grants allocated in 1949-50.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to emphasise how important it is that localities should bear their due share in the cost of this vital and urgent work, as an integral part of a system which, because of its recognition of the fact that the State is only one, and not the principal one, of the parties responsible for the education of our children, we must continue to value highly.</P>
    <P>I should also, perhaps, mention that delay in the building or replacement of schools is often occasioned by the difficulty of establishing legal title to sites. The provision of a school site is entirely a local responsibility.  If the site, after inspection, is considered suitable, it is in the interests of everybody concerned that the legal formalities connected with establishing titles should be attended to without delay.</P>
    <P>Now, much of the blame for the delay in school building that is laid against the Department actually rests with the local people themselves.  I am very clear about that.  Again, I would like to stress at this time that, from my short experience and of the questions that have been put to me, it seems to me that much of the delay in school building is occasioned by the parties to the second part changing their minds now and again.  Very often, a minor change in a school building may necessitate the production of a completely <Col N="1699" /> new set of plans.  These are things on which the people, who are dealing with schools locally, ought to make up their minds.  When they are quite clear and satisfied with a certain proposal, then there will be no difficulty or slowness so far as the Department is concerned.</P>
    <P>Other developments during the past year were the introduction of conciliation and arbitration machinery to deal with salaries and emoluments paid by the State to primary and to secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>There is a continued increase in the number of pupils attending secondary schools.  For the year 1950-51 the number of recognised pupils was 48,559, which is 1,494 more than the previous years.  The number of recognised secondary schools has increased from 416 in 1949-50 to 424 in 1950-51.</P>
    <P>Vocational education, also, shows a continual expansion in all its phases. In the year 1950-51 the number of students enrolled in whole-time day courses was 17,885 as compared with 16,430 in the previous session.  In the evening classes the total of 39,885 showed an increase of a little over 1,000 on the previous session.</P>
    <P>The demand for enrolment in whole-time day continuation courses for the session 1949-50 was again, in the large urban centres and in the county boroughs, in excess of the accommodation available.  Consequently, in some centres classes in general subjects overflowed the workshops and the domestic rooms.  In rural areas accommodation generally was adequate.</P>
    <P>The certificates given by the Department to successful students at the end of the two years' course are now widely accepted as evidence of qualification for certain types of employment. For instance, apprenticeship in the motor car engineering trade is confined to boys who have secured the manual training group certificate, and the Electricity Supply Board, Córas Iompair Éireann and Messrs.  Arthur Guinness and Son make a somewhat similar stipulation.  The largest increase in candidates was in the group mentioned, where the figure rose from 1,200 to 1,429.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> Technical instruction for apprentices and others engaged in trade and industry is largely confined to the cities and bigger towns, although provision is also made for specialised instruction in particular trades in rural areas where a demand exists.</P>
    <P>Remarkable work under this heading is being done particularly by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee with the active co-operation of the employers and the trade unions.  Other areas, too, are doing valuable work of this kind.</P>
    <P>During 1949-50 and 1950-51 the Department continued to co-operate to the fullest extent with the university extension courses organised by the University Colleges of Cork and Dublin in conjunction with vocational education committees.  These courses were originally provided in Cork, under the inspiration of the president of University College there, for trade unionists, employers and young workers, and in the three or four years of their existence, they developed rapidly, spreading to Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Clonmel, Fermoy and Killarney.</P>
    <P>During the present session they have been extending to smaller towns, and are beginning to penetrate to rural areas in Munster.  Similar courses were organised by University College, Dublin, in Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford in conjunction with the local vocational committees.  I should also mention a special course of this type organised by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee at the High School of Commerce, Rathmines.</P>
    <P>Another promising development in the sphere of adult education is the establishment of choral classes.  A scheme of choral classes was organised by County Cork Vocational Education Committee during the session 1948-49, with a permanent whole-time teacher of Irish and choral singing as special organiser.  Largely as a result, choirs were successfully established during 1949-50 in 24 centres in County Cork, mainly in rural areas, and the movement is spreading in other counties. Apart from their cultural aspect, such choirs have a social importance as <Col N="1701" /> being of great help in Church ceremonies, concerts and feiseanna.</P>
    <P>The number under detention in the boy's reformatory school on 31st December, 1950, was 175, as compared with 187 on 31st December, 1949. Improved accommodation, which includes new wings and comprises classrooms, dormitories, ablution rooms and workshops, is being provided.  One of these wings has already been completed and it is expected that a contract will be placed during the present month for the erection of the second wing.</P>
    <P>The girls' school in Limerick had 28 under detention on 31st December, 1950, as against 31 on 31st December, 1949, and in the girls' school in Kilmacud, certified recently for a special type of girl, there were 12 under detention on 31st December, 1950.</P>
    <P>The State capitation grant for maintenance in reformatories has been increased from 12/- to 14/6 weekly as from 1st January this year, following representations made by the managers of the schools, and provision is being made for 1951-52 for 260 youthful offenders in these schools at a cost of £9,850 as compared with 290 youthful offenders at a cost of £9,100 in 1950-51. As from the 1st April, 1951, the grant from local authorities, hitherto varying from 11/- to 12/-, is increased to a figure varying from 12/6 to 13/6 per week per pupil.</P>
    <P>The State capitation grant for industrial schools, of which there are 51 in all, has also been increased by 2/6 weekly (from 9/6 to 12/-) as from 1st January, 1951.  Grants payable by the local authority have been increased by an equivalent amount as from 1st April, 1951.</P>
    <P>There were 3,117 girls under detention in industrial schools on 31st December, 1950.  This is a decrease of 104 on the previous year.</P>
    <P>In the boys' industrial schools, the number under detention on 31st December, 1950, was 2,742, as compared with 2,848 on 31st December, 1949.</P>
    <P>The industrial school at Baltimore, County Cork, was closed on 30th September, <Col N="1702" /> 1950, with the concurrence of the committee of management.</P>
    <P>I have used a word there which I dislike&mdash;the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;.  I think the intention behind it is better. I believe that we do more for the children than detain them.</P>
    <P>A special feature in connection with the Science and Art Vote this year is the proposal to increase from £1,500 to £5,000 the provision for the survey and reproduction of Irish historical records in foreign collections.</P>
    <P>All such documents, in so far as they are catalogued in libraries throughout Europe, have already been listed by the National Library up to 1200 A.D., and Deputies may be surprised to know that only about 8 per cent.  of our records up to that date are to be found in Ireland itself.</P>
    <P>The intention is to make a beginning on the systematic microfilming of all these documents, so that this important part of our title-deeds to nationhood shall not perish from the earth.</P>
    <P>I have not so far touched on the question of Irish.  I have thought it better to deal with it as a separate item.  There are so many activities in regard to the revival of the language, both inside and outside the classroom, that I have thought it better to glance at them generally rather than to try to relate the position to the individual Votes with which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>In presenting the Estimates for 1948-49, my predecessor expressed the view that it was imperative that all schools in purely Irish-speaking districts where Irish is the natural language of the home and of the community should be placed under a special inspectorial eye from the point of view of primary education.  Arrangements were accordingly made for the appointment of a special inspector for each of the three main Gaeltacht areas.  In addition to the ordinary supervision of the work of the schools in their districts these inspectors are entrusted with other special functions and duties designed to secure the active co-operation of all residents in revitalising the language and strengthening its position in these areas.  Their special duties also include the fostering and promotion of cultural activities and recreations, with particular reference to the development <Col N="1703" /> of drama through the production of plays in Irish in local schools and halls and to securing increased facilities for the provision of reading material in Irish at local centres.</P>
    <P>I am of the belief that definite advances have been made in these areas in the development of cultural activities, and that a very praiseworthy degree of co-operation has been obtained from all groups.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Department to make the teaching of Irish in vocational schools as attractive as possible, and, for this reason, the training for the Teastas Timire Gaeilge, the qualification required of teachers of Irish, includes practice in the teaching of drama, singing and dancing in so far as they are associated with the language.</P>
    <P>Inspectors report on the difficulty of securing a good enrolment and attendance while the work is confined to the formal teaching of the language, but classes which cater for social activities through the medium of Irish succeed well.</P>
    <P>Apart from the work done in the schools and directly under the supervision of each branch, an innovation that should have a stimulating effect on the teaching of Irish in all types of school is a course in language teaching which the Department proposes to hold in July this year in the Dominican Convent, Eccles Street, Dublin, with the kind permission of the convent authorities.  This course will be conducted by distinguished experts in language teaching from abroad and at home, and its principal aim will be to show how difficulties in language teaching have been met and surmounted elsewhere.  It will be open to national, secondary and vocational teachers, and it is hoped that one result will be to enable those teachers who attend to apply the most scientific methods to the teaching of Irish and, where these succeed, to so spread the light to other teachers.</P>
    <P>Another experiment proposed this year is to increase by £500 the provision for the National Film Institute on condition that part at least of the increased provision be devoted to dubbing films <Col N="1704" /> in Irish or otherwise synchronising Irish with films.  While on the subject of the National Film Institute I would like to mention that the Department finds the institute most helpful and co-operative in regard to the use of films and film strips in schools, and I understand that other Departments find it no less helpful.</P>
    <P>The five bodies concerned with dramatic productions in Irish are Taibhdheare na Gaillimhe, an Cómhar Drámaíochta, an Compántas, Cumann Drámaíochta na Scol and the various dramatic societies that have sprung up in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The Taibhdhearc had its annual subsidy increased from £1,000 to £2,000 two years ago, and as a result has been enabled to do much-needed refitting and repairs to its theatre in Galway and to extend its activities from Galway City to various parts of the surrounding Gaeltacht, including the Aran Islands.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of its last session was its playing as a special facet of its work, a translation of &ldquo;St. Joan&rdquo; to a packed house in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin.  No doubt many Deputies who had an opportunity of attending made a point of seeing for themselves the excellent work of this voluntary group.</P>
    <P>The Cómhar Drámaíochta continues likewise to keep up its good name for a high level of professional acting, and its Christmas pantomime in the Abbey Theatre has come to be regarded as one of the most popular theatrical events of the year.</P>
    <P>An Compántas, with its variety shows, in its turn does much to popularise Irish with those of the public who attend the theatre rather for amusement than through interest in dramatics.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to note that Cumann Drámaíochta na Scol, the Schools Dramatic League, which appeared some years ago to be moribund as a result of travelling difficulties during the war, has in the last two years come to very vigorous life again.</P>
    <P>However, the most remarkable extension of dramatic activity during the past 12 months, and in my view, fundamentally the most important, has occurred in the Gaeltacht itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> Up to 1950 the systematic production of plays in the Gaeltacht was confined mainly to County Donegal.  Last year, after the inspectors appointed specially for schools in the Gaeltacht two years ago had had time to become familiar with their districts, it was decided to increase from £100 to £500 the subsidy towards the production of plays in the Gaeltacht, and that any companies that sprang up should receive full co-operation from the special inspectors.  For the effect of this comparatively small increased expenditure a comparison of the position in 1949-50 with that of 1950-51 speaks for itself. Whereas in 1949-50 a total of eight companies (all in County Donegal) participated in the scheme, in 1950-51 the figure for County Donegal alone was eight companies, for Connacht ten companies, and for Munster five companies.</P>
    <P>Another noteworthy advance is the establishment in the Munster area of a widely represented general committee, with several local committees, to foster the development not alone of drama but also of concerts, lectures, feiseanna, etc., for the various Gaeltacht districts in that area.</P>
    <P>This year Comhaltas Uladh celebrates the jubilee of its foundation.  In the 25 years of its existence Comhaltas Uladh has achieved magnificent work for Irish, both in the Gaeltacht areas in Donegal and throughout the province of Ulster generally.  The Comhaltas is planning to strengthen the position in the Gaeltacht further by erecting halls which would serve as centres both for summer schools and for dramatic and social activities.  The first of these halls is to be built in the Ros Guill Gaeltacht, and to mark the occasion of the jubilee, and as an earnest of the appreciation of the Government for the work which the Comhaltas is doing, it is proposed to give a State grant of £2,500 towards the erection of the Ros Guill Gaeltacht hall.</P>
    <P>This was an idea of my predecessor's, and I think it was a good idea. The idea of special inspectors was also one of my predecessor's.  I think it was a brilliant idea.  With regard to the grant of which I spoke, provision has not been made in the Estimates <Col N="1706" /> this year for the project, but I am asking the House to agree that a Supplementary Estimate be passed for this payment of £2,500.</P>

      <P>Tá fhios againn go bhfuil socair ag an Dáil deireadh a chur lena cuid oibre Déardaoin seo chugainn agus go bhfuil mórchuid Meastachán le cur tríd an Dáil inniu mar tá socair go mbeidh díospóireacht Meastacháin an Taoisigh agus Meastacháin Gnóthaí Eachtracha amárach agus athrú amárach.

      <P>Because of the fact that the Dáil has decided to go into recess from Thursday next and because of the number of Estimates which have to be got through this evening&mdash;I understand that the Estimate for External Affairs and the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department will occupy the whole of to-morrow and the day after&mdash;there is no possibility of having anything like an adequate discussion on the Estimate for Education or the statement the Minister has made, and I feel that it would be a distorting of very important matters to go further than to deal with one or two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate very much the line the Minister has taken generally in presenting the Estimate, and particularly his reference to the Council of Education.  I feel that that body will provide the Minister, the Ministry and the general education services of the country with most valuable help.  The Department of Education is a very intricate and very complex Department, and I think we are very blessed that we have in the Department the Civil Service organisation that we have.  A Minister in the Department of Education could do an awful lot of damage and the Department of Education, run without ministerial control, or, rather, ministerial help, could be a very laborious and very distracting place to work in.  When <Col N="1707" /> we see the fruits of the recommendations and discussions of the Council of Education, on the one hand, and the stimulus given to educational thought on the part of those who are the educators of the country, the teachers, by the atmosphere created by the Council of Education, on the other, we will realise what a very necessary extension of the ministerial function in the Department, if you like, the setting up of a Council of Education is.</P>
    <P>I echo the Minister's thanks to those members who have worked so patiently and carefully in the Council of Education. I indicated, after the council was set up, that it was not my intention to sit on their doorstep listening to what was going on inside, and, during my term of office, I kept myself away from their discussions, because I felt that, having assembled a selection of people who were deeply engaged in educational work into a council, what we wanted was to get the real honest results of their experience, judgment and discussions.  The Minister may, perhaps, have to wait for some time to get those results, but I feel that already the council has stimulated activity and a desire to pass on the experience of those who are the real educators of the country, that is, those who work in the schools.</P>
    <P>I am happy to realise that the conciliation machinery set up for the primary teachers has been able to come to a conclusion which the Minister has been able to agree with at the conciliation stage.  One of the things which I think it is very important to do is to allow our organised teachers, primary, secondary and vocational, to turn their minds to pedagogical experience and pedagogical work and to give to our general education system the benefits of their experience in a detached and, as I might say, a personal and individual way, because the educational experience of individual teachers is the most precious thing we have to keep by way of guidance in our policies in regard to training and technique in education.  I feel that we have reached a very satisfactory stage when, having set up machinery of conciliation and <Col N="1708" /> arbitration to deal with teachers' salaries, it has been possible to find agreement as between the Ministry and the primary teachers at the conciliation stage.</P>
    <P>I know that vocational teachers have not yet been brought to the point at which they have arbitration and conciliation machinery, and I hope it will be possible for the Minister to solve the difficulties that lie there.  The difficulties arose from the fact that the vocational teachers have been in some way related to a cost-of-living bonus and any changes in their scales had to wait until the Civil Service Arbitration Report had been received; but, apart altogether from that, when whatever modification appropriate to the change in the cost of living has been made in their scales, this fact then remains, that of the 1,200 vocational teachers, 29 per cent. have the very same qualifications as would qualify them to teach in secondary schools; and 23 per cent. of this 1,200 are domestic economy teachers who have qualifications that would entitle them to teach as secondary teachers in secondary schools.  It seems quite wrong that men and women, teaching in any one particular town in Ireland, would if they were teaching in a secondary school have different conditions of service and pay from what they would have if they were teaching in vocational schools.  That is a matter that vocational teachers may have something to say about, as agreement has to be arrived at between them and the Minister as to what kind of conciliation and arbitration machinery is to be set up for them.  I feel that it will come inevitably and while there are difficulties in the way I hope the Minister will be able to solve some of them.</P>
    <P>It would distort the importance of matters that are very important if too many aspects of educational policy were discussed by me here to-day in the short time at our disposal.  Therefore, in regard to urging any particular thing on the Minister, I would urge that additional facilities are required for the training of women primary teachers.  The Minister will be aware that the training colleges at present <Col N="1709" /> for women primary teachers give us about 50 teachers a year from Limerick and 120 from Blackrock, making 165 in all: but the annual requirements at present&mdash;and they may increase within the next two years&mdash;are 230.  That is to say, in order to fill vacancies that arise for trained teachers, we need an additional 60 or 65 women teachers every year.  That is a very serious position to be in.  It is arising in certain circumstances, but I think it has to be faced now.  In addition to that, as long ago as 1946 it was definitely decided that the Department would, at the earliest possible moment, cease the appointing of untrained teachers.  I think about 20 per cent. of the women teachers&mdash;I am speaking about women teachers now&mdash;of the country are untrained junior assistant mistresses. There is every reason dictated by experience why we should not have untrained teachers in our primary schools.  Apart altogether from the 60 or 65 deficiencies in meeting our normal requirements for trained women teachers, there is the fact that about 70 additional trained teachers a year would be required, even of the junior assistant mistress status, to meet other vacancies that exist in the country.  I think the Minister will find himself&mdash; and managers and parents and children will find themselves&mdash;in very serious difficulties in the next year or two, if there is not set up immediately an additional training college for women that will provide about 120 places, that is, in a two years' course it should give 60 additional teachers every year.</P>
    <P>While I am not saying that we should get rid of the untrained teachers who are there at the moment &mdash;though untrained, they are definitely qualified, they are doing good work, and I do not think it should be intended to replace them&mdash;we are adding every year to the teacher corps about 70 untrained junior assistant mistresses and I feel that at a very early stage that should stop.  There has been a 10,000 increase in the school-going population between 1947 and 1950. The Central Statistics Office has examined the situation, and I think they have indicated that between 1950 and 1955 or 1956 the number of <Col N="1710" /> additional children in the country between 4 years and 14 years of age, which is the school-going age for practical purposes, will be increased by 35,000.  The Minister may have been sufficiently long in the Department to have run against the difficulties that managers find themselves in when they cannot find a teacher to take up when another teacher goes.  The one thing that I would urge as a matter of vital importance to the whole well-being of the primary school system is that a new training college be established at once for about 120 places, that would guarantee 60 or 65 additional trained women teachers per year.  Not only is there the lack of trained women lay teachers that I speak of, but the convent requirements are quite inadequately met by the present training colleges.</P>
    <P>It will be suggested that the Council of Education is examining certain matters with regard to the function of the primary schools, and that certain changes may be recommended, say, from 12 years onwards.  Also, the Interim Report of the Commission on Youth Unemployment in the City of Dublin, which was received four or five years ago, forewarned that when the report came out they would be recommending an increase in the school leaving age.  It may be suggested that it would be time enough, when we see what the Council of Education has to say or what the Youth Unemployment Commission has to report to consider what plans or preparation ought to be made for the training of teachers.  The most important, I might say the only, training of teachers that we have in this country is in the training colleges for primary teachers, and an examination of the achievements of the various schools would suggest what an important factor in our educational world is the work of the training colleges.  Whatever educational development we may have, after the age of 12 or up to 15 or 16, we very definitely want more of the work that is being done in the training colleges in which men and women are being trained for the primary schools. That training could not possibly go to waste.  It is wanted in our primary <Col N="1711" /> schools, no matter what kind of development occurs.</P>
    <P>As from some time in 1948, the staffing arrangements in primary schools were somewhat improved.  Nevertheless, in order to overcome some of the difficulties that teachers had in keeping up averages&mdash;the staffing of the school was related to average attendance&mdash; there was introduced a scheme of staffing based on enrolment.  That enabled the staffing of schools to be kept in a stable way in spite of epidemics, in spite of sickness and in spite of the weather conditions that affect rural schools.  A staffing plan based on enrolment was introduced that was favourable to the greater number of schools in this country.  It worked out that in city schools staffing based on average attendance was of greater advantage.  Actually, both of these were used as an alternative so that the introduction of staffing based on enrolment would not do damage to those schools that were already fairly poorly staffed and not on average attendance.</P>
    <P>Now there is the alternative there but, nevertheless, I should like to mention some facts with regard to the conditions of appointment in primary schools here and, say, in primary schools in the Six Counties.  For a first appointment of a principal and an assistant in a school here, an enrolment average of 60 is required.  An enrolment average of 25 is sufficient for the first and succession appointment in the Six Counties.  In order to have a principal and two assistants here, for first appointment you want to have 100, and for succession appointment 95.  In the Six Counties you get a principal and two assistants where you have an average enrolment of 65.</P>
    <P>When you come to a principal and four assistants, it requires for first appointment 220 here and for succession appointment 205.  In the Six Counties, for a principal and four assistants, both for first and succession appointments, an average enrolment of 145 is required.  The Minister ought not to allow anybody to persuade him on financial grounds that the staffing of <Col N="1712" /> the schools here can be tampered with or that changes can be made to meet this shortage that I spoke of.  It cannot be done.  I have already from these benches in the past referred to the bad staffing of schools in the City of Dublin. Unfortunately, I was not able to do very much about it partly because of the shortage of teachers and partly because of the lack of suitable accommodation. The main point I am aiming at is&mdash;more teachers are wanted.  You want a small number of men teachers which, I believe, can be provided through the services of St. Patrick's Training College for men, Drumcondra, but you will want to give them facilities to meet their training requirements and you will want to get 65 women teachers a year that we are short of, or will be short of, in the years immediately in front of us.  That shortage is there now.  The Central Statistics Branch, in a survey made for the Department of Education, have indicated that there will be 35,000 more children of school-going age to be catered for in 1956 than are being catered for to-day.  The setting up of a training college straightway capable of housing 120 women teachers would give no additional teachers for two years.  It would not help in any way in making a contribution towards solving the annual problem of appointing about 70 untrained junior assistant mistresses which will continue to exist unless a second training college is established.</P>
    <P>It will be said maybe that primary teachers should be sent to and trained in the university.  I do not believe&mdash;I would offer my advice to the Minister for all it is worth&mdash;that properly trained primary teachers are to be got that way.  If there is to be an improvement, and there can be an improvement in the atmosphere for training and in the atmosphere for instruction that primary teachers can get, that, in my opinion, can best be provided by improving the status of the professors in the training colleges and of the training colleges themselves.  The one point I want to emphasise to the Minister now, not to distort any other matter in the sphere of education, is that he wants straightway an additional <Col N="1713" /> training college for women that will house 120 candidates for teacherships, and that when it is in proper working order it will turn out 60 additional lay women teachers every year. That will not meet all he wants.  He will then want another which will enable him to stop the practice of putting untrained women teachers to the extent of 60 or 70 into the schools year after year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine myself to one or two tabloid remarks owing to the shortness of time.  The first thing I would like to urge on the Minister is the importance of coming to a decision as rapidly as possible in relation to the raising of the school-leaving age.  I am sure the Minister agrees, and there is very little difference of view in the House, as to the necessity of ensuring a higher standard of education for all our people.  The question of raising the school-leaving age has been canvassed and discussed for a considerable period of time, and we should be in a position to reach a decision on that issue fairly rapidly from now on.  I am not raising this in any kind of a Party spirit, but I am sure it is a matter which should be examined objectively by the Minister and by Parties on both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Another matter which is probably simpler, apart from the financial provisions in relation to it is the number of scholarships granted to national school children.  The number is grossly inadequate and is far below the standard given in any other country.  I think the Minister would render a useful service not merely to the parents of the children but also to the nation if he could persuade the Department of Finance to make a greater sum available for the granting of scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be possible in the space of time available to discuss the Department's policy in regard to the spread of the Irish language.  Again, I feel that there is agreement in the House that it is the aim to make the Irish language the spoken language of the people.  There are many different factors involved.  The most alarming factor in recent years is the recession, if you like, of Irish in the Gaeltacht districts and along the western seaboard <Col N="1714" /> generally.  That arises of course in part from the economic conditions, but I think it also arises largely from a lack of realisation of the constant and mounting influences that have to be combated if Irish is to survive in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Day in, day out, not merely an alien language but an alien culture and civilisation is pumped into our people through the cinemas, through the radio, through magazines, through cheap books.  I do not think that that problem can be dealt with merely by excluding these or by trying to limit their circulation.  American and English films have come to stay and we cannot exclude them, but I do not think that we have faced up to the problem that these developments of the last 20 years or so have created in the weakening of the language and I would ask the Minister to consider ways and means of competing with these influences.</P>
    <P>The scheme I have always been very keen on is the erection of halls right through the Gaeltacht on the basis of at least one hall per parish, these halls to be used for Irish drama, lectures, concerts and céilithe.  They could be handed over, if you like, on a yearly trust either to the Comhdháil or the Gaelic League on condition that they be used only for entirely Irish-speaking functions.  I know that a scheme of that kind will, of necessity, be costly, but I feel that if we are serious and sincere in our determination not merely to revive Irish as the spoken language of the people but to maintain Irish in the Gaeltacht, it is essential that we should put our own culture on a basis where it can compete with the influences that reach us from outside through the alien culture which is pumped day in, day out, into our people.  I think that we can compete through drama, through music, through céilithe and through making life more attractive in the Gaeltacht. It may be a costly business, but I think that we must face up to that cost.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can compete successfully by making films of our own or that we can produce a sufficient quantity of literature in Irish to be a sufficient counter-attraction to the literature and films which are being <Col N="1715" /> pumped in from outside.  We can however compete through the means of parish halls and parish theatres. These, if they are to be of any value, must be thoroughly organised and first class.  It will be necessary to run in conjunction with them special drama troupes and special concert troupes that would tour them the whole year round and provide entertainment the whole year round, and also to provide lectures and classes. Any attempt in that direction should be made on the basis that we can produce something better than is produced outside; we must be able to compete with outside influences.  If possible, we must also develop a pride in our own language and culture.  If these halls were erected I would like to see organised through them systematic tours of plays and concerts as well as céilithe.  These halls could thus acquire a reputation outside the Gaeltacht areas in the same way as the Irish theatre in Galway.  I should like to see the position where people from outside the Gaeltacht would actually go to these halls at different times of the year.  I know that a scheme of that kind would be costly and that there would be a great deal of opposition, but I think that that is the only way we can maintain the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I do not wish any more than the preceding speakers to take up much time on this Estimate, but I would like to express my appreciation of the setting up of the Council of Education and to acknowledge the good effects which are already showing themselves throughout the schools now that such a council is in being.  I also want to pay a tribute to the better relations which exist between our inspectors and our teachers throughout the country. With our Council of Education and our conciliation and arbitration boards I think that things may be much happier in future than they have been in the past for the primary teachers at any rate throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot let the occasion pass without referring to the revival of the Irish language.  It has been mentioned that very great results are being obtained at <Col N="1716" /> the present time but I want to be realistic and factual on this matter.  We are now at the end of 30 years of effort to revive the Irish language.  I think that each Government has been anxious for the revival and that each Government has pursued substantially the same methods.  No doubt the effort in the schools has been very intense but what do we find at the end of 30 years? We find here in Dublin that actually less Irish is spoken outside the schools and school circles.  On the streets of Dublin, in the buses, in the lounge bars, in the hotels and in the dance halls you hear more Yiddish than Gaelic spoken. As between the two languages I think that from that point of view Yiddish appears in Dublin to have the upper hand.  I know that in the English speaking parts of the country outside Dublin it is not so bad.</P>
    <P>The chief hope we had, some 30 years ago, was that we could so strengthen and extend the Fior Gaeltacht that we would create a spring that would nourish the rest of the country and, in time, make the whole of Ireland Irish-speaking. That has proved a vain hope.  From my own observation, I think the Fior Gaeltacht districts have shrunk and that the position has weakened.  From that, I conclude that something is, and has been up to now, very wrong.  I think the time is ripe for a real stocktaking and a change of methods with regard to the revival of the language.  Now that we have a Council of Education I shall not be presumptuous enough to offer suggestions but if such a council were not in existence I should put forward suggestions which I think might be useful.  I urge the necessity for an intense effort and a change of methods in the matter of the revival of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>Now that the serving teachers have been more or less satisfied&mdash;I need not say that they are not fully satisfied: nobody is ever fully satisfied&mdash;and that they have got an increase in their salaries and other emoluments through the medium of the conciliation board which was set up by the previous Minister for Education, I should like to bring the case of teachers who retired prior to the 1st January, 1950, to the attention of the <Col N="1717" /> Minister.  As the Minister is aware, all national teachers who retire since that date receive a retiring gratuity, but a large number of teachers who retired previous to that date do not come under that rule.  Provision was made in that connection in Northern Ireland some years ago and if such an arrangement can be come to in the Six Counties surely our Government should be able to do likewise.</P>
      <P>Serving teachers will now receive an extra sum of £1,000,000 odd per annum. I understand that a retiring gratuity necessary to satisfy the teachers who retired before the 1st January, 1950, would be in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000 also&mdash;but once you make provision for that, and pay it, you are finished with it.  I think that these teachers who did their work well and who taught in even more difficult days than our own deserve that that provision should be made for them.  As the previous Minister did so much good towards improving the conditions of teachers, both as regards salaries and conditions of service, I hope that the new Minister will now do a very good service and satisfy this body of retired teachers in such a way that they will never have occasion to trouble him again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that a number of serving teachers would like to see settled is the question of retirement on marriage, which is compulsory in the case of lady teachers.  It can be argued that the place for the mother is in the home, but experience through the years has shown that married women teachers have been amongst the most successful in our schools, and that the children of the home do not suffer.  We can easily understand that a lady teacher who has definitely made up her mind to get married will not take that interest in her school work which she would take if she felt that her marriage would not mean her retirement from the profession.  In the ordinary way, if she felt that she could teach for years and years, she would pay far more attention to her work. There are many other reasons why it would be well, not only for the lady teachers concerned, but also for education in general, if the Minister would <Col N="1718" /> now look into the whole matter and see what can be done to remove the ban.</P>
    <P>The heating, cleaning and maintenance of schools are matters that have caused a great deal of trouble to managers and teachers.  The arrangements made and the grants allowed are not satisfactory.  The grants are insufficient, especially when they are given on an average basis.  It is easy to understand that if there are two or three rooms in a school and an average of, say, 100 on the one hand and then, on the other hand, an average of only 30 or 40, it will take the same amount of fuel to heat the school no matter what the average may be.  The managers are responsible for the heating and cleaning of the schools but they have no fund at their disposal.  It is rather difficult to solve the question. I suggest that the Minister should call a conference representative of the teachers, the managers and the Department of Education to see if they can hammer out some scheme by which the heating and cleaning of schools can be arranged on some satisfactory basis.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I understand that he has the name of being a decent, fair-minded man and I think his appointment was very favourably received by the members of the I.N.T.O.  I wish him success in his Department.  If he will carry out what I suggest in connection with retired teachers, the question of retirement on marriage of lady teachers and the matter of the heating and cleaning of schools he will earn the gratitude not only of the teaching profession but also of the managers and the people in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister the necessity for the provision of sanitary accommodation in the rural schools.  Apparently, schools not directly under the board will not get the same concession as schools which are directly under the board.  For a long time past there seems to have been a bone of contention between the board and the managers. I think a move was made by the last Minister to be more generous <Col N="1719" /> with the schools under the managers than they were before that.</P>
      <P>I am sure that no one knows better than the Minister that there are schools in the North Cork health area which are absolutely scandalous from the point of view of lack of sanitary facilities.  How the pupils in these schools can assimilate any knowledge is beyond my comprehension and I am sure that it is beyond the comprehension of others also who are very interested in the scholars.  I would ask the Minister to get in touch with the Department of Finance or the Department of Local Government&mdash;I think that the Department of Finance would be the principal obstacle&mdash;and ask them to be more generous with their allowances for the development of sanitary and water schemes for these schools.</P>
      <P>In my first contribution to the debate on the Estimate for this Department in 1948 I stressed the point to the then Minister, now Deputy Mulcahy, that I thought that the responsible education authorities could do a little more than they were doing in the matter of inculcating a publicminded spirit in the scholars&mdash;the boys of to-day who undoubtedly will be the men of to-morrow.  I have said before that I think it is desirable that the National Flag should be flown on one day in each week or in each month in all our schools and the school children should be taught at an age when they are most impressionable that they should honour, cherish and respect the flag of their country.  Possibly, too, a recording of the National Anthem could be played to teach the children respect for that anthem.</P>

      <P>The proper time during which to inculcate a proper national spirit into our children is during their school years.  I do not want to add to the existing burdens of the teachers. We all know that they are carrying out their duties most competently and we all know that they are more than prepared to give assistance when required. I am sure that they would be more than willing to help to inculcate a deep rooted spirit of nationality in our children.</P>
      <P>It is painful at times to see the lack of respect that is shown when our National Anthem is played.  It is said that &ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt&rdquo; and possibly that may have something to do with the present unsatisfactory situation whereunder one observes that our anthem and our flag do not get the respect to which they are entitled. Sometimes I wonder how far have we advanced in national concepts over the past 30 years of native Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Palmer has spoken at length on the subject of the Irish language.  I know that when I was a member of Craobh an Chéitinnigh I was much more fluent in speaking Irish than I am to-day.  Possibly, the psychological aspect of the situation should be examined more fully.  I do not feel competent to make suggestions to people who are much more expert at Irish than I am.  As a native speaker, the Minister must realise that something is wrong.  It may be that the old Gaelic League spirit is dying out or that Irish is commercialised.  It is inevitable that as time goes on and objects are achieved and ambitions realised there should be a tendency to revert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that the present Minister will continue in the footsteps of his predecessor. When Deputy General Mulcahy established the arbitration and conciliation boards he succeeded to a great extent in bringing about a <i>rapprochement</i> between the teachers and the ordinary taxpayer.  Salaries have been increased substantially and I would appeal to the teachers to rest content with the increases for the time being.  I cannot quite understand what <Col N="1721" /> happened in the Department of Finance.  I think Finance must have got some kind of hypodermic.  That is the only thing that will explain their &ldquo;flaithiúlachtness&rdquo; because never before has Finance proved so liberal.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider the points made by Deputy Palmer in relation to teachers who resigned or retired prior to the 1st January, 1950.  Those teachers following the establishment of a native Government here had to go and learn Irish.  They did that quite willingly and they made a good job of it.  Those teachers were appreciated by the parents.  I would appeal to the Minister to give those who retired in 1950 the benefit of the increases so far as gratuity is concerned.  That would only be justice to them.  They have reached the winter of their lives and they would be glad of some improvement in their present position.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very tough job. Education is a perennial topic of conversation. I am sure the Minister will do all he can to improve education.  He is the first Minister for Education who hails from Cork and we expect a good deal from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he did not intend making any drastic changes in the Department of Education.  For a new Minister, that is a wise temporary step, but I say that at the end of five years no drastic changes will have taken place; nor at the end of another five years will any drastic changes have taken place.  Yet, there is no Department of the Government in which drastic changes are so needed as in the Department of Education. It is the same in other countries. Education seems to suffer financially in many countries but I would say that things are worse here.  It is not a popular thing to vote large sums of money to the Department of Education. It is claimed that it is not a capital investment, and for that reason it has become more or less the Cinderella of all the Departments.  There are many changes required; many things have to be attended to.  Firstly, decent school buildings must be made available for our Irish children.  Then the matter of <Col N="1722" /> heating and cleaning of these schools needs careful and vigorous overhauling.</P>
      <P>Credit has been given to the Minister for the way he sanctioned increases in salaries recommended by the conciliation committee but those increases represent only a fraction of the just demand of the teachers.  Those increases will tend to bring teachers' salaries up to the same level as salaries enjoyed in other professions the members of which possess the same or a lower standard of education, but they compare, even yet, very unfavourably with the Black Scale in Northern Ireland or the Burnham Scale in England.  Pensioners, even under the new recommendation, have been neglected.  We must remember that these pensioners taught at very difficult times in our history.  They were pioneers in the work of restoring the Irish language at a time when it was not popular to do any pioneer work in that direction.  It is unfair especially that teachers who retired prior to the 1st January, 1950, should not get the benefit of the retiring gratuity.  There is a case quoted of two brothers, one retiring on 1st December, 1949, and the other retiring on 1st January, 1950. They had the same length of service but one retired with a gratuity while the other did not receive any such payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the different branches of education &mdash;primary, technical, secondary and university&mdash;there should be more harmony and more dove-tailing.  I think that the break which occurs between primary and technical education could be remedied by having the school-leaving age increased to 16 years, but with the present shortage of teachers and the inadequacy of school buildings it is impossible to do that at the moment.  The shortage of teachers is again related to the question of salary. Young men who are advised by their parents in the adoption of a career, are certainly not advised to follow teaching as a profession.  I have known boys who passed the preparatory school entrance examination&mdash;that is one of the easiest ways of becoming a teacher&mdash;and who yet would not avail of the scholarship because their parents, who were ordinary country people, said that far more could be earned at <Col N="1723" /> an earlier age in any trade like carpentry, masonry, or the other manual trades.  These are points which must be looked into.  It is in the interests of the nation, the interests of the men and women of to-morrow, that changes, and drastic changes, should be made. Wireless should be made available in every school.  I think the Department would put forward many points against adopting such a course, but it is necessary because in rural schools it would broaden the outlook of the children and give them an added interest in affairs outside the immediate school area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that Comhaltas Uladh was celebrating its silver jubilee, and that it had done great work for the language.  These statements are true.  Comhaltas Uladh wishes to impress upon the Minister the necessity of having sufficient text books in the Ulster dialect.  Teachers find, at the end of the school year, when making selections for their classes, that out of a large number of Irish text books sanctioned by the Department, a very small percentage&mdash; I would say only about 10 per cent.&mdash; are in the Donegal or Ulster dialect. It is not fair to the work that the Comhaltas has done that it should be in this respect penalised.</P>

      <P>I recommend to Deputies who have not had an opportunity of hearing Deputy Butler speak here to-day on the Education Estimate to read and inwardly digest his observations.  They provide quite an interesting and intriguing echo of the progressive disintegration of Fianna Fáil and, for that reason, deserve close study by anybody interested in the probable future of this country.  God help Deputy Butler, because, if I know anything of his colleagues and the machine to which he belongs, it is not through a mangle he will be passed, but through a tumbler when the boys get him behind closed doors.  However, let me console him, as they proceed to eviscerate him, by assuring him that he put the cat amongst the pigeons most effectively. Deputy Butler, speaking with a very long experience of education, said that the Irish language was very much less <Col N="1724" /> used outside the schools to-day than it was 30 years ago.  He and his colleagues can speculate on the reason. I can tell them the reason.</P>
      <P>We have travelled a long road since I was 20 years of age and a number of young men and girls of my age used to assemble one night every week in Stephen's Green for no other purpose than to have the opportunity of speaking Irish.  None of us were looking for jobs; none of us were hoping to qualify for treatment that we did not deserve in the Civil Service; none of us were trying to edge out of public employment candidates who technically were our superiors but who refused to stoop to the degradation of &ldquo;a chara&rdquo; and &ldquo;mise le meas mór&rdquo;. What has thrown Irish back in this country is the growing conviction that it has become an instrument of corruption and a means of procuring preference for the relatively incompetent over the competent. Nothing has filled me with more nausea during my period as a Minister of State in this country than to see highly competent candidates for public employment placed first by the Civil Service Commissioners who had examined them in the technical sphere and then to have those placings sent to a star chamber court that sat in private and examined them.</P>

      <P>I am trying to without being too abrupt.  Nothing disgusted me more than to see those returns made by the Appointments Commission setting the people in order of preference according to their technical competence sent to a star chamber court by the Civil Service Commissioners where judgment upon their capacity in Irish was then passed; you frequently found the man who was eight or ninth on the list lifted up to the first place and six or seven superior candidates denied the post in the public service to which they aspired and their appointment to which would have benefited the public service, because some technically incompetent person was more glib with his &ldquo;a chara&rdquo; and &ldquo;mise le meas mór.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I love the language and I learned to love the language when there was no money in it, and I learned the language in Ballingeary and Cloghaneely when there was nobody in either of those colleges who hoped to get any money out of it.  Every one of us in Teach Luasaigh, Ballingeary, Cloghaneely or whether it was in Gortachoirce or Bunbeg, was there because we loved the language.  Its acquisition qualified us for no preferment and for no monetary reward.  I gave up going to Ballingeary or Cloghaneely only when those colleges became infested with &ldquo;tulips,&rdquo; male and female, who came there for no other purpose than to try and qualify themselves to get jobs that they were not technically qualified to hold.  Having failed to attain a high degree of proficiency in the work they proposed to undertake, they thought that, by equipping themselves with &ldquo;a chara&rdquo; and &ldquo;mise le meas mór,&rdquo; they might steal in by the back door. The Civil Service and the local authorities are still with such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still love the language, but instead of seeing it made an instrument of that base kind of corruption, I believe there is yet time to restore it to the position to which it is entitled in this country, to raise it high in the estimation of our people and to make its mastery the ambition of the best in all our future generations.  I propose to outline now, in not more than six <Col N="1726" /> minutes, how that could be done to-morrow, to the great advantage of the language, to the great advantage of education and to the great advantage of our people in every branch of their daily lives.</P>
    <P>One of the reproaches of any democratic community in the world must be that the son of well-to-do parents has access to avenues of education which may well be denied to a much more richly endowed child whose parents happen to be without means.  I never walk through a slum street in Dublin or along a country road without, again and again, being rendered conscience-stricken by the knowledge that I, and the likes of me, had educational opportunities which, were they available to some poor children, could have been made much more of by them than I was capable of making them.  Nevertheless, those poor children never will have access to such facilities as their parents are highly unlikely, in any economic set-up based on Christian democracy, to be in a position to finance it, because what I feel are the minima due to a child richly endowed by God with brains is the right and opportunity to secure education from the first book in the national school to the Doctorate of Philosophy, if that is where his talents are calculated to bring him.  Irish, instead of being an instrument of corruption and shame, could be made by this House now the passport to that standard of education for every child in every school in Ireland.  While at the same time crowning the language, we could banish from our society the reproach that poor people cannot use the talents God gave them, while the well-to-do may waste the opportunities afforded them.</P>
    <P>What, then, shall we do?  I suggest to the Minister that all the &ldquo;cod&rdquo; expenditure that goes on at present to satisfy the multitudinous vested interests who trot around the Irish language night and day to see what they can get out of it be cancelled out, and that we ought to say to every child in every national school in Ireland: &ldquo;The road is open to you, without imposing the burden of a penny piece on your <Col N="1727" /> parents, be they rich or be they poor, to be a doctor or a philosopher if you, a five-year-old child, start burning your modest modicum of midnight oil studying Irish.  If you take Irish and bend your mind to it in the national school and, when you come to taking your leaving diplomas in the national school, you choose to offer yourself for a special examination of a relatively high standard for a national school in Irish and attain the honours standard, you will get a scholarship to the secondary school on this understanding: that when you take your intermediate in the secondary school and when you do your leaving certificate or matriculation, whatever other subjects you take, contemporaneously you present yourself for a special examination in Irish in which the standard will be high, and get honours in it, you will get a scholarship to the university.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I say a scholarship I mean a scholarship, because for a labouring man's son from Kerry or Cork a scholarship of £60 a year, to attend the National University, is useless, because, while it may be useful to a relatively well-to-do person for his son to get £60, how can a labouring man send his child to Dublin to live in digs and attend lectures on £60 a year? That scholarship, related to a scholarship in the Irish language, must be a scholarship which affords a successful student the cost of his digs, the cost of his books, the cost of his fees and, if necessary, clothes suitable to his new walk in life and, let us face it, an exiguous but modest provision in respect of pocket money, because there is no use in asking boys or girls to attend the university, who never have a penny in their pockets.  I do not mean that they should get an extravagant weekly allowance to dissipate in tomfoolery, but that they must have a few shillings in their pockets once a week to live normally, is an inescapable fact, unless we spoil the whole ship for a ha'porth of tar.</P>
    <P>That student on entering college should be fixed with notice that the faculty to which he wishes to belong is his own business, but that so long as he passes in the academic examination <Col N="1728" /> relating to the faculty to which he attaches himself each year and, at the same time, continues to present himself in a special examination in the Irish language contemporaneously, taking honours in it, he can proceed on that scholarship to the doctorate of whatever faculty he chooses to join.  I constantly hear the Taoiseach talking about the value of the language and the impossibility of saving it should it die in our time.  He is right in that. But does he mean it?  Because, if he does mean it, it seems to me fantastic to meet the proposal I now make with the excuse that it would cost too much.</P>
    <P>That degree of education ought to be open to every child in the country if children are to be afforded an opportunity of using the talents God gave them.  It would be wrong, I think, to open the doors of education on that scale to the whole community, just as I think it is wrong for well-to-do parents to try to force children through a university course for which they are quite unfitted.  Some children have talents for academic learning; others have talents for technical instruction; others have talents for a trade and other occupations.  But the child who is prepared to make an academic effort to attain to a high standard of proficiency in colloquial Irish marks himself out as a child fitted for academic education and you have operating continually a power of selection which functions automatically: for the child who yearns for education and has the capacity to purchase it by acquiring a high degree of proficiency in Irish has the two qualities which are guaranteed to glean good value from whatever educational opportunities are afforded.</P>
    <P>Given that such a scheme were operated as from to-morrow, there would start pouring out of our universities in our time a steady stream of educated men and women who had attained all their education through the instrumentality of the Irish language and all of them would be highly proficient exponents of the language.</P>
    <P>The last advantage to note in the plan is this.  If there is one thing our people revere, it is learning.  If Irish becomes a master key of higher education and learning in this country, <Col N="1729" /> ultimately it shares in the reverence our people pay to learning; ultimately it becomes associated in the minds of our people with learning; it becomes a hallmark of superior education.  Not for the first time in this House I point out that in pre-war Russia the people who spoke French and Russian proclaimed themselves to be the educated elements of society.  In this country our aim should be to establish in the minds of our people that people who spoke Irish and English were the educated elements of our community and that the monolingual might or might not be distinguished academically.</P>
    <P>There is the means of restoring the Irish language to the place of honour from which it should never have been dashed down.  There is the means of putting behind us the whole noisome concept that the language has become the means to deprive those technically competent of the preferment to which they are entitled in favour of those who never acquired technical competence. There is the means of ending forever the reproach which all of us should feel that the poor man's child in Ireland, eager, willing and anxious to use the talents which God gave him, can be denied the opportunity.  There is an exciting adventure founded on the language.  There is a cause in which the language could be nobly used.  Is there the slightest prospect of anyone adopting it?  Far less than the snowball has in hell.  There is no money in it; there are no votes in it; there is no electoral advantage in it.  But it should be noted for the records, because some day it will be done and, if I am any judge of the future, it will save the language.  But, when we come to save it, we will have to do it in spite of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Those of us who believe in the principle laid down in the Proclamation of 1916 of equal opportunity for all the children of the nation must find in the speech delivered by Deputy Dillon some hope for the future, not on the aspect of the Irish language on which he based it, but on the aspect of free education for all the children of the nation from the primary school to the university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  Like Deputy Dillon, I agree that many people are sent to the universities who are unfit to be in the universities, who should not be in them; that there are many children of talent kept out of the universities because their parents have not the means to send them there, who should be there, and could be there with advantage, not only to the nation, but perhaps to the world as well.  I am one of those who believe in that type of free education.  I have been advocating it for many years and I sincerely hope that, before many years have passed, we will be able to create in the minds of the people a desire for that free education, with equal opportunity for all our citizens, so that the talents and abilities of the children of the nation may be utilised in the interests of the nation and, perhaps, as I say, in the interests of the world.</P>
      <P>Now, I have intervened in this debate to support the plea that was made here this evening for the retired teachers.  I also want to make a plea on behalf of certain &ldquo;Jams&rdquo;&mdash;junior assistant mistresses.  They are divided into two sections, one appointed before a particular date, and another appointed after a particular date.  I understand that there is approximately a difference of £100 per annum in the salaries of these particular grades.  I intend to take that matter up with the Minister.  I am only mentioning it on this Estimate to indicate that there is considerable objection amongst the teachers affected by that unfair discrimination which seems to have no basis whatsoever in reason.  It was an arbitrary decision taken at some time by somebody and continued on.  Those people are doing the same type of work and have the same responsibilities, and they feel, and I think rightly so, that they ought to have the same remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been certain references to the condition of our schools.  Everybody knows that the conditions in some of the primary schools right through the country are a disgrace, <Col N="1731" /> and that the conditions in some of our city schools are an absolute disgrace. There is overcrowding and there are insanitary conditions.  Some are almost derelict structures in which the teachers are expected to teach and the children are expected to learn.  I understand that the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, some short time ago, sent out a circular to all teachers asking them for very simple information as to the conditions obtaining in their own schools: the size of the rooms, the number of pupils, data in regard to sanitation and the age of the school&mdash;ordinary information that one would expect would be accumulated by any organisation which had the interests of the pupils, the interests of the teachers and the general interest of education at heart.</P>
    <P>I understand that that document was described as the most revolutionary document that was issued in this State since the Irish Free State was founded, and that the document was withdrawn.  Now, I think that is a serious matter.  I think that all of us ought to be concerned about the conditions in the schools, and that all of us ought to understand and appreciate the position, and on whom the responsibility rests in connection with the conditions in the schools.  I think that, having some responsibility to the young generation and to future generations, we ought to see that such steps as are necessary to put an end to these horrible conditions are taken as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I come across, in the course of my ordinary work, applications in the court to send children away to industrial schools, to schools which are under the control of the Minister.  I have seen some of these applications based on cruelty by the father&mdash;that the father was excessive in his punishment of the child.  I did see one case where there was an allegation of the stealing of money by a child, in which the father used something in the nature of a cane on the buttocks of the child.  Certain marks were left, and there was an application in the <Col N="1732" /> court, because of that, to have the child taken away from the control of its parent and put into one of these schools under the control of the Minister.  I am one of those people who think that family control, and the responsibilities of parents, ought to be interfered with as little as possible.</P>
    <P>I think there is too much interference at the moment, particularly in regard to children.  Although we have no divorce laws, separations are being made in the courts day after day, but that is not relevant to this debate. There is too much interference with the responsibility of the parents in regard to their children and children are being taken away from their parents and sent into these schools without a proper appreciation of what is involved in that action.</P>
    <P>Only recently have certain complaints come to my notice, one of which I have referred to the Minister already, about cruel treatment of children in the schools.  If a parent is alleged to have acted cruelly, he is brought up in court, and there is some investigation, but when these little children are sent away to some of these schools and there is an allegation of cruel treatment in regard to them, there are no court proceedings, no investigations in the open, and I am asking the Minister, because I know he is interested in this problem and interested in the children, to set up machinery that will ensure that there will be no complaints of cruelty of that type.  I put it no more strongly than that complaints have come to me recently, one of which, as I say, I have referred to the Minister for investigation. The Minister and the House will agree that it is important that there should be no cause for complaint, that there should be no suggestion of complaint, and that such steps as are necessary to make sure that there will be no suggestion of complaint will be taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I know that the authorities in these schools are doing excellent work, invaluable work, but none of us would be anxious that out-of date methods of punishment that we abhor, cruelties, should be adopted, even though that <Col N="1733" /> cruelty and that punishment may be considered to be in the best interests of the child.  Certainly, if the father of a child can be brought up in court and deprived of control of the child simply because he has used a cane on the buttocks of the child and left marks, no authority in the State should be permitted to use that same form of punishment without some investigation or inquiry into it.  I am satisfied that the Minister, having the same interests as all humanitarians have in these children, will take such steps as are necessary to ensure that there will be no suggestion of complaint against these institutions in the future.  If he does so, and if the remarks I am making this evening have the effect of putting an end to even a suggestion of ill-treatment, I feel that these remarks of mine will have been justified.</P>

      <P>I should like to support those Deputies who have spoken in favour of raising the school-leaving age.  I hope that it will be the Minister's privilege to come to a decision on that matter.  In rural Ireland, when children leave the primary schools at 14 years of age, they are sadly lacking in training of any kind for the life they have to lead afterwards, and, if the two extra years were spent at a technical or vocational school, they would learn many arts and crafts which would be very useful to them in their future life at home or when they go abroad, if they are forced to emigrate to earn a living. Boys are taught many trades in these schools, and even if they are to become farmers in their own homes, they can learn to be very useful and to make many useful things for use around the house.  Girls also can learn the art of housekeeping and housewifery of all kinds and, when they subsequently take up a position, they will not be the menial dependents they are at present. Under present conditions, there is no respect for them as domestic servants and they are sadly lacking in the ordinary rules of housekeeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would concentrate on building more technical and vocational schools throughout rural Ireland, it would be much preferable to this higher education which Deputy Dillon <Col N="1734" /> spoke of here.  When he talks he talks, so to speak, in the air.  He is not practical and merely talks for talk's sake. He was a Minister for the past three years, and it is a wonder he did not expound these wonderful views which he now tells the Minister he should put into practice&mdash;that everybody should have free education, including university education.  I should like to ask how many of our university graduates are able to make a living at home. Many of them graduate in Ireland with very high honours and very high degrees, but unfortunately have to seek employment elsewhere, whereas if boys and girls in rural Ireland had a good practical education and were enabled to find employment in the industries in their own districts, it would be much better for the nation and for these boys and girls themselves.  Let those who have the ability, the money and the training go on for university education, by all means, but I do not think the people of rural Ireland want this higher education for their children. They would much prefer to see them practical men and women making comfortable livelihoods, and not aspiring to an upbringing to which they are not accustomed.  That is only my own opinion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cleaning of rural schools, I spoke on this subject on former occasions, and I understand that the same system of cleaning still prevails.  It is a sad commentary on our civilisation that schools in rural Ireland should be cleaned by the primitive methods of 30 or 40 years ago, that is, by the children attending the schools.  Children are kept in after hours to clean and dust these schools, and I do not think that is good for them, physically or mentally.</P>
    <P>If the amount of money that is given for cleaning and heating schools were increased, and a cleaner were paid as in the case of technical schools, it would be far better than having the children doing that very unsuitable work.  I understand the amount allotted for this was reduced by the previous Government.  If the Minister could see his way to increase the grant again, it would be to great advantage, and I hope that the Minister will look into the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself very much in agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Mrs. Rice.  I would like to see a practical approach to the subject of education.  I am inclined to think that even in the primary schools the very basis of our education directs the children's minds from the rural areas to the industrialised areas&mdash;mainly, I should think, for the Civil Service.  I hope a new policy will be devised for the rural areas.  Education in a primary school in the cities should be very different from that made available to children in the rural areas.  The children of farm workers and farmers are being educated at present in a manner which enables them to go forward in competetion with the children of cities and towns for administrative work such as the Civil Service. I would prefer to see a bias there which would equip them to face life in the localities of their origin.  First of all, not very much attention is given to the rudiments of housekeeping in the case of girls.  Certainly, from the time they reach 11 or 12, they could get more education in general housekeeping and household management.  In the rural areas the boys should get a certain amount of technical instruction in the management of land and agriculture. If that bias were introduced in the rural areas, it would bring about a frame of mind there which would encourage the children to seek a livelihood on the land instead of going forward into the towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin City is increasing steadily in population, at the rate of 7,000 persons per year.  That is what has happened during the last 20 years&mdash;7,000 every year&mdash;and next year there will be another 7,000 on the register of Dublin City.  These 7,000 are coming from the rural areas mainly&mdash;because our economy and our education are not biassed in favour of a rural life.  I hope the Minister will approach this problem in a new way.  His Department has certainly been very active during the last couple of years under the inter-Party Government.  I hope he will continue to maintain that policy in many respects and that he will depart from it in cases where he considers it desirable to do so.  In the <Col N="1736" /> rural primary schools, the children of farmers and farm workers could be educated in a way that would show them that agriculture is not just &ldquo;a way of life&rdquo;.  People say that farming or agriculture is a way of life, but if we continue to adopt that frame of mind towards it, we will never get them to approach the question of food production in a businesslike way, to the advantage of the consumer and of the nation.  If farming is not tackled in a businesslike way, starting with education in the primary schools, we cannot hope to maintain and improve the good standard of living in this country.  We must equip the children in rural areas with sufficient knowledge to enable them to go into food production in such a way that they can compete with the world market as a result of their efforts.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the school building programme at present on hands.  I hope he will pursue it even more vigorously. In County Dublin, which is only on the fringe of our capital city, many primitive schools can be found.  Children there are being housed in primitive conditions, insanitary conditions, conditions which certainly are detrimental to their health.  I am not going to mention any particular schools.  I am sure a survey has been carried out and the Minister can see for himself what schools are not suitable and those to which children should not be sent in the interests of their health.  I hope that a remedy will be found and that State money will be made available for the erection of proper schools or the improvement of existing ones.</P>
    <P>One more point I wish to mention is in regard to the pensioned teachers. Those who retired before a certain date were not eligible for pensions under the same conditions as others. Of course, a certain date had to be mentioned in order to facilitate administration. However, since that certain date was mentioned, a number of pensioned teachers find that a certain hardship was imposed on them.  I would like the Minister to examine the financial consequences of a decision to pay those who have been disqualified as a result of the date decided on.  It <Col N="1737" /> may not be a very large sum and, if it is not, it is only right that those who have given long years of their lives to the education of the children of the nation should be properly rewarded.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Roe Report has been finally implemented.  Of course, the teachers are disappointed&mdash;we heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy say here to-night that they are disappointed that they did not get something more than they have got, as the cost of living has been altered considerably in the last six or eight months.  No one will deny that.  The cost of living appears to be on the increase and it is only right to expect that the amount now to be made available to the teachers should be scaled up in order to bring their conditions into line with the cost of living of the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the curtailment of time allotted to the Estimate, I propose to address very few points to the Minister.  Deputy Rooney says he hopes the Minister will pursue the educational policy as vigorously as the Minister who has just left office.  I can assure the House that he will not have to apply a lot of energy to pursue the vocational education aspect of it.  For the past three years, I have been protesting here, as a member of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, against the hold-up in the building operations in the city.  After three years, it is only in the last few months that the first of a series of schools which were planned more than five years ago has started, the one school at Clogher Road, Crumlin.  I appeal to the Minister not to look at the city vocational education affairs through provincial glasses, as the previous Minister did and perhaps the Ministers who preceded him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vocational education in the City of Dublin is a separate problem.  It is different.  It may be akin to Cork and, perhaps, Limerick, but Dublin is a separate problem&mdash;completely separate. The Minister should remember that Dublin and its environs has a population of more than 600,000 people, and that the type of vocational education in Dublin covers a very wide field, <Col N="1738" /> and is not comparable with any other part of the country except, perhaps, in a small way with other towns.</P>
    <P>The building programme must be pushed ahead.  We have a housing programme in this city that is not paralleled anywhere else.  We have no schools in the built-up areas for the children who are leaving school between 14 and 16 years.  Representations have been made repeatedly to the Department of Education.  In the Drimnagh district, which Deputy Briscoe represents, and in which 5,000 children leave school annually, there is no provision whatever being made.  At Clogher Road there is a very limited provision for 240 students, but there and elsewhere the problem has been left without being tackled.  Until the Minister sets up a department within his own Department, to deal specifically with the question of the City of Dublin, for me and people like me who give their time week in and week out to vocational education, it will just be continued frustration.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Minister to give the vocational education committee a larger measure of autonomy.  It is ridiculous to think that when people, competent people, elected to those bodies and who have made a study of the problem of vocational education over a number of years make some simple decision it requires the sanction of the Department.  I agree that the Department should have an overriding sanction in certain aspects. After all, if the State is contributing a considerable amount of money to the local body it is only logical to expect, and everybody will agree, that that sanction should be there.  At the same time, I do not want to see a continuance of what is in existence over a great number of years, this mentality that, when something goes up from our vocational education committee there are one or two or whatever number of people there is in the Department whose job would appear to be to see what holes they can pick in and what faults they can find with this scheme. If you have people who are elected to the vocational education committee by a competent body and if there are people competent to sit on that committee then give them as large a <Col N="1739" /> measure of autonomy as possible and do not be wasting the State's money and the local authorities' money with this shuttlecock performance of backwards and forwards between the committee and the Department.  It is frustration for the individuals and a waste of public money.  I hope the Minister will get his teeth into the building problem.  The plans are there and have been there.  Before Mr. Derrig left office three years ago he was doing his best to have those plans gone on with.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to vocational teachers.  We have protested repeatedly that we will not get the best people to teach, particularly the higher scientific and engineering subjects, on a salary scale of £340, a sum which has recently been raised to a maximum of £550 a year.  I think that is a ridiculous figure to offer people who can go elsewhere and, as I said here and elsewhere, it is an extraordinary thing to see an advertisement for an engineering teacher appear in the newspaper under the vocational education committee and side by side in the next column of the same newspaper an advertisement for the Electricity Supply Board or other body with a starting salary in excess of the maximum salary to which a teacher may hope to attain.  I think that is a ridiculous position.</P>
    <P>I think that the vocational education teachers must be paid; otherwise we will not have the standard of teaching that we demand.  People will not come into the profession and my advice to them is: &ldquo;Keep out of the profession on the present rates.&rdquo;  I think that the scale recommended recently by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee&mdash;the Minister should have a look at it as soon as possible&mdash;is a fair scale.  It does not represent the demands of the Vocational Education Committee but it is a long way in advance of what is being paid to teachers at the moment.  I shall not delay the Minister any longer since he must be finished by half-past eight.  I will have other opportunities to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I would impress upon the Minister <Col N="1740" /> to get on with the building programme; to see to it that a separate section is set up in the Department to deal with Dublin City and to look into the claims of the vocational teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I have to apologise for the fact that my knowledge of the Department is necessarily limited because I have not been long enough in it to familiarise myself with the various problems that have been raised here to-night.  I know I have mentioned that our building programme is not broad enough or sufficient enough to my own knowledge in the building of primary schools.  We have roughly 5,000 primary schools. Our average of new buildings is 15 a year.  It would take us 100 years to replace the existing buildings and very many of these to my own knowledge are in a rather poor condition.  I have no doubt that with the growth of the population in Dublin there is dire need for an expansion of schools of all classes, but I was hardly prepared for the scathing attack by Deputy McCann on the Department of Education and his belief that Dublin City has been very adversely treated.  Apparently it is in a much worse condition in regard to vocational education than the rural areas with which I am familiar and where there is no vocational education.</P>
      <P>So far as a few matters in which Dublin is so far in advance of rural areas, we have been told that there are in one school trades of fitting and turning, garage practice, metal-plate work, brass finishing, pattern making, boiler making, smith work, art iron work, oxy-acetylene and electric welding, foundry work, iron moulding, brass moulding, watch making, brick laying, carpentry and joinery, plumbing, plastering, painting and decorating, cabinet making, wood cutting, machinist work, coach building, coach painting, coach trimming, orthography, bookbinding and lithography.  It would not seem to me that the Department of Education is making a very poor effort here in Dublin when one school can provide all those classes.</P>

      <P>Part of our difficulty, to my mind always the major part, is historical.  We have much leeway to make up.  Deputy Rooney spoke about agriculture as a way of life.  It is a good way of life, but it is not enough in these days for it to remain a way of life only.  That way of life has been too good for some of the people who hold land and who have not justified themselves, and when people complain about the salaries paid to teachers I, as a countryman, must always take the view that every shilling of that salary must come out of a tankard in a creamery car.  I am interested as Deputy Rooney is in better production in agriculture because I know that these salary demands can never be met except we have greater production in the country.  I do think that the people who urge the payment of bigger salaries and the expenditure of more money must always remember where that money is to come from&mdash;out of the pockets of the people.  The Government have no magic wand to wave whereby to get that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy spoke of training colleges for women; someone else spoke of the school leaving age and another Deputy spoke of the marriage ban.  The question of providing training colleges for women teachers has been on the carpet for quite some time and I think we will probably solve that problem this year.  It would be very well to leave to the Commission on Education the question of deciding on the school leaving age and other problems of that nature at the moment.  I am not competent to judge as I have given no thought or examination to the question of the marriage ban but I have no doubt that that decision was not arrived at without due consideration and I can see very good reasons why such a ban <Col N="1742" /> is imposed.  There may of course be reasons why it might be set aside and I will examine that problem but I do not know if there is anything I can do about it.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe in doing things for themselves and in getting people to accept responsibilities for themselves and I cannot understand Deputy Mrs. Rice's deep concern and the deep concern of the other Deputies about the grants for heating, cleaning and maintenance of schools.  There should be some local responsibility. There is a very big grant, almost I suppose 90 per cent. grant, for the building of schools.  Surely if the people of the country had some concern or regard for education they would in their local parishes make some attempt to provide a fund for the cleaning, heating and maintenance of their schools.  Muintir na Tíre get up and collect funds; Macra na Feirme get up and collect funds; even Fine Gael in my parish can get a little money.</P>

      <P>I cannot see for a moment why there could not be local committees concerned for the children, for education and for the state of the schools, who could without trouble get the little money sufficient to provide for cleaning, lighting, heating and sanitation. I see no trouble of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham spoke about the need for drastic changes.  That is probably true.  I could suggest very drastic changes here in the Dáil, but it is not so wise, I think, as only fools rush in where angels fear to tread.  An unlettered, inexperienced man like me should not be allowed to set aside the years of experience which guide the officials of the Department of Education in their work to-day.  The best a Minister can do is to bring what experience he has, what knowledge he has, and what energy he has, to bear on every problem that comes up before him, and where he decides after examination that a certain thing is wrong or that another thing should be done, to insist upon that change against all opposition.  If it came, however, to making immediate drastic <Col N="1743" /> changes in methods which at some time must have proved their worth even though they may be outmoded now, changes against the weight of the experience of men who have been in the Department for years, I think that the new Minister would be most foolish to do so.</P>
    <P>I am interested in Deputy Dillon.  I confess to being deaf; I never can hear him; he has so many inflexions that at one time he is up at the roof, and at the next moment he is in the cellarage.  Everything that Deputy Dillon inspects seems to develop some scent of corruption.  Irish is the source of corruption at the moment, according to Deputy Dillon.  Never have so much courage, so much sacrifice, so much decency and so much public spirit been associated with any problem in Ireland as with the Irish language and its revival.  Deputy Dillon senses corruption in the idea that a man is asked before the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission if he is qualified in Irish, particularly for a position in the Gaeltacht.  But there is no corruption on the part of Deputy Dillon in offering a bribe to a boy at a primary school&mdash;the bribe of a scholarship to a secondary school, and there is no corruption in offering the bribe of a scholarship from a secondary school to a university, and the bribe of a scholarship from a university to a postgraduate course.  Is he not offering the same incentive to a boy in a primary school as that which is being offered to medical men who desire posts in the Gaeltacht, that they must be specially qualified in Irish?</P>
    <P>What corruption is that?  I think that Deputy Dillon is ridiculous.  Mind you, there is, possibly, something to be said for an expansion of scholarships along the line which Deputy Dillon mentions.  Such an idea may eventually show good results.  It is something that might reasonably be examined and put into operation. However, I do not agree with this idea of equal opportunities for all, the pursuit of happiness, and so forth.  You cannot give equal opportunities to everybody.  It is impossible to give to me the opportunities available to a <Col N="1744" /> man of Deputy Dunne's stature.  You might give me opportunities along a certain line that would be valuable to me and that would be of no use to another man.  Give me an opportunity of running a good and well-financed publichouse in Dublin City and I would go broke in 12 months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan spoke of junior assistant mistresses and two grades of salaries.  I do not know anything about that but I believe that if such a position exists there must be some sound and defensible reason for it.  It would be very strange to me if, by edict of the Department of Education, one man producing the same amount of work, under the same conditions, as another should be paid much less than the other man.  Of course, it is a point worth mentioning and I shall look into it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan also spoke about industrial schools.  I am always sorry for those children whom I see in industrial schools or orphanages.  I think it is a very definite drawback that they should not be reared in their own homes.  It would be with great reluctance that I should consent to parting children from their parents but there are occasions when it must be done&mdash; to be orphaned is one and some kind of delinquency is another.  It is undesirable but it is unavoidable sometimes and we shall try to keep it down to the smallest proportions possible. One thing we should ensure, as Deputy Cowan says, is that cruelty in an industrial school shall not be substituted for cruelty in the home.  However, we should not make swift or rash judgments in regard to that matter.  Many of these children who have been confined are not normal children.  They are difficult to deal with and sometimes there must be restrictions placed upon them for their own good.  I dislike the idea of children being taken from their own homes and I should consent to it only as a last resort.  I think we must develop as much as we can curative treatment in the homes of these children rather than develop any system of punishments and hope for good from it.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people are affected by statements made without due consideration or knowledge.  A few years ago <Col N="1745" /> the late Father Flanagan was over here from America.  He had built up a great name for himself in America with regard to boys' homes.  When he went back, he spoke to some journalists of the yellow Press and an article was published in American papers on the subject of the cruelty exercised towards boys in industrial schools in this country.  There was not a shadow of truth in the charges made by these journalists.  Father Flanagan had not visited the schools here or seen what went on in them.  I know of one school here in Ireland&mdash;and good and all as it is I should prefer to see the children at home&mdash;and I would challenge any country in the world to produce better.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Rooney in regard to the provision of technical training in primary schools.  Technical training is a matter for technical schools.  If I have any ideas at all in regard to primary education it is that the narrower the curriculum the better. I think it would be a very good thing if children in the primary schools could be taught to read intelligently.  I think it would be a very good thing if there were a school library in every school, where the children could be enthused by reading.  In that way I believe you would build more into their characters and make them more effective in other matters in after life than by giving them into their small hands any technical training whatsoever.  Try to build their character; give them a little wisdom through reading and try to give them a desire for further reading when they leave school.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about university scholarships.  I know any amount of university graduates and their intellectual pabulum now, having left the university, is a shilling <i>Buffalo Bill.</i>  I hope the primary schools in the future will produce better than that.</P>
    <P>With regard to teachers' salaries, may I say that history has affected the standing and salary of the teachers. However, I think that we in Ireland can compare favourably in regard to the payment of teachers with any other country in the world.  I want to promote all the goodwill I can between the Department of Education and the <Col N="1746" /> teachers.  I want such content amongst the teachers that they will be concerned with teaching rather than with salaries.</P>
    <P>The point was made a while ago that the salaries of English teachers are altogether superior to the salaries of Irish teachers.  The impact of the income-tax in England as compared with here makes very little between the salaries of Irish teachers and the salaries of English teachers and, if what I heard is correct, if there is any advantage it is with the Irish teachers. The salary looks very well until you know what deductions are made from it and as between England and Ireland it is with the net salary we must concern ourselves.</P>
    <P>I understand that some Deputy intends to raise on the adjournment the question of the use of the national flag in the schools.  I appreciate the value of true patriotism but, if it is to be inculcated in the schools, it must be done through the teaching of history. Without any knowledge of teaching, I am of the impression that until you reach the more senior grades in the primary schools it is quite impossible to teach history.  In the junior grades, first of all, children must be taught the tools they are to use and the equipment of which they will subsequently make use.  Until children can read with appreciation the books given to them, there is very little use in trying to teach them history.  It is a long and a difficult and an arduous task to get from small children an appreciation of concrete facts.  Teaching children abstracts is a much more difficult task. To teach them the meaning of a national symbol and an appreciation of it they must be taught the history associated with it; they must be taught the lives of the men, the events, the sacrifices and the nobilities that go with it.  Because of that, I think it would become a task and a chore rather than something which people could approach with enthusiasm if it were decided to have a daily flagraising in the primary schools.  I do not believe it would be useful but anything I can do I will do, and any suggestion that may be made to me which might induce a greater love and appreciation <Col N="1747" /> of their country in our children will meet with my approval.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the action of the Ceann Comhairle in refusing to afford to Deputies who desired to speak on Motions 7 and 8 on the Order Paper of Dáil Éireann on July 4th, 1951, the opportunity of speaking was a grave infringement of the rights of Deputies, which if adopted as a precedent would tend to bring Parliament into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the world in which we live it should be a matter of pride to all of us that we are members of a free Parliament. The individual liberty of every citizen of this State depends on the continued functioning of Oireachtas Éireann as a free Parliament.  The continued functioning <Col N="1750" /> of Oireachtas Éireann as a free Parliament ultimately depends on the sacrosanct right of the humblest and most isolated Deputy whom our people choose to elect by their votes to speak and be present here in Dáil Éireann. All over Europe free Parliaments are being destroyed and I submit to this House now that the issue I here raise transcends Parties and individual likes and dislikes, for if we look abroad upon the world and watch the murder of free Parliaments in other countries we shall find a uniform pattern: that the process of assassination invariably is begun by elected members of a Parliament combining to deny one member his parliamentary privilege of one kind or another.  In Ireland the only real privilege a member of Parliament enjoys is to speak and to be heard.  In every case where the members of a legislature have been tricked into consenting to the deprivation, in the case of one of their number, of rights the use of which caused them irritation, the subsequent unfolding of history has to tell that the precedent then established has been quickly used by a dwindling majority to destroy a growing but impotent minority until eventually the voice of the minority is heard no more.</P>
    <P>On the 4th July, Sir, two distinct resolutions appeared on the Order Paper of this House.  One resolution, No. 7, stood in the name of the Taoiseach and proposed the election of a Fianna Fáil Deputy to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Another wholly distinct and separate motion appeared on the Order Paper as No. 8, in no sense an amendment to No. 7, in no sense dependent on No. 7, proposing the election of Deputy Alfred Byrne to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  That motion stood in the name of two Independent Deputies. The Taoiseach moved his motion. Deputy Fagan moved the motion in his name and that was seconded by Deputy Flanagan.  Then Deputy Cowan and some others intervened.  There then transpired one of those events which cause those who know the Taoiseach well to wonder how he manages so successfully to maintain an exterior of undeviating honesty and simple good faith until one remembers that he has read, not without <Col N="1751" /> profit, as his manual of politics, <i>The Prince,</i> by Machiavelli, which once established the rule not to bother about what one really is but to be solicitous about what one appears to be.</P>
    <P>I was in this House when the Taoiseach offered himself a second time to the Chair to be afforded an opportunity to speak.  Several other Deputies were here.  I have been 20 years a member of this House and in all that time I have never seen the Leader of the House, from whatever Party he was drawn, rising to speak and any Deputy from another side of the House claiming to be heard before him.  So it was on July 4th.  When the Taoiseach rose, no other Deputy pressed his claim to be seen or called until the Taoiseach had finished what he wanted to say.  As I heard the Taoiseach and as others heard him&mdash; I refer to Volume 126, No. 6&mdash;he rose in his place, unbidden by anybody, to say: &ldquo;May I say a few words&rdquo;, and then went on: &ldquo;First of all, this is not a question of penalties or comparisons.&rdquo; Now I have not sat opposite the Taoiseach, and Deputy de Valera as he was for three years, for 20 long years for nothing.  The moment the division concluded that ensued on the resolution subsequently moved by him, and which excluded me from the service of this House, I went to the editor of debates of this House and claimed to see the typescript of the report of what had transpired.  I took the precaution of saying: &ldquo;Observe the Taoiseach's opening words were: &lsquo;May I say a few words?&rsquo;&rdquo; I then scanned my own contribution to the proceedings and went my way.</P>
    <P>Three days later the Official Draft Report was circulated and this is what is circulated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Taoiseach: May I say a few words in reply to some things that have been said?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the whole issue joined in this House was the question as to whether the Taoiseach, when he rose on that occasion to speak, was being called on to conclude the debate which is the ordinary parliamentary terminology for replying to the arguments <Col N="1752" /> advanced by those opposed to the motion which he had moved.</P>
    <P>The whole basis on which the Ceann Comhairle on that occasion refused to hear me, refused to hear Deputy MacBride when he rose to a point of order, directed the Leader of the Labour Party to sit down when he rose to a point of order, and said that he would hear nobody, that &ldquo;The Taoiseach is concluding the debate on this motion&rdquo; (column 806), was that the Taoiseach was known by all Deputies in the House to have been replying to the case made against the proposal he brought forward.  The record of the official notetaker, the recollection of the Deputies who listened to him, was that he said: &ldquo;May I say a few words&rdquo;.  This dramatic fact emerges that when this hardy old practitioner himself read the typescript of the report he was constrained to admit to himself on that record: The Ceann Comhairle could not be right, and I cannot sustain the claim I made to be concluding the debate, for he made that claim when it was proposed to him that he should conclude.  At column 837:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Taoiseach: I did not intervene in the debate.  I was called on by the Chair.</P>
    <P>General Mulcahy: You were not.</P>
    <P>Mr. Seán Collins: You rose and asked permission to say a few words.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was the old practitioner daunted by the typescript?  Was he dismayed by the testimony of several Deputies that they heard what he had said?  Was he confounded by the fact that every independent witness confirmed the other?  Not a bit of it.  If the words were not there he would put them there, and in his own office he sharpened his pen and he inserted in the typescript, or had them inserted by his staff, the words: &ldquo;In reply to some things that have been said.&rdquo;  This report is published with those words inserted.  If the Taoiseach reiterates that he said them, that his voice fell and no one heard them but himself, his position as Leader of this House entitles him to the courtesy of an acquittal of speaking what is not true. <Col N="1753" /> He is the Leader of this House.  He is the Head of the Irish Government.  I ask him now to tell the House, on his word of honour when he comes to speak, did he utter those words, or did he, in retrospect, regret that he did not utter them and think it wise to put them in.  Did he hope he would not get caught and now that he is caught, what does he propose to do? That is not the pith and essence of this matter.  That is the typescript without the words.  That is the printed version with them.  That typescript has been checked officially with the notetaker's shorthand note and that note confirms the typescript, but there are the words for all to see.  I know their source, not the official notetaker but the Taoiseach's Secretary. I am concerned, Sir, to defend something much more important to this country than the Taoiseach's veracity or lack of it.  I refer the House to column 837 at which I am reported as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On a point of order.  I confidently trust in you, Sir, to reserve my right to speak on the motion proposed by Deputy Fagan and seconded by Deputy Oliver Flanagan, and lest you might be under any misapprehension through my failure, for want of agility, I should like to say that I desire to contribute to the debate and be seen as soon as your convenience will permit.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: The Chair called on the Taoiseach to conclude the debate.</P>
    <P>General Mulcahy: Nobody heard you say that, Sir.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: There is no need for the Chair to say definitely, &lsquo;The Taoiseach to conclude.&rsquo; The Taoiseach, as the mover of the motion, rose when no other Deputy offered himself to make a contribution to the debate.  I definitely rule the Taoiseach as concluding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Several other Deputies intervened.  I now refer the House to column 840.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On a point of order.  I am an Independent Deputy and I have as much right to be heard in this House <Col N="1754" /> as any member of the Government. A motion has been made by Deputy Fagan, an Independent Deputy.  It has been seconded by Deputy Oliver Flanagan, an Independent Deputy. Common courtesy demands that, if the Taoiseach rises in this House and seeks to catch the Ceann Comhairle's eye, Deputies will naturally give way. I am claiming my right to intervene in the debate on the motion moved by Deputy Fagan and seconded by Deputy Oliver Flanagan and I look to you, Sir, to protect that right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle then proceeded to rule and ended his ruling with the words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am now ruling definitely that the Taoiseach is concluding the debate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As reported in column 840, the Ceann Comhairle said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Chair has already indicated that what will happen on this motion will rule whether or not there will be any motion before the House.  I am putting the motion now.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: What motion?</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: The motion in the name of the Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On a point of order I submitted, as reported in column 841:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is one of the few remaining Legislatures in the world where individual Deputies' rights are recognised. I respectfully submit that I have as sacrosanct a right as any other Deputy to intervene in an orderly way in the debate on the motion before the House.  I am asking that right now.  I want to intervene within the strict rules of order in the debate which has been proceeding in my presence during the last quarter of an hour on the motion of Deputy Fagan and Deputy Oliver Flanagan.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: The Deputy should have offered himself before the Chair called on the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I want respectfully to submit that no Deputy of 20 years' experience of this House, such as I have, could ever imagine that the Taoiseach would be called upon to <Col N="1755" /> wind up on the motion of Deputy Fagan.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: Deputy Fagan can reply on his own motion.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I want to intervene on this motion before Deputy Fagan concludes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I ask Deputies calmly to listen to this ruling:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An Ceann Comhairle: The Chair cannot help that.  The Chair is calling on Deputy Fagan and on no other Deputy.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I am asking the Chair to allow me to intervene.  Will the Chair accept a motion for the adjournment of the House?</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: I will not. Deputy Fagan to conclude on his own motion.</P>
    <P>General Mulcahy: The Taoiseach tricked the House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: That is an untruth. It would take a Deputy Mulcahy to make that statement.</P>
    <P>Mr. O. Flanagan: I will ask you to take a motion to adjourn the House.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: Deputy Fagan to conclude on his own motion.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I have offered myself twice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: If Deputy Dillon persists I will have to ask him to leave the House.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: For asking to exercise my right to speak.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: If Deputy Dillon persists I will have to ask him to leave the House.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: The right of an Independent Deputy to speak in this House is a stabiliser of liberty in this country.  I claim that right under those Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: I have told Deputy Dillon that if he offered himself before I called on the Taoiseach I would have freely and willingly called on him.  I cannot allow him to say that the Chair has been partial. Deputy Dillon will resume his seat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> Mr. Dillon: I asked leave to intervene on the motion moved by Deputy Fagan and seconded by Deputy Flanagan, and I asked you to see and to hear me before your attention was drawn by Deputy Fagan.  I now ask my right to intervene in that discussion.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: I am asking Deputy Fagan to conclude now, and I will hear no further points of order.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I demand my right to be heard.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: Deputy Dillon has his remedy if he thinks my ruling is incorrect.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I respectfully submit that my remedy is to stand here and claim to be heard.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: I will have to ask the Deputy to leave the House.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: If the Ceann Comhairle considers that I have no claim to be heard in Dáil Éireann after 20 years' service here, then I must insist on my rights.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: I regret that I have to name Deputy Dillon for disobeying the ruling of the Chair.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I intend to stand my ground, and I claim my rights.</P>
    <P>Mr. Norton: On a point of order.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: There is no point of order.  Deputy Norton will resume his seat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride, the Leader of Clann na Poblachta, rose.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An Ceann Comhairle: Deputy MacBride will resume his seat.  There are no points of order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then intervened and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is my duty, as Deputy Dillon has been named, to move that he be suspended from the service of the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to pause and ask themselves this question: Is it an affront to the dignity of this House, to its Ceann Comhairle or to its Standing Orders for a Deputy to ask leave to speak and to be heard while a debate is in progress?  I readily <Col N="1757" /> concede, I go further and I affirm, that, if Parliament is to be carried on with the dignity it is entitled to demand of its members, if a Deputy finds himself in conflict with the Chair on a very grave matter, in 90 per cent. of cases his clear duty is to give way and, as the Ceann Comhairle suggested, to avail of another occasion to take the classic remedy of moving the motion I now move.  But I want to submit to my colleagues in this House, wherever they sit, that to that general principle there is one exception, and that is an attempt on the part of the Ceann Comhairle of the majority, of the minority, of the whole House, to deny one Deputy his right to speak, and that there is no appropriate means of resisting that challenge but to stand where the Irish people sent you to stand and to speak so long as you can make yourself heard.  I believe that as sincerely as I believe anything.  If that right is successfully challenged, it is a fraud and a delusion and, what is worse, a snare to our people for any Deputy to come to this House in their name and pretend that he is a Deputy of a free Parliament, because he is not; and he is contributing to the fraudulent pretence before our people that they have free institutions when they have ceased to have them.</P>
    <P>I said often in this House that the test of a democratic Government is not the size of its majority but the solicitude with which it concerns itself for the rights of the minority.  It does not matter how great a majority a Government has; if it uses it to rob its fellow-citizens of their fundamental rights it is the most loathsome kind of dictatorship.  I am appealing from Governments and officers of this House to the supreme civil power in Ireland, to Parliament itself, to join hands with me in defence of our rights, and when I say &ldquo;our rights&rdquo; I mean the rights of all our people to be free because that right is enshrined and sanctified by us, the people's representatives, being free in the people's Parliament.</P>
    <P>If I fail to make my colleagues see that what is at issue here is not whether one Deputy shall be silenced, it is not whether that which is unpopular <Col N="1758" /> shall go unspoken, but what is in issue here is, ultimately, will we keep our people free, if I fail to persuade my colleagues in this House, on every side of it, I fail in perhaps, the most important assignment I ever undertook?</P>
    <P>I want no traverse.  I have excluded from the motion I placed upon the Paper words which appear in the only two precedents our records have to show.  A motion in these terms was moved by Deputy Fahy, in 1930, before he became Ceann Comhairle, when Deputy Michael Hayes was Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil.  A motion in similar terms was moved by the late Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan in 1935, when Deputy Fahy was Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil.  In both those motions care was taken, while deprecating the events, to condemn the Ceann Comhairle for deliberate misfeasance. I am ready to concede at once that in the early stages of the new Dáil confusion may sometimes arise-misunderstanding.  One word may borrow another until eventually an impasse is reached and things transpire which we all regret.  I do not give a farthing for my own person in this matter.  I do not deny that I so love and revere our parliamentary institutions that it is an affront to me, one I bitterly resent, to be declared by resolution of this House excluded from its proceedings.  But, that is trivial compared to the importance of ensuring that what transpired on that day will not be established as a precedent to filch away the fundamental rights of all of us hereafter.</P>
    <P>I want the House, if needs be, passing judgement on no one and leaving judgments just or unjust on the record, to say clearly that that is not a precedent this House accepts; that whatever transpired from those events are of the past but have no part in the future of this free Parliament.  Say that and all that matters fundamentally is done, but fail to say it and July 4th will become a day of as evil memory in this Republic as it is glorious in another.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the mind that sought to change the record of this House in a fundamental way, surreptitiously. <Col N="1759" /> Perhaps others do.  I am not concerned to understand it, to justify it or to condemn it.  I am only concerned for one thing and that is that Dáil Éireann shall say now that no one but Dáil Éireann has the right to limit free debates in our Parliament, that no officer of this House, no Party in this House, no individual group or majority, though it be 145 to one, shall take from a member of this House the right our people gave him to speak and to be heard on their behalf in their Parliament. It is the foundation stone, it is the keystone, it is the cornerstone of the freedom of us all.  I urge my colleagues to forget the personality of every individual involved in this matter and to achieve the miracle of unanimity for this most fundamental principle of freedom.</P>

      <P>I also feel that to-night in dealing with this motion the House must endeavour to divorce it from personalities and to grasp at what is fundamental and what is the real issue that is at stake.  We have heard in this House on many occasions Deputy Dillon in a different mood, but I think any Deputy divorcing his mind to-night from the structure of Party, from the relentless crack of a Party whip, facing, as he must face, his responsibility as a protector of the fundamental principles of liberty embodied in our Constitution, embodied in this free parliamentary institution, must consider whether or not, whether in error, whether in misconception, whether in stupidity, whether in any way whatever it be, there has been a transgression of the fundamental liberty of an individual Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 4th July, I, too, concerned myself with challenging, as I was entitled as a Deputy to challenge, the correctness of certain rulings given by the Ceann Comhairle. I challenged them then in the spirit in which I now speak on this motion because I felt that the Ceann Comhairle <Col N="1760" /> in his rulings was unwittingly limiting the rights of an individual Deputy.  In pursuit of that argument, it became quite clear on the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle himself that, at least, one motion at issue before the House was not, in fact, concluded.  I took the line in my argument that, once the Ceann Comhairle had indicated that he was going to call upon Deputy Fagan to reply on motion No. 8, the motion was still under open discussion in this House, and as such that any individual Deputy, making the demand as he was entitled to make, the demand to speak, should have been heard.</P>
    <P>This is something that is far from the ken of Party politics.  This is something that is fundamental and sacred to the very foundations of the Parliament that we have the privilege to be members of.  This is an issue that is one of the toughest, one of the most far-reaching, that we Deputies in this House, be we young, new or old in the service of this House, will have to face, because it is quite certain that, for whatever reason it may have occurred, there is a background to this whole incident which brings a sinister light and an unwelcome sinister air into the conduct of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is now common case, it is now an admitted fact, that changes were made, at somebody's behest, in the Official Records of this House.  It is also common case that, in those circumstances, the changes put a twist on reality that might have suited a certain purpose. That is undemocratic; it is unprincipled, and it certainly is not worthy of the glorious tradition of sacrifices, continuing sacrifices, which ultimately gave us free institutions, and gave to us who sit in the seats of this House, the privilege of membership of the 14th Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am not anxious to criticise in any way individuals or individual action. I want the House to take into perspective what is the principle involved.  The principle involved is undeniably and unquestionably the deliberate negation by a majority in this House of the fundamental right given to a Deputy to speak in this House within the rules of order.  I feel that in this issue we have no personality but something that is <Col N="1761" /> greater, and that, if we have the courage to do it, we can to-day ensure that it will live longer than personality or anything else.  We can, by our action, in calm deliberation and appreciating the full value of our own parliamentary institutions, strike a blow to-day to ensure that never again &mdash;and certainly to deny for all time&mdash; can such a precedent go on the records of this House as the one that must go on the records of this House if the regrettable, unfortunate and unnecessary, as I submit to the House, action of the 4th July had not taken place.</P>
    <P>I am going to give credit, I hope not unwisely, to the Taoiseach for being a man big enough, and if his record is to stand for anything he must be a man big enough in his record of service to this State to come into this House now as Leader of the Government and say: &ldquo;No matter what may have happended on 4th July, I, the Taoiseach and Leader of this Government, standing true to the principles of liberty for this Parliament, wholeheartedly agree that this should not ever be considered as a precedent in this House.&rdquo;  I am going to give credit, as I say, I hope not unwisely, to the Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, for being man enough to regret&mdash;whether it was accidental, deliberate or anything else is not the issue&mdash;his unfortunate intervention which caused a situation that should not have arisen, a situation that, I believe, he was anxious, in the heat of the moment even, to avert.  But, unfortunately, even the Taoiseach suffered the fate of other Deputies who wished to intervene, as I submit they were entitled to, to submit to the Chair what they considered to be points of order, but, as I say, even the Taoiseach was not afforded the opportunity to say any more.  I make this earnest appeal to the House, no matter what the circumstances were, and no matter how heated the issue may have been at the time: Let us forget all that, let us erase, if we can, the background to the trouble that arose.  We can do it effectively and do it really well in this House to-night by having the courage, as a united Parliament and with no castigation of any individual and with no <Col N="1762" /> sustained imputation against any individual member of this House, to ensure that no bad precedent will be created.</P>
    <P>I argued in this House on the 4th July that there were two separate issues, moved in accordance with Standing Orders and in the correct way. I said then what, unfortunately, subsequently transpired to be too true, that unwittingly maybe, and unconsciously, it could be imputed to the ruling which the Ceann Comhairle then proposed to give, that there was no impartiality in the action.  I am so jealous in my belief in the fundamental principles of our own Parliament that I was anxious to protect the custodian of our liberty from unwittingly falling into error.  I did that in a consciousness of the full value of the real worth of a free Irish Parliament, and it is in that consciousness that I speak on this motion to-night, not in any way to join issue on personalities or to revive ill-feelings.</P>
    <P>What happened on 4th July has happened, but what can happen if courage, if sincerity and if an appreciation of the duty owed by and expected of each Deputy by the people of this country to their own free institutions, can have its voice here to-night is that we can undo by one small act all the harm that has been done and can face the country to-morrow, knowing that a united and unanimous Dáil had rebuked itself honestly and manfully for being careless in the custody of liberties which we were sent here to guard jealously.</P>
    <P>That is the issue.  Whether or not records were changed, whether or not an effort was made to prejudice this issue before it started, is of no consequences when one faces the real issue. The ordinary Deputy, by virtue of the wishes and votes of the people who sent him to this House, has the right, the sacrosanct and undeniable right, to voice freely, within the Rules of Order, all that he can on their behalf.  I feel that on the occasion of the 4th July, not one part alone but maybe on both sides of this House, and, with due respect, possibly on the part of the Ceann Comhairle himself, stubborness and obstinacy and clash of personalities, <Col N="1763" /> often so volatile and sudden here, induced us, unconsciously and unwittingly, I hope, to start a trend which may make for the ultimate enslavement of us all, if we were in any way by our acts to allow the untrammelled liberty of which we in the Republic of Ireland and in our Parliament are amongst the last custodians, to be either filched or taken away from us deliberately.  My appeal to the House is this: let us be united on one thing&mdash;not in censure of any individual or person in this House but on the principle that, no matter what our Party differences may be, we are jealous and fearless custodians of that liberty which has been so dearly and hardly won.</P>

      <P>I feel that there is a certain air of artificiality and unreality about this debate.  I was present in the House when the incident which gave rise to this motion and discussion took place, and there did not appear to me to be any difference in the procedure from the procedure I was accustomed to during the period for which I have been a member of this House.  We had a motion and an amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>These two motions were before the House.  One motion proposed to appoint Deputy Breslin as Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the other proposed to appoint Deputy Alfred Byrne as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I looked on them, as I think anyone with any experience of procedure not only in the House but outside it would look on them, as a motion and an amendment. The motion was proposed by the Taoiseach; it was seconded; and we had a certain discussion.  I took part in that discussion and subsequently the Taoiseach spoke, and obviously, as the person who proposed the motion, when he got up to speak he was closing the debate.  The Chair so ruled.  It was an extraordinary thing that nobody seemed anxious to get in on that debate, until the Taoiseach had spoken the second time.  He made some telling points in answer to the debate and it was those <Col N="1764" /> telling points which compelled or influenced Deputies of the Opposition to desire then to participate in the discussion.</P>
      <P>We have had a lot of talk about liberty and sentiments in regard to liberty have been expressed here which are ideal sentiments and which certainly would be worthy of a much better motion and occasion.  I have always heard it said that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty and if any Deputy was sufficiently vigilant to stand up to participate in the discussion, he would have have been called before the Taoiseach was called upon to conclude.</P>

      <P>If, as I say, any Deputy was sufficiently vigilant, sufficiently concerned about his rights, sufficiently anxious to speak, he would have stood up, would have been seen by the Chair and would have been called upon to speak.  No Deputy offered himself and the Taoiseach, as mover of the motion, stood up, was called upon by the Chair and, when he had spoken, under the rules of order of this House, the debate was then concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no interference, good, bad or indifferent, with the right of any Deputy by the Chair on that occasion.  Deputy Dillon feeling he was right in maintaining a particular position, was named by the Chair and was suspended by order of the House for the short period of a week.  That is of no importance at all, as Deputy Dillon admits, so far as the discussion is concerned.  The motion suggests that there was some partiality on the part of the Chair.  If Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy was deprived of the right to speak, he was deprived of that right under the Standing Orders of this House which were made by this House and which were put into operation by the Ceann Comhairle appointed for that particular purpose by the unanimous vote of the House.  I think that when a Deputy is not sufficiently vigilant to stand up to participate in the debate, <Col N="1765" /> he has no right to feel aggrieved, has no right to condemn the Chair and has no right, at the end of a session such as this, to take up two hours of public time in drawing attention to what occurred on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I am as concerned as any individual for the rights of Deputies.  Since I came in here, I have never been denied any right of a Deputy by any chairman or acting-chairman in the House.  It is my duty as a Deputy to defend my own rights, and I will always do that when the occasion arises.  But if I am slow in getting up, if I miss my opportunity, I have no right to make an attack on the Chair or on other Deputies who are endeavouring to run the business in accordance with the Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that this debate has taken place.  I am sorry that it has brought forth sentiments that would be excellent if they were expressed at the right time or in the right place.  But this is neither the time nor the place for the expression of particular sentiments, as no Deputy was deprived of any right in the debate that took place here on the 4th July.</P>
      <P>I wanted, a Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, to say those words I said in the beginning, that the debate was artificial and unreal.  What purpose is sought to be served by it I do not know.  The rights of the Chair are important: the rights of individual Deputies are important. When the Chair is acting in accordance with Standing Orders of this House, it is the duty of every Deputy to support the Chair.  I felt that there was something wrong when the division took place, when certain Deputies belonging to small Parties voted against the Chair, the Chair that was endeavouring to do its duty to run the business in accordance with the Standing Orders, and to protect the rights and liberties of all the Deputies of the House.</P>

      <P>We have heard a great deal about liberty this evening, but there has been no attempt whatever to bring these general expressions down to the concrete facts with which we are dealing.  On the occasion regarding which the ruling of the Chair is questioned, the House was dealing with two motions.  One was in the name of the Taoiseach and the other that of a private Deputy.  Both motions were spoken to at the same time.  From my experience in the House, when two motions of that sort come up they can be dealt with in either of two ways.  One is to treat them as completely separate motions: the other is to deal with them as if they were related motions, related somewhat as a motion and an amendment would be.  In that case, they are both discussed together and the invariable rule when that happens has been that the mover of the original motion, the first motion, is given the right to conclude.  I have never seen that departed from, in all my time.</P>

My only anxiety when standing on my feet was whether I would be permitted by the Chair to reply to these matters which the Chair had been contesting as not being relevant.  I had no need whatever to intervene.  On this question of courtesy shown to me or shown to the Taoiseach, I have had experience of it both ways; and I know that some members of the Opposition, if they wanted to gain any point, would show scant courtesy, very scant courtesy, to me whether as a private Deputy or as Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Because it pleased me to exercise my discretion as I have done many times before.  Do you think that if I wanted to change it I would have done so to give an opportunity to Deputy' Dillon or somebody like that, who would be only too glad to get off on a side track? If I wanted to play that sort of game I would never have done it that way, and many people would think that I would be wiser not to in view of the situation.  The fact is, it did not alter the substance, and that was the view of two independent witnesses, two independent judges.  The Editor of Debates, apparently, looking at that, did not think so.  So the Ceann Comhairle says this morning.  The Editor of Debates did not think that it constituted any substantial change.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fortunate in all this suggestion of collusion, because that is what it means in the long run, collusion between me and the Ceann Comhairle, that we are in the position anyway that we do not belong to the one Party, and it is fortunate that it should have arisen in a case of that kind.  We do not belong to the same Party.  The Ceann Comhairle owes nothing to us for his election.  It is true that we accepted the nomination.  He was nominated by the present Opposition. who were then the Government for the moment.  He was nominated by the Government.  He was accepted by us. He had been acting as Leas-Cheann Comhairle for a considerable period. He had the qualifications as far as Irish, which we have uniformly insisted upon.  Therefore, this question of supposed collusion has no basis for it.  The whole way through this thing there has been a suggestion of collusion.  The whole business could never have arisen. There must have been collusion <Col N="1770" /> between me standing up and the Ceann Comhairle replying.  Every bit of this thing can stand on the one basis only&mdash; the deliberate collusion between the Ceann Comhairle and myself.</P>

      <P>Why do we revise speeches?  We revise them in order that they may more accurately express our thought, provided we do not introduce anything which is substantially different from what we said.  I deny there was anything substantially different from what I said in the words I inserted.  As I said when I stood up if there was any meaning to the words I had used the only meaning I would have was the interrogatory address to the Chair as if he made a reply to the things I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get back to the Chair because this is not a motion censuring the Taoiseach but it is a motion censuring the Chair.  This is a motion censuring the Chair for depriving, it is said, individual Deputies of their liberty. There is such a thing as genuine liberty and there is anarchy which is licence.  You cannot carry on a State or a Parliament unless you have laws <Col N="1771" /> and regulations to govern them.  The laws and regulations are contained in the book here which is the Standing Orders and in the precedents established by the House, and the practices established by the House over a long period of years.  The ruling of the Ceann Comhairle was strictly in accordance with the principle that no one should speak twice unless the person who is closing the debate.  There is a standing practice that when there are two motions considered in that way, one being regarded more or less as an amendment to the other, it is the mover of the prime motion, the first motion, who replies.  That is the rule and invariable practice.</P>
    <P>As for Deputies not getting in time to their feet, I have had more than once on an occasion like that to be told that somebody was concluding and that I would not be permitted to speak. That is not a new experience for members in the House, and when other members are told that they accept the ruling.  But certain Deputies, such as Deputy Dillon, want to be a law unto themselves.  They want liberty for themselves at every other person's expense. That is the thing the Standing Orders are designed to prevent.  They are designed to give ordered liberty and to prevent a situation of anarchy and that was what was being led to here.</P>
    <P>There was a second possibility in dealing with the case of these two motions and that was to take them separately.  If they were taken as separate motions, then the first motion was going to be decided first and the debate on it would come to a close.  In that case, I was entitled to reply.  If that motion had been defeated there could have been either a continued discussion or a simple vote on the second. If there was a continued discussion, if the first motion had been defeated, then there would be a reason either for others intervening or for replying to the second motion.  The practice has been when the two are dealt with together there may be separate votes, but in that case it was quite clear that the success of the first motion would have defeated the possibility of bringing <Col N="1772" /> up the second at all.  The Chair referred to that during the period when a point of order was being raised.</P>
    <P>I think that this motion is altogether unjustified.  I do not believe that it would have been brought forward by anybody except by Deputy Dillon, that any other Deputy would have had the audacity to do it because it was so strictly in accordance with the precedents already established in this House.  What we have to determine is whether we are to have order here with the Ceann Comhairle in a position to enforce the rules of order, either the rules that are expressed in the Book of Standing Orders or the rules that have been&mdash;to use Deputy Dillon's word&mdash;sacrosanct by usage over a long period.  I am satisfied that the Chair, in deciding as it did, decided in accordance with precedent, and I certainly am going to vote for the preservation of the authority of the Chair as being absolutely necessary if we are going to have real freedom in this Parliament.  Otherwise we will not have a Parliament at all; everybody will be a law unto himself; everybody will speak when he feels he has the right to speak.  Deputy Dillon told the younger members the way they were to learn the rules of order; it was by breaking them.  If anyone should know the rules of order by heart it is Deputy Dillon because he has broken so many of them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Captain Cowan has referred the House to his experiences in this House, and recalling all that happened on the 4th July when dealing with the motion then before the House considered that it was in keeping with the practice of the House.  The Taoiseach has referred to the standard practices of the House in dealing with two motions and says that in cases where there are two motions of this kind before the House there are two ways of dealing with them; that one of these was that they could be discussed together&mdash;that was one of the alternatives; the invariable rule had been that when that happened the mover of the motion was given the right to conclude: &ldquo;I have never seen that departed from.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On July 4th we were discussing motions dealing with the election of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I challenge the Taoiseach or any Deputy of this House in relation to the business of the House in electing either a Ceann Comhairle or Taoiseach or Leas-Cheann Comhairle to point to a single instance in which that has happened.</P>
      <P>Between the dates, the 23rd June, 1927, and the 25th February, 1948, on 31 different occasions this House had to go through the process of selecting a Ceann Comhairle or a President of the Executive Council or Taoiseach or a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and in no single instance where the motions were discussed in the way in which they were discussed on Thursday was there any formal conclusion to the debate. The debate stopped and the question was put.  On one occasion, the 2nd February, 1930, there were three proposals, and on that occasion, that occasion alone, the three proposals were taken separately.  Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly proposed Eamon de Valera and a discussion took place contributed to by seven persons, and Deputy O'Kelly concluded the discussion on that motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was defeated.  Deputy Morrissey proposed that Deputy O'Connell be made Taoiseach and that was again discussed and nine Deputies took part in that discussion and Deputy Morrissey concluded that discussion.  Deputy <Col N="1774" /> Mongan proposed Deputy Cosgrave and was seconded by Deputy Davis and that came to a conclusion without anybody formally winding up the debate. On every of the 31 occasions the debate came to a stop and the motion was put. That is the invariable practice of this House when dealing with matters affecting the election of officers.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to the debate that took place on the 4th July.  The Taoiseach in a short and formal statement moved that Cormac Breslin be appointed Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Deputy Fagan then proposed, again in a short and formal statement, Alfred Byrne and Deputy Flanagan supported that.  These were the proposers and seconders.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the circumstances in which the appointment was being made before we come to Deputy Captain Cowan's contribution to the debate.  A change of Government had taken place by virtue of the fact that a person who had occupied the Chair of this House for 19 years came down to the floor and voted for the Government that was appointed and those that are now the Opposition, fulfilling what they thought were their responsibilities to the House, provided it with a Ceann Comhairle and a member of the present Opposition was sent into the Chair.  The House was discussing the appointment of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle in these circumstances.  Considering what the circumstances were the restraint was very great and no one proposing either one or the other of the designatees made anything but a formal proposal of appointment.  Then Deputy Captain Cowan came along and he quoted principle.</P>
    <P>He provided a principle to support the Taoiseach in grasping his extra special pound of patronage and power: as the Ceann Comhairle was taken from one side of the House the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be taken from the other.  That was the first little note that tended to take the debate away from the formal and dignified presentation of the name of a Deputy for the occupancy of the Chair, It was inevitable that there would be some slight further reference to that, but the references were very mild, and the hesitancy to get into the debate <Col N="1775" /> that the Chair expresses itself as having found in the House, was because most people were prepared to have the House take a formal decision no matter how they might feel regarding the grasping hand of the Taoiseach and his Party in grasping the Vice-Chair as well as the Government, by the very simple process I referred to previously. There was hesitancy on the part of many of us who did not wish to get in. Then the Taoiseach did ask if he could say a few words, and with the precedents we have had before us back through the years, as the Taoiseach said, of 31 occasions upon which we went through a similar process, on every single one of 30 of these, where the motions were not taken as separate motions, those who wanted to make a contribution made the contribution, and there was no gathering up of the arguments or replying to any points. Proposals were made, and even though there were long discussions on some of them&mdash;and I could give the details of the people who opened the discussions and the people who wound up&mdash;the facts are, and they can easily be obtained by reference to the debate, that we were in the position of accepting that the debate would be conducted in the normal standard way, and that the precedents and practices of this House would be carried out.  We were naturally quite gracious in accepting the Taoiseach's desire that he wanted to say a few words.  But, in the saying of those few words, he went deliberately into those matters that were matters of very definite conflict and that, if there had not been restraint on the part of many people in the House when Deputy Cowan intervened, would have given rise, perhaps, to an undesirable and profitless debate.</P>
    <P>I did intervene when the Ceann Comhairle was telling the Taoiseach he was out of order in dealing with certain things.  When the Taoiseach had very definitely and positively brought out the points that many people were anxious not to bring out&mdash; and had put these in a challenging way before us&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle was ruling him out of order.  I naturally intervened to remind the <Col N="1776" /> Ceann Comhairle that after, as the Taoiseach had said everything that was worth saying on the point, he ought not then to rule the Taoiseach out of order because that would imply that we would be ruled out of order. It was only then that the position transpired that the Ceann Comhairle accepted not only that the Taoiseach was concluding, but that he had called upon the Taoiseach to conclude.</P>

      <P>I said on that occasion that the Taoiseach had tricked the House.  I think that that remark was deserved by reason of the fact that when the Taoiseach had found out what had happened he did not have a certain amount of grace and admit that the House had been misled by his remarks and say that he did not wish to stifle any discussion it was desired to make.</P>
      <P>The country that this Parliament is intended to serve could very well do without this debate&mdash;and the workers and the Deputies in this House could very well do without this debate, and most of them have felt like that.  But the Taoiseach's attitude to-night is a warning to us that, perhaps, we could not very well do without.  The Taoiseach comes in here and talks to us about order and about law in this House.  Yet he walked into the lobby against the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle because a member of his Party called another Deputy a liar in this House and would not withdraw it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see a little more of the operations of this House with the Fianna Fáil Party in its new position and, perhaps, in a new mood, but I think that the Taoiseach, in all that <Col N="1777" /> has happened with regard to the Chair since this Dáil reassembled, has done what he has done to many institutions in this country before: he has sullied and demeaned it.</P>

I ask them to produce any single case in which, except where motions have been taken separately, the debate has not gone on with anybody who wanted to speak speaking until the debate stopped and then the decision was taken.  We have been treated to a kind of sermon on the standard practices of this House&mdash; practices that never existed as standard practices and that certainly were not the experience of Deputy Cowan even during his short stay in this Assembly.  But unless we realise that we come in here to give everything we have in an interchange of thought and work in an orderly way, and unless we respect practices and order, we will not have this House of any service to the country: and the country wants the service of an efficient, orderly, clear-minded and fair-minded Parliament.</P>

But if we are in the position that the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, and the Fianna Fáil Party now feel that they are going another round with Irish democracy, then they will feel and know that there <Col N="1778" /> are people in this House who will respect the Chair and who will support the Chair but who will not allow the Chair either to be tricked into dominance by the Taoiseach or ordered by the Taoiseach or reduced to a satellite of the Taoiseach in his desire to dominate this House.</P>

I think a great deal of the thunder and noise to which we have listened and most of this pounding of the desk to which Deputy General Mulcahy treated us are designed to cover the fact that the mover of the motion and the Opposition which purported last week to support the motion are now running away from it.  In the course of this two hours' debate those who have pretended to be supporting the attitude which Deputy Dillon took up when he put down this motion have not referred to the Ceann Comhairle at all.  There has not been any criticism, at least not any very strong criticism, of the Ceann Comhairle's ruling. Instead of that we have had a continuous attack upon the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Yet the Taoiseach is not mentioned in this motion.  The word &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; does not appear in it from beginning to end.  I heard a Deputy on the Opposition Benches allege that the Taoiseach had tricked <Col N="1780" /> the Chair.  If Deputy O'Higgins wishes to censure the Chair because the Taoiseach tricked him, why was that not stated?  Why was that not stated as the reason for this motion?  Why was it not upon that ground that Dáil Éireann was asked to condemn the Ceann Comhairle or, if the Deputy likes to put it in another way, why did not Deputy Dillon put down a motion asking the House to censure the Taoiseach because he tricked the Chair?  That motion did not appear on the Order Paper; instead of that, we have a motion in very strong terms, perhaps the strongest that a motion of this sort could fittingly be expressed in having regard always of course to the fact that even Deputy Dillon is expected on occasions of this sort to exercise some control and impose some limitations on his rather verbose vocabulary.  Here is what Deputy Dillon did say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Cowan now knows why I feel it vital to defend, with all the resources at my disposal, the right of an individual Deputy to speak and to be heard in this House because the desire to prevent both one and the other is very strong in certain quarters in this House and, if the Chair be not vigilant to protect the individual Deputy against the desire to shout him down, very few Independent Deputies in this House will ever be heard at all.  The Minister for Finance wants to know why there was no reference in the motion on this Order Paper to the action of the Taoiseach.  I shall tell him.  Because the motion was put down before I pinned the Taoiseach's hand to the desk.  The motion was put down before the printed copy of the unrevised report was issued.  You cannot pin the cheat's hand to the card table until he stretches forth his hand to play a dishonest card.  I directed the motion at the facts as I knew them.  I directed the motion at no individual and I said so.  I directed the motion against the danger of establishing a precedent that already has begun to take root and to grow in the rank and rotten soil of Fianna Fáil.  It was while I was doing <Col N="1788" /> that that the cheat's hand went out to change the records and to change the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, Deputy MacBride gave notice that he would raise the subject-matter of Questions Nos. 49 and 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked leave to raise the subject-matter of Questions Nos. 49 and 50 on the Adjournment tonight, not in any spirit of contention against the Minister, but in the hope that I may be able to persuade the Minister to adopt a different attitude from that expressed by him in the course of his reply to me to-day.  The reply which he gave me to-day is, in effect, the Department of Education's stock reply which has been given in this House for over 25 years.  It is a reply drafted year after year by civil servants in the Department of Education and handed down to their Minister to give out in this House.  I do not think that that reply bears examination. I do not think that the Minister can possibly agree with that reply if he focuses his mind on the issues involved.</P>
      <P>In effect, my suggestion was that, in order to inculcate a sense of patriotism and respect for this State in the young people growing up, we should have available in the schools of this country a copy of the Proclamation of 1916 and our national flag.  What objection can there be to that?  The objection originally, as I understand it, in the Department of Education was that it might be construed as introducing politics into the schools.  Whatever validity there might have been for that line of reasoning 25 years ago, or even ten years ago, there is no ground for that argument in the year of Our Lord 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should not our children be taught to respect the national flag? Why should there not be in every school in the country a copy of the Proclamation of 1916 or the Declaration of Independence?  In practice, in every other country in the world the national flag is displayed during school hours in the national schools and the equivalent <Col N="1791" /> of the Proclamation of the Republic, in the shape of the declaration of that Republic or, if it is a monarchy, a photograph of the king and queen or the ruling family is displayed in every schoolhouse.  I know the Minister is a man of independent mind, and I hope that he will revise this silly, stupid, stock answer that we have been given.</P>
    <P>I should like to read that answer which has been put into the Minister's hands:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I cannot agree that the procedure suggested offers the most effective means towards achieving that end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I never suggested that the display of the flag or the Proclamation or the Declaration of Independence in the schools provides the most effective means of inculcating patriotism in the minds of our children.  But it certainly does provide a means.  At the moment, as far as I am aware, there are no means of any kind prescribed by the Department of Education to inculcate patriotism or respect for the flag in our national schools.  The answer goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Patriotism should be a natural and progressive growth in our schools, and the less it is inculcated through the medium of the formality which characterises most school classes, the more likely it is to take firm root in the mind and heart...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who suggested that it should be inculcated as a formality or as a school task?  I suggested in my question that the Minister should make available to schools copies of the Proclamation of 1916, so that they could be hung on the walls of the schools.  Is that a formality? Is it a school task?  Is it a formality or is it a &ldquo;school task&rdquo; to have the national flag flying over our schools?</P>
    <P>The answer goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A sound knowledge of the national and cultural inheritance that has come down to us is, to my mind, the surest foundation for a spirit of patriotism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By all means&mdash;a sound knowledge of <Col N="1792" /> the national and cultural inheritance, but surely the Proclamation of 1916 and our flag form part of that national inheritance.  How are the children to have a sound knowledge of our national inheritance unless they are given an opportunity of learning about it?</P>
    <P>The answer goes on, further down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not consider that symbols of national significance should be made a matter of such everyday familiarity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That beats all platitudes.  Because a symbol is important it has to be kept hidden.  You might as well suggest that because to all of us our religion is probably the most sacred thing we have, crucifixes should be hidden and churches should not be seen.</P>
    <P>I hope that if this adjournment debate serves no other purpose it will stop civil servants from writing answers that are platitudes, that are meaningless, that do not bear examination, and then handing them to Ministers.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not been too hard in criticising the answer which the Minister gave me to-day.  It was not my intention to indulge in harsh criticism. My intention was to appeal to the Minister to review the matter in the light of conditions as they exist in the year 1951.  There can be no objection to the display in our schools, not merely of the Proclamation of 1916, not merely of the Declaration of Independence, but also of pictures of some of our national heroes.</P>

      <P>I can quite well see that there should not be displayed in schools matters which are the subject of political controversy, but there is no political controversy about these things now.  This nation accepts the fact that it is a Republic.  We accept the fact that we are a nation and our task must be to inculcate in our young people a <Col N="1793" /> respect for their nationalism, for their nation, for their flag.  There is no better way of doing that than by visual demonstration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, it is not an unusual thing that an answer to a question in this House is drafted by the officials of the Minister's Department but, even if that happened, as it did happen in this case, I examined the answer and I fully agreed with the matter of the answer.  Nobody has greater respect for the flag than I have.  I can even say that nobody has proved his respect for the flag better than I have, but I do not regard this as quite the simple matter of hanging a framed replica of the Proclamation of 1916 on the walls of schools or the presentation of a flag and flag-pole to the school.  The value of symbols is what is behind them and if those who are asked to honour a symbol are without a knowledge of its history or background, that honour is a very empty one.  It is not a simple matter to impress or to inform children with a capacity for thought.  To secure an intelligent acceptance by them of concrete facts demands a continuous and considered effort.  Abstract ideas are more difficult still, and reverence for symbols requires the exposition of the background of the idea and the inculcation of historical knowledge of the men and events associated with the symbol and the sacrifices and nobilities also associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is one of the functions of the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only to be achieved, in my opinion, by the teaching of history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teaching of history in a primary school must necessarily be a slow process.  Much talk was made to-day about the various subjects that should be taught, and especially about preparing children for their future economic life.  I think the primary school's main function is to try to develop character ïn children and to give them wisdom.  It seems to me that in the few hours that it is possible to teach small children they should <Col N="1794" /> be taught those subjects which are needed for the acquisition of the knowledge by which character is formed and wisdom developed.  I do not think that history can readily be taught in the early stages of a school-child's life.  I think the child must be at least 12 years old and beyond the fairytale age, and until then there is little use in trying to give him a feeling for history.</P>
    <P>I confess that, due to my unfamiliarity with the schools' programme so far, I have no knowledge of the amount or the nature of the history taught or the text-books used, but I am deeply sensitive of the value of true patriotism and I do propose to make an earnest inquiry into the text-books used, the nature of the history taught and the method of teaching.  I believe that in that fashion we shall develop the patriotism which the Deputy, I presume, and I would like to see throughout the countryside.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that it would not be easy to teach small children the full meaning of the Proclamation of Easter Week, and that a good deal of time would be wasted in trying to do so.  I feel also that the raising and lowering of the flag daily, instead of being an event in the child's life, would be a reminder to it of a daily task associated at some time with subjects during school life.  I think a method of inculcating respect for the flag would be by having a coloured replica of it in the history text-books.  I think that lessons in the teaching of history might be impeded by stories of flags and their use.  I think, since not merely children but older people require to be told something of the honour due to the flag, that a recent publication of the Genealogical Office in relation to the respect due to the flag, and the manner in which it should be used, should be part of the lesson taught to the children.</P>
    <P>I think that, in spite of everything that has been said to the contrary, our people of all brands of politics are nationally minded.  Converts from one religion to another are generally more vocal about their new religion than <Col N="1795" /> those who were born into it.  In other countries, with not as sound a basis of nationality and patriotism as this country, we have a good deal of ballyhoo about the flag.  There is a good deal of insincerity about it.  I think that when the flag is carried in procession, and when adults stand to attention and take their hats off as it goes by, such action has more effect in inculcating the idea of the honour due to the flag, of its background and of the reasons why men have died for the flag&mdash;because it represents the best of the things they <Col N="1796" /> believed in and wished for their country.</P>
    <P>I am wholly in agreement with the Deputy in his desire for a knowledge of the history of our flag, and for the inculcation of the idea of respect for the flag.  It is not for any perverse reason that I would object, at the moment anyhow, to the carrying out of what the Deputy desires.  I think, however, that my idea is better than his, and is much more likely to bring about the result which the Deputy and I would like to see.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 18th July, 1951.</P>
