      <P>It is expected that supplies of coal and coke from Great Britain in the year 1951 will amount to about 1,230,000 tons as compared with the minimum quantity of 1,570,000 tons guaranteed in the 1948 Trade Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hession</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what steps it is proposed to take to combat and/or offset the growing trade depression in this country, and if he will arrange the most immediate expedition in respect thereof before irreparable harm has been caused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to ascribe to a single cause the recent reduction in sales to the public which has caused <Col N="824" /> a set-back in business, particularly in the textile and clothing trades, and which appears to be almost world-wide in its scope.  The most generally accepted explanation is the development of &ldquo;consumers' resistance&rdquo; to continuing high and rising prices.  As the price level is becoming stabilised it seems probable, in view of the over-all economic conditions, that this situation is not likely to be of long duration.</P>
      <P>In this country, the position in some industries, notably textiles, is accentuated by the existence in the hands of merchants of exceptionally heavy stocks accumulatel for stockpiling purposes under the facilities afforded earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>In so far as the position may be affected by a preference for imported as against home-produced goods, with a consequent fall in purchasing power through a reduction of employment, steps to rectify the position have been taken.  In the case of textile goods subject to import quota restrictions, the quantity of goods permitted to be imported under quota has been drastically reduced and in the case of other goods, certain protective tariffs which had been suspended have been brought back into force.</P>
      <P>Consideration is being given continuously to further measures which might be taken to expand trade in home-produced commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give to Dáil Éireann particulars of the estimates available to his Department of the total (a) gross and (b) net external assets held by persons, firms or corporations resident in Ireland (excluding such external assets as are held by the Government, the Central Bank and the associated banks) on the 31st March (or other convenient date) in each of the following years: 1938, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already informed the Deputy that there is no official estimate of the sterling holdings of private persons, firms and corporations. The only estimates available to my Department are those published in the journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland for 1949-50 and earlier private estimates. Net external assets in public and private ownership at the beginning of 1949 were estimated in the paper printed in the journal at approximately £225,000,000.  The following factors have since affected the value of Ireland's net external assets:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(i)  deficits of £10,000,000 and £30,000,000 in the balance of payments for 1949 and 1950 respectively;</P>
      <P>(ii)  increase in the market value of assets held by externs in this country;</P>
      <P>(iii)  appreciation of Irish private investors' holdings of British industrial and other securities as a result of higher yields offset by a fall in the value of gilt-edged securities in which the greater part of the sterling resources in Irish ownership are invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> The external disinvestment in 1949 and 1950 referred to at (i) above was not reflected in a fall in gross external assets.  These actually increased during these two years because dollar and sterling liabilities were incurred in excess of the balance of payments deficits.</P>
    <P>If the prospective deficit in the balance of payments this year of £70,000,000 is realised, total external disinvestment in the three years 1949 to 1951 will amount to £110,000,000. Changes in external assets and liabilities are shown annually under various heads in the balance of payments statement.</P>

      <P>The implication in the first part of the Deputy's question that public expenditure of a capital nature is always proper to be met from borrowing cannot be accepted without qualification.  The question of the extent to which public expenditure, whether capital or current, should be met by borrowing must be decided in relation to the general economic circumstances. Whether the borrowed funds come from current savings or represent merely the putting of new money in circulation is of special significance in this connection.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance undertook to a meeting of Mayo County Council on the 25th November, 1950, that the Office of Public Works would arrange for the removal of obstructions on the River Moy at Manulla, Foxford and Mount-falcon; that the work would commence in March, 1951; that the former Minister for Agriculture, in consultation with him, was allocating £100,000 for the scheme; and, if so, whether he will accordingly state if (1) there is any record in his Department of any such scheme; (2) there is any correspondence in the files of his Department with the Minister for Agriculture in connection with any such scheme; (3) whether any survey was carried out by his officials for the purpose of implementing any such scheme, and (4) if the Office of Public Works have had an examination made as to whether they have any legal right to remove these obstructions except in pursuance of a full unitary scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945; and, if so, what was the result of the examination.</P>

      <P>I have no information as to the proceedings at the meeting of the Mayo County Council on the 25th November 1950, beyond that contained in Press reports, which attributed to Deputy Donnellan statements to the effect that he proposed to commence work on the removal of the obstructions at Manulla, Foxford and Mountfalcon in the summer of 1951 in advance of a comprehensive scheme for the Moy catchment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the possibility of affording some temporary relief from flooding along the Moy by the removal of <Col N="832" /> obstructions was adverted to in correspondence with the former Minister for Agriculture, there is no record in my Department of the allocation of a sum of £100,000&mdash;or any other sum&mdash;for such work; and no engineering survey has been made for the purpose of formulating or implementing any such scheme.</P>
    <P>The removal of obstructions of the nature of those on the Moy is a major drainage operation involving substantial interference with important water rights and other rights, and the legal powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to interfere with such rights are derived from the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, and not otherwise.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It seems to me the solution to the Moy catchment drainage problem will lie, not only in opening up the main River Moy and its tributaries, but also in improving the channels leading into and out of the two lakes, Lough Conn and Lough Cullen, the object being to make much greater use of these lakes as storage and balancing reservoirs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On 17th April, 1951, after some opening remarks, the then Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been giving the Moy very careful attention myself and the engineers of the Board of Works have been there examining every aspect of the problem there obtaining. There is no solution of the Moy flooding by removing the rock or by plugging or picking at it.  The Moy must be dealt with as a unitary.  It may involve the building of loughs on Lough Cullen and Lough Conn. It certainly constitutes a unitary drainage problem, and that is the way it is going to be done.  The survey authority will start on it this year.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that no rigid schedule of the order in which drainage schemes will be undertaken has at any time been settled.  It was, of course, necessary when the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, came into force to draw up a provisional programme of work, and this was done so far as the information then available permitted. That programme is, and must continue to remain, subject to alteration as may be determined from time to time.  The survey of the Corrib catchment was taken at an earlier stage than was originally contemplated, but this variation has not altered the position which the Moy occupied in the provisional programme.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the failure of unmarried mothers to take adequate care of their health in the ante-natal period results in a higher infant mortality rate amongst illegitimate children than amongst legitimate children.  Despite this well-known fact, the following table, which shows in <Col N="838" /> respect of the year ended 31st March, 1950, the number of deaths of infants under one year in the four main homes for unmarried mothers which receive financial assistance from public funds, expressed as a percentage of the total number of children born in the home concerned or admitted to it after birth, indicates that the rates compare favourably with the general rate in some, at least, of the homes:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Unmarried mothers and their children are, of course, maintained in other voluntary institutions which receive contributions from public funds and in local authority institutions (e.g. county homes), which cater for other classes as well.  Circumstances in regard to admissions to such institutions vary so greatly, however, that it would be difficult to establish valid comparisons.</P>

      <P>I understand that certain ballot papers were rejected because the electors concerned had failed to enter the ballot paper numbers on their declarations of identity or had entered numbers which did not correspond with the ballot paper numbers. The onus of completing the declaration of identity rests on the elector.  The functions of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; are set out in the first Schedule to the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947.  They are:</P>
      <P>(1)  To satisfy himself that the elector has five unmarked ballot papers;</P>
      <P>(2)  To furnish the elector with a form of declaration of identity which is required by the Act to be made and completed by the elector;</P>
      <P>(3)  To mark this form &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; if the elector's ballot papers are duplicate ballot papers;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> (4)  To sign the declaration of identity as witness that the elector is personally known or has been identified to him and has produced to him the ballot papers unmarked and the envelope in which they were enclosed and has signed the declaration in his presence and to return the declaration of identity to the elector who then marks his ballot papers;</P>
    <P>(5)  To affix a label to the closed covering envelope in which the elector has placed his ballot papers, ballot paper envelope and declaration of identity; to sign the certificate on the label and to return the envelope to the elector.</P>
    <P>The law requires the elector to insert the ballot paper number on his declaration of identity.  This requirement was brought specially to the notice of every elector in a circular issued by the Seanad returning officer before polling took place in the last Seanad General Election.  The procedure set out in the 1947 Act was adopted following consideration of the recommendation of the Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad on Seanad Panel Elections which reported in May, 1947.  I do not propose to promote legislation to amend the procedure in such a way as to place on the &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; the onus of verifying the ballot paper numbers shown by the electors on their declarations of identity.  The onus is on the elector to exercise his vote in accordance with law, if he wishes it to be effective.  It would be improper to amend the law in such a way that the onus would be placed even partially upon an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; whose purpose is to identify the elector and to ensure that the ballot papers are marked in secret.  I understand that, in connection with the last Seanad general election, the &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; carried out their duties satisfactorily and I am satisfied that they need no further instruction in the proper discharge of their duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The switchboard equipment at Castlebar exchange is adequate for the volume of traffic. The delays complained of are due solely to insufficiency of trunk lines on certain routes, particularly the routes between Castlebar and Ballina and between Ballina and Dublin.  An additional Castlebar-Ballina line will be brought into use very shortly.  It is hoped it will be possible to improve the Ballina-Dublin service next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that even local calls sometimes are delayed for as long as one and a half hours through no fault of the staff?  It is purely the fault of inadequate and antiquated equipment.  I believe the switchboard is not capable of handling half of the calls coming through. Telephone subscribers in the Castlebar area might as well be without a telephone at all most of the time.  It is about time that something would be done about that.</P>

Within the next fortnight, a new main automatic exchange will be brought into service in the central city area. The measures referred to will help to reduce the number of faults of the kind mentioned by the Deputy in so far as they are due to overloaded equipment or equipment due for renewal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 62, 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>There are now about 600 post offices without telephones and they are being dealt with at the rate of 130, approximately, a year.  Deputies may ascertain if places they are interested in are to receive attention during this financial year by referring to the list circulated with the Official Report by my predecessor on the occasion of a question by Deputy Spring on 14th March, 1951.</P>
      <P>As regards post offices to be dealt with in the next financial year, I have approved of the general lines on which they should be selected.  Regard will be had to social considerations, but the choice will be based largely on engineering considerations.  Any pressure brought to bear by Deputies in respect of a particular office if successful would almost certainly postpone service being granted in an adjacent area where the need is equally great.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to interfere with the list of selected offices once determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Question No. 64, I should like to point out to the Minister that the Killawalla area comprises almost 1,000 families and that the people there are 14 miles from the nearest town.  While I can understand that engineering problems must be given a certain priority, it seems to me that such a vast number of families living at such a long distance from the nearest medical or other centre deserve a priority.  I think that it would be difficult to find a more deserving case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that the rate <Col N="870" /> is only approximately 130 per year and why are there not more connections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the staff of the engineering department are engaged on works of various kinds&mdash; cabling and so forth.  There is a limited total staff available for that purpose. A portion of the staff is directed to establishing call offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Blowick, I may say that the considerations he has mentioned have the attention of the Department.  As there are only 600 post offices left without telephones and as they are being catered for at the rate of approximately 130 per year, it would seem undesirable to delay the carrying out of the whole work by interfering with the list of selected offices.  The Deputy may rest assured that for every area which he can mention of the kind which he has specified another area will suffer in respect of the area which he has chosen.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say if it is possible that engineering staff have been diverted in the past from work of that nature to the provision of telephone facilities for colonels, and so forth, of the British Army who were prepared, I must say, to pay for these facilities?  Has that not had the effect of slowing-up the provision of telephone facilities in rural areas where they are so essential?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>Provision of service within six months was promised in a departmental letter to the subscriber in December, 1950, when my predecessor was in office, application having been made in September, 1948.</P>
      <P>In regard to the remainder of the question, I think it would be highly detrimental to the development of the telephone service to publish the circumstances relating to individual telephone installations which are the subject of contract entered into privately between the Department and the subscriber concerned, particularly having regard to the desirability of encouraging the rural community to take service. I am, therefore, sending full particulars to the Deputy privately in regard to the remainder of the question.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the desirability of treating each catchment area as a unit in any arterial drainage programme, but in our present circumstances I would be grateful if you would consider this qualification of the established procedure:</P>
      <P>We have assembled over the last ten years hydrometric records for several rivers.  You are at present engaged on, or about to undertake, the Brosna catchment area, the Glyde and Dee catchment area and the Corrib ditto.  With the two new survey parties, we propose to undertake physical surveys of the Boyne and the Maine.  The completion of the Brosna, Glyde and Corrib will each take about five years, according to the present programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would you consider the desirability of postponing work on the tributary rivers in each of these catchment areas, thus releasing trained engineering staff, which, diluted with the newly-recruited engineering staff, could undertake next spring preliminary work on five or six main channels of arterial catchment areas; thus, next spring, work would be in progress on main channel of Brosna, Glyde and Dee, Corrib, Boyne, Maine, and we could add Moy, Inny and another river?  This course would have two very substantial advantages, i.e., (a) it would provide outlets for water drained off land at present waterlogged, without valley <Col N="886" /> flooding such as has occurred in areas like the Moy estuary this year; (b) it would create in its wake a valuable pool of useful work awaiting execution on the tributaries in each of these catchment areas, which would be available in the event of any unemployment problem arising in these areas in the future, and in the meantime, if any of the tributaries urgently required opening, it could be undertaken under Local Authorities Public Works Act or by the land project, undeterred by any apprehension of consequential valley inundation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where is the Moy mentioned in that, except in the very last paragraph as an afterthought and when it was mentioned that it might possibly be surveyed and drained?</P>

      <P>Before continuing on the line I was attempting to adopt yesterday, I want to correct a misstatement I made yesterday or, if you like, an incorrect statement.  While referring to the Central Bank, I was subjected to a continuous running fire of interruptions and was slightly thrown off balance.  Referring to the functions of the Central Bank, I stated, quite wrongly, that among its functions was to provide money at cheap rates of interest for local authorities.  In that I was quite wrong and I take this opportunity to correct the mistake I made.  There are, however, very substantial sums of money under the control of the State, Post Office savings for example, and this sum of money which Deputy Norton, when he was Minister for Social Welfare, was going to spend on the acquisition of a luxury suite of offices now known as the bus station.  These funds are made available for loans to local authorities at lower rates.</P>
      <P>I also referred to the deposits in the Central Bank by our joint stock banks and I am afraid that I again made a statement which could quite correctly be described as misleading or wrong.  I said that the banks did put on deposit in the Central Bank moneys deposited with them by their clients.  What I should have said&mdash;I have since given myself a chance to think about it&mdash;was that the Central Bank has power to request our joint stock banks to lodge with them at any time certain sums of money by way of deposits if the Central Bank itself requests the Minister for Finance to examine the matter on the grounds that the banks may possibly be attempting to restrict credit and are not lending money to the extent they should lend it in relation to the deposits they have.</P>

      <P>Both.  On the one hand if they refuse to lend money for the specific purpose of restricting credit, as a deliberate policy of credit restriction, then they can be asked by the Central Bank to lodge with them without any interest charge whatever, substantial portions of the deposits lodged with them.  Alternatively, if it is felt that they are extravagant in the giving of credit which might not seem in the interests of the community at large they can again be asked to lodge a certain amount of money.</P>

That bank issues our paper money which is in circulation and by the law under which the Central Bank was set up it has to carry out its operations in a certain manner in order to have the creation of liquid money in the bank for the purposes of the community.  The previous powers which the joint stock banks held were changed.  There was a time when the only people issuing paper money in this country, outside the money from across the water, were the joint stock banks and, with the establishment of the Currency Commission and subsequently the Central Bank, the issue of these notes was gradually reduced and the Central Bank is now the issuer of our paper money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been talk about where we are going to get capital, <Col N="896" /> how we are to provide capital, how we are to create capital assets.  The greatest capital asset the country had was destroyed after the change of Government in 1948.  We are now filled with the desire to sell what we have to sell, the surplus commodities of this country, to other countries in order to secure what is known as hard currency and one of the best hard currency undertakings this country had was the transatlantic air services.  It was sold for sterling which shortly afterwards became less in value as a result of devaluation and notwithstanding that particular loss to reacquire such machines to-day you would have to pay increased hard currency prices for them.</P>
      <P>A physical asset was thrown away and its dollar-earning capacity with it and all the employment that would have been given of a very high standard. Yet we talk here about capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my amazement, I heard Deputy Cosgrave yesterday attempting to suggest that it was the Coalition Government which was to be thanked for the rural electrification scheme. I remember sitting in these benches when the Tánaiste introduced a Bill to provide £20,000,000 for rural electrification, half of which was to be given by way of subsidy by the State over the period of years which the rural electrification scheme would take.  I remember, after the change of Government, several of us continually asking questions as to whether the then Minister for Industry and Commerce was satisfied that the rural electrification scheme was being proceeded with at the rate contemplated before the change of Government. Yet we had Deputy Cosgrave yesterday repeating several times: &ldquo;Make sure you carry out the rural electrification scheme that we initiated.&rdquo;  Deputies on that side of the House realise that people's memories cannot be very much at fault in thinking of matters over a period of three years.  Deputies know that what I am saying is correct and that what Deputy Cosgrave says is incorrect.  I do not know whether he will come into the House like I did <Col N="897" /> to-day and admit that something he said yesterday was incorrect.</P>
    <P>I was talking yesterday about our position.  I agree that, so long as we are linked with sterling, whatever we do in this country will have very little effect on the whole sterling area or on the value of sterling outside it.  The sterling area is a big area.  The turnover of sterling is a phenomenal figure. We are only an infinitesimal part in that scheme of things.  Therefore, we cannot help to make the £ more valuable, nor can we, if we dispose of every penny of our external assets, bring about a situation where the £ sterling could be considered to be of less value.  All we can do and should do is to think in terms of how we can get more for our exportable goods in order to bring them up to their world price.  After all, whether the £ is worth 2.80 dollars or four dollars, a commodity has to be sold at the world price.  As your £ or whatever currency you use rises or falls, so does the price you pay for a world commodity rise or fall.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what we should do is to try to get the real world price for any goods that we have which outside countries are prepared to buy from us, and we have in this country in to-day's world scheme of things some of the most valuable items for export.  We have the food that people need to consume from day to day.  We had, however, an agreement which prevented us from selling abroad more than a certain percentage of our exportable goods and in connection with that agreement there was also a maximum price fixed.  In the last few years a new situation has developed. America is buying from us certain of our agricultural produce in a very desirable form.  We are not shipping live beasts; we are shipping carcase meat.  There are, therefore, offals of great value to the community and there is a certain employment content inherent in that particular transaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask to what commodity did the restriction to which the Deputy refers apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. Let me finish my line of thought first. <Col N="898" /> I made a mistake yesterday and I want to prevent myself from being drawn into mistakes to-day.  We are selling to-day a commodity to America at a very much higher price than would be got for the same commodity across the Channel.  It is sold in a form that gives additional employment and provides additional raw materials for ourselves which are much needed. But there was an agreement as to which there was a dispute with regard to its interpretation.  That is the agreement to which the Deputy has asked me to refer.  There was an agreement with Britain that they were to get 90 per cent. of our cattle exports and that our exports of cattle to other countries should not exceed 10 per cent.  It did not matter what the other countries might offer us for the cattle.  By reason of this agreement, live cattle definitely were limited in their export to foreign countries other than England so as not to exceed 10 per cent.  There was also a difference between the Minister of Food in England and the Minister for Agriculture here on the question of whether this agreement could be interpreted to include carcase meat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement was there.  When I hear the Deputy say that I have a recollection of the Deputy pleading with this House in pre-1948 days from that very seat not to forget the customer that had supported us for 100 years; that even if the world prices were higher, we should feed these people even at a lower price because of their past purchases. Obviously, with that mentality the Deputy was not going to go out to seek ships to carry the cattle if they were needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who got the ships for the meat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This agreement existed, and the result was that, even if foreign nations offered twice the price for the cattle, we were hidebound by this agreement.  To-day we have reached a stage where we must attempt to do two important things if we want to keep our standard of living unimpaired. Apart from the value of sterling or the purchase price of the £ and the high price of commodities, we must do two things.  We must find a market for our goods that will give us the world price.  We must increase our production of these items.  Then it does not matter to us what the denominator is, what the medium of exchange is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> The fact is that then we will get in goods or the equivalent of goods sufficient currency to pay a price which will not be the high price that it is to-day.  We are paying world prices for our imports but we are not getting world prices for our exports.  I suggest that when we deal with what is termed our adverse trade balance, bringing with it the dissipation of our foreign assets, the way in which to limit the dissipation of those assets is to increase our exports in value and in quantity and to decrease as far as possible our imports in value and in quantity.  We will then be able to get our country into the position where we will both understand and appreciate the sanity there is in any direct effort to reach as soon as possible that state of self-sufficiency which the country should reach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not approach it from that point of view, but rather from the point of view of what I felt it to be my duty to say as an elected representative to this House.  There has been talk about stockpiling.  I would like to see the Tánaiste publishing a list of the items which were brought in here, ostensibly for stockpiling. I remember, when the present Leader of the Opposition was Taoiseach, that on the Vote for his Department there was an attempt made at having a sensible approach to a serious situation.  I remember saying on that occasion that I approved of the stockpiling of certain items, but not of manufactured garments or nylon stockings.  The items I referred to were essential raw materials for housing, large piles of timber, which should be properly stored, and large piles of steel to meet our requirements at home.  I would regard the stockpiling of these as a sound approach to the situation, but not of consumable goods, the value of which, as an asset, disappeared the moment they were consumed.  I shall probably put down a question some day to the appropriate <Col N="906" /> Minister asking him to indicate the items which were stockpiled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We will remember that the machinery we had for the establishment of a heavy engineering industry at Inchicore was sold.  It was scrapped and sent abroad.  What kind of a mentality was behind that?  I will not call it sabotage, but it certainly was vandalism from the point of view of the national well-being.  Our dollar earning possibilities in Aer Lingus, and the value to us of this heavy engineering industry, all went.  Despite that, we are challenged and accused of not being interested in capital investment for reproductive purposes.  That is where there is a big difference of opinion between us.  I remember an occasion in this House when we had a very detailed and technical discussion &mdash;it arose on housing&mdash;as to what was above and what was below the line spending as regards capital expenditure, and what was not.  We were told on this side of the House to regard all expenditure on housing and hospitalisation as capital expenditure.  My view of capital expenditure is that it is money spent on items which are reproductive. Money, for example, spent on the building up of a second addition to our cement production would be regarded by me as capital expenditure. I do not know how many million dollars would be required for that, but such expenditure would be reproductive.  I would regard expenditure on the building of houses and hospitals as part capital expenditure.  The health of the nation is concerned there.  We want to make available for our people good houses and good hospitals, so that they will be healthy.  Capital expenditure, in that sense, would be reproductive <Col N="907" /> because it would ensure that our people would be strong and healthy and able to work.</P>

Surely there is nothing wrong in that?</P>

      <P>That was set up under the administration of Fianna Fáil.  We know the amount of good work that was done in the building up of that particular organisation.  If it were not for those ships we might have found ourselves very much worse off than we were during the war years.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy admits that.  I am sure that the Tánaiste will be successful in bringing that scheme to the full fruition which he desires.  It will be a good thing for the nation.  Then Deputy Dillon will be able to ship our cattle whenever we like, and to where we like, on our own ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to see agriculture developed from the point of view not only of meeting our own requirements but of enabling us to have a surplus of valuable agricultural produce for export. We also want to bring the country back to the position in which it will be as self-sufficient as possible in the matter of wheat.  I do not know how many millions of dollars were spent on the importation of wheat, but we all know that it is a very difficult thing to get dollars to-day.  I do not think it is anybody's wish that this country should ever become a mendicant nation, depending on any rich <Col N="908" /> nation to give us loans or grants to buy our daily bread.  Surely we should be in a position to buy our daily bread ourselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke about butter, and Deputy MacBride drew my attention to the 2d. on butter.  I do not know if it will ever be possible to get certain Deputies to understand certain simple things.  I believe there are certain Deputies on the opposite side of the House of average intelligence, some with far greater intelligence than I can boast of.  Therefore, when they pretend that they do not understand simple things, I sit in amazement and wonder.  Fianna Fáil believed at one time, rightly or wrongly, but they believed, that after the conclusion of the war, with the uncertainty of supplies and the rise in prices that took place, that, unless some provision was made to protect the people by enabling them to get a certain rationed amount of essential commodities at a subsidised price, great hardship would follow. Therefore subsidies were introduced. Subsidies were going to be abolished at one time by the inter-Party Government and it was the inter-Party Government which introduced what I described then and what I now describe as a Government black market in some of these commodities when they became more readily available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Deputy has digested mentally what I said before because he now realises there are certain things you cannot do now, and I am grateful I have one convert anyhow.  The Deputy talked about butter.  The situation in which our <Col N="909" /> country had found itself was that, although mainly an agricultural country, we had our milk supply so reduced that we had to import butter from abroad.  It was obvious that something had to be done to increase the production of milk so that more milk would be available for butter production.  It is again a matter of economics.  You cannot expect the farming community to exist continually in uneconomic circumstances.  Surely they are as much entitled to secure the full value of the goods they produce as anybody else.  Consequently, an increase of 1d. per gallon was recently given to the milk producers and 2d. a lb. was put on the butter, but the public were not asked to pay it in the rationed butter.  Deputy MacBride said yesterday that that was putting on the back of the community an amount of money of some £400,000 to £600,000 a year which will have to be paid from taxation.  What does the Deputy mean by that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave yesterday, in addition to taking credit for rural electrification, took credit for turf development and for drainage.  He said we must continue these things; we must not abandon them.  Did anyone ever hear such codology?  The Rural Electrification Act was passed by this Government, by Fianna Fáil, before 1948.</P>
      <P>In regard to turf development from 1932 onwards we made strenuous efforts to make the people turf-minded with a view to the development of turf as a fuel ultimately, so that more people would buy and burn it.  I remember Deputy Dillon upbraiding us as if we were fit to go around the world as a comedy set from a circus shouting &ldquo;turf, turf.&rdquo;  I remember that every effort was made to get the people sufficiently turf-minded and we were abused for supporting the present institutions for developing turf.  They certainly were not set up by the Coalition Government.  They were found there when they took office and they are still there.  I can assure the Deputies opposite that turf development in the sense and to the extent we wanted to reach will be attempted and continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards drainage, who was it brought in that big Drainage Bill to make the drainage we are now talking about possible?  Deputy Dillon, who is a man who talks with a tone of assertion, positive of his knowledge, and a few of his colleagues, particularly the ex-Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, tried to convince us to-day that a survey meant drainage.  I do not know where they get their interpretations of ordinary words from.  In my <Col N="911" /> opinion, a survey is one thing and drainage is another thing but those on the opposite side of the House were trying to suggest during questions to-day that when a promise was made for a survey, it was in fact a promise for drainage.  That is what I call codology. But it has not been misunderstood by the public.  The public know that it is codology and it would be far better for those Deputies to take a serious view of a serious situation and to try to be as constructive as they can in the state of things as they are.</P>
    <P>We have large-scale Government expenditure before us on housing, hospitalisation, drainage and many other things.  The State will have to find the necessary capital from time to time.  A question on the Order Paper yesterday brought forth the answer that up to the time of the change of Government this year some £16,000,000 of the Marshall Aid money had been spent and that since the change of Government in the last four months £18,000,000 had been spent&mdash;proof of the extravagance of this Government.</P>

      <P>Now I understand it. Deputy Cosgrave said yesterday that £18,000,000 had been spent extravagantly by Fianna Fáil.  Now Deputy Sweetman says it was used to redeem debt.  It was a question of what is a good financial thing to do.  If you have a debt you must meet it or you must fund it and you must pay interest on it.  It might have been far better to have paid that debt and save the interest charges that would accrue if you had not paid it.  Maybe the people to whom the money was due needed it. <Col N="912" /> Maybe they were entitled to get it paid.  I intend to ask a question for next week as to exactly how that £18,000,000 was spent.</P>
      <P>I know that a certain amount of it had to go to Córas Iompair Éireann. I know that they needed some £1,500,000 to £2,000,000.  When Deputy Morrissey was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I remember him saying here that Córas Iompair Éireann would not need £1,000,000 when he had two or three years in office.</P>

      <P>The records are available and can be looked at in case somebody suggests that I have corrected them.  I have said that it was attempted to suggest that the £18,000,000 I have already mentioned had been extravagantly spent by Fianna Fáil in the last four months and I said that I was anxious to find out for what purpose it had been used. I repeat that.  I said, further, for Deputy Morrissey's benefit, that I intended to put a question down for answer with a view to finding out exactly on what this money had been spent and what it had been used to meet.  I said &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;, and I say again &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; there is a deficit of £1,500,000 to be met in respect of Córas Iompair Éireann, but the Deputy's suggestion was that there was no deficit in the running of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean to, if I am allowed.  We must, first of all, limit as far as possible the importation of non-essential goods and goods which can be produced here.  We must design as fast as possible, either by private enterprise or through State aid, means of increasing exports and limiting the import of consumable goods by their production here.  We must try then to increase our productivity and to sell our goods at the best price on offer.  Only in that way can we bring our adverse trade balance to a position where it can be controlled and to a point where we will not be throwing the responsibility for the position that has arisen&mdash;increased expenditure for less goods&mdash;from one to the other, because that is what has been happening.  When Deputy Dillon rises to speak I know that he is going to try to impress on the House that under his administration in the Department of Agriculture exports went up in pounds, shillings and pence, but he will not be able to say that the quantity went up accordingly, for it is <Col N="914" /> the quantity of production that counts not the fictitious argument that because certain goods became more valuable less were exported for more money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with producing more goods and selling them for less.  I do not agree with the Deputy's approach to the selling of eggs&mdash;that you will get more money if you produce more eggs.  When the poor, unfortunate farmer produced more eggs he discovered that instead of getting 2/6, 2/9 or whatever the ruling price was, he got less per dozen because he was getting more in his turnover.  I would not subscribe to that theory for a split second, but such has been Deputy Dillon's approach to eggs, beef, and every single commodity to which he had to give any consideration or thought during the whole three years of his administration. We have to approach this from a patriotic point of view.  We must not consider what is best for our cupboards but what is best for us.  Deputy Dillon may bless himself if he wishes. A patriotic approach in the affairs of State is necessary when it concerns economy.  The Deputy who spoke in this House and asked the people to join the British Army now crosses himself publicly.  In my opinion, he is giving scandal by his behaviour.  I say to the Deputy and to every Deputy who believes in an increased turnover in volume without an increased turnover in money that it is not going to get us anywhere.  We have got to get the best available price for our goods&mdash; the ruling world price.  We have got to try and increase production and so benefit ourselves.  We know that in relation to imports, exports and re-exports all these figures and statistics do not mean anything except when related to each other.  I want to say that I have not been at all impressed by the so-called financial experts who <Col N="915" /> were dealing with matters beyond their comprehension and trying to give explanations without any understanding of the whole situation.  Deputy Hickey will agree with me in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that very little, if any, proof has been given to the House of the creation of industries within the last three years to promote the production in this country of consumer goods, which are being imported at present.  I hope that a great deal will be done in that matter from now on, and that we shall rapidly begin to understand what we all believe we understand, from the point of view of putting our economy on a basis on which it can be controlled for the best interests of all our people, not for sectional interests or interests abroad. Deputy MacBride wants us to repatriate our foreign investments. That is an expression which the Deputy has coined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and utilise them for our own productive purposes instead of leaving them to the British <Col N="916" /> Government to promote capital development over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>When we have an asset in the shape of money for which immediate use cannot be found, probably the right thing to do is to arrange to have it earn an income for us until such time as it can be brought back for use on a profitable basis here. While it may not bring an income in the shape of interest or dividends, it will certainly bring a benefit to the community in that it will make goods, which we need from abroad, more readily available for our people.  The management of these foreign investments must be carried out with a sense of wisdom and a sense of proportion. You cannot repatriate all your foreign investments at once and convert them into a form of expenditure which, after a few years, will mean nothing to you. The income from these investments will then have disappeared and you will probably have very little to show for the expenditure to which they were devoted.  It must be done in a serious fashion; you cannot repatriate your capital until you have decided what you are going to do with it.</P>
      <P>We have heard some talk of the £18,000,000 of Marshall Aid disposed of by this Government.  Does Deputy MacBride realise that there was a sum of £36,000,000 borrowed by the Coalition Government and that that meant an additional burden of taxation on the community in the sense that interest charges and a sinking fund had to be provided for it?  According to the last figure which I saw under that heading, our commitments had risen from £4,000,000 a year to £6,000,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Marshall Aid may have been used to an extent but the State floated a loan, issued a prospectus and asked the people to subscribe to it. <Col N="917" /> For that loan, as I have said, interest charges and a sinking fund had to be provided.  The figure under that heading has risen in the last three years from an annual charge of £4,000,000 to an annual charge of £6,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. Deputy Hickey wants us to get money for which there will be no interest charged.  I do not know who is going to lend his money to us unless he gets some benefit for it.  I do not know how you are going to induce people to sell their investments in England which bring them in an income on which they live and lend the proceeds to you without any interest.  Surely that is not an attitude to which we can subscribe.  Deputy Hickey remembers one member of this House who talked about printing money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy heard Deputy Flanagan give expression to that idea or perhaps he was not here then.  Deputy Flanagan believed that money could be printed and that the security or the backing for it meant nothing.  I do not believe that is the approach of most people in this House to the problem but having listened to and read the speeches on this Bill and the criticism of the Central Bank I do say that we are getting away from a realistic approach to the problem. Some people believe that we should break the link with sterling.  I believe that we should have our currency anchored to some sort of backing not necessarily British.  I have always believed that if we had found ways and means of doing it, we would have been so many millions the richer because we lost millions of pounds, not so much by devaluation, as by a series of repudiations by the British Government. First of all, they went off the gold standard and that was followed by a series of devaluations&mdash;first one of four dollars to the £ and finally one of 2.80 dollars to the £</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> I did hope that, in the course of time, we would try to acquire and build up, either in the shape of foreign currency or some internationally saleable commodity, added to our productive capacity, something to which we could anchor our currency which in any emergency would be regarded as solvent.  This is a problem that should have been tackled a long time ago and that should be considered now, but I do not subscribe to the idea that if you break the link with sterling you can produce your own money <i>ad lib.</i> Less than a matter of two years ago, when there was a Bill introduced to substitute cupro nickel for silver in our coinage, I suggested that, instead of selling the silver, it should be kept here as something of value which might form some anchorage for our currency. As it is, it will be melted and sold as silver bullion for £2,000,000 worth of paper notes.  The £2,000,000 paper notes will be consumed in goodness knows how short a time.  We had at one time a certain amount of gold as backing.  I remember when we had under the first Currency Commission an arrangement whereby £5,000,000 in gold was deposited in the Bank of England.  Somebody pointed out that that was very foolish because the gold produced no interest and that if we sold the gold for £5,000,000 and bought £5,000,000 worth in script, it would be interest-bearing.  That was done, and in a very short period of time sterling went off the gold standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that, at one stage I understand we actually bought American securities in dollars but we were advised by our financial experts that the dollar was not secure currency and they were all rushed back into sterling.</P>

      <P>I do not know on whose advice the Government acts in financial matters.  I do not know the status or the stature of the so-called experts to whom the Deputy refers.  I am expressing my own opinion.  I believe it would be a good thing for this country not to be dragged into this maelstrom of international currency or sterling currency problems.  I believe it would have been a good thing if we had been able to devise some means of having our own independent currency which would not have been affected by some other country's liabilities or commitments but only by our own.  I hope that some day those Deputies who are concerned about this matter may be able to exchange views, apart from political differences or other differences.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, may I say that some of us may have the vice by inheritance of a little understanding of this problem and others of us may have the virtue of complete ignorance of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe began his speech last night and went on to-day. I am going to deal only with one item mentioned by Deputy Briscoe because he invited me, and he has not extended the customary courtesy of waiting to hear me, to reply.  He spoke of the cement industry and of its establishment as an Irish industry 100 per cent. and, secondly, of the failure of the inter-Party Government to secure its expansion during the last three years, so that the total domestic requirements of cement might be produced in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cement company was established in this country under legislation enacted about 1935 or 1936.  That legislation was recommended to this Parliament on the ground that unless we had a domestic Irish cement industry we would become the victims of the Danish Cement Cartel which maintains its headquarters in Copenhagen, and which has intimate relations with Blue Circle and Red Triangle in Great <Col N="920" /> Britain.  It was pointed out to the Government of that day that up to that hour cement was sold cheaper in Ireland than in any other country in Europe, for the simple reason that the cartel had never been able to grip this country for, whenever it sought to do so, cement came in from Spain and cement came in from Poland, neither of which countries belonged to the cartel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the cartel kept the price of cement in Ireland lower than in any other country in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so as to ensure that the trade connection would not go off to Spain or Poland.  The present Tánaiste ridiculed that story.  It made him laugh to think that Irish Cement Limited would have any contact with the Danish Cement Cartel, and so Oireachtas Éireann passed the legislation, and the company was established. Imports of cement from any source were prohibited unless they were brought in by Irish Cement Limited. The nation awaited the first meeting of the board of directors of Irish Cement Limited, and it took place in Dublin.  The directors met, but the chair at the top of the table was vacant, and when the Irish directors had been assembled the door was opened and the chairman of Irish Cement Limited was introduced to them.  Do you know what his name was?  Nils Jensen, from Copenhagen, and he is still the chairman of Irish Cement Limited.</P>
      <P>Is not it a remarkable coincidence that he is widely reputed to be familiar with the Danish Cement Cartel?  Is not it an astonishing coincidence that the controlling director of the Danish Cement Cartel has the same name, Nils Jensen?  I invite the absent Deputy Briscoe to send the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on another odyssey through Europe to find out if these two gentlemen have ever met each other or could it be that they are the same man?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Behold what the cartel had never succeeded in doing, erecting in Ireland <Col N="921" /> an enclave for themselves, within which they could get the price they demanded for cement, they tricked Oireachtas Éireann to do it.  It was our legislation which forbade cement to come to Ireland from any part of Europe unless it was brought in through Irish Cement Limited, and the chairman was Nils Jensen.  An Irish company!</P>
    <P>That is not the end of the story. Now I come to Part II.  We were not in office three months until the question of increased cement supplies came forward for consideration, and Cement Limited were urged either to build a new factory or to extend Limerick and Drogheda or to do both, whichever their technical advisers, having surveyed the situation with the Department of Health, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Industry and Commerce, might consider to be the probable demand. I well remember the case being made that they ought to take the highest forecast, because, in the last analysis, should an unsaleable surplus ever manifest itself from our own production, there is not any reason why it should not be turned to the purpose of making a great road system in the years after the war if depression or unemployment threatened to become a national problem.</P>

      <P>Do you know the reply we got from Cement Limited?  Remember, they are a monopoly; no man in Ireland can buy a bag of cement except through them.  Do you know the reply we got from them?  We were told that they had made a deal with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, that if they increased their output he would authorise them to distribute to their shareholders 10 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not listen?  My recollection is that our attitude to Cement Limited was that we were not prepared to chop logic with Cement Limited about whatever negotiations or discussions they had <Col N="922" /> with Deputy Lemass who, doubtless, had excellent reasons for the attitude adopted by him; that whatever the considerations were that influenced his mind to that end, they did not influence ours; and that we were of opinion that 8 per cent. was plenty for a monopoly to earn on the production of a commodity which was as necessary in many spheres of our national life as bread was to the poor&mdash;houses, hospitals, buildings of every sort, kind and description&mdash;and we said to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I well remember that my colleague, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, brought before us a variety of proposals so as to get the capacity increased and to avoid allowing Cement Limited to force him into the position of becoming a consenting party to a rate of profit which he felt was excessive for a monopoly to enjoy.</P>

All Deputy Morrissey's colleagues know the difficulties that he had to contend with in dealing with these people and the misrepresentations which his efforts to protect our Irish people from exploitation are open to now and in the future.  The fact is that when Irish Cement Limited went to buy the cement, the galleons came floating home and they told us what it cost them.  That cost had to be spread over the price of Irish cement and foreign cement in order to keep the price of cement anywhere within the reach of the people at all.  There was a commission on the purchase of that cement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I really forgot that end of the story.  Heavens, let me tell that story!  I remember that, finally, the question was whether we were going to go on receiving the cement coming in through the North Wall or there was <Col N="926" /> an end going to be made of the matter. I think the Minister was conceding the 10 per cent.  I do not think he enjoyed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was promised in the letter written by Mr. Lemass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that the pressure of demand seemed to us to make it necessary to concede but what happened?  You would have expected that Cement Limited would have tried to make up lost time.  This was a national company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not told about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And that everything would be done to expedite expansion of production.  At that stage a Belgian company asked: &ldquo;May we build a cement factory?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer was &ldquo;certainly&rdquo; and the Belgian company started to ask immediately whether any guarantees would be given them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister and my colleague, Deputy Morrissey, can intervene in this debate subsequently. I want to tell the story in my own way. Was there a proposal that they should get guarantees?  They were told they would get no guarantees.  The moment it was suggested that everyone else would be allowed to manufacture cement in Ireland, Irish cement Limited got into convulsions.  I think they were still in convulsions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not, about that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to recollect that although it was not confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perfectly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one interesting fact connected with the industry.  One man met another who intended to <Col N="927" /> develop industry in Ireland and said to the second party to keep clear that they could not be depended on; that you could not get your whack in that country.  Another man got a message not to produce cement in Ireland or somebody would break his neck.  I was happy to send back a message, or get it sent back, telling him that if there was neck-breaking it would not be he who would do the breaking but it might be his neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing about that in the records I can tell you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I confess that.  I put that in because it was put in issue by Deputy Briscoe and because it did me good to get it off my chest.</P>
      <P>What I want to talk about&mdash;and I am sorry the Tánaiste is gone&mdash;is the MacEntee-Lemass racket that is proceeding in this country since Oireachtas Éireann adjourned last July.  I think the time has come to stop being mealy-mouthed about this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And about everything else as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to tell the people of this country, through the medium of our own Parliament, what is common knowledge in the corridors of Leinster House and which it has not been deemed expedient to let people know.  The whole purpose of this racket, designed to present our country to the world abroad as a silly, bankrupt hulk to the great detriment of the ordinary people, was the prologue to a plan operated by the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, to ensure that when the Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, retired from his present position, Mr. Lemass and not Mr. Aiken would succeed him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common knowledge in the corridors of this House that the Taoiseach contemplates early retirement from public life.  It is common knowledge in the corridors of this House that the Fianna Fáil Party is internally split and that Deputy Lemass claims the succession to the leadership, and that that claim is contested by Deputy Aiken.  It is common knowledge that, when the present Government was formed, <Col N="928" /> Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Ryan told the Taoiseach that they did not intend to remain in public life, and only accepted their portfolios as stopgaps until such time as he had time to reconstitute his Government.  I have every sympathy with Deputy MacEntee in that he has given 15 long years to the public service, and the Government having got themselves re-established, he has to throw up his secular occupation for the second time for an income of £1,500 a year, and then, perhaps, in two or three years' time struggle to rehabilitate himself again.</P>
    <P>I think the general circumstances in respect of Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Ryan make it evident that they do intend to retire.  I now allege that Deputy MacEntee undertook to help Deputy Lemass to that legitimate ambition. It is a legitimate ambition for a young and energetic man like Deputy Lemass, with 20 years' experience in the public life of this country, to aspire to the first place as Premier.  There is nothing shameful or degrading in that, but it is a shocking thing that, in the course of political manoeuvring for the purpose of getting a build-up as a potential deliverer of this country, the little people all over this country, who want nothing but freedom to earn their livings, should be prejudiced and injured because it is necessary that this game be played out within the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The plan was simple.  As soon as the parliamentary recess came, there was to be a succession of speeches, carefully spaced, suggesting, in an oversimplified way, imminent ruin, and neatly interlarded with these there were to be chosen occasions for the Tánaiste to appear and say: &ldquo;Yes, there is a crisis.  Things are pretty bad.  but we will pull through,&rdquo; and everyone went around saying: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, we have Seán Lemass.&rdquo;  Then, when Seán Lemass was securely and honourably established in the position of Taoiseach, there would be at his service a man of long experience in public finance, in private finance, ordinary mercantile and professional finance, a man of surpassing integrity and a man with a wide knowledge of business <Col N="929" /> affairs.  Who could be a more suitable representative of the Government on the 12 or 15 Government companies which operate various enterprises in this country and which require the services of such a widely-experienced man as Deputy MacEntee would be if he retired from ministerial responsibility and returned to the practice of his private profession, than Deputy MacEntee?  I see nothing dishonourable in a man aspiring to continue to serve the public interest in a new sphere on withdrawing from the rough-and-tumble of public life, to which he, God knows, has made ample contribution. Many Deputies sometimes think that what I tell them is far-fetched. They often come to discover later on that it was surprisingly true.  Remember that it is only three months since I warned this House that, if they let the Taoiseach tamper with the record&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy not wandering a little?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are those who doubt what I tell them to-day, let them remember their doubts of three months ago and the confirmation we got to-day.  This is another forecast. The whole of this campaign was started for that purpose, and it was skilfully deployed, until, at the psychological moment, the Minister for Finance dropped a brick&mdash;and it is the father and mother of a brick.  This whole campaign was built up to coincide with the annual issue of the report of the Central Bank.  The fundamental difference between the two documents mentioned in the amendment tabled by the Leader of the Opposition is that the report of the Central Bank is the work of a disinterested and high-minded public servant.  You may hate the economic philosophy he holds and you may reject every economic conclusion he reaches, but you can see in his report the cold, unswerving resolution to record the truth as he sees it, whatever the unpopularity involved thereby and whatever the difficulty created for himself thereby.  Having undertaken a duty, he will do no less than he himself regards as adequate, and, God knows, <Col N="930" /> he has done it; but it would be a poor Oireachtas and a poor country that would not correctly value the services of that kind of man.  He is very rare&mdash; the man who is aptly described in a poetical title as the man who is always no man's man.</P>
      <P>I like to remember that when the end of his period of office came a year or 18 months ago, the Government of which I was a member restored to him the position which it might, with perfect propriety, have allowed to pass to another.  I like to think that it was the Government of which I was a member which put back in that position an authority with whose integrity we were so familiar that we knew that, for the duration of our Government, we would annually contend with blistering criticism in the field of pure economics, blistering criticism from a high-principled public servant, criticism which had to be argued out with our people, and no honest Government need fear the consequences.</P>
      <P>Adulation from a creature of the Executive would be a real menace to freedom in this country, and I venture to swear that Deputies will agree with me that the probability of any living creature receiving adulation from the present chairman of the Central Bank is a contingency so remote that no rational Government would seriously reckon with it.  But far different was the White Paper, and that was the brick that was dropped.  I wonder does Deputy Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary, who now so graciously occupies the Front Bench, attend meetings of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to do a little speculation as to the fate of that White Paper.  I suggest that what happened was this: the material that was accumulated in the Department of Finance, by the direction of Deputy Costello when he was Taoiseach, was produced to the present Minister for Finance when he asked for it.  He must have been told that the officers of Finance and Industry and Commerce and other high State officials had been charged with the task of ceaseless vigilance for <Col N="931" /> the last nine months, to discern and report to the Executive the first symptom of an inflationary trend.  I suggest that Deputy MacEntee&mdash;who is a vain little man&mdash;thought Deputy Lemass was getting too much of the limelight.  Deputy Lemass, being a master of strategy, said: &ldquo;Let our apotheosis come with the Report of the Central Bank; they will start pegging rocks at the Report of the Central Bank, and when the whole Front Government Bench is piled high with their rocks, I will climb out of the rock pile and say: &lsquo;I agree with you, boys,&rsquo; and watch them collapse.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No.  Where was the place for Sancho Panza in that picture, if Deputy Lemass was to have the rôle of Don Quixote?  But Sancho Panza was determined to be there, donkey and all; and when he got the material in his Department it was not very helpful, because it all seemed to say the very reverse of what he wanted it to tell. I could nearly go through that document and pick out the paragraphs he wrote and he inserted and show this Dáil the balance which came from the unwilling hands of certain officers of the Department of Finance, who constitutionally live in the shadow of the terror of imminent national ruin, and who were delighted in their hearts but consternated in their minds to discover that the country that ought to have gone smash had not gone smash, that the country they always believed God had ordained to be poor and its people living hard, had managed to lift itself up a bit by its own boot straps and was finding it fun.  In their hearts they were as glad as we were, but in their heads they felt that something had gone wrong, because all their fundamental beliefs persuaded them that the nation ought to have been running down, getting blowzy and showing all the signs of early dissolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To their amazement, it appeared to be getting young and going places. But they preserved the apprehension that every corner we turned would have a precipice before it, and they were exhausted wrapping themselves in bandages, urging us to insulate everyone else against the precipice <Col N="932" /> about to come; only to discover to their astonishment that it was not coming.  When they found these facts, even though they conflicted with the prophecies that had been so confidently made&mdash;true to the great tradition of the Civil Service of this country, the facts were reported to the Government of which I was a member and there was no attempt to make them different from what they were found to be, no attempt to conceal that the facts as they were did not confirm the best advice that we had been given and had chosen, after careful consideration, to ignore.  That was the state when we left Upper Merrion Street.  This is what Fianna Fáil has made of it&mdash;not Fianna Fáil, but Deputy MacEntee.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I wonder was the Parliamentary Secretary, at the meeting of the Government, affrightened when that was circulated for the information of the Government.  The Taoiseach was in Zürich.  The Tánaiste presided at the meeting.  Was there a row?  Did the Tánaiste say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;For God's sake, don't circulate that thing; did you not see the grand article I got written in our domestic <i>Pravda</i> on the Central Bank's Report?  Let them bite on that&mdash;then I will come out from the rock pile and say, &lsquo;Me, too&rsquo;, and then they are sunk, because I do the Annie Oakley all over again, just as after the general election we fought and were beaten on the 1948 Fianna Fáil programme and went into Dáil Éireann, invoked the busted flush, four diamonds and a bleeding heart, and it is now straight open at both ends.  Incidentally, I would remind them it is a very much more difficult hand to fill, and publish again in <i>Pravda</i> the 15-point programme.  I thought of suing them for copyright, but it had this distinction&mdash;it was the inter-Party programme, with Annie Oakley's addition: &lsquo;Anything they can do, we can do better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Lynch was present when the Tánaiste counselled prudence and restraint.  The Minister <Col N="933" /> for Finance reminded the Tánaiste that it was not by the authority of the Government the White Paper was issued by the Minister for Finance, but by the authority inherent in the Minister, and it was presented, not by the Government to the House, but by the Minister for Finance.  Then there was a compromise and someone said: &ldquo;Well, look, let us leave it till the chief comes back&rdquo;, and the Minister for Finance said that he would pay them the courtesy&mdash;no more than that &mdash;of holding it up until the following Tuesday.  He did not tell them then that he had not foreseen this difficulty and on his way into the meeting had already passed out copies to the Press.  But the political correspondents of this country are, as every public man has reason to know, pillars of discretion; and nothing happened once the Minister for Finance told them that the document was not for publication until the following Monday, I think. Then there came a hasty message to the same parliamentary correspondents, saying: &ldquo;Hold everything; it is not now for Monday&mdash;it might be for Tuesday, but it will be for Wednesday.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then a series of incidents transpired and resulted in the cat getting out of the bag and the Minister for Finance had to ring up the Tánaiste and say: &ldquo;I promised to keep the cat in the bag until the Chief came home and there was a meeting on Tuesday, but the blooming animal got out through the bottom; I did not want to sanction the publication until I told the boys that, despite my undertaking last Friday not to publish until the Government had met on Tuesday, it has got out in spite of me.&rdquo;  But he would have added: &ldquo;Remember, I am the Minister for Finance and I have the right to do it.&rdquo;  And then he dropped the brick&mdash;and, oh, is this a brick!</P>
    <P>I want to put this straight at issue. The case has been made in the country by Deputies like Deputy Briscoe and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &mdash;oh, what a glorious odyssey through Europe he had with its culmination in Belgium incognito.  I wonder did he wear a beard to deceive the natives when he crossed the border into Belgium? One could picture the multitudes <Col N="934" /> assembled at the news that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would pass this way, and then a stooped and limping bearded figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no, I am only putting the beard on.  I will go through his speech, I warn you.  Let us return. I want to put this in issue.  The case is made that this country is in grave economic distress, that it is unique in Europe in its trade position and that fiscally and in the sphere of international trade, radical and desperate measures are urgently required.  I want these words taken note of.  On the 14th June, when our Government was last seized of information, with the sole exception of the United States of America, there was no country in the world whose economic circumstances were as good as Ireland's. That is the first proposition.</P>
      <P>I stake my name on it.  There was no country in the world, the United States included, whose people had a happier or a better life than our people in their own country.  There was no country in the world which was a free democracy, which had the immense privilege that the Government of which I was a member enjoyed on behalf of the people of using the resources of our people to make their own country a better home to live in. while others were constrained to use their resources to build a citadel within which they might defend themselves against the pending attack of the Cominform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes, when I hear people in this House sneering at the adversities of Great Britain, of France or of other countries that stand between us and the Iron Curtain rolling forward from the East, I am ashamed.  While we are entitled to rejoice in the opportunity to use our resources for construction, we should not have the indecency to sneer and gibe at neighbours who are using the same resources from their store not to feed and house their people, but to defend their freedom, when we know that <i>nolens volens</i> our freedom will last as long as theirs, <Col N="935" /> not an hour longer and&mdash;bad as they have been in the past&mdash;not an hour less.  Can you imagine the madness of a Government who are heirs to that opportunity belittling it, when they see the Government of the United Kingdom pouring out its wealth on defence, and yet telling their people that there is nothing but austerity ahead?</P>
    <P>When our travelling polyglot Minister for Posts and Telegraphs comes back from Copenhagen where he went to read a circular that has been in the library of Dáil Éireann for the last three months&mdash;an the astonishing things is that when he got to Copenhagen he read it in an English translation and travelled home to tell us, not that we could read it in the library, but that if we were as fortunate as he and had been in Copenhagen we would learn (column 594) that in 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Danish Government owed very large sums of money to the Swedish Government, the Dutch Government and the Swiss Government. They had borrowed as much as they could from four different international agencies.  Their foreign debt had risen to the enormous amount of 1,501,000,000,000 kroner in 1948.  That was the total volume of their foreign debt.</P>
    <P>At the end of that time they were still in some considerable difficulty. They had rationing on articles like coffee, textiles and clothing.  They still have rationing to-day of many of these commodities....  They have faced those difficulties because at the end of the war they were anxious to expand and to go ahead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Across the border to Belgium and he had to tell a tale there but he took the precaution of proceeding incognito. Let us see him.  I think we are entitled to envisage him limping with a beard until he waylaid four workmen.  Two were Socialists and, so that you may get the atmosphere of the situation better, two belonged, not to the Catholic Party but to the <i>Parti Catholique</i>&mdash;it is in slanty letters, but that is not all.</P>
    <P>Having identified their Party affiliations in their native language he engaged them in conversation in French, <Col N="936" /> if you please, and for the purpose of discerning the economic background of Europe he said to this evenly-balanced group from behind the tunic of his beard: &ldquo;Come, tell me, leaving out of consideration the revenues of the Congo and the proceeds of your steel-manufacturing industry, your coal mines and such mineral deposits as are available, setting them aside, how is it that Belgium looks so prosperous?&rdquo; Here was the epoch-making reply.  I am going to give it to the House in French just to show that there is culture on this side of the House as well.  The epoch-making rejoinder was, <i>Mais Monsieur, nous travaillons,</i> the implication being that the Minister for Posts and Telegraph attributed the Lemass and MacEntee crisis to the fact that the Irish were lazy loungers and it was time that they learned from Belgian workers, Catholic and Socialist, that the key to progress and prosperity was quite simple, <i>Mais Monsieur, nous travaillons.</i>  That, said the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, is an observation which might well be digested in this country.  He set his face for Ostend where he doffed his beard, shed his limp, squared his shoulders and came back to tell the lazy Irish that all the crisis and ruin that threatened could be dissipated if they would just do two things: appreciate the new Lochinvar, Seán Lemass, and work, which he felt they had never done before.</P>
    <P>I wish he would come down some time from his exalted exinence in Rathmines or Rathgar and see how long he would live on a seven-acre farm in a congested area or on a patch of rocks in Connemara or the Rosses. If he did, he would be better equipped to end that classic conversation when the Belgian workmen, in quartet, proclaimed the solution of our difficulties, <i>Mais Monsieur, nous travaillons.</i>  It is because the Fianna Fáil Party comprise &ldquo;silly billies&rdquo; like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Deputy Briscoe and his kind that Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, and Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, have dared to embark on the dirty game, the dirty trick, they have played on our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> I am going to put this matter to the proof and I can prove it.  I can prove it with evidence independent of anything in this House.  The burden of the charge made against the last Government is that they stood by and suffered the balance of trade in this country to go haywire.  Let me quote <i>Pravda.</i> This is what the unfortunate dupes of the Fianna Fáil Party are fed and they consume nothing else.  Out in the cold they go like a sack of potatoes if they do not buy their copy every morning. On October 24th, this is what the dupes read from one end of the country to the other.  Referring to the Report of the Central Bank, <i>Pravda</i> said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Tánaiste, in recent addresses, warned the people of the grave economic situation in which the country was placed, Mr. Costello, rushing in to defend Coalition policy, talked about &lsquo;hysteria&rdquo; and accused Mr. Lemass of &lsquo;trying to raise a scare&rsquo;.  We wonder if he will be as flippant about the Report of the Central Bank?  The report deals with the conditions that existed at the close of the financial year that ended on March 31st.  The accumulated deficit in the balance of payments was then just short of £90,000,000. Since then the situation has seriously worsened and, according to a recent statement of the Tánaiste's, the deficit will mount up to as much as £160,000,000, unless drastic measures are taken to deal with the situation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy say what he is quoting from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the <i>Irish Press</i> of October 24th, 1951, popularly known as the Fianna Fáil <i>Pravda.</i>  I am asking the House to look at this; £160,000,000.  That is what <i>Pravda</i> said on October 24th. Now the beauty of the Fianna Fáil position is that you have <i>Pravda</i> and then there is a whole string of <i>Izvestias</i> who will say anything they like, and then there are the Government who are quite prepared to sing an agreeable trio of different songs, reserving to themselves the right to opt for whichever is most popular when they have tested public feeling.  To keep <Col N="938" /> track of them and earn your living at the same time requires considerable agility of mind.</P>
      <P>That is the charge, bolstered with falsehood, bolstered with fraud, bolstered with every scare and alarm with which it could be attended, and introduced to our people on the Tánaiste's authority as a prospective deficit of £160,000,000 which he to-day says he expects will be about £60,000,000.  Can you imagine a Government operated by a Tánaiste who can change his economic forecast from a deficit of £160,000,000 to one of £60,000,000 and a Minister for Finance who undertakes to read out to this House the adverse trade balance for the month of July and who reads the total imports figure and then gets as mad as a gnat when I said to him, &ldquo;Put on your spectacles, you are reading the wrong column.&rdquo;  It did not strike him when he read out the figure for our total imports that it was not the adverse trade balance.  Can you imagine the approach to economic policy that must go on in a conference of which these two men are the principal advisers and my poor successor, the Minister for Agriculture, is sitting looking up at them as two oracles who cannot err?  The poor man must be addled sitting there and the result of their deliberations must be truly fantastic, as indeed they appear to me to be.</P>
      <P>One hundred and sixty million pounds!  It came down to £60,000,000. But the crowning evil is that it has gone up in the last 12 months.  I want the House now to think over something.  We have been told that the adverse trade balance has gone haywire, just as we have been told that agricultural production is not what it should be.  It is wonderful what people will believe if they are told often enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the adverse trade balance picture?  What was the adverse trade balance in 1947?  £90,000,000 sterling and <i>Pravda</i> and all the little <i>Izvestias</i> and all the oracles were hurrying around the country saying it was the best thing that ever happened?  Splendid !  Deputy Lemass made the famous Letterkenny speech.  Bear in mind it <Col N="939" /> was £90,000,000 then.  In 1948 it declined. In 1949 it was estimated that the real official deficit was £10,000,000. In 1950 it went up again.</P>
    <P>Now, I call the Fourth Estate to give testimony.  It has long been the ambition of the Fourth Estate to be recognised in a free and democratic country as an element which can materially sustain democratic government if it is given the chance to help. The chance it always asks to be given is the opportunity of knowing, albeit on the understanding that the information cannot be published, what the background is, to let them know the essential elements of the background against which news is operated so that they may interpret it correctly, but they must keep the background secret for reasons of national interest.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Fourth Estate of Ireland&mdash;the editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the editor of the <i>Irish Press</i>, of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the <i>Irish Times</i>; is it or is it not true that they were invited to the Taoiseach's room approximately 12 months ago?  Is it or is it not true that he there told them that he knew of their desire to serve the national interest, whatever their political affiliations were, if they were but satisfied that it was an interest superior to any political Party's programme. Taking them at their word he told them that the Government felt that the time had come to stockpile and that, having no medium of exchange to put into the hands of our buying commissions and delegates other than inconvertible sterling&mdash;we had no tungsten and we had no oil and we had no indispensable article of international trade with which we could barter, and precious few of the others&mdash;we had to go out into a market short of supplies wherein both the United States and Great Britain were stockpiling and try to get the goods&mdash;a year or 12 months' supply of essential commodities.</P>
    <P>Did or did not the Taoiseach tell them that?  Did he not say to them: &ldquo;We know that the im-balance of our international trade which will be manifested in the summer and autumn of 1951 has in it terrific political repercussions for us as a Government; <Col N="940" /> normally we would ask you to start explaining to the people now what we are doing and why we are doing it and what the consequences will be in the trade picture as returned by the Statistics Office in the summer and autumn of this year; the reason why we have asked you to come here to-day was to tell you that in order to avoid forewarning the foreign interests who have the things we want to buy and thus inducing them to put the price up against us&mdash;and in the summer of next year when our people are told the background of this story they will endorse what we have done&mdash;even if wind of the word reaches you that work of this character is proceeding, if you want to help us, &lsquo;Keep it mum&rsquo; so that the buying missions that are abroad will at least get the best value they can get in the circumstances for the money that we have got to spend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You heard Deputy Dr. Browne yesterday trying to spatter his erstwhile colleagues with mud.  He knew that the facts of which he had knowledge would not serve the purpose the Minister for Finance sought to establish. Instead of getting up like a man and saying: &ldquo;I have quarrelled with them, I think they treated me rottenly but when I was their agent and their colleague in this they were right,&rdquo; like a silly, hysterical girl, he said: &ldquo;Yes, it was done, but it was I did it and maybe the Minister meant something other than what he said.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose we should not be here discussing Cabinet secrets.  What is one to do?  Suppose a Minister for Finance gets up and says there was no stockpiling and that those who stockpiled, like Deputy Dr. Browne, did it on their own initiative, what are you to do when you know that that is a blooming lie and when you were present at the Government meeting at which the Taoiseach asked each Minister to come prepared with a schedule of what he and his advisers thought should be done and what he and his advisers jointly determined between them in his own particular province it was essential to buy.  The Taoiseach invited the Government jointly to consider each Minister's submissions so as to determine the essentials and eliminate the non-essentials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> When we came to Health, if my memory is right, there were two categories&mdash;one, medicine and medical supplies, and the other building materials for the hospital programme.  In regard to medicine and medical supplies, the Taoiseach told Deputy Dr. Browne that he was to be the judge and, having due regard to all the claims upon our reserves, he was to try to ensure that the public institutions and the hospitals would have a year's supply.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Dr. Browne explaining at a Government meeting that he had negotiated with the builder to buy up all the materials that would be required for all the hospitals for which he was responsible.  I remember my saying to him: &ldquo;Be careful.  If you use one builder and he gets all the profit on this vast volume of material, no matter what you say afterwards, allegations will be made against you. Never mind what your friends will say of what you are about to do, but ask yourself what will your enemies say of what you are about to do, and if you cannot think up an answer right away well calculated to confound them, change your plans.&rdquo;  I remember saying to him: &ldquo;There is an association of building contractors' suppliers, representative of all building suppliers, in Ireland, go and ask them to choose one or more of their number to act on a buying commission for all this material.&rdquo;  I remember him coming back and thanking me, saying: &ldquo;Of course, you are in business and you would think of this; I might quite innocently have left myself open to the malicious misrepresentation which this precaution protects me against.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the background in which that former colleague was invited to stab a colleague by the present Minister for Finance, who eagerly sprang to the assignment.  But he could not deny that the supplies were here; he could not deny that somebody brought them here; he could not deny that it was not Dr. Noel Browne, but the Minister for Health, and he could not deny that that could only be done by leave of the Government of which he was a member, but he was solicitous to suggest that it was done by their countenancing rather than at their <Col N="942" /> suggestion.  He could not understand that it might be done in association with loyal colleagues who wished to share the credit and the blame of all they jointly did.</P>
    <P>I call the Fourth Estate to witness that we told them 12 months ago that the balance of trade of this country would be dramatically and radically affected, and that the adverse trade balance would certainly equal and, possibly, exceed the 1947 figure, and that we were doing it deliberately, and thanking God that we had the resources from which to finance that precaution for our people.  Were we wrong in that?  Remember the situation. The Korean war was in progress. Personally, I was not pessimistic on the probability of war, but I sat there and listened for six days.  I am glad to see my colleague now present.  Did he hear me rebuke him for his lack of generosity?  I think I spoke the truth and spoke fair.</P>

      <P>Well, when the Deputy reads it he will not be proud.  We deliberately got the stuff, and we got it in circumstances dictated not only by the certainty that it would be required of itself, but because one after another Minister of our Government had sat there while the whole Fianna Fáil Party, on this side of the House, got up and denounced us, saying that we proposed to let the people find themselves involved in war or to be surrounded by a maelstrom of war without a day's resources.  I remember that the largest political Party in the House sent forth a Boanerges like Deputy Davern and an eloquent Deputy, whose name I forget, to whisper the rumour through the country. A responsible Government which <Col N="943" /> has got to face then, not merely the supply question, but the question of the people's morale, is faced with a situation in which, whether you think it materially necessary or not if the people's morale is to be sustained, you have got to put yourself in the position to say what I found myself constrained to say last October: &ldquo;If there is never a blade of hay saved in this country not a beast need die, for we have installed in Ireland a greater stock of cereals for human and animal consumption than was ever assembled in this country heretofore.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne testified yesterday that he had bought and secured, I think it was, a 12 months' supply of medicines, or as near as he could reach that, bearing in mind the scarcities with which he had to contend.  I told the story of what followed, that he had negotiated with a builder to buy up all the materials required for the hospital building programme, and of my suggestion to him that it would be better if that were done through the representatives of the trade.  I told of how he came back and thanked me, and said to me that I had been in business and would think of that, but that it would not have occurred to him.  I told that the Deputy had full authority to employ some body of tradesmen jointly to purchase for the hospital programme as much essential material as would guarantee the programme against serious interruption and scarcity of supplies.</P>

      <P>The temptation to get into the gutter with the doctor is well-nigh irresistible, but I am resolved to <Col N="944" /> resist it.  Did we do wrong in buying those essential supplies?  I want it known all over Ireland and all over the world, that the state of the trade balances in this country to-day was the deliberate act of the Government of which I was a member, that its state was foreseen and designed and brought about by the Government of which I was a member.  If I had to do it again to-morrow, I would do it, because I am certain that we were right.  I want now to know from anyone on the Fianna Fáil Benches, the Pravdas, the Vyshinskies or Izvestias, do they think we were wrong?  I know what they will answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us turn now to this disgraceful White Paper, and we will read in paragraph 5 that the increase in the trade deficit has been due mainly to the heavier import of consumer goods and raw materials intended for the manufacture of consumer goods.  Mark this well; if you study that White Paper with the eye of a grammarian, you will find that paragraph 5 cannot be said to govern Table 5, but how many grammarians are there amongst us who will undertake to tell us in less than ten seconds the difference between a preposition and a pronoun? We would want to know a lot more before we could dissociate paragraph 5 from Table 5.  I venture to suggest that every 100 people who read that White Paper read Table 5 as being a list&mdash;a shocking list&mdash;of the prolific purchases of consumer goods.  Let us see how the table is set out.  We come to the first item&mdash;butter.  What could be more consumable than butter?  I want the House to know this and there is a record of it in the Taoiseach's Department if they want a check.  When I kept studying the problem of securing supplies of butter, I was arrested by the fact that in 1950 the Irish people had eaten more butter than they had ever eaten since Brian Boru was slaughtered at the battle of Clontarf. Perhaps Deputies will remember that I used this formula in the House before.  Now, our economy is such that inflation will not show itself here by a domestic price rise.  Inflation, in our special circumstances, is liable first to manifest itself as a striking increase <Col N="945" /> in the import of consumer goods from sterling sources, but the failure to export is a sort of inverted import.</P>
    <P>It struck me as odd that our people are in a position to eat more butter than any people in Europe and that, having reached such a high standard of living, we were not exporting any butter, whereas, in 1934, when we produced the same quantity of butter, we shipped half of it abroad and sold it for some millions of pounds.  It struck me that if we could do the same at present it would play a not insubstantial part in closing the gap in our balance of payments.  When that matter engaged my attention I went to the Taoiseach and placed the problem before him.  I said that I felt the Department of Finance should have its attention directed to the investigation of this matter, because it might be the first symptom of inflation.  But it was not.  The reason for the vast consumption of butter is that I have brought the retail price of this commodity down to a level which makes it cheap as a medium for frying, as an ingredient for cakes and so forth, in comparison with jam, dripping, margarine and all the other competing commodities.  We have brought butter down so low by subsidy that the other comestibles have been allowed to find an economic level in comparison with other substitutes for butter.  Butter is the cheapest food that one can buy for any purpose, and so it is that our people are not rushing out with surplus spending power above what they require for a decent standard of living. They are simply exercising a normal economic choice between jam, dripping, margarine and other shortening mediums in picking out of that whole range butter costing either 2/8 a lb. or 3/- a lb., which is the cheapest fat in relation to all other commodities of that nature.  We heard the Minister for Agriculture last night saying that he was going to import butter.  We need not have imported butter.  We could have cut the ration.  I want Fianna Fáil to listen to this.  The evidence of the situation was that the poorest housewife in Ireland, having shopped through the whole range of available fats, had rightly discerned that the cheapest fat for her family <Col N="946" /> was butter.  We were not producing butter in sufficient quantity to give everybody in Ireland eight ounces.</P>
    <P>There were two courses open to us as a Government.  The easy one was to come to Dáil Eireann and cut the butter ration to six ounces.  It would have saved subsidy and re-established the black market, for which there is always an opening.  We could have let the well-to-do make up the eight ounces by substituting two ounces of the alternatives which we had in abundance, or we could have bought butter from abroad and filled up the gap in the ration and charged the difference between the retail price and the price at which we had to buy it abroad to subsidy.  That is what we did, and I want to ask Fianna Fáil if we did the wrong thing.  Should we have cut the ration of those who could not afford to buy an alternative and let them do without it, or was it right carefully to weigh the relative values of the various commodities which our resources permitted us to buy and to put in high priority butter which, under our policy, was the cheapest fat a family could buy?  I fought for that, and the responsibility is mine, if it is anybody's, for importing butter.  If my memory serves me right, Deputy Dr. Browne, when he was Minister for Health, endorsed my view that rather than cut the ration we should bring in butter, while at the same time exerting ourselves to the limit to ensure that our home supply would be sufficient to meet our needs at the earliest possible moment.  Were we wrong?</P>

    <P>The second item is wheat.  What is more consumable than wheat?  There is not a higher official in the Department of Finance who did not know and tell the Minister for Finance that of the 300,000 cwt. mentioned in the note not one lb. of it was brought into this country for human consumption.  I have got to tell the story now; it did not suit to tell then and I do not think <Col N="947" /> it will suit the country internationally now, but it is better that our interests should suffer in that sphere than that the people should be fooled as they have been fooled and cruelly misled.</P>
    <P>I got that wheat under the International Wheat Agreement, under which I had a right to buy wheat and command it at $1 80 cents when I would have had to pay $2 25 cents for maize.  I was under no obligation, I had given no promise not to do it but I knew if I took up the residue of our ration which I was in a position to demand at $1 80 cents, the usual hugger mugger would start in the International Advisory Organisation and a good reason would be advanced why there was no wheat.  I got the wheat afloat and once the wheat was on its way nobody ever asked until the goms in this Government constrained me now to tell.  That wheat to-day is being sold in every town in Ireland under the euphonious title of pollard.  It can be bought in any town in Ireland, delivered in a 6 ton wagon, for £25 a ton, when maize is £37.</P>
    <P>I have got seven sows at home which I hope will shortly have 70 bonhams, and 50 per cent. of their diet is pollard. It came in as wheat at 12/- a cwt., £12 a ton less than maize cost.  Was I wrong?  Was it improvident to bring in this wheat?  The White Paper says it was.  Look at the new Taoiseach-elect. He would never have published that White Paper.  He is the old dog for the hard road.  He has learnt how dangerous it was to go campaigning with Sancho Panza, because a cavalier mounted on a donkey, if he does not know how to ride, may get run away with.  That is the donkey, and it has run away with the man who rode it, and if he does not break his political neck off this donkey I am a Dutchman.</P>

Lochinvar Lemass will ride to the rescue, and as his chief retires to a lofty eminence to look down into his heart when the inclination moves him he will see Lochinvar proudly cantering at the head of forces, which may have shed a latent rump but have acquired a whole new tail, geared at the head of a mighty host in the middle of the road.</P>

      <P>There is a lovely entry here.  Raw cocoa.  What could be more consumable or improvident to purchase at a time of crisis than cargoes of raw cocoa.  The imports were raised from £9 million to £1.6 million, an increase of £7 million worth of cocoa.  How bad we were.  I can imagine the flutter amongst Fianna Fáil Senators and Senatoresses and their saying: &ldquo;Cocoa!  how bad we were.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the c.i.f. price was up by 47 per cent. and there is a note below which says: &ldquo;Increased price reflected in higher value of chocolate crumb exports.&rdquo;  Will that suggest to you that 80 per cent. of these imports were the raw material of an industry which was exporting milk to Great Britain at a price which paid our farmers approximately 4d. per gallon more than the Government had fixed for milk to be converted into butter, and that these imports of cocoa were the imports for a new industry, not a substantial unit of which is within ten miles of a city or town?  This Government has told us that one of its great new remedies for the Lochinvar Lemass crisis is the decentralisation of industry and that they are going to bring in a Bill for that purpose.  In one 12 months the Department of Agriculture, over and above what Industry and Commerce were doing, had factories established for the processing of agricultural produce in one form or another in Dungarvan, in Carrick-on-Suir, in Clonmel and in Cahir and there was another to be established in Ballinasloe.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce will confirm that.  In the case of every factory that was put up we decided to bring the factory round to the people not the people to the factory. That is what that cocoa referred to in the White Paper was required for.  If we did not bring it in, we were going to have the milk used for chocolate crumb sold at the price we could get for it at home and we would <Col N="950" /> have to sack over 100 people.  Were we wrong to bring it in?</P>

      <P>The White Paper said it.  I can visualise the scene that transpired between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, when the Government met on that Friday to consider, as a remedy for the danger to the prosperity of this country, the early publication of Sancho Panza's Ass.  Let it be known all over Ireland, the proper description for the White Paper is Sancho Panza's Ass and I shall show you that it is desirable to make that known not only in Ireland but outside, because Sancho Panza's Ass has been taken as the text for comments on this country outside Ireland.</P>
      <P>Then we come to currants and raisins.  The country stood aghast at the sight of the Minister for Finance straining his collar stud to keep the Irish £ abreast of the English £.  The whole Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, studs popping in every row, cries out: &ldquo;Keep the Irish £ abreast of the British £&rdquo; !  The task, they thought, was a thousand times exacerbated by the profligacy of his predecessor, who in the worst crisis known to history was disposed to increase the national purchases of currants and raisins by one million sterling.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste was not in when I was explaining that there were the Pravdas, the Izvestias and the duet or trio.  You had something like this: Pravda said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Izvestias said &ldquo;Perhaps&rdquo; and the trio said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and whichever was the most popular was subsequently adopted. Sancho Panza said: &ldquo;You burdened me with raisins and currants to the tune of £1,500,000&rdquo;; Izvestias said: &ldquo;Tut, tut, not responsible, nothing whatever to do with it.&rdquo;  Am I reasonable in calling that Sancho Panza's Ass?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were these currants and raisins for?  This was the stuff that some enterprising gentleman was persecuting <Col N="951" /> Maurice Webb with as cake mixture, if you please, and on being restrained from the introduction of that comestible into Britain, he cut up an apple, mixed it with the currants and raisins and returned with a galleon laden with mincemeat.  The last I heard of him he was in the Court of Appeal in England seeking to establish that the introduction of a specified number of apples, duly shredded into a pound of currants and raisins, transmuted the substance from cake-filling to mincemeat.  This is what the currants and raisins were coming in for&mdash;coming in a back door, mixed with apple and then sold at a handsome profit.  I read an interview with the gentleman in which he was described as travelling in a car, having a great air of prosperity.  He was able to sell the goods which he imported at 3d. at as high a figure as 9d., and if these profits are reaching this country, more power to his elbow, because it cannot affect the balance of trade adversely.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the record of these imported consumer goods to show that these currants and raisins were used in the manufacture of commodities which were exported, though we are told that exports of preserved fruit are £1.8 million higher. We are also told that the imports of sugar show an increase of 40 per cent. in volume and that the c.i.f. price is 6 per cent. higher.  I think I am right in saying that a great part of the sugar was also used in industrial processes and a relatively small quantity of it used in exactly the same way as tobacco.  Unrationed sugar was sold to those who wanted more than their ration and who were obliged to pay the economic price for it, with an additional levy to relieve the Exchequer of the burden of the subsidy on rationed sugar.  Were we right to do that?</P>
    <P>We brought in tobacco, we stockpiled and we distributed continuously great quantities of tobacco.  Is there any more deflationary procedure than to make widely available an unnecessary comestible carrying a heavy degree of tax?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Out of this has grown a situation in which every joint stock bank in Ireland has proceeded to apply a credit squeeze on ordinary simple people, degrading and insulting them in the presence of their neighbours.  They are men who in their own small communities are equal to the great Panjandrums, directors of companies and mighty Ministers.  They are only little creatures but they are respected men in their own community.  One of their boasts and prides was that they would never contract a debt that they were not in a position to pay, and one of their gratifications was that their financial standing was such that if the bank manager desired to discuss a matter of business with them he came to call on them and was made welcome and entertained.  It may sound a trivial thing in the Metropolis but to us in the country it is our life.  He does not like now to be sent for by the <Col N="953" /> bank manager and to be told that if he does not come and render an account of himself his cheques will not be honoured and to discover that if he goes to any other bank he will be told that the Government have recommended caution and that the advance he seeks is not essential because it is only reasonable that his own bank will give him all the accommodation that is good for him.</P>
    <P>All that, because I am to be invited here to dance catch-as-catch-can around this debating Chamber to determine whether the Government of Ireland to-day are embarrassed by the fact that their predecessors bought too much or bought too little, and I cannot pin the Minister responsible for this Bill before the House down to a clear and final declaration as to what the basis of his complaint is.</P>
    <P>This is a dirty, shameful fraud, and it is a wicked, irresponsible thing of the Tánaiste and of the Minister for Finance to embark upon this political adventure without counting the cost to people who could not defend themselves against that betrayal of trust.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was a child thinking it was hyperbole when William Jennings Bryan used the peroration at the Democratic Convention of 1900: &ldquo;You shall not crucify humanity upon a cross of gold.&rdquo;  For no other reason than the service of what I believe to be a sordid little political adventure, ordinary people in this country have been exposed to the agony that wealthier and greater have fought to defend themselves against in declaring: &ldquo;You shall not crucify humanity upon a cross of gold,&rdquo; because what is being done in this country now is to say to ordinary people whom we&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition when he was Taoiseach and every one of my colleagues who were members of the Government&mdash;asked to go into debt, to clear the warehouses on the North Wall.  We could not stockpile if the stocks simply piled up in Dublin and Cork, and if they did not pass out into the vacant storage in the country our best effort must be frustrated.  We asked them to do it, and we told them that if they would help we would see them through.  It <Col N="954" /> was not only supporters of the Government. I am convinced, and Deputies on the far side of the House must know that dozens of Fianna Fáil business men felt that this was an issue superior to Party or political interest, and they bought more than their normal trade requirements.  Travellers going around Ireland to-day are going into small shops, who want to order the goods for delivery in the spring, but who have been told by bank managers: &ldquo;If you write a cheque for the amount due for your autumn goods we will not honour it.&rdquo;</P>

We ought to be proud that in Ireland that is the kind of democracy we have.  So authoritative is this Government, so was its predecessor.

      <P>I want to register in a most solemn way my protest against the betrayal of people who took the word of the Government of this country. I think the Government has a solemn duty to honour this bargain. They may give notice that they are going to terminate a bargain which they do not approve of, but the liabilities outstanding must be discharged and, in respect of many people in this country, they are not being discharged now, and it is wrong.  They have a right to the assurance that the Government of this country will do more than talk in restoring to independent men who take a pride in their independence the right to walk into their bank, when they have to, to get the accommodation they require for the legitimate prosecution of their business without taking off their hat or being beholden to any moneyed power in the world.  It is as well that we should face it.  I am not a radical in these matters.  I would preserve the sterling link.  I value highly our sterling assets.  I know the arguments for and I know the arguments against, but I believe that the existing method of administering bank credits in this <Col N="956" /> country has no logical foundation&mdash;but it works.  Now that is the point: I think it works.  It is very hard to get a system that works pragmatically. For that reason I want the system that we know does work to go on working. But it is right to say now that should it ever accept to itself the illusion that there is any master in this country but the legitimate Government, ours are not a people who will tolerate that illusion long.  I have said time and again to many conservatives who sought to argue the right-hand view with me: &ldquo;Watch your step, because in your solicitude to press down on our people a degree of so-called orthodoxy which our people will not accept you may precipitate an upheaval that will sweep away far more than you or I would like to see go, with no guarantee whatever that anything will be put in its place that will work half so well.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bestir themselves now and to see that these institutions work well and chop no logic with us.  We have not come to chop logic about economics.  We have no apology to make to money changers for being politicians.  We became that of our own free will and we are proud to be that in the public life of Ireland.  With that authority about us, we know our people better than money changers whether they be moneylenders, pawnbrokers or bankers.  They all come to the same thing.  They all live by usury, greater or less.  That is where Deputy Hickey and I come dangerously close to agreeing with one another.  I may contaminate him politically, but I am always afraid he will drive me mad. It ought to be treated quite apart from the rules of orthodoxy.  They had better make the system work and they had better make it work, because we want it, and it is we who count.  The only justification there is for their existence is the quality of the service they give our people.  If it ever seems to us that they have forgotten their obligation to serve and have, for a moment, succumbed to the illusion that they have a right to rule, and attempt to use their power to that end, we will sweep them out of existence <Col N="957" /> without a moment's hesitation and face the future: whatever it may be, it could not be worse than that.</P>

      <P>I should be much obliged if the Tánaiste would send for the Minister for Finance.  I should like to be a witness of the atomic fission. Would it precipitate a chain reaction and convert the whole Fianna Fáil Party into an atomic bomb?  The only thing is that I understand it would have to generate great heat before we could detonate it.  I do not think there is much in the Fianna Fáil Party, except the Leader alone, capable of generating heat.  Cold feet&mdash;perhaps&mdash; but heat!  Long, long ago they lost that.</P>

      <P>I do not think we are going to be a witness of the fission but that does not alter the physical fact that it will take place.  Vehicles&mdash; there is something I want to talk about.  A very prudent friend of mine, when he heard me say I had a few well-chosen words to offer in this debate, said: &ldquo;Now, listen, do not say we are not importing luxuries.  That is one of those lies that has got across. You will find the most rational and wise man saying: &lsquo;Damn it, look at the great big American cars.  There should be some restraint.&rsquo;&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I am not made that way.  I know it is right.  I am going to say it is right and ram it down their throats, but the people will not believe it.&rdquo;  I had hardly left and I declare to God I met a most respectable man who said: &ldquo;Look at the great number of big American cars that are being imported.&rdquo;  Did you see the figures in respect of the import of cars?  I was astonished.  They are microscopic.  In the last nine months, I think the total money expended on <Col N="958" /> the import of American passanger cars was something less than £2,000.</P>

      <P>Some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies went round with Sancho Panza's Ass, and said: &ldquo;Look at the vehicles.  They have gone up £800,000.

They would blind you going down the road.&rdquo;  At which moment, the Minister for Finance will fly by in a Dodge car, all black and gold, and will not look on the side of the road you are on.  Vehicles, which for the purpose of propaganda are 24 horse-power, American touring cars, turn out on examination to be 2,347 agricultural tractors. Were we wrong to bring in tractors? Do you remember which of these it was who advocated that we should prohibit the export of horses so that, when war broke out, we could plough the land of Ireland with a horse and plough because there would be no tractors, no oil or anything and that we ought seriously to consider retaining the larger bullocks so that they also could be used for tractor purposes? We brought in some 2,300 tractors. Were we wrong?</P>
      <P>Wood and timber and manufactures &mdash;did you hear Deputy Briscoe to-day marvelling that we did not, when we were going to spend money abroad, buy timber suitable for housing?

    <P>Textiles, apparel, rubber and manufactures, paper and cardboard, and motor spirit, are listed in the White Paper.  I can remember three separate meetings of the Government at which the matter was discussed as to whether the petrol and oil companies would not increase their storage in this country.  They could not even be persuaded to fill the storage they had got. I remember the Minister for Industry and Commerce going from the meeting of the Government to see representatives of the oil companies and saying to them that we would not be satisfied with anything less than that, making allowance for transhipment through the storage inland, they should fill up all the storage.  Then we discovered what Governments all over the world have discovered.  An international oil cartel is one of the few things which even a sovereign Government cannot buck with impunity.  They have to handle them gingerly and grasp them where it hurts.  If you do not get a right hold of them, they might not only hurt you in a bland and courteous way, but they would say that no tankers have arrived for the last seven days, that they have tried London and New York, but were confident that they could get over the difficulty.  Supplies being to run down in storage. You think of passing an Act of Parliament and they say: &ldquo;Pass two,&rdquo; and they would see if they could get us a tanker.  If you do not play ball, you can pass 40 Acts of Parliament and you can run your tractors or let them stand still.  The Minister for Industry <Col N="960" /> and Commerce had to handle oil cartels prudently, firmly, but not too Mossadequely, and signs on them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I come now to fertilisers, and they will smell down any fish the Minister produces.  I make this my second test.  I challenge the Fourth Estate to give their testimony and I offer this myself.  There is no precedent that I know of in the history of this country for the Government of the day opening the Treasury and putting at the disposal of one Minister of the Cabinet £1,000,000 sterling of money to buy fertilisers on his own account. So far as I know, that has never been done before in the history of this country or of Great Britain, but, in the course of last year, the Dutch superphosphate trust&mdash;and I think they were bluffing&mdash;for the purpose of showing how liberal they were and how they were not applying any restriction at all&mdash;pleasant and polite men&mdash;said to me in my room that we could have 100,000 tons at £9 15s. c.i.f. if we wanted it.  I was given authority to buy it and I bought it.  When I left office there were 48,000 tons of it in the possession of the Minister for Agriculture of that day.  It would be a very profitable occupation for some of the Izvestias during the next fortnight to inquire of the Minister for Agriculture of to-day why he is trying to sell at £13 a ton what I bought for £9 15s. There is a quarter of a million pounds of money in it, which might help to relieve the anxieties of his worrying friend, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and he does not say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I want to draw the attention of the House to something the Minister forgot to amend.  The House will remember how his skilled and agile hand was pinned to the table yesterday while engaged in much the same operation as left a scar on his leader's hand three months ago&mdash;changing the evidence, and, what was worse, getting caught at it.  At column 311, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think there is anything <Col N="962" /> wrong with the idea of expanding considerably our capital investment in Irish productive enterprises or in meeting Irish social needs except that up to the present not enough of it has been financed by the &lsquo;pay-as-you-earn&rsquo; basis.  The Central Bank certainly has not demonstrated to my satisfaction that the country is incapable of supporting a still larger capital investment programme than anything yet attempted.  But they have shown, and their proof of this is, I think, unshakable, that we are not attempting to finance enough of it out of current savings.  The sincerity of the protestations of the Deputies on the benches opposite to assist the Government in achieving the expansion of services which we intend to effect, and in proceeding with the capital investment programme which we believe to be necessary will be put to the test when they are asked to vote for increased taxation for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very de Valera-esque phrase and if it had been uttered by the Taoiseach he would have demonstrated most clearly 18 months from now that the taxation reference covered extra services and capital investment, but if you charged him with meaning that, before it suited him to attach that meaning to it he would grow pale and, more in sorrow than in anger, would say: &ldquo;This is the kind of thing that sometimes makes me curse the day I entered public life &rdquo;&mdash;that anyone should so infamously misrepresent, should so cruelly misrepresent what is as clear as crystal, that the words &ldquo;extra taxation&rdquo; applied only to extra services and could not conceivably in that context be imagined to have any application to capital investment.</P>
    <P>Remember that this is the incumbent, this is the Caesar to Deputy de Valera's Augustus.  Remember that, in the days of Caligula, it was the custom to teach the Caesar to wear purple before gold was added to his toga.  We know that Caesar must learn, like Augustus, to change the evidence and even to get caught.  We know that Caesar, like Augustus, is ambitious, not for money, not for wealth, incorruptible, but avid <Col N="963" /> of power, and it fascinates me that Caesar is already beginning to learn the capacity of Augustus for the <i>double entendre</i>, which may never have to be used, but which is there in case it should be wanted and so expressed that he can be outraged if anyone reads that meaning into it, before he wants that meaning read into it, and so expressed that he can be equally grieved and shocked that anyone would doubt he meant that, when, 18 months later, it is convenient for him to say so.</P>
    <P>Mark that passage.  It was put there to justify Augustus if he advocates taxation.  When his is the responsibility, he will remind you of what Caesar said.  You do not have to worry about a Budget so long as the present Augustus is afoot.  He got &ldquo;bet&rdquo; once on an autumn Budget and he will never get &ldquo;bet&rdquo; again, that way, in any case.  You will have no general election until they split, and by that time Augustus will have gone to the park or out to grass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Every evidence of economy of an exotic kind, I think, can be rightly attributed to the activities of the present Ministers.  Even when Fianna Fáil Deputies start sending private correspondence under the Ministerial frank, who will blame them? Every man must turn an honest penny, in the distress upon us, and are adjured to work their hardest in the national effort&mdash;and I have no doubt the postman gladly carried the letter no one paid him to deliver.  It has become fashionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture.  I agree with those who say the land is what matters.  We have only two assets that count in Ireland&mdash; our people and our land; they are the only sources of wealth we have, and if they will not provide it, nothing else will.  I confess I am jealous of the capacity of our land to provide for our people the standard of living that I have always hoped to see them have. It has become the fashion, I am sorry to say, not only on the far side of the House but elsewhere, to join in lamentations about the rigid refusal of the volume of agricultural production to change.  Even some of my good friends have said: &ldquo;Not but that we admire the zeal and energy of the late Minister for Agriculture, but he did not seem to have much result because, after all, <Col N="966" /> the volume is only up to what it was before the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What astonishes me is the success with which <i>Pravda</i> and the whole gang have succeeded in selling the proposition that the appropriate comparison is of 1950 with 1938, overlooking the intervening fact that, taking 1938/9 as 100, in 1940 it was 95, in 1942 it was 91, in 1943 it was 89, in 1944 it was 91, in 1945 it was 97, in 1946 it was 95, in 1947 it was 89, and then they passed the baby over to me.  That figure&mdash;89 &mdash;is the lowest figure that ever was recorded since grass grew in Ireland; and that is what I got when I came into office.  There were cattle in this country grazing knee-deep in grass and dying of starvation&mdash;that no man had ever seen before&mdash;from aphosphorosis. I do not want to recapitulate the story. There were never less four-legged beasts in Ireland since man was first known to inhabit it than when I came into office.  Do Deputies remember that?  And in three short years under the inter-Party Government, starting from the bottom, gross production rose from 89 to 99.3, and in 1950 it was 98.7.  That is gross agricultural production. Now, do not let any trickster, any three-card trickster, sell you the figures of net agricultural production, because the more rapidly this country was sinking into bankruptcy the higher the net figures were going, since net meant what you took out of the soil less what was put in, so that if you put nothing in your net grew and grew and grew, but if you were a good farmer and fed your cattle and spread their manure on the land and bought fertilisers and kept the place up to date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They take a farm in Tipperary, take seven crops of wheat off it, then swap it with the Land Commission for a farm in County Meath, take seven crops of wheat off it, then sell it preferably to the Land Commission or, if not, to some damned fool from England, who buys it through a local auctioneer.  That is mining your land, and by that method you can get a net return from your land that would dazzle you, but it is not farming, and when you take the gross return, looking at it over a period, one year after another, it means that you can see what is happening.  You can see whether people are mining the land or farming it.  If they are farming it, the gross return should slowly rise; if they are mining it, it comes slowly down by the law of diminishing returns which would work dramatically on a farm operated by the Tánaiste.  In 1948&mdash;I am not blaming Fianna Fáil, because during the war they could not get feeding stuffs: I am not aspersing their record at all&mdash;when you see that the volume of agricultural production was on the way up, do not be sold that dummy.  You cannot judge agricultural production by taking an isolated year. You must at least take a quinquennial and look at the trend.  All I can claim is that I was given the agricultural industry of this country into my care when it was in a state of dereliction unprecedented in Irish history; in the three and a half years during which I was charged with responsibility for it and the inter-Party Government was the Government responsible to the people of the country, there was a record of steady maintained progress, and I guarantee that nothing but Fianna Fáil malice or incompetence can prevent its continued growth and expansion which we initiated and maintained to the day we left office.</P>

    <P>Deputy Aiken thought to scandalise us.  That member of the Fianna Fáil brigade&mdash;<i>Ecce</i>!  He has come in and the two atoms are side by side.  They tell me that in Nevada, when the bomb <Col N="968" /> is just going to go off, that is what happens only nobody lives to describe the scene.  I understand that Deputy Aiken condemned me personally or by inference because I persuaded the Government to retrieve the fortunes of a group of farmers who, through no fault of their own, had their potatoes thrown back on their hands by asking the Government to direct the alcohol factories to enable the Potato Distributing Board to pay £8 per ton to those farmers, thus putting 4d. per gallon on industrial alcohol, thus increasing the cost of petrol to the distributor by one-eighth of a penny per gallon.  The Government said to the petrol distributor: &ldquo;You are getting 3½d. per gallon profit.  You are getting 2/4 every time you go to the pump and turn the handle.  Your neighbours have met with a fortuitous disaster which can be repaired by your contributing one-eighth of a penny out of your 3½d. profit for a restricted period in orded to enable us to turn those rejected potatoes into alcohol.&rdquo;  And they lent a hand.  Does Dáil Éireann think we were unreasonable in that? The story was told, I think, to the poor yobs at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.  They were told that I had got the Government to put 4d.&mdash;if you look very closely you will see that it says &ldquo;on alcohol&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does this House think that it was unreasonable to ask a body of traders who were earning 2/4 every time they unlocked the pump, in a crisis which none of us could have prevented and which no foresight on the part of the farmers could have prevented, to help their neighbours by <Col N="969" /> carrying that little burden on their profit for a strictly limited period of time.  The responsibility is mine.  I persuaded, I argued, I urged the Minister for Industry and Commerce to consult&mdash;naturally he was concerned primarily to defend those whose interests were committed to his care&mdash; and I, the interests of the farmers.  I think I made the case that they were mostly small farmers, poor farmers from Cooley, North Mayo and other places like that, who were not able to carry the burden.  In any case I did it&mdash; proudly and with no apology.  Does any Fianna Fáil Deputy think I was wrong?</P>

      <P>I see that my distinguished successor has been edged out of the front bench into the parliamentary secretaries.  I suppose that there is a change in Government policy.  In my day the voice of agriculture at least was heard. I understand that at the present time it is allowed to speak only on sufferance. It is a pity because he is a friendly, agreeable kind of man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Mirabile dictu.</i>  I think I have made my case.  As they say on the radio, let us recapitulate.  I say that this is the most prosperous country in Europe.  I say&mdash;I am restrained only by the reluctance to name names&mdash;that I could name half a dozen people who had the world to choose from for settled stable conditions in which to settle down for their retirement and for the safe-keeping of their substantial property, and who brought it to Ireland, and brought their families as well.  I say that the day we left office the standard of living of our people on the land was higher than it had ever been in human memory.  I say that the day we left office working in this country and for this country was adventure and romance to the vast majority of our people.  I say that the day we left office for the first time every farmer in the country knew that <Col N="970" /> he could get a good living on his own holding, and that he was a free, independent man.  I say that in the judgement of every external observer&mdash; and some of them gave public expression to their thoughts&mdash;Ireland was one country which was on the march and going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I say that this whole rotten racket was started for no other purpose than as a cheap political stunt to glorify the Tánaiste at the expense of the Minister for External Affairs.  I say that great damage has been done, and I am not sure that much of it is susceptible to recall.  I repudiate and disown the advocacy of a breach with the sterling link.  I am certain that, from the point of view of the agricultural industry, it is in the best interests of our people at present to maintain that link.  I do not by any means accept the proposition that the machinery at present employed by the Central Bank for the maintenance of that link is either the only machinery or the most satisfactory machinery for maintaining it.  I solemnly warn the Government and this House that there is no use in trying to hold up Niagara. When it comes down to tin tacks we can ask any economist in this country this question: why does the Central Bank invest £80,000,000 of money in the bill market in London and short-term British Government securities and derive a yield of about 1¼ per cent on the whole holding while the Government and the municipal authorities in Dublin find themselves restricted for work they want to do for the want of credit?  Do not try to hold up Niagara with an eggcup, because the only result of trying to do that is to break the eggcup and then watch Niagara go.</P>
    <P>I think that there is provision in the Central Bank Act for an initiative by the board to employ part of the currency reserve for a purpose other than investment in the London bill market, but that must be done on the board's initiative; it cannot be instructed by the Government.  To tell you the truth &mdash;and I say this with the fullest sense of responsibility&mdash;there is plenty of political kudos to be got by chewing the rag in this House on questions <Col N="971" /> relating to credit and currency.  But it may do the country much damage, because there are enough &ldquo;daftees&rdquo; abroad in this country who would cheerfully wreck the whole ship and then run up to the top of the mast and sit in the crow's nest and yell for help after having drowned the whole crew. Credit and money are like the atom bomb.  So long as it is rolling around the floor and the child is using it for a football it looks quite harmless and a convenient piece of furniture.  But if somebody hits it on the right place and at the right time the right kind of blow, it goes off and you would never know there was a child in the parish when you go to see what made the bang.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to tell the Government&mdash;I know it is futile to do it&mdash;is that as certain as the philosophy underlying the report of the Chairman of the Central Bank is operated in this country disaster will come upon us, because nobody but a half-conscious instinctive slave would submit to the arbitrary fate that a fictitious gold standard procedure is likely to bring upon you.  Gold standard my foot! Do we not all know that at the beginning of the last war, when the British Government had sold the last of their securities, they sent for the Governor of the Bank of England and said: &ldquo;Start the presses going, but make it look respectable,&rdquo; and the Treasury deposit procedure was devised.  I do not understand it and I am blowed if I can get anyone in the Department of Finance to explain it to me.  It may be they do not want to as I might get bad thoughts in my head.  The conquest of Germany was largely achieved with paper money.  It is the same paper money on which we are supposed to be floating as safe as if we were on gold.  Out of that paper money has been wrung the conquest of the world.</P>

Every nation in the world, East and West, is standing at the back doors and the front doors, saying: &ldquo;Pussy, pussy, <Col N="972" /> pussy, if you will not let us unite you, what do you want us to do?&rdquo;  What other country in the world can say that both sides of the Iron Curtain wait with bated breath on the declaration of our faith?  It should appeal to so cynical mind as that of the Tánaiste. When he is getting cynical about that, I beg of him not to believe that Deputy Hickey is so damned simple that he does not know what the sterling link means.  Its pragmatic value is as a working instrument for the maintenance of a price relationship between London and Dublin.  As a secure foundation for our currency it is not worth a button, and it is only the skilful maintenance of the pretence that it is that keeps the system in existence. Let Deputy Hickey and his like, before they start blasting its foundations with reverberating &ldquo;Hear hears!&rdquo; send me a memorandum of what they would put in its place after they dispose of it.</P>

Even when I have gone to my colleague, Deputy MacBride, with whose ratiocination I find myself instinctively carried rather farther than I want to go, the only brake I can apply is: &ldquo;Let us admit that the sterling link should go, but what will we put in its place?&rdquo; It is I who will be selling the bullock and I do not want the cattle dealer to start off chewing the rag with me at five o'clock in the morning and saying: &ldquo;The exchange in Lombard Street was very weak last night; therefore your bullock is worth 15/- a cwt. less than it was at the fair of Charlestown and though I am only offering you £32 for it I am really giving you more than the £40 you refused at Charlestown.&rdquo;</P>

I do not think there will be any shot fired through the Iron Curtain but, if there is, the quality and the content of sterling will largely depend on Stalin's longevity.</P>

At the moment, thanks be to God, Capitol Hill and Blair House do not want to make friends with the man out of Moscow.  I hope they never will.</P>
      <P>Do not test us too far.  Try to the best of your ability to repair the damage that has been done.  You cannot ever clear your names of the cynical squabble that has been going on for shoes that are not yet vacant.  It was detestable to inflict on our people the suffering they have had to bear.  It was disreputable to blacken your predecessor's record by your fraudulent diatribes.  I join issue with you on every single allegation, and I look forward to the exposure of the fraudulent rubbish talked by the Minister for Finance in the present Government yesterday, the man who was reading a brief but pretending he was not; the man who did not know enough about his own Department to trust himself to speak on economics here without getting a senior officer of the Department of Finance to write his speech for him: and, having done that, he was ashamed&mdash;a man of his age&mdash;to let on that he was cribbing from his desk.  If that happened in the higher infants in the national school he would deserve a slap.  When it happens to a man getting on to 70 in Dáil Éireann it is hard to withhold contempt.</P>

    <P>Vanity in the middle age, as in myself, is perhaps pardonable but in ten years' time vanity in me will be ludicrous. It is not only ludicrous but <Col N="974" /> disgusting in the present Minister for Finance.  When it is accompanied by an insidious pretence that he is honourably discharging his duty to the people of revealing the truth entrusted to his care, when, in fact, his real purpose is to blackguard and denigrate with facility the record of his predecessor, it is indeed a revolting spectacle.

      <P>The <i>Irish Press</i>, known as the Fianna Fáil <i>Pravda</i>, of Thursday, November 15th.  When he had gone on for a full ten minutes there were feverish grunts from his colleagues because they realised he had gone wrong.  There was a little treasure of £3,250,000, and he had missed it.  He had informed the House quite frankly that this was the measure of his burden.  When he added up it came, in fact, to £6,000,000.</P>
      <P>Now, if we are dealing with a situation in which the Minister for Finance intervenes in the debate on the economic state of the country and does not know instinctively the difference between our total imports and our adverse trade balance and cannot go within £3,000,000 of the figure which he alleges to be the burden that he has been called upon to bear and delivers here the kind of speech we listened to last night, is it any wonder that it was possible for this pair to purchase victory over the orphan who sits alone, not at the expense of the great or the rich, but at the expense of the best people in this country who played their part when they were asked to play a part and who have been cruelly wronged by what has supervened since.</P>

    <P>It is a sad day when an English paper like <i>The Economist</i> has to publish an article on Ireland entitled &ldquo;The Gap&rdquo; and to say that&mdash;I am paraphrasing this, and the source of my paraphrase is <i>The Economist</i> of 27th October, 1951&mdash;after all the gloom and misery, after all the derogation from Irish credit by the Minister and the present Government, we do not take so poor a view and we suggest that if they would pull their socks up they would have a better country and a better future than almost any other country on the Continent of Europe. There is an old saying: &ldquo;It is a dirty bird that fouls its own nest&rdquo;.  It is <Col N="976" /> a poor fish that so cries down his own country that an English economic review in 1951 is constrained to say to us that it is not such a dunghill as he describes it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect that I would be called upon to-night.  I had expected that the last Deputy would go on to the end.  I think he did quite well.  When all the fine words and long words, and all the fine phrases are finished, the fact of the matter remains that those who are opposed to the present Government have in this debate concentrated upon two main charges.  One is that the gravity of the present economic position has been unduly exaggerated by the present Government, and the second charge is that the Government were about to&mdash; mind you, about to&mdash;do a wrong by accepting the Central Bank's Report. Both these charges can easily be seen to be fantastic, particularly the first one.  It is not always easy to prove that a person was not about to do a wrong.  For example, if you see a farmer going into a shop to buy a rope you can accuse him of going to hang himself, and it is hard for him to prove that he was not going to do it. You can always claim that your accusation, or your drawing attention to the matter, prevented him from doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this first charge, that the Government unduly exaggerated the gravity of the present position, there is no difficulty in proving that there was no undue exaggeration of the gravity of the position.  Deputies who were here last week and listened to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not say that he made a gloomy speech, and would not say that he was preaching a gospel of despair.  Did we not all hear the &ldquo;hear, hears&rdquo; from the Opposition Benches, the involuntary cheers, because the statements which the Minister made rang true, and because they gave to fair-minded Deputies&mdash;and there are fair-minded Deputies on every side of this House <Col N="977" />&mdash;the feeling that here was a man who was prepared to fight for the interests of this country, and who was prepared to try and bring it safely through any difficulties that might confront it.</P>
    <P>In support of what I have said, that there was no exaggeration in regard to the economic position, I propose to produce to this House three witnesses who will corroborate the statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that our economic position is grave, particularly in regard to the balance of external payments.  The witnesses that I propose to produce in support of my statement are no less than Deputy Patrick McGilligan, the former Minister for Finance, the editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, and the executive of the Trade Union Congress. Those witnesses are, I think, of sufficient standing and repute to be accepted.  They cannot be charged with being on unduly affectionate terms with the present Administration.  I shall first quote from Deputy McGilligan when speaking as Minister for Finance in this House.  The quotation is from the speech he made when introducing the Budget in the Dáil a day or two before the last Dáil was dissolved. Having dealt with many other aspects of our economic position, he went on to say, at column 1882:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is an appropriate point to introduce the term &lsquo;inflation&rsquo;.  The classical definition, in popular language, is &lsquo;too much money chasing too few goods&rsquo; and, therefore, driving up prices.  In our circumstances the definition might be reformulated as &lsquo;too much money attracting too much imports&rsquo;, since over-spending by the public and the State is able to find an outlet in purchases from abroad financed not from income but from our past accumulations. In a state of normality, we should be able to live on our income and, indeed, save enough of it for capital purposes not only to maintain but actually to increase our production and, therefore, our standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is still proper and eminently reasonable to draw on our external assets if thereby we speed up the process of capital development at home. <Col N="978" /> What is abnormal and, if it persists, can be seriously damaging, is to use up our external resources for consumption purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to dwell on whether or not we are using our external assets for consumption purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins finds that the prospects of his ever being Minister for Finance are rather too gloomy.  I propose to give extracts from the gloomy speech that was made by Deputy McGilligan, Minister for Finance, on the very eve of the dissolution of the last Dáil and of the dissolution of the then Government.  He said at column 1883:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon says it is glorious.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce could not say anything worse than that.  In the next column, the then Minister for Finance went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Only if the gap in the balance of payments is narrowed so that external disinvestment is balanced by additional home investment&mdash; rather than by excessive consumption&mdash;can we be satisfied that as a nation we are making ends meet and not wasting out past accumulations. One of the great benefits conferred by the possession of external assets is ability to ride out periods like the present of exceptional difficulty and stress, but this external mass of manoeuvre is the mainstay of our economic independence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes on further:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious.  We <Col N="979" /> cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to ask the House is there any difference between that speech and the speeches made by Deputy Lemass since he took office and those made by the ex-Minister for Finance.  Is it not true that the only difference is that the ex-Minister for Finance in making that statement as a member of a Government spoke alone.  He had no support from his colleagues.  But Mr. Lemass, on the other hand, had the support of his colleagues.  Instead of support, the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, found that his small, weak voice was completely drowned by the loud-voiced boast of his colleagues; the little tin whistle of the then Minister for Finance was drowned by the trombones, the saxophones and the big drums of his colleagues, who boasted that the country was rolling in prosperity while he, the Minister for Finance, was continually warning all who would listen to him that the country was in a grave economic position, and that something serious would have to be done in order to remedy that position.</P>
    <P>Since the election, a campaign has been undertaken by the displaced persons of the former Government to discredit the existing Administration. First they told us there was going to be inflation, that the Government was rushing the country forward towards an inflationary spiral because they gave the unfortunate milk producers an additional penny for their milk.</P>
    <P>Then they decided that that would not be the most attractive line to adopt in order to pull down the Government. Therefore, taking note of responsible and serious speeches made by certain Ministers, and particularly by the Minister for Ministry and Commerce, they decided to adopt a different line and say that the Government were making unduly gloomy speeches and that they were causing a scare and a panic.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, said that an attempt was being made by the Government to create an atmosphere of panic in the <Col N="980" /> country.  There was an atmosphere of panic in a particular part of the country since 13th June last.  There has been an atmosphere of panic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;down in the Law Library.  We all know that bewigged gentlemen are going around saying to one another: &ldquo;We should never have allowed this to happen.&rdquo;  The speech delivered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the Publicity Club early in October has been described as a gloomy speech.  Very few people have quoted extracts from that speech in order to emphasise that it contains an atmosphere of gloom.  I have read that speech carefully and I can find nothing in it to merit the description that it is a gloomy or a hopeless speech.  I think it was a vigorous and responsible speech.  It was the speech of a man who was facing up to his responsibilities and was telling the country exactly the position they were in and what should be done in order to bring the country safely through.</P>
      <P>There are two ways of dealing with danger.  If a cross-Channel boat were to spring a leak and Captain Costello were in charge of that boat he would say: &ldquo;Do not mind, boys, the water is pouring in but it does not matter. When the boat is half-full of water it will flow out again of its own accord. A little water will not do any harm.&rdquo; If Captain Lemass were in charge of that boat he would say: &ldquo;We had better repair the leak, bale out the water and get going again.&rdquo;  That is the difference between the approach of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the approach of his opponents. Let me quote one small extract from the speech delivered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the Publicity Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government recognised its responsibilities and was striving to discharge them, first by trying to get the hard facts about the national position known and generally understood. Secondly, by expediting all plans for developing increased productive capacity which were their special charge.  Thirdly, by giving <Col N="981" /> to private enterprise all the support and help that it may need.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another part of his speech he pointed out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;External assets constituted not merely a capital reserve but a political safeguard, the significance of which was sometimes overlooked.  It would not be an exaggeration to describe them as one of the main bulwarks of our national independence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That sounds very similar to what Deputy McGilligan said in that responsible speech which he made on the eve of the election.  It is a pity that Deputy McGilligan is not in the House to take part in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass's whole speech on that occasion and his speeches before and since then have represented an urgent appeal to the people to remedy something which constitutes a danger to our economic position.  No individual citizen can hope to survive if his outlay exceeds his income.  No nation can hope to survive if its outlay seriously exceeds its income.  The problem that faces the country is to bring about equilibrium in our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>I said I would quote some other witnesses to prove also there was nothing exaggerated, nothing gloomy and nothing misleading in the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>, in an editorial on the 24th October, last, commenting on the Banking Commission Report, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Report shows... that a continuation of recent trends would be a just cause for alarm.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Industry and Commerce had made such a statement he would be told that he was trying to alarm and to scare the people but, when the Editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> makes that statement, it is accepted as sane and reasonable. The editorial to which I am referring goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It points out that a large excess of imports has been an outstanding <Col N="982" /> feature of our economy in recent years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is another sane and reasonable appeal to the nation to try and rectify its external conditions, so that it can go forward, make progress and maintain its independence.</P>
    <P>However, I feel that the most important endorsement of the stand taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the statement issued by the Trade Union Congress.  I do not claim, or pretend, to be very enthusiastic about the Trade Union Congress, or the trade union movement. Speaking as a farmer, and from my natural inclinations as an individual, I do not give very much thought to the idea of regimentation and control.  I read the Trade Union Congress Report from end to end and was impressed by it.  I said to myself: After all, the men who control this Congress have a sense of responsibility; this is a sane and well-reasoned document; I think it is good; since we must have a trade union movement, and it embraces a very large section of our people and is a very important body in the nation, it is a good thing that the men who control that body are men with a sense of responsibility.  On page 7 of the Congress's Report we read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...The question arises whether our external assets have been utilised to build up our productive capacity or not... An examination of the imports statistics shows that there are many categories of imports which could be drastically reduced without adversely affecting employment or the general standard of living.  (For example, imports of ready-made apparel amounted to roughly £5,000,000 last year.)  A policy directed towards reducing imports should aim at (a) reducing or eliminating luxury consumption goods, (b) substituting home-produced raw materials for imported, (c) producing here such manufactured goods as at present are imported but which could be made here, and (d) replacing imported foodstuffs, such as wheat and maize, by home production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> It is just as well that the Minister for Agriculture is not listening to me.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The import problem should be tackled, therefore, along the three lines of instituting a form of import control to eliminate or reduce luxury imports, a vigorous programme of industrial development designed to replace imported materials and manufactured goods and a progressive agricultural policy that will enable imports of foodstuffs to be cut considerably.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is the considered opinion of the Trade Union Congress, therefore, that the former Minister for Agriculture was not pursuing a progressive agricultural policy, and that he was allowing into this country foodstuffs which could be produced at home.  It is an accusation against the inter-Party Government that they allowed, in the last few years, luxury goods to be imported into this country, and that they allowed in here wearing apparel which could easily be manufactured in this country.  The Trade Union Congress Report has never been described by any of the spokesmen of the Opposition as a gloomy document&mdash;a document designed to create a scare in the country or a recession in trade and in industry.  I think that if we consider together the statement made by the former Minister for Finance&mdash;a statement which was completely submerged and trampled upon by his colleagues&mdash; the statement of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the statement of the Trade Union Congress, and the statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, both outside this House and in this House, we will find general agreement that there is a grave problem to be faced, to be solved, and to be overcome.  We will find also that there are means within our disposal to solve that problem and to bring this country safely through any difficulties that may arise.  Almost every country in the world has been facing up to this serious problem in the last year, trying to restrict unnecessary imports and to promote home production to the best of their ability. However, when the Minister for <Col N="984" /> Industry and Commerce suggests that this is the line we have to take, we have an uproar from the Opposition to the effect that he is trying to discredit the former Administration.  There is nothing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce can say or do that can discredit the former Administration more than their own actions, their own words, and the policy they have pursued.  Is it not true, and does not everybody admit it to be true that, during the course of the past couple of years, we have been importing into this country goods which we could easily produce here, and the production of which here would give employment to our people, would provide hope for the future and a strengthening of our economic position?  One has only got to look at the trade returns for the past nine months to realise how much unnecessary and unwise spending has gone on as far as this nation is concerned.</P>
    <P>During the Vote on Account last March I passed the remark that the then Government's policy could be summed up in a few words&mdash;eat, drink and be merry for to-morrow we die. Not being a prophet, I did not realise at that time that those words would prove to be so literally true in regard to the then Administration.  However, the then Minister for Finance became quite angry at my remark, and he said that we have no physical control over our imports.  That was the sort of defence he was making, but people with a truer responsibility of Government, if they wanted to keep the country on an even keel, would assume physical control of the import-export trade, so as to safeguard the nation's interests.  We realise, and we all accept the fact, that this is an agricultural country, but is it not an extraordinary circumstance that for the first nine months of this year we imported into this agricultural country in food, drink and tobacco goods to the value of £33,000,000?  How much of that money could have been saved if we had in this country a responsible Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    <P>We all remember how in 1948 the farmers were driven away from tillage; farmers who formerly grew tillage <Col N="985" /> crops were refused a fair price for their produce.  We were told by the then Minister for Agriculture that we could get unlimited maize imports from abroad at less than £1 per cwt. We found that prophecy was as false as many of the other prophecies he made.  We found that our farmers who had been driven away from the production of tillage crops could not get these cheap imports and because we could not get these cheap imports we had to pay more for our wheat, thus adding to the burden of the subsidy on bread.  We had to pay over 30/- per cwt. for maize and even found it difficult to get it at that.  As a result of having to pay so high a price for maize and other feeding stuffs our stock of poultry and pigs declined with the result that the cost of living has been increased.  There is an outcry in the city at present about the high price of eggs.  Why is the price of eggs high?  Because the Minister for Agriculture told the farmers to go and choke their hens, if they thought that a guaranteed price of 2/- per dozen was not a profitable price.  And because the farmers or a substantial number of them choked the hens, and put them into the pot as he advised them, people in Dublin have to pay 6/- or more per dozen for their eggs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only our lawyer <Col N="986" /> friend interrupting.  I was suggesting that the economic position of this country does demand the adoption of drastic corrective measures.  We have got to get more out of our land and out of our industries than we have been getting.  It is true, of course, that there has been a substantial increase in the volume of industrial output, though that has not been due to any great increase in the number of factories.  That increase in the volume of industrial output can be increased still further.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about the wonderful position in which agriculture was left when the present Government took office and the late Administration collapsed, but facts have got to be faced.  We imported £33,000,000 worth of foodstuffs in the first nine months of this year.  We have to face the fact that the acreage under tillage crops has declined in the last three years from 2,500,000 acres in 1948 to 1,600,000 last year.  The number of milch cows has fallen within the last year by 50,000.  The number of pigs, on the last figure that has been produced, has shown a decline of 97,000, and the number of poultry in the last year has shown a decline of 2,500,000. All that has happened under the reign, the inglorious reign, of a Minister who said: &ldquo;Keep one more sow, one more cow and till one extra acre&rdquo;.  Yet we have had a decline in tillage of 900,000 acres.  The decline of 50,000 in the number of cows does not indicate that the policy of the Minister when he advised our farmers to keep one more cow, one sow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are facts the Deputy knows he cannot dispute.  The Deputy, as a man of ordinary intelligence, knows probably as well as anybody, that if a sane policy had been pursued with regard to agriculture we would have saved at least £10,000,000, which was paid out, in the main, to <Col N="987" /> the dollar area for imported foodstuffs. That saving would have helped to keep our country in a sounder economic position and prevented our going so deeply into debt with the United States, if we had a Minister whose policy was not one of bitter hostility towards such things as wheat, beet and peat.</P>
      <P>The statistics for the first month of this year afford melancholy reading.  I have shown how enormous have been our food imports.  We have also the fact that we have had to import nearly £1,000,000 worth of cement in the first nine months of the year simply because the inter-Party Government could not make up their minds to tackle the problem of increasing production in that one industry which, more than any other, had proved a success.  We all know that Irish cement was reasonably cheap and of first-class quality, but for three and a half years the men who could talk for hours in this House about initiating a capital development programme could not make up their minds to expand the cement industry.  Their talk about initiating a capital development programme was all bunkum.  It was all a mighty ramp and fraud.  We all know since the State was established a capital development programme has been the policy of successive Governments. Even the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government, which was rather conservative, had initiated a capital development programme.  The Fianna Fáil Government, on its accession to office, initiated a capital development programme.</P>
      <P>Those Governments did not call it initiating a capital development programme. They called it by its plain simple name&mdash;borrowing money for useful development works, which was quite in order.  During the past week a tramp called to a country cottage and said to the housewife: &ldquo;Good evening, madam.  I am about to initiate a capital development programme.&rdquo;&ldquo;Would you mind telling me what that means?&rdquo;  said the housewife.  &ldquo;I want the loan of a couple of bob to buy rabbit snares,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> There is nothing new in this idea of capital development but new phrases have been coined and in the main they have been coined to cover up a certain amount of fraud in the management of this country's finances, to cover up the fact that there was borrowing on a large scale, not for capital development, but to run the ordinary services</P>
    <P>The net result of all this capital investment programme has been that in the past nine months we have had to import over £900,000 worth of cement, which is a valuable fundamental material in all works of national importance. There have been other large imports under the heading of textiles, which I think excessive.  We have had the importation of £3,200,000 worth of wearing apparel.  I see no reason why it should be necessary to import £3,200,000 worth of wearing apparel in a country in which there is so much capital investment.  Surely the cost of buying a few sewing machines would not seriously embarrass a Government which had been borrowing such enormous sums over the past few years.</P>
    <P>Another very substantial item in our import list was £8,500,000 worth of coal.  One of the things that disgusted me in the early years of the inter-Party Government's administration was their attitude towards home-produced fuel.  I could never understand such an attitude being adopted by an Irish Government.  I could not understand the prejudice against home-produced fuel.  Surely everybody realises that a nation's most important asset is home-produced fuel.  Britain made wonderful progress in the past years because she had a large fuel supply.  When an effort was being made to build up and develop a home-produced fuel supply in this country, that effort was attacked in the most venomous way.  We heard denunciations by Ministers of the policy of producing fuel for our people.  The adverse circumstances in which fuel had to be produced during the war, particularly in the last year of the emergency when weather conditions made it so difficult, were all exploited to ridicule and denounce the whole idea of this country producing its own fuel.</P>

      <P>On their death-bed, the inter-Party Government woke up to the fact that home-produced fuel was a very important asset, an indispensable asset, and they had to go out in panic to call upon the people to produce more.  They had to call on the county councils and call upon them to produce more.  They did not do that until they were on their death-bed.  Why did they <Col N="990" /> not do it in 1948 or 1949?  These were the best turf-producing years as far as weather is concerned.  The year 1948 had a fine summer.  Plenty of fuel could have been provided in that year.  The year 1949 was also exceptionally fine. Nothing was done in those years.  It was only when the supply which they thought was inexhaustible was cut off, when they discovered that our good neighbour that we loved and for whom we wish to provide cheap food, was unable to supply us with fuel in exchange for that food, that the Ministers decided to take the barrow and make their way to the bog road.  They had to make their way to the bog road in another way very shortly afterwards. It will be acknowledged, and anybody who listened attentively to Deputy Lemass's opening statement in this debate will admit, that there is a future for this country.  The blinds are not down.</P>
      <P>This country has a future.  We have a Minister for Industry and Commerce who realises that this country has potentialities, and that with united effort we can overcome our difficulties, and bring about that spurt in agriculture and industrial production that is essential if we are going to survive as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce is back again in office. He is back again because he convinced a very large section of our people&mdash; that section of our people who decide the fate of Governments, who occupy a central position in this nation and who are prepared to give a fair chance to any fair policy&mdash;that the administration of our economic affairs in the last three years had fallen into flabby and foolish hands, and that there was need of a man in control of our economic destiny who had not only a sense of responsibility but a real interest in our country.  In the past 20 years, since he first came into public life, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, has shown that he is prepared to fight for this country against all difficulties, internal or external, that may face him, and that he is prepared to take the national line on every important issue. That is the reason why he is back again <Col N="991" /> in office.  If all these lawyer gentlemen on the Opposition Benches assert that Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was about to adopt a deflationary policy, was about to adopt the recommendations of the Central Bank, would he not thereby destroy the very industries which he has laboured so hard to build up? Could anything be more ridiculous than for these legal gentlemen to suggest that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, of all men, was about to commit not only political suicide, but national suicide as well &mdash;that he was about to destroy the constructive efforts of the past 20 years, into which he had put so much energy and zeal and enthusiasm?</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a very clever thing to accuse a man of being about to commit some crime.  If he does not commit the crime, it can always be said that he was frightened off.  Does that not sum up the whole policy of the Opposition?  They assert that the present Government was about to do something which is absolutely absurd and ridiculous but that as a result of their big words and fine phrases they frightened them off doing it.  What evidence can they produce that the Government was going to adopt the recommendations of the Central Bank Report?  Is it not true that in 1937 there was a Banking Commission composed, not only of some of the directors of the Central Bank but of leading bankers from all parts of the world?  These gentlemen issued a majority report which was absolutely similar to that which has now been issued by the Central Bank.  But the Government which was in power then is the same Government which is in power to-day&mdash;and they did not adopt the Banking Commission's recommendations. The Banking Commission recommended that there should be a stay on the housing programme which was going ahead at that time, a stay on land division and a stay on practically every progressive effort that was then being made to build up the country. Nobody took any notice of these recommendations. The then Opposition tried to boost that report and welcomed <Col N="992" /> it as a condemnation of the then Government.</P>
    <P>I remember telling them in 1938 that in trying themselves to the majority report of the Banking Commission they were hitching their wagon to a dead horse.  They probably realised that that was true because they did not pursue that line much further.  They now suggest that a group of Ministers who did not adopt the recommendations of the Banking Commission would, at this late hour of the day, accept similar recommendations from similar gentlemen.  Surely such an accusation is utterly and completely ridiculous?  Perhaps it is good Party practice, when you find that the Government is not doing anything with which you can find fault, to accuse the Government of being about to do something wrong and then, when they do not do anything wrong, to say that you prevented them from doing so. Perhaps the next thing they will say is that the Government is going to introduce conscription and, a year later, that they are going to do something else.</P>

Is it not true to say that we would have far more bacon to export if Deputy Dillon, the then Minister for Agriculture, had not fought against my proposal in 1948 to give the farmer a fair price for oats and feeding barley, and had encouraged the production of those feeding cereals?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the leaders of the Opposition have covered themselves with nothing but discredit since they opened the debate on this particular Bill.  They know the Bill is designed to enable the country to carry on the affairs of the nation in regard to supply and distribution and to carry out the various other projects. They know this Bill is absolutely essential, yet they have tabled ridiculous amendments and claim they will not accept the Bill because of those amendments. They know perfectly well that all the amendments are utterly absurd. As I have indicated, there is no substance whatever in the arguments they have put forward apart from the stupid accusation relating to the gravity of the present economic position and the accusation that the <Col N="994" /> Government were about to do something silly and stupid but changed their minds.  They have submitted no reasoned arguments.  An occasional interruption is not a reasoned argument. It carries no weight.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that I believe we can bring forward this country economically by adopting a sound long-term policy designed to build up our potentialities in regard to fuel development, afforestation and hydro-electric development.  In regard to the latter, I think a good deal more can be done in spite of the views of the experts.</P>
      <P>These are long-term projects but I feel that there is an urgent need&mdash;and everybody who studies the economic affairs of this country must acknowledge this&mdash;for a short-term production policy.  If I were asked to outline briefly what would be a short-term production policy designed to add to our output so as to make our trade balance, I would be inclined to suggest that it would fall under three headings&mdash;tillage, turf and tourism. By giving the necessary inducements and encouragement to farmers to increase the acreage under tillage, we can cut out that £3,000,000 worth of sugar which we import from those queer named countries.  We can also cut out imports of maize completely. We can reduce very substantially our imports of wheat.  By encouraging the production of field grains such as oats and barley, we can increase our output of eggs and bacon.  Those are industries which give rather a quick return.  In view of the neglect over the past few years, I think the nation demands a speedy return so as to balance our external trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to dwell upon the advantages of increasing our output of turf.  There we have an industry which has got to be developed to the fullest extent.  Both in regard to tillage and turf there is a certain risk.  We must face that risk, the risk in regard to weather conditions.  The best Government in the world, with the best intentions in the world, may be frustrated both in regard to tillage and turf by very severe and adverse weather conditions <Col N="995" /> but we have got to take the risk.  We are not getting a full output from our agriculture.  It is useless for the ex-Minister for Agriculture to come into this House and say there was wonderful progress made in regard to agriculture during his period of office when the fact is that the net output of agriculture was actually 15 per cent. lower in 1951 than it was during one of the years of the emergency as a result of that Minister's activities. The production of turf was down 35 per cent last year as compared with the previous year.  In respect of the preceding years&mdash;I have not the figures with me at the moment&mdash;I would say the reduction was even more substantial.</P>
    <P>There is scope for putting our men to work.  Deputy Dunne may be interested in the fact that 50,000 people have been driven off the land since the inter-Party Government took office.</P>

There is no future, I say, for the workers in this country unless we can raise the standard of output on the land and in the factories, and unless we can raise the standard of industry.  It is by so doing that we can provide permanent employment for our entire working population.  You will not provide permanent employment by borrowing millions from the United States and spending them on work that is not productive. That is not the way to provide employment for the workers.  The way to secure employment is by means of a productive, well-directed agriculture, and by the development of the secondary industries of this country.</P>

    <Title>Reports from Committees. - Adjournment Debate&mdash;Unemployment in Balbriggan.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was constrained to put down this question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by a number of considerations, first, by the most important consideration that there is in the town of Balbriggan, which is the largest town in my constituency, a very great degree of unemployment among the workers who ordinarily make their living from the hosiery mill in that town.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he is aware that the town of Balbriggan is very seriously hit by large-scale unemployment of workers engaged in the hosiery mills; if he will state whether the importation of goods from foreign sources is contributing to this situation and, if so, what steps he is taking, if any, to secure the re-employment of these workers whose sole dependence is the hosiery industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> The Minister in his reply indicated that, in his view, the situation in Balbriggan, the slump in the hosiery industry and the consequent unemployment, was attributable more to a recession in trade than to any other factor.  He also indicated, by inference at least, that he did not consider that the reference I had made to large-scale unemployment was founded on fact because he stated that he was aware that there was partial unemployment. The Minister's reply published in to-day's papers has, to say the least of it, caused indignation and astonishment in the town of Balbriggan, and that is a fact which is known not alone to me but to the Minister's supporter, Deputy Burke.  It has been drawn to Deputy Burke's attention no later than this day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct and will be later shown to be correct.  The workers in the town of Balbriggan to whom I refer have been dependent upon this industry for their livelihood for very many years, and I am quite certain that the Minister is well aware of the tremendous importance the hosiery industry has for the population of that town.  It has been the foundation of the economic life of Balbriggan for the best part of a century and a half, and, when that industry is hit by any kind of slump, when unemployment develops, it means that the entire town is very badly circumstanced and the slump makes itself felt in every family in the town and every aspect of the town's economic life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable concern to traders and all classes of people that this situation should exist.  It is commonly believed by the workers in the hosiery industry and also by the managers of that industry that this situation has been brought about by the importation of large amounts of foreign goods.  The Minister, in his reply yesterday, did not subscribe to that idea, although Deputy Burke was strenuously endeavouring within the past few days and over the past two or three months to bring home to the people of <Col N="998" /> Balbriggan, and the people of Lucan who are also hit to some extent in a similar fashion, that it is the importation of foreign goods which has brought about this situation and that there is no other reason for it.  Deputy Burke, in his usual fashion, has sought to give it a political twist by suggesting that the previous Government has responsibility for that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply he made it very plain that he did not consider that the present situation came about as a result of stockpiling or abnormal importation of foreign goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="999" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made it clear and the people of Balbriggan and the management of this industry were astounded to read the statement he made that this situation had, in his view, nothing whatever to do with imports or with stockpiling but came about through a recession in trade.</P>
      <P>The primary consideration which prompted me to put down this question was that of unemployment.  The Minister described the situation in Balbriggan as one of partial unemployment and I am afraid he is misinformed in that connection.  I am informed by the management of the factory concerned that their normal number of employees is 300 odd.  Of these, 100 are now in continuous employment; 100, approximately, are laid off entirely and signing on at the labour exchange, and approximately 100 are on short time on a three-day week.  These workers, who are unemployed and whom I have met and talked to more recently than Deputy Burke, are dependent for their livelihood at this moment upon picking winkles in the harbour of Balbriggan and can find no other means of getting a few shillings to ward off economic want.  I believe the Minister has a duty in this matter to see that this situation is brought to an end as quickly as possible and to see that these workers are restored to full-time employment with the least possible delay.</P>
      <P>A further consideration which induced me to bring this matter up for discussion was a letter which I received dated 5th November and which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Last week I entered a shop near O'Connell Street to buy a pair of socks and the enclosed tag was attached.  Naturally I gasped with astonishment as my people have been interested in the welfare of our country since '67, did our bit and suffered our bit.  Was it to have a Government of our own to license imports from Hong Kong?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;You can have the socks, if necessary,&rdquo; he adds, as a postcript.  It is not necessary to have them, as it is quite obvious what he states is true because he encloses the manufacturer's tag attached to this pair of socks, sold <Col N="1000" /> just off O'Connell Street&mdash;&ldquo;Made in Honk Kong&rdquo;&mdash;while up to at least 200 skilled workers are idle in the town of Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>Now, whatever the reasons are which brought the situation about, I am interested in hearing them.  It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to fall in with the view that, if there have been large imports of these goods, some steps must be taken to ensure that our own people are protected and are not thrown on the employment market without any hope and particulary with the hardship that must ensue during the oncoming winter.  It is hard enough for workers to be unemployed when the sun is shining, but it is particularly hard for them in a small self-contained town like Balbriggan, coming up to the Christmas period.  The Minister may say that these imports are not affecting the situation unduly, but then, though he may be expressing his opinion and what he believes to be correct, he is in conflict with the views of the workers, of the management in the factory and also of other interests in the hosiery trade.</P>
    <P>I am told that buyers for Irish wholesale firms, who have had to go to England within recent months to purchase nylon, have had it imposed upon them as a condition that for every unit of nylon they purchased they would perforce purchase three units of other types, of rough work, for sale in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>What is described as rough work&mdash;different types of cotton socks, and so on.  This may be an answer to the problem.  It may be that this trade practice has been in progress and has resulted in an unduly large import of foreign goods. If that be so, it should be looked into by the Minister and stopped.  This situation cannot be brushed aside as a simple recession in trade.  It is beyond question that the foreign imports have influenced the position and have contributed in a large degree to the great hardship which the people of Balbriggan are undergoing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> I want to put to the Minister the proposal that he should examine the situation in so far as lies in his power, in order to find just how much of these goods lie in this country, how much are lying in wholesale warehouses&mdash; and in retailers' hands, if it is possible to discover that.  Then some arrangement should be made with the wholesale and retail interests to have the foreign goods&mdash;if they are there in large supply, as they appear to be&mdash; filtered onto the market, so as to ensure that the Irish product would be bought, that the Balbriggan factory would go back to full production and that the workers&mdash;and this is an important consideration&mdash;who are suffering at present can resume full-time employment.</P>
    <P>I do not need to describe to Deputies or to the Minister the importance of this industry to the town.  It is not necessary to go into detail to show that when the factory concerned goes out of full-time operation it is indeed in the nature of a catastrophe.  These skilled men are valuable assets, not alone to Balbriggan but to the country.  I am told by responsible people from Balbriggan that numbers of them have already emigrated, that numbers have sought references from the local clergy to go to England to work there in the factories.</P>
    <P>That is a definite loss to us, to our country and to the nation.  That consideration, allied to the ordinary humanitarian outlook, the need for providing employment, should impress the Minister.  If exceptional steps are necessary now, they are justifiable.  The steps which I have suggested, the investigation of the position with a view to a restriction on the sale of these foreign goods, may be exceptional, but I think they are justified by the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I want to clear up.  In his reply yesterday, the Minister stated that he was informed that the workers who had been disemployed from this particular factory in Balbriggan had been absorbed by another factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the Minister's <Col N="1002" /> own words, in reply to a supplementary of mine:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I understand that the situation to which the Deputy refers applies to only one hosiery factory in Balbriggan and that in fact some of the workers laid off in that factory have been employed in another hosiery factory there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has been misinformed in that.  It is not correct.  I am told by the management of Smyth's factory, and I am also informed by the management of the other factory to which he refers, that there is no foundation for that statement.  Therefore, it is not just a question of one factory closing and some of the workers being taken into employment in the industry in another factory: it is a question of a definite slump hitting the town and the nature of the slump represents to the people of Balbriggan very great hardship.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me now whether he is prepared to investigate the possibility of having the suggestion I make to him implemented, that is, that these foreign goods which appear to be lying here in such abundance, goods from Hong Kong and other places, should be filtered for sale to the public, that arrangements should be made with the trade to ensure that they will not be allowed to go on the market in such a fashion as to kill the industry here, even for a period, for the benefit of foreign interests?</P>

Deputy Dunne wants to put over on County Dublin that this thing has <Col N="1003" /> only started since we came into office, but he knows in his heart that he clapped the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce on the back when he started to stockpile.  How could people be sacked in Balbriggan a month after the change of Government, except by the very bad management of the inter-Party Government, which brought that position about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care personally how this situation came about or who is responsible for it, except in so far as knowing that will help to find the way for dealing with it.  It is true that there is in this factory in Balbriggan a situation which has resulted in the reduction of employment there.  The precise figures are that, out of a normal number of employees of 303, only 118 are in full-time employment and 92 are on half-time employment.  The number of unemployed is 93.  That is a serious situation in a town like Balbriggan and one that as soon as it was brought to my notice I took steps to rectify, such steps as were open to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has been developing for some time.  As Deputy Burke said, a number of workers were laid off some time ago.  When the information came to me, I examined the trade and shipping statistics with a view to ascertaining to what extent it was due to imports and in the case of hosiery goods which are subject to quota restrictions, I took immediate steps to reduce the quota so as to stop the influx of goods of that character from abroad until this situation had rectified itself.  Some of the goods produced by <Col N="1004" /> this firm are not subject to quota restrictions but are subject to tariff. In the case of these goods, I was concerned to find out whether the tariff was sufficient and the trade and shipping statistics seemed to suggest that the tariffs are sufficient.  In the case of hose and half hose, the commodities to which I referred in my reply to the Deputy yesterday, statistics show that imports to the end of September this year were less than in the same period last year and constituted a very small proportion of the total sales of these goods.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's suggestion, however, that this situation could be eased by taking some measure to reduce the release for sale of the stocks of imported hosiery goods held in this country does not deal with the real cause of the problem.  There is at the present time in the hands of wholesalers and retailers of these goods a very large supply of goods of all kinds. It does not make any difference from their point of view whether this large supply is of hosiery products or of other drapery products; they are all overstocked with some form of these goods.</P>
    <P>I am not going to criticise now the decision to permit exceptional imports of these articles of clothing for stockpiling purposes earlier in the year.  If there had been a war or a similar emergency we would have been glad to have them, but there has not been a war and the existence of these stocks is a complication in our problem.  It has accentuated the other causes which are producing a decline in the activities of these trades at the present time. There is a falling off in sales, whatever the reasons for it.  It affects not merely this country but every country in the world.  Reports even from the United States of America which is in the middle of a rearmament boom reveal that there is a glut of these products in the markets and a slowness of sale at the present time.  The position in Great Britain is much more acute than here and that constitutes a danger that manufacturers in Great Britain with surplus stocks on their hands will seek to dispose on our market of these <Col N="1005" /> stocks to the detriment of our own producers.  We must be on the alert to see that that does not happen. In so far as the problem can be solved by restriction of imports all steps have been taken and whatever further steps are required will also be taken.  In so far as it is due to a development among our people which makes them reluctant to buy at present prices, I think it is likely to be a problem of short duration because I think that it is possible to say now that the price position is stabilised and that being so it is almost certain that trade will begin to move again.  There may not be for our manufacturers precisely the same volume of business as there was previously when these stockpiling measures were in progress, but I think that we can, by confining the existing business to our own manufacturers, get them back in full production even though the total volume of trade may be somewhat less than it was earlier.</P>
    <P>The situation which exists in this hosiery business is similar to that which exists in other branches of the clothing trade.  In the case of the woollen industry&mdash;that is the spinning and weaving of woollen cloth and the manufacture of that cloth into garments&mdash;a conference was arranged between all parties concerned, manufacturers, distributors, trade unions and wholesalers, and as a result of that conference there was not merely general agreement as to the measures it was practicable to take but some useful suggestions were made which are being adopted.  I intend to hold a conference of a similar kind with other branches of the clothing trade including the hosiery trade and I am hopeful that as a result of that conference equally practical and useful suggestions will emerge and I would undertake, if they do emerge and meet with the general agreement of those concerned, that they will certainly be adopted.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that just at the present time when we are hoping to secure a considerable expansion of our economic activities in other directions this set back should have occurred in <Col N="1006" /> the clothing industry.  I hope that we will be able to remove the essential cause of it in a short while but it must be clear that so long as there are substantial stocks held by traders throughout the country completely normal conditions will not be restored until these stocks have come down to normal and that depends entirely upon the psychological reaction of the public to the measures which have already been taken and to the stability of prices which I hope has already been established in this industry at least.  I may say that I have some doubt in my mind whether our price control arrangements are not retarding the course of normal trade.  At least it has been reported that the regulation which requires the marking of prices on the goods by the manufacturers is having a bad effect in so far as traders holding price-marked goods are reluctant to buy goods marked at lower prices until these dearer goods are off their shelves.  However, I will look into that question.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Dunne will assure the gentleman who bought the socks in Hong Kong that if he had a licence, that licence was not issued since the middle of June.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the problem of stockpiling can be related to this particular class of goods.  It must be related to the total stocks held by traders who are reluctant to order further consignments not alone of hosiery but of every other type of goods.  I hope, however, to secure in regard to the hosiery trade what we have already succeeded in securing with regard to the woollen trade, that is agreement on the part of the organised traders to submit their orders for spring delivery now.</P>
