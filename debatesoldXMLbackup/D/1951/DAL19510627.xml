      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he proposes to initiate discussions to end the peculiar situation which Córas Iompair Éireann is enduring arising from the continued leave of absence with full pay accorded to two bus drivers over whose employment in Córas Iompair Éireann a costly strike arose in February, 1950, and if he will state the amounts paid to date to each of the men on such leave and any perquisites and whether it is a fact that such payments are equal to payment of full wages without any work in return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made from Córas Iompair Éireann in this matter.  I find that the two bus drivers concerned have been on leave with full pay since 25th March, 1950. The total amount involved to date is approximately £797.  Córas Iompair Éireann are having further discussions on the matter and when I am informed as to the outcome I will, if necessary, consider whether there is any course open to me which might contribute towards a solution of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>

The position is that before services could be discontinued on any branch line Córas Iompair Éireann would have to obtain an Order from the Transport Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act, 1950.  Notice of any application is required to be published and such objections as may be made by interested parties must be considered.  No proposals for the closing of this or any other branch line have been submitted under the Act by Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

    <P>The establishment of a generating station in the Erris area is not in the <Col N="491" /> present programme of the Electricity Supply Board.  I understand that the board considers that there are serious difficulties of a technical and economic nature involved in the proposal.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The flour ration is the same throughout the country.  To increase it for a particular area would be an innovation to which there would be many and serious objections.</P>
      <P>This year, as in earlier years, I hope to be able to arrange for the issue of supplementary rations to harvest workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if an extra bread ration will be provided for turf workers, farm labourers on farming operations such as beet singling and men engaged in harvesting and also if he will take steps to provide that rural bakers and bakers supplying rural areas and holiday resorts will receive an extra ration of flour during the summer and harvesting months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that whilst the flour ration is more than sufficient for city bakers and there is usually a surplus, the present ration for bakers supplying rural areas is completely insufficient; and, if so, if he will have the matter examined with a view to providing a differential in favour of bakers supplying rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the consent of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>All persons who are engaged on heavy manual labour and who find it necessary to take meals to work may obtain supplementary rations of bread or flour.</P>
      <P>I intend to arrange for the issue of supplementary rations to harvest workers.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree, however, that the existing ration is completely insufficient in country areas, and in any event fear that it would be impracticable to arrange that bakers who supply country areas and holiday resorts should be issued with additional quantities of flour.  I will, however, at the request of the Deputy, look into the question further.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that an application has been made by the Guild of Master Bakers for a 25 per cent. increase in their bread ration during the months of July, August, September and October?  What is his answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said. There are many practical difficulties in providing for any such differential rationing system.  I will look into the matter, however, but I doubt if it would be practicable to do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a differential between the price of flour in city areas and the price in rural areas. Why not give a similar differential in the ration of bread between the city areas and the rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A system of differential rationing would be very difficult, if not impossible, to operate and I regret that I cannot see my way to introduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that areas of this nature are in a peculiar position, would the Minister consider having the matter investigated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, who is apparently going to deal with questions that may arise in the Gaeltacht or semi-Gaeltacht areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be understood that people who do heavy manual work, such as bog workers and harvest workers, get an additional ration, but the introduction of a different ration in one area from another would lead to many practical difficulties and, while I have not finally made up my mind as to the practicability, I doubt if it will prove to be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that in the areas I have referred to, apart from the question of heavy manual work altogether, the position of bread or flour in the diet is unique as compared with other areas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear that consideration is being given at present to the possibility of providing special measures to facilitate or to encourage industrial development in those areas. These measures may possibly include proposals for legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated in reply to the question, that matter has been considered, but the development of the Erris area is not at present in the programme of the Electricity Supply Board and that means that some delay must necessarily <Col N="495" /> occur before any development can take place, but the matter is being considered.</P>

      <P>In September, 1950, a veterinary survey by officers of my Department was carried out in widely distributed areas of Connemara (including adjacent islands).  The report on the survey revealed a serious lack of phosphates in the soil, giving rise to the condition of aphosphorosis in cattle known locally as &ldquo;Brios Bruan&rdquo;; serious parasitic infestation known locally as &ldquo;Galar Truagh&rdquo;; and pine in sheep due to cobalt deficiency. Measures subsequently taken to remedy these conditions, and which are being continued, include the provision of supplies of remedial agents to local shops in the area for sale in small quantities to stock-owners; and the promotion of the use of the suitable drugs for control of parasitic infestation. The inclusion of appropriate supplements in mineral mixtures for supply to the area is also receiving attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further detailed veterinary survey of the very extensive parish of Roundstone was carried out in April, 1951, and a preliminary report received thereon indicates that the health of the live stock in the area is, in general, reasonably good.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to remove defects in existing Post Office legislation and to give a greater degree of freedom in the conduct of certain types of Post Office business.</P>
      <P>The principal piece of legislation governing Post Office activities is the Post Office Act of 1908, which, with relatively few amendments, is in force to-day.  I think it is a tribute to the framers of that Act that it has stood the test of time so remarkably well and that the principles laid down in it have provided so satisfactory a foundation for the conduct of Post Office business. However, it is only to be expected that changing conditions and developments would make modifications of the Act necessary.  The provisions of the Bill now before the Dáil represent the changes which are required to bring the measure into conformity with modern needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated explains the <Col N="523" /> various matters included in the Bill, but there are some sections with which I will deal in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Section 2.&mdash;The 1908 Act gave general power to the Treasury to fix, by warrant, rates of postage and other sums to be charged on postal packets and to regulate the scale of weights and circumstances according to which those rates and sums were to be charged.  This power was qualified by certain restrictions as to the maximum amounts which might be charged for certain classes of postal packets, including letters, postcards, book packets (now printed packets), inland newspapers and newspapers for places outside the British islands.  These restrictions were all gradually removed by subsequent legislation except that restrictions remained as to the maximum postage which might be charged for newspapers.</P>
    <P>In introducing revised postage rates as from 1st July, 1948, I understand that the existence of a limitation on the rate of postage for inland newspapers was inadvertently overlooked and a rate of 1½d. was introduced compared with the permitted maximum of 1d.  Section 2 of the Bill is designed to rectify this position.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the removal of the limitation of 3d. on the postage which may be charged on a newspaper posted to a country (other than Great Britain) outside the State.  This proposal is in keeping with that in Section 2 dealing with inland newspapers and is made in order to permit postage rates for newspapers for foreign countries to be fixed by warrant as is the case with rates for all other classes of postal packets.</P>
    <P>Section 4.&mdash;It is the general practice of postal administrations to accord special postage rates not only to books and papers for the use of the blind but also to sound recordings, plates for embossing Braille and other articles specially adapted for the use of the blind.  The House will, I am sure, have no hesitation in agreeing to the proposed extension of the application of the special postage rate for literature <Col N="524" /> for the blind which is the purpose of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 5.&mdash;The Post Office Act, 1908, Section 24, lays down that the form in which postal orders are issued must be prescribed by statutory regulation, and limits to 21/- the amount for which a postal order may be issued, and to 2d. the maximum poundage per order which may be charged.  Section 5 of this Bill proposes to abolish the necessity for prescribing the form of postal orders by statutory regulation and also to remove the limits of 21/- and 2d. referred to.  These provisions are necessary in case, for instance, it should be found desirable to vary the form of the existing postal order or to issue postal orders of a higher value than 21/- or to charge higher poundage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is designed to give power to operate a business-reply service for which a demand exists and which has proved very successful in other countries.  This service would enable firms to send an unstamped card, envelope, folder or label of a special pattern with their advertising matter to be returned through the post unstamped to the originating firms who would be responsible for the normal postage, plus an additional fee on the returned items.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is designed to regularise the position in regard to the customs examination of &ldquo;Green Label&rdquo; packets.  The &ldquo;Green Label&rdquo; service is an international service governed by the Universal Postal Convention under the provisions of which &ldquo;Green Label&rdquo; packets containing goods may be sent by letter post to countries which have agreed to accept them. The &ldquo;Green Label&rdquo; serves both as a customs declaration and as authority from the sender that the packet may be opened for customs examination.</P>
    <P>Section 8 proposes to extend to aircraft the obligations and duties imposed on ships in regard to mails. This is necessary, because the Post Office is now very considerably engaged in the conveyance of mails by air and because of the likelihood of air conveyance continuing to increase.  This section also proposes to abolish the <Col N="525" /> statutory obligation on the master of an inward-bound vessel to sign a particular declaration form relating to postal packets on board.  The declaration in question is not now considered necessary in this country.</P>
    <P>Section 9 proposes to deal with defects existing at present as regards the proper registration of newspapers to enable them to qualify for the newspaper rate of postage.  To qualify for that rate newspapers must, in accordance with Sections 20 and 21 of the Act of 1908, comply with certain conditions, including registration with the Post Office in London.  These sections have not hitherto been adapted to provide for the registration of newspapers at the G.P.O., Dublin, and permit their transmission at the newspaper rate of postage although the service has always been operated here. The proposal in this section will remedy this position.</P>
    <P>Section 10&mdash;The Department is advised that it is doubtful if its existing powers adequately cover the operation of the cash on delivery parcel service and this section is designed to give legislative power to conduct the service in accordance with Post Office regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 11 proposes a more convenient and workable method of fixing foreign telephone fees.  At present the Department is required to issue a statutory regulation for the purpose. The fees depend largely on the payments and terminal credits which have to be made to the countries through which the calls actually pass.  These charges are not within the Department's control and the foreign telephone rates are, therefore, liable to variation from time to time.  It is proposed in future to fix them by notice in the <i>Iris Oifigiuil.</i></P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill is designed to prohibit without authority the use of certain words, letters or marks associated with the Department's services. The unauthorised use of some of the Department's signs in the past has given rise to difficulties and this section is intended to give adequate power to deal with abuses of the kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> Section 13 is necessary to enable the Department to deal adequately with telephone offences, e.g., nuisance calls. false ambulance calls, grossly offensive or annoying conduct on the telephone. The Department's existing powers to prosecute for such offences are extremely limited.  The only statutory power that can be invoked is that contained in Section 67 (1) of the Post Office Act, 1908, which makes it an offence &ldquo;whilst in any post office or within a premises belonging to any post office or used therewith&rdquo; to obstruct the course of business of the Post Office.  This section can only be used in cases where the offence is committed from a post office call office or a kiosk.  A prosecution cannot be brought under this Act where the offence is committed from a subscriber's telephone.  The proposed clause in this Bill will enable prosecutions for such offences to be taken where warranted.</P>
    <P>Section 14.&mdash;Section 64 of the Post Office Act, 1908, prohibits unauthorised imitations of post office stamps, envelopes, etc., or marks which might lead to the belief that a postal packet bearing them is sent on the service of the State.  The section needs to be adapted in order that it may have full force and effect in the State, and Section 14 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Last week, on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs, I drew attention to the mounting losses in recent years on the Department's working and said that I was examining certain proposals for increasing postal and telephone charges, designed to ease the situation, which the late Government were preparing to introduce when the general election was announced.</P>
    <P>The estimated deficit at the end of the financial year 1950-51 was of the order of £500,000.  The increased charges contemplated by our predecessors are expected, in a full year, to yield enough to offset that deficit but, with about a quarter of the present financial year already spent and the difficulty of changing telephone rates for some time, the additional <Col N="527" /> revenue likely to be received in 1951-52 will not be more than £220,000.</P>
    <P>The principal changes involved are in the printed paper rate which will be 1½d. for the first 4 oz. instead of 1d. for the first 2 oz. and an increase in the surcharge on telephones from 5 per cent. to 25 per cent.  These two items together will give £413,000 per annum. Increases in the poundage on postal and money orders and in the charges for foreign, inland and British parcel post will, it is estimated, add another £72,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that in the circumstances in which the Post Office finds itself these increases are justified and have authorised me to give effect to them as soon as may be practicable.  It is, therefore, proposed to introduce the new postal rates right-away and to make the new telephone charges operative as from 1st October in the case of charges for calls and 1st January next for rentals.  In justification of the increases, I may say that the wage bill of Post Office employees has increased by 139 per cent. over 1939 (excluding the recent Civil Service Arbitration Board award) while the cost of a wide range of materials largely used by the Post Office has increased in the same period from 200 per cent. to 600 per cent.  As compared with 1939, the poundage on postal and money orders has not changed at all, the telephone rates at present in operation are only 5 per cent. higher, most other postal rates have been advanced by from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. only, while in only two directions have charges gone up 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise two points&mdash;(1) what we are now doing is to give effect to a decision taken before the change of Government, and (2) the increased charges are only roughly sufficient to meet the deficit disclosed at the end of the last financial year. Since that time the Civil Service award has been accepted by the Government, other claims affecting departmental classes are being negotiated, while the cost of materials and services which the Post Office has to buy continued to mount.  In these circumstances, <Col N="528" /> and having regard to the Department's policy of paying its way, it is more than probable that further increased charges may have to be announced later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of my Bill.  He is in the fortunate position that it will be well received by those of us on this side of the House whereas if I were introducing my own Bill the members of the Fianna Fáil Party would denounce it.  They are silent to-day because they are sitting on the Government side of the House.</P>
      <P>This piece of legislation was necessary if for no other reason than to give some facilities to the blind and also to legalise the position in regard to the expression &ldquo;on His Majesty's Service&rdquo;. The sooner that latter position is legalised, the better.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the Government are satisfied that, in the circumstances in which the Post Office finds itself, certain increases which the previous Government were preparing to introduce when the general election was announced are justified and that he has been authorised to give effect to them as soon as may be practicable. We are not going to make any political capital in regard to this matter though our attitude is different from the way in which I was met when I had occasion to bring in proposals for certain increased charges.</P>
      <P>When the Minister's Party was in opposition there was much adverse comment in regard to the fact that I had failed to give any increase in the pensions of men who retired under Article 10 of the Treaty.  These men had refused to work under any Government of this country.  I am sure that the Minister will adopt my policy which was that the men who refused to work for any Government of this State are not worthy of receiving further compensation from any Government of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is getting off lightly now, but I can assure him that he will not get away so easily on his next Estimate.  This is my Bill and I accept responsibility for it.  We were responsible, <Col N="529" /> as a Government, for initiating it.  We have no apologies to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increase in wages.  What increase in wages took place in the Post Office between 1948 and the present time?  Greater increases took place between 1948 and 1950 than took place during the previous ten years in all sections of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that probably there will be a new Bill to increase further the charges in the Post Office. I can only sympathise with the Minister. I am sure he will get all the opposition which we can possibly command in relation to all extra charges which have not been announced so far. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the time the Civil Service award has been accepted by the Government, other claims affecting departmental classes are being negotiated, while the cost of materials and services which the Post Office has to buy continued to mount.  In these circumstances, and having regard to the Department's policy of paying its way, it is more than probable that further increased charges may have to be announced later.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have always objected to the Department making a profit.  I maintain that their sole duty was to be of service to the nation and not to make a profit. They are a nationalised service, if you like.  It is their duty to provide all the services and facilities they possibly can for the benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>We have gone a great way in regard to our air service.  I hope the Minister will also continue the revision of all the country areas.  For too long&mdash;prior to my taking over responsibility as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;has the Department of Finance been forced to reduce the services in the country while giving greater facilities to the towns and cities.  I hope the Minister will stand up to any treasurer or Finance Department that tries to interfere with the facilities and amenities for rural areas.  One-fifth of the country has been revised.  The people in the hills and in the hamlets have their daily delivery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> I appeal to the Minister to continue to press further until we have the whole Twenty-Six Counties revised so that the people in the rural areas will get facilities similar to those in the towns and cities.  The Minister will receive our support in that work.  I know he will have opposition from the Finance Department but he can stand up to it, knowing that he will have the support of all fair-minded Deputies in this House in spending money when it means a benefit to these people.</P>
    <P>By the reorganisation I initiated with the help of the officials, we were able to give a daily delivery to the people in rural areas without any extra cost.  Formerly, they had only two deliveries a week and sometimes only one.  I will give the Minister every help and assistance to carry out that policy.</P>
    <P>I have always objected to retrospective legislation, but it was necessary in this case.  In this case, it was needed in order to legalise some of the things we should have accomplished years ago. We are bringing consolation to the poor blind who have very few friends. For those reasons I am supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a change of Government is a very desirable thing at times.  We have here a Bill prepared by Deputy Everett of the inter-Party Government, which is now introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  That means that the Bill will receive constructive criticism and will be dealt with, as all Bills ought to be dealt with, purely on its merits.</P>
      <P>I think it is fundamental that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should, as near as possible, pay its way.  Certainly, there ought to be no justification for a loss on the working of the Post Office amounting to approximately £500,000.  Where there is a deficiency of that large amount, it is necessary that charges should be increased and that is one of the major objectives of this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by the Minister's predecessor to increases in wages and that those increases in wages and to the fact that those increases in wages that have been sanctioned increase the deficiency and that it is necessary to have these increased <Col N="531" /> charges to pay those authorised increases in wages.  I think that it would be right on this Bill to refer to the fact that a large number of employees and officials of the Post Office are still inadequately paid and, although I accept what has been said by Deputy Everett that there have been considerable increases in the past three years, there is no doubt whatsoever about it that temporary postmen, particularly in rural areas and even in the cities, and sub-postmasters all through the country are paid a scandalously inadequate wage.  The Minister would be doing great work if he would make provision in the increase of the charges to enable a decent living wage to be paid to those officials of the Post Office.  The Post Office is an essential service.  It is a Government service. We hear quite a lot nowadays about social teaching, and certainly with regard to social teaching the Government ought to give a lead by the proper payment of its own servants and employees. I would avail of the opportunity offered by this Bill to make a plea to the Minister on behalf of those particular Post Office employees and officials.</P>
    <P>There are many desirable things in this Bill.  It is desirable that there ought to be a legalisation and a regularisation of things that have been done without proper authority in the past. I am glad to see steps being taken to increase the value of postal orders.  I think that would be of great benefit to the community as a whole.  With the decreasing value of money, particularly over the last ten years, I do not think anyone will object to the increased charges that are suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be possible on the Committee Stage of this Bill, which is an amending Bill, to amend the original 1908 Act.  I hope it will be possible to go into a few more sections of that 1908 Act, those sections that authorise the censorship of letters and those sections, whether they are in that Act or not, that make provision for the tapping of telephones.  This House ought to take the opportunity <Col N="532" /> now of seeing, if it is necessary to open and censor the letters of private individuals, that that can only be done under the most stringent precautions and that it will not be possible, as it has been suggested was done in the past, for political communications passing from one citizen to another to be detained, opened and photographed, without the knowledge of either the sender or the receiver.</P>
    <P>In the new temper of the country there will be no necessity for that type of action, but now that we are getting the opportunity on this Bill we ought to make those sections water-tight so that they can be used only when it is necessary that they should be used in the interest of and for the preservation of the State.  As I said, I am glad that this Bill is being approached in a constructive and sensible way by the House, and I hope that all of us will contribute to the discussion of the Bill so that any defects which we are aware of in the administration of the Post Office may be removed with the goodwill of this House acting unanimously in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down knows much better than anyone listening to him that it is not the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister in charge of that Department that is responsible for the censoring of letters.  He knows perfectly well from past history&mdash;it may have applied to himself&mdash;that the Minister for Justice is the Minister who authorises the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to perform that function, desirable or undesirable as it may be.  I suggest to Deputy Cowan, with his fairly intimate knowledge of the constitutional and legal position, that he should have a friendly conversation with the new Minister for Justice in the matter, as he is now in a position to have.  I am sure that if Deputy Cowan has a friendly conversation with the Minister for Justice, he will be able to persuade him with very little argument, now that he is in the position of controlling the Ministers and the Government, which is a Coalition Government, not a Fianna Fáil Government, <Col N="533" /> that it is undesirable to continue the practice which has hitherto prevailed and which probably applied to himself when the previous Fianna Fáil Government were in office with their clear majority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Cowan and every other Deputy will agree that it is about time that sections of any Act of the Victorian days like the 1908 Act or any other Act of Parliament passed by the British House of Commons when in control of the affairs of this country were amended, if not altogether repealed, and that this Bill is long overdue.  I was glad to hear from Deputy Everett, and I am sure the Minister will confirm it, that he was the first person, with his advisers, to consider the urgency and the necessity for bringing in this amending legislation.  The Post Office Department should be regarded, and I am sure is regarded by every Deputy with experience, as a public service corporation set up, not for profit-making purposes, but for the purpose of giving the best possible facilities to every section of our citizens, whether they live in the cities or towns or in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett has indicated that the revision of the postal facilities since he was appointed Minister had been carried out to the extent of about one-fifth of the whole area controlled by the Post Office.  I am sure that the Minister, with his reasonably good outlook, and I know him to have a fairly good social outlook on matters of this kind, will continue that good work, speed up the job and get it brought to a satisfactory conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>We are getting very far back to the Estimate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following the good example set by the Minister in introducing his predecessor's Bill and in making the speech prepared for his <Col N="534" /> predecessor which dealt with all these matters.  I am also following the good example set by my colleague, Deputy Cowan, who now controls the Minister and all his colleagues in the Government and can put them in or out at his sweet will, as he put them in some time ago.  Speaking of my own constituency, I urge the Minister to speed up the work of revision and to give every occupier of a holding, whether in the remote rural areas or in the villages or towns in my constituency, the same public service facilities as are afforded to citizens who live in the cities.  It is a public scandal and a disgrace to any Government, past or present, that they should tolerate the conditions under which 2,000 or 3,000 auxiliary postmen are employed at present.  If a Labour Government with a Labour majority were in office, I certainly would not tolerate for ten minutes that we should have citizens of this State, wearing the uniform of the Government, paid for by the taxpayers of the country, engaged on part-time work at as low a figure, in my constituency at any rate, as 37/6 per week.  The unfortunate thing about these temporary auxiliary postmen is that when they have completed their part-time work they have no alternative employment to supplement their Post Office earnings.  They have to go and dig their own gardens because they will not be employed part-time by Bord na Móna, the local authority, or even by the majority of farmers.  The majority of farmers are looking for men who can work a full day or a full week.  That is the position as I see it, and the sooner we blot out from the records of the Post Office the disgraceful condition in which temporary part-time postmen are employed the better it will be.  I urge the Minister to speed up the work of revision and give to every citizen in the State equal facilities in regard to a public service of this kind and also to give to every Post Office employee conditions of service which can be defended by a Christian Government in a Christian country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to assure Deputy Everett, the former Minister, that it is not the intention that the postal services and the telegraph <Col N="535" /> and telephone services should make a profit.  I gave a very limited kind of warning in regard to higher charges soley because people should be prepared for eventualities which may or may not occur.  As I have said, we do not intend to make a profit on these services.  The actual figures may be of interest to the public and to Deputies as I think they were lost sight of during the discussion on the Estimate.  Assuming that the bonus award comes into operation&mdash;we know it is coming into operation&mdash;and retrospective increases are granted to the 15th January, 1951, the loss on the postal services for the financial year 1950-51 will be £316,000, the loss on the telegraph service £250,000, and the profit on the telephone service, £92,000, making a net loss of £474,000.  In future, there will be a large commitment on the telephone service in paying the annuities arising from telephone capital charges.  In other words, we are borrowing money for a long-term telephone development and spreading it out as best we can.  Certain annuities will fall due and they will increase the total charges for expenditure on the telephone service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett, I think, should know that during our term of office we had to pass certain items of retrospective legislation.  I can hardly believe that we would have dealt so hardly with him if he had been Minister as he suggests.  One can never tell what the temper of the debate will be on any particular occasion and one should naturally avoid retrospective legislation. In this particular case there were matters of no great importance although it was rather fantastic that for a long time we have had to have newspapers registered in London in order that they should be the subject of certain administrative regulations here.  Now that has been changed. Deputy Everett will also recognise that we did a great deal during our first 16 years of office to establish Irish institutions and to bring about a more satisfactory state of affairs in regard to that matter and we may be forgiven for some of these omissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revision of the postal service <Col N="536" /> now extends to about one-fifth of the country with a view to providing daily post and better facilities.  The work will be undertaken for the rest as soon as possible.  In fact, it is going on continuously area by area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan referred to the rate of wages for part-time postmen.  I am glad to say that they went up very considerably during the period of office of the previous Administration but one and they went up further in the time of the Administration that has just now terminated.  The total increases varied from 77 to 90 per cent. in certain grades and, as I said during the course of the debate on the Estimate, the wages paid to unestablished postmen and auxiliary postmen are over modest.  There have been increases and there will be further increases under the Civil Service arbitration award which will affect in turn all grades of postmen in the country. They will get their share of the increase resulting from the general arbitration award by the Civil Service Tribunal.  In other words, they had increases during the period 1939-1948, further increases during the last three years and almost immediately will have another increase dating back, I hope, to January 15th.  So that progress is being made in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin spoke of these postmen as being part-time and finding it difficult to secure alternative employment for the rest of the day.  So far as I understand, a good number of them manage to produce an income&mdash; shall we put it that way&mdash;a supplementary income&mdash;during the remainder of the day.  That may not apply to all of them, but, knowing their rates of wages, I am thankful that a good many of them at least are able to do that.  It is a source of consolation to me because I am well aware that, taken as a weekly rate, as suggested by the Deputy, the wage is obviously grossly inadequate as the person's total remuneration.  I have not gone into the matter.  I have not been long enough in charge of this Department to have any idea of how many get an additional income and what form it takes and how far their work as part-time <Col N="537" /> postmen fits into a family scheme of life which suits certain individuals in rural areas.  I have not had time to investigate that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan referred also to postmen's wages and to the position of sub-postmasters.  The remuneration of sub-postmasters has been increased in the same way as that of postmen and all other grades in the service during the last few years, since the increase in the cost of living.  As the Deputy knows, in country districts, the demand for sub-postmasterships and the pressure brought to bear on Deputies and others interested for sub-postmasterships would seem to suggest that the remuneration, if not adequate, was at least worth while from the standpoint of the social status conferred on the shop concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan himself has been interested in time past in rural areas and I think he probably knows what happens to the Minister of the day when a sub-postmastership becomes vacant.  The pressure brought to bear for these positions, sometimes where the contract is for a figure of anything up to £57 a year, is appallingly difficult for the Minister to face. The last Minister established a selection board, as the Deputy knows, and we are continuing that experiment, but, of course, as I said in the course of the debate on the Estimate, the Minister is ultimately and solely responsible for the appointment of subpostmasters and we are continuing the experiment with a view to seeing how it works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Censorship does not form part of this Bill and it would be irrelevant for me to discuss it even because under the old Post Office Act of 1908 the position is that it is an offence against the law to open letter packets except on a warrant which in former cases was under the British authorities and which is now under the Minister for Justice.  In other words, the Act says that the Minister for Justice can compel the Post Office to have letters opened, but it does not form part of <Col N="538" /> the Bill and I do not think any amendment will be accepted by the Ceann Comhairle which will revise those parts of the old Act relevant to censorship because two Ministries are involved and it is not relevant to the Bill which deals with purely minor matters of a different character.  Not one of them, as far as I can see, has any relationship to censorship or is even remotely connected with censorship. Section 7 for example deals solely with customs regulations and simply makes it possible for the customs authorities to open letter packets that have attached to them a green label, in the same way as they are permitted under other regulations to open parcels for customs purposes.  So, therefore, it is not really relevant to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I took an opportunity of mentioning the increase in telephone charges and, although the Deputies know from their previous experience that we are not obliged under the law of the land to obtain the consent of the Dáil for these charges, I took what was almost an illegal opportunity of making a statement in the matter.  It would have been more correct of me to ask the Ceann Comhairle in the first instance for leave to make the statement on the increased charges for posts and telegraphs simply by way of statement to the house.  It is not relevant to the Bill and cannot be discussed either now or on Committee Stage, but perhaps the Acting-Chairman will forgive me for not having asked formal leave to make the statement.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs increased certain postal charges after coming into office and he was criticised by members of our Party.  So I thought that in future, although the postal service is a commercial service in one sense, in that it presents commercial accounts which have been viewed by the Auditor-General, as it is a matter of public concern, it is a good thing to make some statement when telephone or postal charges have to be increased.  I made the statement for that reason. If the House will give me permission, I would just like to reassure the minds of the public in regard to the colossal <Col N="539" /> increases that have taken place in certain types of costs so that they will be prepared for these increases and will understand the necessity for them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the course of my statement that the total wage bill had gone up by 139 per cent. since before the war.  Deputies will be interested in the cost of materials used in the Post Office, the increases in respect of which in some cases are quite fantastic and which are the result of examination by the Controller of Stores and the contracts section and therefore can be regarded as the lowest possible under the circumstances.  A postman's uniform&mdash;tunic, vest and trousers&mdash;has gone up from £1 10s. 5d. in 1939&mdash;it would be undesirable for me to give the exact figure&mdash;to something round about £7 in 1951.  That is one item very largely used.  If you take ordinary cable, that has gone up from £43 per 1,000 yards to somewhere between £190 and £200 per 1,000 yards&mdash;nearly five times&mdash;in the period from 1939 to 1951. Light poles, 22 feet long, which the public can see every day when moving around the country, have gone up in price, too.  They were 7/4 each in 1939, and they are well over £2 each in 1951.</P>
    <P>I mention those items because the increases in the price of materials used by the Post Office are far greater than the increases in the case of articles more commonly bought in the shops, although there have been increases there too.  Copper wire, for example, has gone up from £56 per ton to somewhere between £265 and £275 per ton. It was those tremendous increases, together with the wage bill, the growth in telephone development, and increased capital annuity charges which have given rise to the increased charges we have announced in this way so as to give the public some idea of the reason for them.  Perhaps Deputies might like to hear the comparative rates for foreign surface mail in European countries compared with this country.  Taking the rate for the first unit of 1 oz., the charges in European countries for foreign surface mail are: Belgium, 8d.; Denmark, 6d.; France, 6¼d; Norway, 5½d.; Holland, 4½d.; Switzerland, 8d.; Sweden, 5d.; Portugal, <Col N="540" /> 7d.; Great Britain, 4d. general and 2½d. preferential; Ireland, 4½d. general and 3½d. preferential.  These figures show that we have not increased our charges in comparison with other countries, and that our position, comparatively speaking, is satisfactory in that respect.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is all I have to say in reply to Deputies.  I think I have answered all their points.  I do not know whether Deputy Cowan intends to examine the Post Office Act of 1908 so as to make the amendments, relevant to the present Bill, that he has in mind.  I had a faint idea that perhaps the House might permit me to have all stages of this Bill to-day. I want to say that I am entirely in their hands in that respect.</P>

This Bill, while it was circulated before the Dissolution, was reintroduced the other day.  I think that the Minister himself would, ultimately, be more satisfied, and so I think would all parties concerned, if the Committee Stage were put down for next week. <Col N="541" /> All stages can be taken on Wednesday next.  In view of the fact that a number of matters in the Bill affect the commercial community in a close way, it would be better, I think, to give an opportunity both to the Minister and those who are interested in the way of moving amendments, if the Committee Stage were taken next week.</P>

      <P>In concluding my introductory statement on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, I invited Deputies to raise any matters affecting local bodies of which they had knowledge and experience.  I assured them that, to whatever extent it was possible for me to reply to those matters, I would do so when concluding on the Estimate.  When extending that invitation to Deputies, I had no idea that the number and variety of the questions raised would be as large and as wide as they have proved to be.  Hence, I am afraid I will not be able to keep the general sort of undertaking which I gave in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, a few matters which were raised by Deputies of all Parties with which I would like to deal. These largely referred to questions as to what my general line of policy would be on the matters raised.  For example, I was asked what my attitude would be towards the Local Authorities (Works) Act which was passed by this House in 1949.  When that Bill which, ultimately, became an Act, was going through the House, I was a member of the Opposition.  Although I am not <Col N="542" /> objecting to the charge that was made here, still I think it has been unfairly charged against us that our attitude to that Bill was one of violent opposition.</P>
    <P>I deny that charge.  I admit that, on that occasion, we did what I would expect any Opposition to do, what I would expect the present Opposition to do when a measure of that nature or, indeed, of any nature is introduced here, namely, to make use of the machinery provided here to criticise the provisions in a measure about which they are in doubt, and to propose any amendments that they think would be of importance, or that would tend to improve it.  I have looked over the discussions which took place on that occasion.  I find that, far from there being any substance in the charge of obstruction made against us when that Bill was before the House, eight of the amendments which we, as an Opposition Party, moved to it were accepted by the Government without a division, and eight other of our amendments were defeated.  These results indicate, I think, that at least there was some merit in the course which we pursued on that occasion.</P>
    <P>So far as the administration of that Act is concerned, I want to draw the attention of Deputies to this fact, especially the Deputies who were supporting the Government and the Minister who was responsible for the preparation of the Estimate to which I am now speaking, that not one of those Deputies has drawn attention to the fact that the provision in the present Estimate in respect of that Act is £1,220,000 or £530,000 less than it was last year.  While I am not in any way laying a charge against my predecessor that he had not good reason for reducing the Estimate in the way in which I have described, I suggest to those Deputies who have been critical as to what my policy in relation to this Act will be in the future that, although they were anxious to find out what my policy might be in the future, they offered no criticism of the fact that the money made available for expenditure under this Act will be £530,000 less this year than it was last year.</P>

      <P>I am standing here over an Estimate for £1,200,000, an Estimate inserted in the Book of Estimates by my predecessor.  I am drawing attention to the fact that there is a certain sum of money available to me.  I am giving an undertaking that so far as I can I will ensure that this money is wisely spent.  I am reminding Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, Deputy Davin and others that the Estimate has been reduced this year by £530,000.  I am reminding them that the logical conclusion to be drawn from that reduction is that the previous Minister responsible for this Department must <Col N="544" /> have had some reason for making that reduction.

      <P>Other Deputies were anxious to know what my attitude would be in relation to wages. Although no definite charge was made, it seemed as if they had in mind that I might have some desire to interfere unnecessarily with something that I regard as the true responsibility of local authorities themselves.  I was for a while a member of a local authority. As a result of my association with that body, as a result of my experience here and as a result of the practice that has always been followed, I know that it is the responsibility of local authorities and the county manager to determine both the rates of wages and the general conditions under which their employees will work.  As far as I am concerned, I would like to see local authorities approaching their task with a full and proper sense of their responsibilities.  As long as I am satisfied that they discharge their responsibilities fairly and equitably, I assure the House that I have no desire on my part to interfere unduly with any decisions they may arrive at in relation to rates of wages or conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Davin or Deputy Cowan who asked me to state in a general way what my attitude will be towards the County Administration Bill, a Bill which had reached a certain stage here prior to the Dissolution.  I have not yet had time to go into all the ramifications of the Bill.  I have not yet had time to seek the advice of my colleagues in the Government as to what out attitude should be in relation to that measure.  Like all measures, I take it there may be some provisions in it that are useful and some provisions that may be either unnecessary or <Col N="545" /> undesirable.  Although I had an opportunity, as other Deputies had, of taking an interest in the measure when it was under discussion here and acquiring more knowledge of its provisions, I did not take advantage of that opportunity and since taking office I have not had time to go into the matter in detail.  I intend to do so as soon as I can.  When the appropriate opportunity presents itself I shall inform the House and the public as to what my attitude is in relation to it.</P>
    <P>The question of the direct labour system in the construction of houses by local authorities was raised here.  I have an open mind in regard to that matter.  I am not prejudiced in one direction or the other.  I regard anything that will introduce into the construction of houses that element of competition which will tend, I hope, to reduce the cost of this service as good and useful.  Local authorities can, therefore, proceed to adopt either the contract system or the direct labour system, whichever they regard as most suitable to their needs.  So long as they do this, they will find that they will not be obstructed, but they will be encouraged rather, as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to have made a study of the matter since taking office, but some time ago I remember reading discussions which took place at meetings of local bodies where a good deal of hostility seemed to be directed towards the introduction of the contract system in the construction of roads.  What I cannot understand is that while some of those who were hostile to the idea of the contract system in the making of roads where the direct labour system prevailed, took the opposite view in relation to the erection of houses where the contract system was in operation. While I have not gone into this matter in a very thorough fashion, I think it would be a good thing if we had both these systems in operation, because as most well-informed people are aware one system serves as a check upon the other and ensures that the best value is obtained for the money spent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> Every Deputy who spoke referred to housing.  Despite the fact that one sometimes finds a tendency on the part of public men to make claims of one kind or another, one against the other, depending on the particular political affiliations of the individual concerned, throwing our minds back over a great many years housing is the one item on which there has been almost entire unanimity.  Not only was that unanimity shown here, but it also prevailed throughout the country.  I thought that the position in Cork City as outlined by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, Deputy Seán MacCarthy and Deputy McGrath could not be absolutely correct.  I thought it strange that the story they told in regard to the progress made there could be accurate.  Since hearing them speak I have made some inquiries as to what was taking place in that area, and I have to admit now that there appear to be some grounds for the general complaint made as to the rate of progress in housing.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have to admit that there were some grounds for the general complaint that was made as to the rate of progress in housing.  We have already taken some steps that may tend to improve the position there but the only thing I can say to the Deputies who are representing that constituency is that the Department and myself will take an interest in the complaints that were voiced here and we shall do everything we can with their co-operation.  The members of the corporation are men who are not slow to make their voices heard and to make their point of view known. I do not say they should not; in fact, they should initiate a fairly strenuous discussion with the city manager on the matters about which they spoke here.  Knowing that they are reasonable men, that they will make their case in a reasonable way and that they will only expect reasonable results, I can assure them that in taking that line of action in order to speed up the erection of houses in Cork City they will have the support of myself and the Department in full measure.</P>

I am talking of the future and I am suggesting to Deputy Hickey and to the Aldermen and members of the corporation a way in which, perhaps, we may secure an improvement in the position as it exists.

      <P>There was a good deal of discussion about that much debated question of the differential rents system.  I am in the happy position that I was not, at any time, until I came into the Department of Local Government, charged with making up my mind as to what I thought of that particular system.  I listened with the greatest interest to what Deputies in this House, who are members of local bodies and who have some experience of its working, had to say.  I have since made inquiries from the officials of the Department as to the accuracy or otherwise of some of the statements that were made as to the amount of hostility that prevailed against the differential rents system.  I take it that the officials responsible are briefing me accurately when they say there is no <Col N="548" /> evidence of volume of hostility to the system that was spoken of here.  Without claiming any special knowledge of the way in which the system operates, I do admit, from my own general knowledge, of how people react to a system of that kind, that you are bound to have a good deal of criticism, a good deal of misunderstanding and, perhaps, a fair share of dissatisfaction from place to place.  If this scheme is fair and equitable as it seems to be, one cannot find any strong argument to make against it.  While admitting that that is the case, in the operation of something that looks fair and reasonable, you sometimes find that things do not work out, as they say, according to plan. In so far as most local bodies are concerned with this new system, there undoubtedly have been complaints. Local bodies have the power to hear those complaints from day to day, to investigate them from time to time and to revise, as they think fit and proper, any of those schemes.  As far as I am concerned in that work which is their responsibility, any amendments that they may think fit to suggest from time to time will be very carefully and sympathetically considered by me.</P>

    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the criticism levelled by several Deputies here against the operation of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I must <Col N="549" /> admit that I have not had much time to see if the complaints that were made in regard to this matter were legitimate or otherwise.  I suppose there was some reason for their being made here but, as far as I can find out, the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts worked reasonably smoothly since the passage of the 1950 Housing (Amendment) Act. Of course, one will find complaints arising here and there in a general sort of way.  I am merely telling the House the experience of those who have watched the operations of these Acts, especially since the passage of the 1950 Housing Act.</P>
    <P>I will consider later some of the statements that were made here and some of the cases that were cited.  I would like to give the House and the country an assurance that if I find there are any grounds for the charges that are made, I will do my best to see that the difficulties are remedied.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to my predecessor for the words of good wishes which he spoke to me in the office in which I have succeeded him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán MacFheorais</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended raising this matter at a later stage, as I did not expect that the Minister would have finished so quickly.  It is a matter which affects every Deputy in this House, one with which each Deputy had contact during the last election and during local elections&mdash;that is the method of compiling the register of electors.  Frankly, I think the method is a bit loose; it does not ensure that every person over 21 years is included in the register. In America and in other countries every person, who in the ordinary course of events is eligible for a vote, registers.  In this country at the present time it is the responsibility of the rate collectors to include in the register of electors those persons, men and women, who have attained the age of 21 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister has had the experience, as other Deputies and I also have had the experience, where there has been failure on the part of <Col N="550" /> rate collectors&mdash;I shall not say maliciously&mdash;to ensure that the names of people who should be on the register are on it.  I have had an experience in my own town where the occupants of six houses were left off the register. Again, I do not say that it was done deliberately, but I say that much more publicity could be given at the appropriate time&mdash;that is, between October and December&mdash;to the fact that the register of electors was being compiled. All qualified persons over 21 are supposed to have the duty, the responsibility and the honour of electing Deputies and, consequently, of electing a Government and the State Departments concerned&mdash;whether they be Radio Eireann, the Department of Local Government or the Department of Justice&mdash;ought to take the responsibility of giving publicity to the fact that a register is being compiled.  I would suggest that a notice should be sent to the electors notifying them that they were included on the register, so that if, say, 90 per cent. of the people in a village or a street are notified that their names have been included, the 10 per cent. who have been left off will then make it their business to see that they also are included.  At the present time the people who are charged with the responsibility of making sure that the register of electors is properly compiled are, in fact, the political Parties.  That should not be the case and I would suggest to the Minister that he should try to tackle this problem and to devise some better method of compiling the register, so that we would not all have to encounter the grievances and difficulties with which we have to deal especially on the day of an election.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the plea made to the Minister by Deputy Corish in regard to the compiling of the register.  At present there appears to be a good deal of laxity and I would suggest that a penalty be imposed on any rate collector who fails knowingly in his duty in this regard.  We have had such cases.  People who should be on the register were not included due to the neglect of rate collectors.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  So far as the compilation of the register is concerned, I can only say that my experience has been identical with that of the Deputies who have spoken.  I do not know what we can do to rectify the matters complained of.  While the system seems to be elaborate enough and, on the surface, appears to give sufficient protection, what Deputy Corish has stated is true, that it is left to the political Parties to see who are on the register.  Unfortunately, the political Parties do not always see to it any more than the individuals themselves who are left off.  I have seen villages where people on one side of the street were on the register and people on the other side were not.  I do not know how these things can happen.  I can only say that the matters complained of will be examined. If possible, some better system will be provided, but I cannot give an assurance on that head.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;To assist agricultural production by (1) guaranteed prices for milk, wheat, beet and such other products as after investigation may prove to be practicable; (2) seeking new trade agreements to secure export prices <Col N="553" /> fair to Irish producers; (3) ensuring the availability and encouraging the maximum use of fertilisers and lime; (4) extending the service of free technical aid and advice; (5) providing financial aid for the purchase of equipment; (6) extending State schemes for the improvement of farms and farm buildings; (7) operating a well-planned and practicable programme of reclamation and drainage, and (8) regular consultation between the Minister for Agriculture and representative farmer organisations on all aspects of agricultural policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are some matters of special importance that I particularly wish to mention now.  The first concerns the price of milk.</P>
    <P>I consider that the increase in the price of creamery milk which was approved by the previous Government was inadequate.  I am of opinion that that increase, which amounted to 1d. per gallon for the summer period, did not adequately reflect the net increase in cost of milk production since 1947, when the previous increase was given. The Government have fully considered the matter and I am glad to be able to announce that it has approved, with effect from 1st July, 1951, of a further increase of 1d. per gallon in the summer price and also of an increase of 2d. per gallon in the winter price. The new prices will therefore be 1/4 per gallon in the summer period and 1/6 per gallon in the winter period. Compared with 1950-51 the price for creamery milk will thus have been increased by a total of 2d. per gallon.</P>
    <P>The new price arrangements will restore the margin of 2d. per gallon between the summer and the winter price, which obtained from 1947 until 1st May, 1951.  There is every justification for this in view of the higher cost of producing milk in the winter period.</P>
    <P>Consequential on these increases, the retail price of butter will be increased by 2d. per lb to 3/-, and the Exchequer will be charged with an additional sum of over £400,000.  These are substantial increases, but they will be justified in full if producers will make every effort to increase their milk production <Col N="554" /> so that home production of creamery butter will suffice not only to meet the ration but to enable off-ration sales to be resumed.  I would much prefer that our butter requirements could be entirely met from home production rather than that, as at present, supplies should have to be supplemented by imports.  The indications at the moment are that it may be necessary to import a few thousand tons in the coming season; the exact amount will, of course, depend on weather conditions here in the months ahead.  With a view to ensuring as far as possible that future consignments of imported butter are fully acceptable to consumers, I have arranged for technical discussions in the supplying country with experts of my Department.</P>
    <P>As regards past supplies difficulties arose mainly on consignments of sweet cream butter which had been specially made for the Irish market.  Some of this butter was not satisfactory, principally in connection with keeping quality and odour.  The quantity of such sweet cream butter returned by traders on quality grounds was about 340 cwt. or slightly over 1 per cent. of the total imports of such butter.  I think that the defects were probably attributable to the fact that sweet cream butter involved a new technique for the supplying country.</P>
    <P>The earlier consignments of sour butter did not please the Irish consumer, who was unaccustomed to its flavour.  The vast bulk of this sour cream butter was in fact technically good.</P>
    <P>The question of prices for farmer's butter has also been considered and I propose to enter into negotiations with butter factories with a view to working out details of a scheme under which factories would be enabled to pay 3/-per lb. for best quality farmers' butter and corresponding prices for butter of secondary quality.  The quantity of butter likely to be involved during the current financial year cannot be gauged with any degree of accuracy at this stage.  It is possible that with the incentive of the better prices which will be obtainable approximately 1,000 <Col N="555" /> tons of farmers' butter may reach the factories, and the cost of the subsidy may be in the region of £75,000.</P>
    <P>I am having examined in my Department the feasibility of extending the system of travelling creameries to areas bordering on those covered by existing creameries in order to get into the creameries milk from outlying districts. In the case of areas far removed from existing creamery facilities the question of making special arrangements for the collection in suitable areas of fresh cream separated on the farms is being considered with a view to having such cream made into butter in central premises specially equipped for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I am considering the possibility of some arrangement under which the cost of milk production in the creamery areas would be reviewed periodically by some expert and impartial authority. The results of these investigations would be taken into account in fixing the prices for milk.  I am not yet in a position to announce any final details but I shall do so as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On the question of tillage, it is obviously imperative in the present international situation that the maximum amount of wheat and feeding stuffs be grown at home.  I propose therefore to give every encouragement to increased home production of grain and other crops and this matter is at present engaging my close attention.</P>
    <P>Provisions about the sale of wheat will be incorporated in the Wheat Order, 1951, which will be made at an early date.</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that the production from our own soil of root and other seeds serves a basic need in the national economy and should be encouraged and expanded.  I am, therefore, taking steps in this direction while at the same time providing for imports to meet special cases.</P>
    <P>Persons or organisations desiring to engage in the production and processing of such seeds in a substantial way will be facilitated; and commercial imports of such seeds will be proportioned to the efforts they make to produce <Col N="556" /> such seeds at home.  Farmers who wish to import small quantities of such seeds for use on their own farms and not for resale may do so, but it is my hope that the overall importations may be on a gradually diminishing scale according as our own production increases.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned in my opening remarks I am not proposing to elaborate in further detail at this stage on the matters arising on the present Estimate.  I shall of course be glad to give information on any points which Deputies wish to raise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to secure a statement from the Minister indicating whether it is his intention to carry on the policy in relation to agriculture which has been in operation during the past three years.  In the minds of the farmers of this country there is the fear that there may be a drift backwards towards the conditions which existed amongst them pre-war, then, following on, during the emergency and, later, after the emergency.  The farmers found, during those years, that there was an inclination on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government to interfere too much with the management of their affairs.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister has stated that at a later date he intends to make a statement regarding the guaranteed price for wheat.  If he is a man as good as his word he will keep faith with statements made by him in this House on that subject.  I believe myself that he said that 70/- a barrel for wheat, guaranteed, would not be a sufficient return for the farmers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I made no such statement at any time as 70/- per barrel.  The Deputy had better refresh his memory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to quote statements which the Minister has made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting-Chairman (Mr. M. O'Reilly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has denied it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's denial.  I hope, at a later date, to get an opportunity of quoting for the Minister his own statements.  However, if <Col N="557" /> the Minister did not advocate that price himself, certainly his colleagues did and I should like him to keep faith with his colleagues.  I would like him to keep faith with his colleagues and with the representatives of his own Party by guaranteeing a minimum of not less than 70/- a barrel for wheat. Apparently the guarantee advocated was regardless of politics.  Certainly, so far as the farmers are concerned, they would be very glad if he decided to meet the demands of his own colleagues in this respect.</P>
      <P>With regard to pigs, I remember quite well&mdash;and I think the Minister cannot deny this&mdash;that when Mr. Dillon, the previous Minister for Agriculture, mentioned that he had secured and he was now in a position to guarantee 220/- a cwt. for pigs, the present Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Walsh, said that £12 10s. 0d. a cwt. would not be sufficient for the farmer. In that case, I hope that he will take steps to adjust the price of pigs upwards in order that the producers of pigs will get £12 10s. 0d. a cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, I would like to know from the Minister whether it is his intention to control the price of barley as it was before Deputy Dillon came into office. When Deputy Dillon came into office, we found that the price of barley was controlled down to 35/- a barrel.  We found a position where, when the maltsters had finished buying all the barley in this country at 35/- per barrel, they travelled to the ends of the earth paying anything up to 85/- per barrel delivered for their own requirements. We found that the farmers of this country lost what is calculated to be approximately £2,000,000 as a result of the control during the years when it was necessary for the maltsters to seek their requirements of barley elsewhere. At the present time, the world price of barley is even lower than the price being received by our own growers for the home product.  I hope that advantage of that situation will not be taken by the new Minister and that he will not interfere with the farmers in the matter of applying control because I am in favour of private enterprise.  I am in favour of giving the farmer a chance to get the best terms possible <Col N="558" /> for those who are interested in the produce of the land.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this particular matter comes within the Minister's duties or not, but I would like to know what he is going to do in regard to the victuallers.  Many of the victuallers have been complaining that they cannot make their business pay having regard to the present prices of beef.  Representations were made many times to the inter-Party Government asking for an adjustment which would enable the victuallers to balance out.  There are two months in the year, particularly May and June, when the butchers find it impossible to make ends meet and to compete in the market for beef.</P>

      <P>There is another matter upon which I want to get a statement from the Minister and that is the export of horse flesh from this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On various occasions, I have referred to the fact that the farmers are inclined to replace horses by tractors and other types of equipment on the farm.  This leaves them in the position that they do not require as many horses as they required in the past.  The result is that farmers are inclined to dispose of the horses at the best prices they can get.  I am aware that there is a demand for these horses outside this country.  So far as I know, only horses which are considered by qualified veterinary surgeons to be fit for work are allowed to be exported from this country.  It is alleged that, when these horses leave the country, they are slaughtered on <Col N="559" /> the continent and disposed of as horse flesh.  If the Minister would make inquiries and see whether this is a fact, and if he is satisfied that this is what happens horses certified to be fit for work on leaving our shores, I would like him to consider whether it would not be better business to establish some kind of a horse canning factory in this country.  Certainly, I am not in favour of any kind of industry in the matter of canning horse flesh.  I do not believe that we should produce horses for that purpose.  We should concentrate more on the production of beef, mutton and bacon.  At the same time, if we find, during the next couple of years, that there is a surplus of horses so far as the farmers are concerned; that they want to dispose of them and that there is no organisation that will take the horses off the hands of the farmers, we ought to see whether it would not be better business now to find out definitely the purposes for which these horses are being used when they leave the country.  If we are satisfied that the horses are being used on the continent as horse flesh and not for work, I think we ought to consider the possibilities of establishing now some kind of a horse flesh industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy remembers quite well that it was intended at the time to slaughter those horses, put the horse flesh in tins and sell it as beef on the continent; &ldquo;Con-Biadh&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, canned beef on the continent. We decided, and rightly so, that people on the continent buying meat should not be deceived and that we should not send any kind of flesh out of this country under a wrong <Col N="560" /> description.  If it were beef, let it be described as such and if it were horse flesh let it be described as horse flesh. The factory to which Deputy Allen refers were requested whether they would describe the meat that was put into tins as horse flesh and they refused to do so.  That was why an end was put to the scheme for the slaughter of horses and export of horse flesh at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen knows all about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he does.  I think he is pretty familiar with it all right. Another matter on which I should like some information is the price which butchers here receive for cattle hides. I understand that they are receiving only 10d. a lb., while there is a scheme in England under which the butchers there receive something like 4/6 a lb. If it pays somebody in England to pay 4/6 a lb. for hides, surely it must pay somebody in Ireland to give more than 10d. to the butchers here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that we should sell these hides as cheaply as possible so as to keep our boot and shoe industry going and put it in a position in which it is able to show a profit and provide employment.  At the same time, I am sure that the factories here have reached a certain degree of competence and efficiency comparable with that which exists in factories in Great Britain.  If that is the case, I do not believe that they are only one-third as efficient as they are in Great Britain, so far as making boots and shoes is concerned, but the price being offered to the butchers here for hides would appear to suggest that. Strangely enough, we find that boots and shoes are coming into this country and being sold across the shop counters in competition with our own products, although 4/6 a lb. has been paid for hides across the water as compared with 10d. a lb. for hides going into the factories here.  Some effort should be made to bring about a proper adjustment and to ensure that somebody is not getting too much at the expense of somebody else because there is a big difference between 10d. <Col N="561" /> a lb. here and 4/6 a lb. in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I should like to get a statement from the Minister regarding his attitude towards the poultry industry.  For a few months early this year, the inter-Party Government were very severely criticised because they did not succeed in inducing the British Government to guarantee more than 2/- per dozen for our eggs.  On coming into office in 1948, we found a position in which the British Government had to subsidise the poultry industry here.  They had to offer £1,250,000 so that we could set up hatcheries and expand our poultry trade.  That was just another example of the policy in relation to agriculture which was carried on by Fianna Fáil over the years.  They were always regarded as the traditional enemies of agriculture and were proved to be such by reason of certain conditions which we found&mdash;the poultry industry having to be financed and re-established on the basis of a grant of £1,250,000 and also the position in the pig industry.  We found that there was scarcely a pig left in the country and there was certainly no bacon.  One would have to be a very good customer of the grocer to get a lb. of bacon in the week.  We altered that position in relation to both poultry and pigs.  The value of poultry and eggs exported from this country in 1950 was in the region of £8,000,000 and the value when we came into office was only oneeighth of that amount.</P>
    <P>We should also like a statement from the Minister with regard to the price of oats.  We remember that a couple of years ago the farmers had a surplus of 1,000,000 barrels of oats on their hands.  A very strong and very deliberate agitation was carried on, mainly at the behest of the Fianna Fáil Party, to get the then Government to guarantee a price per barrel for oats at the expense of the general taxpayers, but the only time the Fianna Fáil Party guaranteed a price of 25/8 for oats was when oats could not be got and when there was no necessity to give any kind of guarantee.  I should like to know whether the Minister intends to guarantee a price for homegrown oats.  The farmers will be very <Col N="562" /> glad if he decides to give any kind of reasonable guarantee in that matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to feeding stuffs, I should like to hear whether he will consider the establishment of some kind of processing factories here which would enable a good supply of feeding stuffs for poultry and pigs to be made available.  The prices of feeding stuffs from outside have gone beyond the pockets of the producers who cannot put pigs and poultry on the market at a fairly reasonable price to the consumers if they must pay exorbitant prices for feeding stuffs from outside countries.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, our agricultural economy at the moment is very sound and people living and working on the land were never so prosperous.  Their present position is mainly due to the vigorous policy of expansion and development pursued by the previous. Minister who approached every problem fearlessly and improved each sphere of agricultural economy one after the other.  One of the monuments to his efforts during the past three years is the land reclamation scheme. I believe that scheme will mean, in the long run, an improvement in the standard of living of our people which could otherwise never have been reached because it will have the effect of making the land more productive and of enabling farmers to produce more from a given acreage with less expense. These things, in the long run, will make for an improvement in the country's economy and will enable the farmers to put various classes of food on the market at a reasonable price to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give us a very clear statement regarding his policy.  We want to hear from him what his attitude towards the creamery milk suppliers is.  His Party were particularly interested in the agitation carried on by that organisation, and it is only right that we should expect that he and his Party will adhere to the views they held on that question in recent months.  I am not quite sure&mdash; perhaps the Minister will tell me whether it is a fact, as I had not time to examine the debate just now&mdash;but <Col N="563" /> I am inclined to think that a figure of 1/6 per gallon was the figure he had in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made an announcement regarding the price of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here.  In any case, I feel that it is due to the creamery milk suppliers from the Minister that he should keep faith with the attitude which he adopted towards this problem in recent months. Of course, it depends on the cost of production in future years as to whether the adjusted price will be a paying proposition or not.  Certainly, dairying was on the downgrade before the Fianna Fáil Government was replaced by the inter-Party Government. There were less cows in the country than there had been for many years; we had reached the lowest point in the number of cows and the quantity of milk being sent to creameries.</P>
      <P>In the past three years, the figures show that there has been an increase in the number of persons who went into the production of milk; there has been a considerable increase in the number of dairy cows; there has been a great increase in the quantity of milk supplied to the creameries and a huge increase in the amount of money received by the farmers in respect of the milk and, of course, in respect of calves, directly connected with the dairying industry.  I hope that the attitude to be adopted now by this new Minister will have the effect of carrying on the policy so vigorously embarked upon by the previous Minister, Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to start by congratulating the new Minister personally on his nomination by the Taoiseach and his selection by this House for the important post of Minister for Agriculture.  I do so very gladly and in full realisation of the difficult task which faces him.  It will be a task of considerable difficulty, not by reason of the problems which he will have to face but by reason of the standard to which he must work.  He is taking over a Department which in three short <Col N="564" /> years has grown from being a subsidiary Department to one of the premier Departments of the State.  We all can recollect&mdash;and particularly the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil portion of the present Government&mdash;away back three and a half years ago to the days when the Department of Agriculture was under the guidance of several Ministers in succession.  It was then merely a sub-Department of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They can recollect the days when the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, previously occupied that position and in fact dictated the agricultural policy.  That was continuously the situation when the Fianna Fáil Government was previously in office.  When the inter-Party Government was elected to power by the votes of the people in February, 1948, a change took place in agricultural policy.  Under the guidance of Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, the Department assumed an importance that it had not enjoyed since the days of the late Paddy Hogan.</P>
      <P>While I congratulate the new Minister on his appointment, my congratulation must be tempered with some suspicion and doubt as to whether we are to have again a similar suppression of this Department.  It is at least noteworthy that the present Minister should have been selected.  He has only the same experience of Dáil Éireann, a very short experience, as I have; he has never occupied a position such as this before; yet he has been selected as the new Minister.  I trust that does not mean that once again we are to witness the suppression of this Department as against others, that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce is not going to dictate again the agricultural policy to be pursued. I hope the new Minister can at least continue the work of his predecessor and ensure that agriculture will be recognised by the present Government, for its short period as a Government, as the important industry, the only industry, upon which the prosperity and economic fabric of the country depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said the Minister will have a very <Col N="565" /> difficult standard to attain.  I say that in all sincerity.  I do not believe there is a Deputy here, including the present Minister, who has any doubt as to the tremendous work achieved in three short years by the Minister's predecessor. I was used to hear the malcontent Deputies, such as the former Independent Deputy for Wicklow, Deputy Cogan, sniping at the former Minister.  I was also accustomed to hear certain Fianna Fáil back-bencher Deputies, like Deputy Martin Corry from Cork, raising hue and cry regarding agricultural policy.  Only eight or nine short weeks ago, the entire public business here was held up for some five or six weeks while this Estimate was being discussed.</P>
    <P>Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party were clamouring like a pack of hounds for compulsory tillage and the hound master was the present Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Walsh, as he then was, only nine weeks ago declared his political belief and conviction to be that compulsory tillage was the only policy for this country.  In that marathon debate Deputy Cogan had some other pet subjects which he ventilated and every section of the present Government&mdash;it is a sectionalised Government if ever we had one in this country; it is a Government by malcontents&mdash;had some different quarrel to pick with the Minister's predecessor. It was at least fortunate that the issue should have remained undecided by the 13th Dáil.</P>
    <P>It was at least fortunate that the issue of the previous Government's agricultural policy should have been submitted to the votes of the people, and I challenge any member of the present Government, particularly Deputy Cogan from Wicklow and the Minister for Agriculture, to controvert the statement that if ever a portion of the Government's policy was completely vindicated by the people of the country it was the policy of the Minister's predecessor.  In every part of rural Ireland, the majority of voters completely endorsed the agricultural policy of the inter-Party Government; in the West of Ireland Fianna Fáil <Col N="566" /> seats tumbled one after another; the Kingdom of Kerry that used to be a Fianna Fáil stronghold returned one Fianna Fáil Deputy, and Deputy Cogan who fancied himself as Minister for Agriculture at one time, and who had a spleen because he was not selected, scrambled into the last seat in his own constituency in Wicklow, and he will never win any seat there again.</P>
    <P>These are important matters because the people of the country in the general election undoubtedly decided the issue that we are now in a very unreal atmosphere discussing to-day.  They undoubtedly decided that they completely endorsed the general agricultural policy put into operation by Deputy Dillon as a Minister of the previous Government.  Naturally there were certain matters of detail which engaged the attention of smaller men with smaller minds.  Take the question of milk prices.  That is the one thing upon which some political capital was made by the Fianna Fáil Opposition when the election was being fought but even in the Golden Vale and in every milk-producing constituency in Ireland a majority of Deputies were returned who favoured Deputy Dillon's agricultural policy.</P>

      <P>He is something the eat brought in but he will be better later.  Before Deputy Gallagher erupted I was referring to the endorsement of the policy of the Minister's predecessor even in milk-producing constituencies.  In each constituency a <Col N="567" /> majority of Deputies was sent back to implement that policy.  It must have been the cause of some disappointment to our political opponents.  To demonstrate that the endorsement of the policy contained in this Estimate was not confined to any one section of the agricultural community or to any one part of the country one can point to the same consistent vote in favour of the policy pursued by Deputy Dillon in each province and even in the poorer areas of the West and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest miracle of all, the most notable achievement of Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, was the conversion of these gentlemen opposite to his policy, the conversion of Deputy Mark Killilea when the issue was to be decided by the Irish people to a firm conviction that the only tillage policy for Ireland was a policy which would provide farmers with the necessary fertilisers to put into their land, which would attract them to till by fair prices and induce them by guaranteed prices in an expanding market to work their land.  There was the policy of Deputy Dillon.  Against that was the policy of Deputy Walsh when in opposition, the policy of compulsion, of the whip and of the lash.  The conversion took place right in the middle of the election campaign.  Deputy Seán Lemass, as he then was, was sent posthaste from the City of Dublin down the country to make a speech declaring that Fianna Fáil had abandoned compulsory tillage.  They were taught their lesson.  They realised that the policy of the Minister's predecessor which Deputy Corry from Cork and the rest of them had been criticising here for three and a half years was the correct policy and the only one which would have the support of the people of the country.  Now we find that the greatest exponent of Deputy Dillon's tillage policy is the present Minister for Agriculture.  I congratulate him heartily on that conversion.  I congratulate him on being a man big enough to realise that the Deputy Walsh who spoke in this House from these benches only eight weeks ago was an omadhaun.  I trust that it is <Col N="568" /> a sincere conversion.  I trust that the cloak of penance which the Minister for Agriculture wears with regard to compulsory tillage does not still conceal the heart of a knave.  I hope that the present temporary caretaker Government will not utilise present circumstances to ventilate their old policy of compulsory tillage.  If they do, let me warn them that there will be something approaching open revolt in rural Ireland. It will not affect Deputy Cogan because he cannot go back to his constituents, but it will affect the Minister, Deputy Corry, Deputy Killilea, and the rest of them if they endeavour ever again in this country to compel Irish farmers to act the part of slaves.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which used to be discussed by our friends in the Fianna Fáil section of the Government when they were in opposition.  I do not know whether they will endeavour to carry out the things they used to talk about.  Possibly they may.  I see that the Minister for Agriculture announced in the House an increase in milk prices.  That, of course, is an important announcement both from Deputy Gallagher's point of view and from the point of view of country Deputies.  An increase in the price of milk does not come from the pockets of the Minister for Agriculture no matter how elegant his salary may be.  It has to be paid for either by increased prices direct from the consumer or by a subsidy which comes from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The honest way, I suppose, is to put up the price of milk by whatever may be decided upon, by 1d. or 2d., and to say: &ldquo;There is what milk is to cost; anybody who buys butter must pay the price.&rdquo; That may be the honest way of doing it.  I suppose it would not be a politically acute way of doing it.  If it were a politically acute way of doing it, we would not be honoured in this House by Deputy Gallagher.  I do not know whether the Minister has indicated the manner in which this increased price will be raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>By increasing the price of butter.  The situation now is that Deputy Gallagher will have to <Col N="569" /> meet his constituents and explain to them how generous the Minister for Agriculture has been in increasing the price of milk for the farmer, but that it is unfortunate that in doing so the Minister has increased the price of butter, particularly as I have no doubt that Deputy Gallagher during the recent general election campaign went around prating about the increase in the price of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not deny the right of the farmer to get an increased price for his milk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily approve of it.  What I object to is the dishonest attitude of the gentlemen who support the Minister for Agriculture. Deputy Corry went down the country demanding an increase in the price of milk and the city Deputies went around Westland Row and Inchicore saying: &ldquo;Is it not terrible that James Dillon is putting up the price of butter by 2d. a 1b.?&rdquo; That is the attitude I object to.  The entire campaign with regard to milk prices and the price of butter was a dishonest one.  I know that the people saw that it was dishonest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not agree that they should get it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the increase in the price of milk.  I think it is a proper thing.  I only wish that the view of the Minister's predecessor was put into operation by the present Minister by encouraging a better type of cow for the dairy industry. Apparently that suggestion has not been pursued.  That is regrettable, because I believe in what Deputy Dillon stated when Minister for Agriculture, and he will be Minister for Agriculture again soon, that we should so organise the dairy industry that we could produce a beast which would give a far higher yield of milk and thus increase the return to the dairy industry without increasing the burden of the consumer who has to pay for butter.  However, the Minister has taken the quick way, probably the easy way, of doing it and I wish him luck in it.  I only wish that he had supporting <Col N="570" /> him a Party that spoke with one voice, because he will find that there are still two or three voices in the Fianna Fáil Party, one of them advocating one policy in relation to the cities and others advocating another policy in relation to rural Ireland. That did not work at the last election, because the people showed by their vote that they wanted an inter-Party Government to carry out the policy of the previous Government.  That decision was set at nought.  The present Minister was put into the high position which he now occupies by a few disgruntled malcontents who set at nought the decision of the Irish people. <i>(Interruption.)</i>  Deputy Cogan is one of them and the voters are only waiting to get at him again.  They are only waiting to get at Deputy Killilea, Deputy Allen and the present Minister for Agriculture.  If there is to-day, as there undoubtedly is, a feeling of insecurity and instability in this country, it arises from the fact that the people know that a Government and a Minister they do not want have been foisted upon them.  <i>(Interruption.)</i> The Deputy should behave himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins should behave himself or he may hear something he may not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition will want to know who will dictate the agricultural policy of the Government. Has Deputy Cowan been consulted?  If Deputy Cowan has not been consulted, have we any guarantee that the present Government will be here next week?  Have we any guarantee that Deputy Cowan, who time and time again was attacked by the present Minister for Finance as being a Communist, will approve of the increase in the price of butter?  These are serious considerations.  In the Dáil we have discussed the policy of the Minister for Agriculture as the policy of one person. Unfortunately, we cannot do it with the present Minister because we do not know how many cooks have prepared the broth that now represents the agricultural policy of the present temporary caretaker Government. <Col N="571" /> Apparently, Deputy Cogan has secured some sort of assurance that compulsory tillage will not be reintroduced.  For how long will that assurance last? These are matters which are of considerable importance, because as Deputy Allen knows, there is to-day in every farming district in Ireland a complete feeling of insecurity with regard to the agricultural policy of the Government. Nobody believes that the Government will last.  Nobody trusts any declaration or policy they may make.  Nobody believes that the present Minister for Agriculture is in a position to act on behalf of the farmers.</P>
      <P>That is a serious situation and it has been brought about because on the 13th June in this House a bad trick was played by five malcontent Deputies on the people of Ireland.  I only hope that for the short time the Minister for Agriculture occupies that elevated post he will not try, out of a feeling of political spleen or anything of that kind, to undo the good work done by his predecessor.  I am sure that he will not set about his duties in that frame of mind.  I am certain that he appreciates, in his own constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, the benefit which his constituents have enjoyed from the land reclamation scheme.  I trust that, in relation to that scheme and the other matters of policy implemented by his predecessor, although he may be urged by Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll and the rest of them to do so, he will nevertheless recognise the good work which has been done and that he will not interfere with or retard it in any way.</P>
      <P>I was sorry to read in a newspaper the other day the Minister's announcement that he proposes some modification of the land reclamation scheme. Perhaps the report may have been inaccurate as I read it in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I trust that the modification which the Minister refers to will not mean a reduction in the application of the land reclamation scheme.  It will be a matter which the Minister will sincerely regret if he stops that work in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> I can only hope that, now that Deputy Martin Corry finds himself in the responsible position of supporting in this House and in his constituency in Cork the policy and personality of the present Minister for Agriculture, he will endeavour to understand some of the difficulties which face the Minister; he will endeavour to understand that the Minister has a high standard to attain to; that he has either to carry out the policy of his predecessor or admit the administration of his Department to be a failure.  There is no other alternative before the present Minister for Agriculture.  He must either implement what his predecessor was doing and subscribe entirely to the policy of his predecessor or find himself and his Government in chaos. There is no other alternative.  It is a difficult position for a political opponent of Deputy Dillon to find himself in, a very difficult position indeed for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope that when Deputy Martin Corry, as I am sure he will, administers spankings to the present Minister at Party meetings of the Fianna Fáil section of the Government, he will recognise the difficulties which face the present Minister.  He cannot just endeavour to put back the hands of the clock and have us back in the days of 1947 when agriculture just did not count in this country.  He cannot have us back in the days when the farmer was the cap-toucher to every businessman throughout Ireland.  He cannot have us back in those days.  He must continue the policy of his predecessor in building up agriculture into something of economic importance to the country.</P>
    <P>That is what is in store for the Minister.  I warn him on behalf of the Fine Gael Party that he will have to work; that we will allow no slacking in his Department or indeed in any other Department in the present temporary Government.  He must watch his job and see that the good work that was being carried on in Ireland four weeks ago is continued.  He must keep his nose to the grindstone, if there is a grindstone in the present Government, for 24 hours of the day, and every time he slacks we will show his <Col N="573" /> shortcomings here in the nation's Parliament.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I may refer to one particular matter.  Now that Deputy Walsh unexpectedly finds himself Minister of the Government, with Deputy Michael Moran behind him who, eight weeks ago, from this side of the House breathed fire and brimstone on all of us with regard to the thousands of bullocks and calves that were lying dead all over the roads of this country, I trust, when that problem undoubtedly exists, the present Minister for Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You admit it exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say the Minister said it.  I say that Deputy Michael Moran said it.  I trust that particular problem will engage the immediate attention of the Minister for Agriculture, as it was engaging the attention of his predecessor.  I am sorry to have to say this to the Minister, that in one area in my constituency, the Luggacurran electoral area, there have been some losses of stock in the last three months or so&mdash;two and a half months&mdash;slightly less than that.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that I am not digging out dead carcases now merely in order to present them to the Minister.  Indeed, if the Minister cares to consult the records of his Department he will find that this is a matter that I raised there time and time again, before ever the Vote for Agriculture was on last.  I want to recommend this to the Minister. His predecessor was suggesting or considering a particular scheme that would give local relief.  The particular problem had been brought about by the bad winter, and so on.  There was a particular scheme being considered, for restocking, or something of that <Col N="574" /> kind.  It was mentioned in the Dáil.  I trust that it will now get the attention of the present Minister for Agriculture. If it does not, I warn the Minister about the consequences because he has sitting behind him Deputies like Deputy Flynn and Deputy Moran who exulted over every dead carcase they found in Ireland eight weeks ago. Cattle may or may not have died but, if they died, their death will not pass unnoticed in this House if the Minister does nothing about it.</P>

I am giving the Minister my own information that, in the last four or five weeks or so in one particular area in my constituency, farmers suffered loss of stock.  I do not know the medical reason for it.  The Minister probably knows more about that than I do.  I am informed that some of the losses are due to the fact that cattle that were in an undernourished condition, feeding on new grass, developed some particular ailment and died.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They know that area well.  The Minister will be armed with far more accurate information than I could give him.  I do expect that, as regards those people who suffered in recent weeks and months, the Minister will take steps to compensate them in some way for the losses they have sustained. The particular area that I have mentioned is an extremely poor area. I am not making a case here on behalf of any man who had ten, 11 or 12 head of cattle.  If he lost cattle it was his own fault because he could have sold some of them to get feeding stuffs.  I am talking about the unfortunate fellow who had just a few cattle and lost them.  They represented his entire asset.  It is that man's case that I want the Minister to attend to.  I hope it will engage his immediate attention.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House any longer.  I wish the Minister every good fortune, personally, as Minister for Agriculture.  I know that, when he speaks on the Estimate for Agriculture next year in opposition, he will wish all good fortune to his successor.  While his period may be short, we realise fully the difficulties which he will have to contend with.  We realise the rabble that he has behind him and the record that he will have to face up to, but, if he keeps his head and does not change the policy, if he stands aside and lets the work proceed, he will be all right.</P>

Deputy O'Higgins was wild about the price of milk, ignoring the fact that, in order to depress the price of milk, the previous Minister for Agriculture sold on a foreign market what he had no right to sell&mdash;good, decent Irish butter.  He sold it at 98/-per cwt. less than the Danes got for theirs.  Let us take that first and examine it.  He then had to rush to the Danes again and purchase inferior butter from them.  Deputies protested against their people having to eat it. He brought that in here and paid more for it than he had been paid for our Irish butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us examine that in this land of milk and honey where we do not know what to do with the milk and find out what the position is now. In regard to that position, I addressed the following question to-day to the Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will state (a) the total quantity of butter required to maintain the eight ounce ration for 12 months, including the ration of butter for creamery milk suppliers which they were receiving for a number of years and which was denied them in June, 1950; (b) the quantity of imported butter he estimates it will be necessary to import to supply the foregoing ration and the approximate import price.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is the reply I received:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) Total quantity required, 740,000 cwt.  (b) Present indications are that it may be necessary to supplement home production by the importation of about 3,000 tons.  The exact quantity to be imported will, of course, depend on whether the weather during the remainder of the season is favourable to milk production. I am not in a position at present to say what will be the price of such supplies as it may be necessary to import.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am glad that the ringing of the bell has brought in some Deputies who were not here during the past three years, and that Deputy Corry, on Deputy Dillon's policy of agriculture, has succeeded in bringing them into the House.  I will now read a statement which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 13th June last:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A meeting of creamery managers from all the Munster counties, members of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association, was held at the Town Hall, Mallow, County Cork, yesterday.  The following statement was made after the meeting: &lsquo;This meeting is of the unanimous opinion that the quantity of creamery butter produced this year would be at least 15 per cent. down on last year's production, and that the Government is faced with the importation of a considerable quantity of Danish or New Zealand butter to meet the country's requirements, <Col N="579" /> or, alternatively, reducing the present ration to 6 or even 4 ozs. a week&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position in which Deputy Thomas Walsh, Minister for Agriculture, found himself on the day that he took over.  The statement continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having regard to the fact that all the indications show that the United States, Canada and Australia would probably join the other butter-importing countries this year&mdash;that is Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland&mdash;it means that butter prices are undoubtedly going to be higher.</P>
    <P>The present sterling equivalent of creamery butter prices in the United States, Canada, Belgium and Germany to-day ranged from 449/3 to 550s. per cwt.  If those prices are to be paid for imported butter to the extent of about 25 per cent. of our total requirements, it is strongly urged that an economic price be now fixed for home milk producers so as to ensure that a sufficiency of Irish creamery butter is available for our own people next season.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Three thousand tons to be bought from the foreigner at, taking the lowest price quoted there of 450/- a cwt., represents £1,350,000 of the Irish people's money paid to the foreigner for imported butter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>And nothing at all about what was paid for the five votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first problem our Minister for Agriculture has to face.  That is the direct result of the activities of Deputy James Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture.  That was his policy: go to the foreigner and pay him the equivalent of 1/6 per gallon for milk at the creamery, pay that to the Danes and to the New Zealander but do not dream of paying it to the Irish farmer.  That was the policy of Deputy James Dillon and there is the result.  Is the Deputy not ashamed?</P>

The first week he sold a chair; Deputy Dillon did that.  The second week he sold the table; Deputy Dillon has done that.  The third week he sold the dresser; Deputy Dillon has done that.  Then he sold the bed and, having sold the bed, he cleared out.</P>

      <P>However, that is the position.  Now we have Deputy T. F. O'Higgins complaining because the price of milk will go up and because the farmer will get now what Deputy James Dillon handed to the foreigner and what Deputy James Dillon put us in the position of having to pay to the foreigner.  We will have to go out now on the continent and pay the foreigner the equivalent of 1/6 per gallon for milk delivered at the creamery for foreign butter, for Brian Boru stuff, bring it in here and dish it out to our people for the next ten months.</P>
      <P>I doubt if the Minister can succeed in 12 months in bringing back the dairy herds again.  I can remember how often I stood up in the benches over there and warned the then Minister that there was one branch of agriculture back into which it was very difficult to bring the farmer once he left it. It is very difficult to get the farmer to go back into keeping a dairy herd once he gives up that branch of agriculture. I know that because I keep one myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That, Sir, is one of the things that the Minister has to face. It is almost an impossible task to induce a farmer, who now finds he need only ramble out on a Saturday evening and have a look at the cattle and go down on Sunday and look at them again, to change his method of farming.  It would be a very difficult task to bring that man around to putting in a dairy herd and dairy stock, but it is a task that must be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, now, is the surplus of butter which Deputy James Dillon assured the farmers he would have to sell to Britain at 271/- a cwt. when he came back with a five-year guarantee: &ldquo;I will give you 2d. a gallon less than Paddy Smith gave you three years ago.  I will give you 2d. a gallon less and I will give you a guarantee for five years; otherwise no one knows what will happen, there will be so much butter in the country and nobody to eat it.  I have no market <Col N="583" /> for it except the British market&mdash;271/- a cwt.&rdquo; That was the Minister's statement.  That was the circular that was sent out by the Minister to every co-operative society in the country. That fraud, or attempted fraud, is the cause of our having to look for and purchase 3,000 tons of butter on the foreign market, and to pay for that, not the 271/- for which Deputy James Dillon was prepared to sell our butter to Britain, but from 450/- to 550/- a cwt.  This is a lovely condition of affairs.  Still, I grant him this much, that there are a couple of idiots of representatives of farmers who went into the Lobby&mdash;I do not know what guarantee they had from Deputy Costello&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some very foolish Deputies who, apparently, had not come to the use of reason or who had gone so far into the imbecilic age that they did not know what they were doing, did travel around the Lobby.  I saw my dearly beloved friend, Deputy P. D. Lehane, walk around there.  I am certain that Deputy P.D. Lehane had extracted a very firm guarantee from Deputy Costello that Deputy James Dillon would not again be in charge of agriculture in this country.  I am almost certain he got that guarantee.  I do not know what promises were made. At that time Ministries were going night and day; they were there for the taking.</P>

      <P>I am not anxious to impart knowledge to Deputies.  As I was saying, there was a flock of calves being reared by cows instead of the milk being sent to the creamery.  It would be uneconomic to milk those cows and send the milk to the creamery for the price fixed by the ex-Minister for Agriculture.  Such is the position that exists to-day.  I am glad that the <Col N="585" /> present Minister has taken as his first task the raising of the price of milk to an economic level.  What is the reason for an uneconomic price?  What is the justification for endeavouring to keep in this country a depressed class who are the only producers of wealth here to-day&mdash;the agricultural community?  Why hold them depressed by giving them an uneconomic price for the foundation of their industry, their milch cows and the produce of their milch cows?  However, the farmer is no longer the kind of fool who says: &ldquo;God is good.  We are going to get a better price next year.&rdquo;  Those days are gone.</P>

      <P>What I have in my hand is a question asked by Deputy Palmer last week in this House, on the 20th June, when he was begging the new Minister for loans free of interest for farmers who, because of the severe winter and spring, and the lack of sufficient fodder, suffered heavy losses in their live stock.  I wondered when I heard that question asked whether Deputy Palmer, on behalf of his constituents, appealed to the former generous Minister for Agriculture to send down some of the superfluous fodder so that these animals would not die, but apparently the stock were allowed to die for want of feeding stuff.  I remember the former Minister for Agriculture over here challenging Deputies from Mayo and other counties to quote him a case where one animal was suffering from malnutrition or where there was one animal for which there were not feeding stuffs.  The first job that our Minister has now to face is the provision of butter for our people.  The country is now in the position that we are importers of butter and we have to pay for that butter the equivalent of 1/6 per gallon of milk at the creamery.  It is an alarming position and a wrong position for an agricultural community.  Our principal industry has been brought to such a state in three years that there is not now sufficient butter for our people and we have to import butter.  I need not go further into the butter question than that.</P>

      <P>That was the £140,000 that I extracted from the late Minister during the last quarter of an hour that he was here&mdash;the £140,000 that the Minister had refused to give to the Irish Sugar Company as a subsidy for delivering lime because they were carrying out an additional service in spreading that lime on the farmer's land.  Deputy Dillon tried to dodge it here, but during the last quarter of an hour he sat here&mdash;I remember telling him that night that it was the last round and the last night he would sit here as Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I succeeded in compelling the Minister to make restitution to these unfortunate farmers of 10/- a ton on every ton of lime spread on their land this year.  I am proud of that.  I am sure some of the farmers got their cheques before polling day and that they remembered me in their prayers when they went to the polling booth.

Before passing on to other matters, I should like to mention that the costings of milk production prepared some time ago are over in the Minister's office.  I am sure that Deputy Dillon remembers that.  I was kind enough to present him with a copy of Professor Murphy's costings. It would not take any great ingenuity on the part of the Minister's officials to bring these costings up to date. When these costings are brought up to date the Minister will know exactly what the position is with regard to milk production.  He will know exactly what increase there has been made in the cost of production of milk since March, 1947, up to date.  It should be very easy to bring the costings up to date.</P>

      <P>I consider that the first thing to be done in relation to agriculture is to fix the wage of an agricultural labourer so high that we are not going to be left with the dregs and the remnants of labour.  All a farmer can depend on to-day as regards labour is what nobody else will take.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the general position of agriculture in this country.  The wages paid to agricultural labourers should be as high at least as those paid for labour in other walks of life in this country.  It happens that, at the present time, a sanatorium is being built in my constituency. I saw over 40 agricultural labourers from my parish leave their work on Saturday night and on Monday morning they were working on the foundations of that sanatorium for double the wages they had been getting for agricultural work.  Why is it that our principal industry must always be in a depressed state?  I suggest that the Minister fix a decent wage for the agricultural labourer, a wage as high at least as that which is paid to builders' labourers in this country to-day.  Fix that first, and then come along and grade the price of agricultural produce to meet that position. You will then have some basis for demanding increased production from the agricultural community, and you will never have it until that is done. A farm labourer cannot take a pride in his work to-day when he gets a salary of only £3 odd a week while, if he goes outside the ditch and digs the foundations of a labourer's cottage, he will get from £5 10s. to £5 12s.</P>

      <P>Fix a decent wage for the agricultural labourer.  Come right along then and increase the price of farm produce to meet that wage increase. We find that when an increase is given to a section of the community who may make a particular article, that increase is reflected the following week in an increase in the price of the article they produce.  If I want to buy that article I must pay the increased price for it.  However, when it comes to farmers' produce, or the gallon of milk, we see the Labour Deputies walking into the Lobbies of this House and supporting the depression of their own class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have some of the world's finest economists on costings in our universities in this country.  The Minister for Agriculture and myself are aware <Col N="591" /> of the pains and the labour taken by Professor Murphy of University College, Cork, in getting the costings on beet from over 1,000 farmers.  He got that information and now we know exactly where we stand as regards beet. When the wages go up, one simple little table is consulted and we have the increased price.  Just one small example is social security&mdash;2/5.  All that is worked out.  The Minister's Department should have no difficulty in getting the costings in regard to practically every branch of agriculture. These costings should then be given to the farmer, plus a fair profit.  He is entitled to consideration just as much as the industrialist is.  When you have done that, you can say that there is a definite obligation on every owner of land in this country to produce food for the people of the country.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk in this House on the subject of compulsory tillage.  Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932 and from that date until the outbreak of the Emergency there was no compulsory tillage in this country. Fianna Fáil brought in compulsory tillage only when it became essential that the land of this country should produce enough food for the people of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture believes in it.  He believes that it is the duty of the owners of land to produce food for the people.  It is the duty of the Government to see that the owners of land are paid a fair price for the food they produce.  They are not going to be the depressed class for the rest of the community.  So far as compulsory tillage is concerned, I have always ploughed more than my <Col N="592" /> quota.  Compulsory tillage never worried me, nor did it ever worry my constituents.  That, to my mind, should be the basis of our agricultural policy in this country.  We have here in this newspaper which I read the result of trying the other game.  If the House wants other instances of it I can give them.  In fact, I have given them repeatedly.</P>
      <P>In 1948, we went to the general manager of the Irish Sugar Company, General Costello, to seek an increase in the price of beet in respect of the 1949 crop.  The general manager of the Sugar Company was willing and consented to give an increase of 4/6 a ton. The matter was referred to the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture.  They refused to give the increase.  As a result, there was an immediate reduction in 1949 of 6,600 acres of beet.  In March, 1950, we had to go abroad; we had to tramp the high ways and the byways, and we had to tramp the world looking for something sweet.  Finally, we landed in a place called Formosa where we found sugar.  We purchased the sugar&mdash;nasty brown stuff&mdash;and brought it home.  I am sure Deputy Dillon did not like it at all.  It was great when tea was scarce.</P>

The sugar was purchased and brought into this country at a cost of £12 a ton more than was paid for the best white sugar leaving the Mallow factory.  The Government, who were responsible for that condition of affairs, are the gentlemen who refused to pay the unfortunate farmer the extra 4/6 per ton for his beet to bring it up to the cost of production.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In view of the fact that the Resolutions upon which this Bill is mainly based have so recently been before the House, I hope the House will permit me to confine my remarks on this Stage of the Bill to those provisions of it which are novel and, perhaps, a little complicated.  On this assumption, I may pass over, without comment, Sections 1 to 5 of the Bill, which are straightforward and self-explanatory.  I shall, of course, be glad to deal with any points which Deputies may care to raise on the sections when they are taken seriatim on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 is a section in relation to which a Financial Resolution was not before the House.  It is essentially a relieving section and is linked up with <Col N="595" /> the Government Loans Conversion Act of this year.  It relates to the tax position which will obtain when a Government stock is converted.  As I explained on the Bill in relation to the conversion operation, a cash bonus obtained on conversion is not chargeable to tax so long as it is in the hands of an ordinary investor, but this cash bonus would be brought into account for tax purposes if it were received by a concern, such as a bank, carrying on a trade which consists wholly or partly in dealing in securities; that is, it would be brought into account as if the conversion were a realisation.  I have said that the section is a relieving section and the relief it grants is that, if a concern such as I have mentioned desires, it may secure that the conversion will not be at once treated for tax purposes as a realisation and the cash bonus, therefore, will not feature in the computation of the tax liability of the concern until such time as the new stock is actually realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; there was not.  That section is brought in for the purpose of amending the Spirits Act, 1880, so as to provide for the warehousing on drawback of duty of home-made liqueurs intended for home consumption; secondly, to remove the restriction on the warehousing on drawback of compounded spirits of a strength exceeding 11 degrees over proof; and, thirdly, to provide for the warehousing on drawback in bottle of certain types of compounded spirits which would otherwise be warehoused only in casks.  I <Col N="596" /> am sorry if I thought that that section was not of sufficient importance to dwell on.</P>
      <P>Section 12 corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 5 and is introduced to confirm the established practice under which the exemption to which it relates operates by reference to the person in whose beneficial ownership the security was immediately before death and not by reference to the person owning it beneficially afterwards. Section 13 and the First Schedule provide for the new scale of rates of estate duty to correspond with Financial Resolution No. 4 which was passed last week.  Section 14 incorporates a somewhat complicated set of provisions, but the main alteration effected in the Acts is the raising of the existing exemption level for legacy and succession duties from £1,000 to £2,000.  The only other matters included are some consequential reliefs and certain provisions designed to protect or preserve the rights of taxpayers under the law as it stands.  If by any chance any Deputy wishes for further information about any of these highly technical sub-sections, I trust he will put his difficulty to me during the debate and I shall endeavour to reply to him at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Sections 15 and 16 provide for the avoidance of double taxation on income derived from sea and air transport and are self-explanatory.  Section 17 reduces the rate of stamp duty on conveyances and transfers of houses and land from 5 per cent. to 3 per cent. Section 18 does the same in respect of leases.  Section 19 reduces the stamp duty from 2 per cent. to 1 per cent. on conveyances and transfers of stocks or securities of Irish companies, or of external companies where the shares are transferred on branch registers maintained here by the companies concerned. Sections 17, 18 and 19 will come into force on 1st August or on the passing of the Finance Bill whichever may be the later date.  Section 20 will transfer £300,000 from the Road Fund to the Exchequer.</P>

    <P>Section 21 has a two-fold purpose: first, to adjust, by reference to the actual expenditure on voted capital <Col N="597" /> services in 1950-51, the annuity fixed by Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1950, in respect of the provision for such services made in the Estimates; and secondly, to fix a second annuity in respect of this year's estimated figure of £12,079,705 for capital services.  The adjustment at sub-section (1) involves a corresponding adjustment in the interest element of the annuity which is effected by sub-section (3).  For administrative convenience, power is being taken to pay the annuity into the account during the year whenever and in such amounts as the Minister may determine, and not, as under the 1950 Act, in half-yearly instalments. Section 22, together with the Second Schedule, provides for the repeal of certain provisions in the death duties code for which new provisions are being substituted by Section 14.  The main reasons for these changes is the raising of the exemption level for legacy and succession duty from £1,000 to £2,000.  Section 23 is the customary care and management section and Section 24 is the other customary provision to cover the short title, construction and commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a piece of legislation which we should all welcome. I certainly give it a great welcome at this moment, and all the more so because I have a foreboding that we are not likely to see such as it again so long as the present Minister is in control.  For three years, four Finance Bills altogether, we have been accustomed to having reliefs given in financial legislation&mdash;which is quite out of the ordinary for the type of legislation the present Minister was accustomed to bring in in his day.  In fact, I commend this legislation to the House as something Deputies might take home and keep for a memory of the good days that are temporarily over, in which reliefs have been the customary thing instead of exactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going on to speak of what is in the Bill, I want to speak of the things which might have been announced as having been carried by certain decisions taken by the previous Administration, and which could appropriately have been mentioned <Col N="598" /> here.  The first point is in regard to certain charges made upon solicitors. It is a matter of great concern to them over a number of years, and I in my time received several deputations on the point.  They complain of three charges which weigh upon them, they say, with some oppression.  One is the fee which a young man pays when he becomes apprenticed to the solicitor's profession.  In one go, that amounts to a sum of £80.</P>
    <P>Secondly, when that apprentice, having served his period and passed the usual tests, qualifies for admission to the profession, he has to pay on admission another stamp duty, an amount of £25.  The solicitors requested that these two should either be abolished or be paid into a particular fund under the auspices of the Incorporated Law Society to enable them to get text-books prepared and get their educational system better provided for.  It had been agreed that that would be done.  The only difficulty was as to the particular time at which the remission could be allowed.  There is a solicitors' Bill which has been on the stocks for many years.  The arrangement was that if that legislation was coming to a head in the near future that would, of course, be the appropriate point at which to have this remission granted. If that legislation were not coming to a head in this particular financial year, the agreement was that the matter would have been carried by the finance legislation of this year or by some appropriate motion of early date.</P>
    <P>The third point the solicitors complain of is that they have to pay stamp duties each year, £9 in Dublin and £6 throughout the rest of the country.  They also request that that should be removed.  In England and Northern Ireland it has been virtually removed for some reason I do not just remember, it has not been completely removed, but where it was £9 it is 9/- and where it was £6 it is 6/-.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there has been a matter of long-time standing in the Department of Finance which has been causing much trouble over the years that affects people who, at the <Col N="599" /> moment, are regarded as unestablished civil servants but who are kept on in their class of work for many years to such a point that the phrase &ldquo;temporary civil servants&rdquo; can no longer be appropriately applied to them.  The agitation for many years has been to have the service of such people counted for pension and gratuity purposes as if they were established.  In my time we had taken the decision that what is called the half-service rule should be established, namely, that half the unestablished service should reckon towards pension in the case of people classified in this way.</P>
    <P>Another matter which affects a small number of the Civil Service and to which a great deal of attention has been given is this.  In 1950 there was introduced here a piece of legislation called Finance (Increase) Bill, that enlarged the pensions of certain people by certain percentage additions.  A ceiling was put, however, upon the folk who were affected by this so that nobody who was in a pension of more than £450 could get any increase, or such increase as was given would not be allowed to bring an existing pension higher than the sum of £450.  The ceiling was objected to when the legislation was produced and at a very early stage I made a marking on a file that I disliked the ceiling or at least had great regrets for having introduced it and would remove it at the earliest opportunity, and I had intended to remove it.  It does not affect very many people.</P>

      <P>Why did the Deputy not announce it in the Budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for the Budget.  The whole thing would not cost £6,000 or £7,000 in a whole year.  It would not amount to three times the sum of £6,000.  There is one other thing I would refer to and bring <Col N="600" /> into the context, that is, the phrase used by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in regard to certain post office charges.  He announced one as being an increase in surcharge on telephones from 5 to 25 per cent. and said with regard to it that it was merely to give effect to a decision taken before the change of Government.  I know of no decision of the Government effecting an increase from 5 to 25 per cent. in the surcharge on telephones.  I know that in a minute I found myself dead against such an increase.  If what the Minister meant to say was that there was a general decision that post office charges should be increased so that the deficit in the post office position could be overcome, then he is right in that; but to say that there was a Government decision to increase the surcharge in telephones from 5 to 25 per cent. is, to my mind, a misstatement and I would like to have it corrected at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>With regard to what is in this piece of legislation, while welcoming it with whatever plusses there are as well as minuses, from the point of view of the taxpayer.  I would like to make one or two points.  First of all, those who would accept this legislation must remember they are accepting not merely the increase in the personal allowances for married men in Section 2 and the increase in the deductions in respect of children in Section 3 and the allowances in respect of total incomes of persons aged 65 and over in Section 4, but they are also accepting the increase on petrol and other types of oil by 2d. a gallon.  The present Minister criticised that when I introduced it in the Budget on the 2nd May and said this was a tax going to bear most heavily on supporters of the Labour Party&mdash;he was addressing them &mdash;as an increase not only in bus fares but in the cost of transport of goods produced by farmers and by manufacturers and everything the workers consumed.</P>
      <P>The present Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Aiken, brought in, somewhat irrelevantly, on this particular petrol tax, this phrase:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture <Col N="601" /> thought £1,000,000 was a great thing to give 400,000 farmers...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in regard to an effort of his to increase the price of milk&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...but of course he could afford to give £1,800,000 to a few thousand civil servants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the context in which that phrase was used, the context of this increased 2d. a gallon on petrol, Deputies are now accepting that, and I understand it is going to be accepted unanimously in this House to-night.  The other matter that has been accepted in this piece of legislation is, of course, the remission of estate duties on estates of certain values and the reduction of the tax levied on certain estates of other values and increases on certain higher estates.  With regard to that, the present Minister for Finance thought that people were capitalists if they left an estate of £2,000, and held me as far as he could up to public odium and scorn for having agreed to exempt the estates of such capitalists. He held that the people in Crumlin and Kimmage would have to pay increased moneys in bus fares, the cost of transport and taxes imposed on them for the commodities they would consume.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has slipped over so easily that he made a mistake in the form of a section which should be obnoxious not only to himself but to those who support him, Section 20. Section 20 is a section which gives effect to the thought of transferring from the Road Fund £300,000 to the Exchequer.  That was vigorously contested on every piece of financial legislation in the last three years and Deputies of Fianna Fáil were hoarse with complaint about this raid upon the Road Fund.  They complained that the local authorities should get the extra moneys which were being got in by reason of the duty on petrol and the increase in the tax itself.  They said that the local authorities were being deprived of what was legitimately theirs because of this raid of £300,000 from the Road Fund. It is remarkable to see how easily the change over can be made.  Deputies who used to get hysterical with <Col N="602" /> annoyance over this £300,000 now accept it with equanimity as a proper raid and something which should be taken from the Road Fund to the ease of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This legislation, however, is remarkable more for what is not in it than for what is.  The last time we met the Minister for Finance gave us the present Government's agreement to the arbitration award made with regard to civil servants.  He pointed out that the decision had been taken by the previous Administration and they were accepting the award in full even to the date from which it ran, the 15th of January.  These increased charges now running have been accepted as running from the 15th January of this year and there was a Government decision that equivalent increases should be given to the Army and to the Guards. That decision had a footnote that a particular decision was not required with regard to teachers because teachers of all grades had arbitration machinery of their own; that arbitration machinery had been set in motion and one of these days would produce an award with regard to these people. I think, however, that the Minister gave us a sum of almost £2,500,000 as being the sum that would fall for payment in this financial year.  It will, of course, be increased somewhat, as the award goes back two and a half months before the begining of this financial year.  Without counting the teachers, 2.4 or 2.5 million pounds is the sum that will have to be found and which should be found by taxation if the charges falling for payment this year are to be met from revenue derived in the year itself.</P>
    <P>In addition, there will be further increases promised by the present Administration. During the last election they made the point that the nation was not being properly looked to, that the defences of the nation were not being accepted in the way they should be.  The present Taoiseach said that the civil Defence Forces would have to be enlarged so as to enable them to cope with whatever emergency there might be and the Taoiseach, in his first Press conference, said that the present Government proposed to do the things that the previous Government had not <Col N="603" /> been doing.  To bring that down to a concrete figure it was suggested that the Army should be recruited up to 12,000 men, an addition of about 5,000 to the present Army strength.  Five thousand additional personnel in the Army strength would certainly run the country into an extra bill of something over £1,000,000, leaving out the increase in pay which the last Civil Service award drags with it as a natural consequence.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the Guards.  For the three years during which I was in the Government I used to hear that we were reducing the strength of the Guards far below what was proper in order to safeguard the community.  It was pointed out to me that criminality was still at a high point and that it was very unfair to the people of the community to deprive them of the services of the Guards which the high statistics with regard to crime seemed to make necessary.  I assume that that is another thing that will be taken in hand right away and that Guards will be recruited to the proper strength required to deal with crime.  If in addition certain Guards are segregated to give police protection to some people who voted for the Government, who because they voted for the Government need police protection, and others are required to give supervision to certain people huddled around the Government extra charges will be required for both that protection and that supervision.</P>
    <P>Teachers are an unknown quantity but they should know exactly where they stand with the present Minister, because very frequently during the past three years he bewailed the fact that what was called the Roe Report had not been fully carried out.  Undoubtedly they look to him to give full effect to that award as well perhaps as some increase in it necessitated by the increase in the cost of living which the present Minister for Finance many times asserted had taken place.  Anyway 2.4 million is enough to go on with regarding these people but by the time the present Minister has made even a shambling effort to fulfil his promises the present 2.4 million should have swollen to 3,500,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> We are presented with what is called the Social Security Bill, a piece of legislation to give effect to what the recent Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, promised with regard to old age pensioners. The amount of money concerned is about £1,250,000 in the year, and if it is to be brought into effect with any great speed some part of that sum must be found and distributed in this present year.  It is one of these indicators of what may happen to a Party when they are three years in Opposition that the present Government find it possible to bring in this piece of legislation at the present time seeing that in October, 1947, when they introduced legislation imposing new taxes to bring in £11,000,000 in a full year they said that they could not find £500,000 to effect some modification in the means test and give some increases to old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, of course there are two or three rather important matters.  During the election a great deal of play was made with what was called the Government system of black marketing or grey marketing in certain commodities.  I have a quotation from one of the speeches, where it was alleged against me that off-ration unsubsidised tea, sugar and butter together with white bread and flour, were being sold at luxury prices in such a way that an advantage was given to well-off citizens over poorer citizens.  It was said, of course, that that would be done away with almost immediately, and we no longer would have any of these dual prices, that either the ration would be increased at the fully subsidised rate, or in some way or another whatever quantities we have of bread, flour, tea and sugar would be distributed to the common people at the subsidised rate.  A fairly considerable sum in millions will be involved in that.  Yet it is hard to believe that, coming fresh from election platforms, the present Government would not press forward with the greatest speed on a matter like that, which requires only a little adjustment, and see that either a new ration will be given or a new subsidy will be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> The greatest complaint made during the election, however, was with regard to the system of financing adopted by the last Government in the last couple of years.  The Book of Estimates for the present year has on the cover the sum of £83,000,000 odd, but that is divided as to £70.9 millions for other services and £12,000,000 for capital services.  I have been told that this £12,000,000 was a misnomer and that these services, if provided at all, should be provided out of the proceeds of taxation.  This was alleged to be increasing the national debt at an extraordinary pace and to be of an extraordinary and bankrupting type. I assume that the present Government will be most alert and speedy about bringing that state of affairs to an end.  What they propose to do I am anxious to hear.  Whether it is proposed to drop what are called the capital services costing £12,000,000 or to tax the unfortunate taxpayers to get the £12,000,000 in order to avoid borrowing for that purpose I do not know.  As between these things, there is a fairly considerable number of millions that will have to be found before this time next year and, instead of asking Deputies to allow all stages of this legislation to go through to-night, we should at least have such a delay as will enable the Minister to collect his forces and let us know what he proposes to do with regard to these bills which he is marking up for himself in the near future.</P>
    <P>I will leave over for the moment, because it has not approached the region of a concrete proposal, the whole question of social security.  In my time we had introduced legislation called a Social Welfare Insurance Bill. I understand that the best indication we have as to the future legislation is that the word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; is to be dropped and that the Social Welfare Bill, whatever it may be or whatever money it will involve, is to be, if promises count for anything, along these lines: that there will be no increase in the cost of contributions either from the employer or the employee; that whatever has to be found for the new benefits will be taken from the taxpayer; and, in <Col N="606" /> addition, of course the taxpayer will have to find the full cost of administration. Deputy Norton stated that the present Minister for Social Welfare, when making a calculation while in opposition, made a slight error of between £3,500,000 and £4,000,000.  Listening to the Minister the other night, I understood that he rather accepted that he had made a considerable mistake, one of some millions, if not exactly £3,500,000 or £4,000,000.  What he proposes to do about finding the money is a point which I await some explanation of with a considerable amount of interest.</P>
    <P>The present Government will find themselves in a somewhat different position from that in which they were before.  It was easy before to stop people getting increases in emoluments. There was always the remedy of the standstill Order and, as we know from what is supposed to be a wastepaper basket find, there was a piece of legislation projected in the autumn of 1947 to have a new wages freeze.  The trade unions were consulted, but the general election of 1948 came on and the matter was left in abeyance until after the election.  The mood that wanted wage freezes is still there. Similarly, I think the mood that wanted compulsory tillage is still there. You do not get rid of the old Adam by sending some weakling who is appointed Minister for the time being down to a county committee of agriculture to say that, no matter what he said in this House this year, compulsory tillage was now off.  Neither will you get rid of the old Adam by announcing that wage control was abandoned.  The mood that projected these things is still there.  I have no doubt that if finances get tight these will be matters to which there will be resort.  We have still as a member of the Government as Minister for Justice the Deputy who said, when complaining about the cost of increases to the Civil Service, the Army, the Guards and the teachers, that that was a situation which Fianna Fáil was determined to prevent and would have prevented if only they got a majority. They have the majority now.  The question is, are they still determined <Col N="607" /> to prevent these things?  Will they prevent them by the mere passage of the legislation which no doubt they can carry with their followers and their camp followers in the present grouping?</P>
    <P>One matter that makes me insist upon a clarification of some of these things is that we were criticised for our expenditure, as it was called.  We had reduced taxation, but still we were getting a greater return from revenue because of the policy we had adopted. Particularly, we were criticised because of what was called the enlargement of the national debt.  It was said that a very high point had been reached in a very short space of time.  It has to be remembered with regard to that that the last Government floated three national loans.  They floated each after they had presented them to the country with a clear-cut financial statement and a piece of financial legislation which, if carried out, would give effect to whatever was contained in the financial statement, and each time they got their return.</P>
    <P>The present Government will need money soon.  Are they going to be as frank with the public as we were?  Will they say what is the bill that has to be met?  What is going to be the cost eventually of the increase in pay to all types of public servants?  What is the cost of either the new rations or the new subsidies or the increased rationing? What are they going to take off capital services and meet out of taxation and what will that amount to in the way of taxation?  What are they going to do under the various headings I have mentioned, small and large? It is said that they will have to take £300,000 from the Road Fund, because that is part of the arrangement for this year.  If, next year, they do not take £300,000 from the Road Fund, that is £300,000 that will have to be met.  If they intend to carry out the promises lavishly made during the election and give an increase to milk producers, will they tell us where the money is to come from?  Is it going to be met by allowing the price of butter to rise, with the consequent increase in the cost of living, or will it be found <Col N="608" /> out of subsidies which will have to be met by a contribution from the taxpayers?</P>

      <P>Will they let us know these things, set them out in a Bill, let us know the total and, with that total, will they go to the people in the way that we did and ask them to subscribe to the loan?  I have the greatest forebodings for the future which are not lessened by the personality of the man who sits opposite to me now.  He first came into significance in this country as Minister for Finance in the year 1932.  I suppose the greatest swing upward in the way of taxation occurred in that year.  Income-tax was raised by 1/6, as one item, and all sorts of items were raised.  I do not know whether history will repeat itself and that we are faced with similar savage increases such as the country was hit with in 1932.</P>
      <P>I am also affected by this, that in 1933 the present Minister went before the people of this community looking for the first subscriptions to a national loan under his auspices.  He achieved an all low record in the way of subscriptions at that time, getting less than 40 per cent. of what was a small sum for national borrowings in those days&mdash;£6,000,000.  He got something less than 40 per cent. from the community. That is why I say I am filled with great forebodings when I think (a) of the debt his extravagance has already piled on him, and (b) of his previous record in the matter of taxation and of finding money for what he would call proper borrowings.  I think the outlook is black and that is why I ask Deputies who see this Finance Bill to take it home and frame it because so long as the present Minister lasts they will never see its like again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has covered the field proper to an exMinister for Finance.  I want to raise a specific matter on the Finance Bill which nobody appears to desire to touch and which I consider is of very serious moment to this country.  It <Col N="609" /> relates to the annual provision made in the Finance Act, the Appropriation Bill, for the remuneration of Ministers of State.  I do not want to refer to the remuneration of any particular Minister but to the general scales laid down in the Ministers and Secretaries Act for which this Bill makes annual provision.</P>
      <P>When a man is in office it is apparently generally thought inexpedient that he should suggest that his own salary is too low.  When a man is in opposition it is thought unfortunate, from the point of view of Party interest, to advocate an increase in the remuneration of a public servant.  I am in the happy position of being an Independent, so I commit nobody. I do not think the public are aware of the fantastic situation that at present obtains in this country. Last Wednesday the Deputies who at present constitute the Ministry were in receipt of parliamentary allowances of £600 a year by virtue of the fact that they were Deputies. The allowances are free of income-tax. As a result of the decision of the House, they became Ministers of State. On becoming Ministers they, as all Ministers are, were required to abandon every other occupation of profit or emolument which they enjoyed in their professional or business lives and to abandon the ministerial pensions of £500 a year to which they were entitled by virtue of their previous service as Ministers, and to enter into office.  Whereupon there was added to the £600 a year of Deputy's allowance £1,525.  There are relatively few responsible civil servants in the Department of any one of them who have not got more by way of salary than the Ministers and every civil servant, properly, is entitled to retire at the end of his period of service with a reasonably liberal pension scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Minister of this State is liable under the law and the Constitution to dismissal without notice and, so far as I know, he is the only employed person in Ireland who can be dismissed without getting at least a week's pay in lieu of notice.  I am well aware that a great many Deputies will say how indelicate it is for someone who finds himself in <Col N="610" /> the position of having been dismissed from office a fortnight ago to refer to any such thing.  I do not give a damn. There is nothing in the gift of my people that I want and nothing that I value that they are in a position to take from me.  But, whether it makes any difference to the individual or not, it appears to me to be a gross offence against justice and commonsense that the Ministers of the Irish Government should be required to surrender all their private income derived from their professions or their business to accept £1,552 per annum for what must be the heaviest work that any man could undertake in the sphere of administration with the prospect before them that their period of employment may be terminated without notice and that if they have been five years or more in office they are entitled to a pension of £500 a year.</P>
    <P>There is this additional feature in it, which applies to members of every Government which has held office since this State was founded, that men have built up a business or professional income for themselves, have then been called upon to accept office in the Government, have wrecked their professional or business interest by protracted sojourn in office, and are then required to go back and try to gather up the threads of their occupation and reconstruct their careers and, as in the case of the present Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Government, having barely re-established themselves in various business walks of life, are called upon to throw the whole thing away again, and it may be for six months or it may be for five years.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly natural that our people, as a result of our history, should have grown accustomed to demanding from the political leaders in this country a degree of sacrifice which was traditionally made in the public life of Ireland over the last 150 years. People expected of a man like Thomas Sexton that he should live in a room in a house on the Vauxhall Bridge Road in London because he was working for Ireland, and he cheerfully went and did it because he could not afford to live anywhere else.  People expected men like William O'Brien to live in London in what would appear to the modern <Col N="611" /> generation to be sordid poverty, because they were fighting for Ireland, and they did it.  It may have been reasonable&mdash;I do not think it was&mdash;to suggest that in the early stages of the founding of this State people who were called to ministerial office should continue in that atmosphere of self-sacrifice and accept remuneration for their service out of all proportion to its value.  I think that has gone on long enough.  This is now a sovereign independent Republic, resting on its own oars, and it has no right to demand of any person enrolled in the public service sacrifice on the scale which our people felt themselves entitled to ask of the leaders of our country during the period when the fight for this nation's existence and freedom was being carried on.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, want to make a concrete suggestion.  I would remind the House that I made this suggestion when the Ministers and Secretaries Bill was before this House.  I moved a reasoned amendment to that Bill but could not get a single Deputy to second it, although, I believe, more than 90 per cent. of them agreed with it, to this effect that the salary of the Taoiseach should hereafter be determined by whatever salary is payable to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as charged upon the Central Fund, that the salary of every Minister of State should be a sum corresponding to that which was payable for the time being to a judge of the Supreme Court as charged from time to time on the Central Fund, and that the salaries of Parliamentary Secretaries should be analogous to those of Circuit Court judges.  I deliberately seek to suggest to the House that ministerial salaries should be related to those of the Judiciary because, politics being politics, it is possible to get a deliberative Assembly in this country to consider the appropriate remuneration for judges, but it is impossible to get any deliberative Assembly in this country calmly to determine what is the appropriate remuneration for a Minister. But, if you link the remuneration of the Taoiseach to that of the Chief Justice and of Ministers to that of <Col N="612" /> Supreme Court judges, it is a fairly reasonable arrangement, and it enables the House, if any adjustment thereafter be necessary, to effect it in the atmosphere of a relatively detached discussion on the appropriate remuneration for judges of the Supreme Court and High Court.</P>
    <P>This is a matter, in dealing with which, any Deputy leaves himself open to derisive attacks.  Let me say with respect that I do not give a damn. Every Deputy in this House knows that what I am saying is true.  It may gratify some ignorant bosthoons in the country to protest loudly that this is a most extravagant and absurd proposal.</P>

      <P>I believed myself to be <Col N="613" /> in order in embarking on this topic, and, perhaps, having got so far, I may be allowed to finish what I have to say. I know it is a subject on which there could be a great deal of emotional talk. I am raising it because I consider it constitutes a real danger to the State if men are raising families and cannot afford to become Ministers in this State on the present basis of remuneration.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that Ministers, or ex-Ministers, have shown any evidence of culpable extravagance in their mode of life.  I know that some of us, and I speak for both sides of the House, who have accepted ministerial responsibility have gone into debt in doing so.  That cannot go on, and the only result of trying to continue that system is that we will exclude from the public service men who might be willing to undertake it and who simply will not be able to afford to do so.  Because of that, we will multiply the probability of the State having to depend for Cabinet material on a lower and lower common denominator of mediocrity. The fantastic thing about it is that the necessary adaptation of ministerial salaries could not cost £25,000 a year. I venture to prophesy that there will be more difficulty, more excogitation and more reluctance to undertake what is the right thing to do in regard to this matter than there would be in appropriating £1,000,000 to pour down a bog hole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary further to elaborate the case I am submitting to the House.  I believe that everyone qualified with experience in this country knows the force of what I am saying.  I want to make it specifically clear that I am speaking on behalf of no other Party and of no other Deputy than myself.  Nobody else has responsibility for the representations which I am now making.  I am saying what I believe to be true, and I do not profess to represent to the House anybody else's belief or knowledge in this matter.  I do urge on the present Minister for Finance&mdash;I am in a position to do it with greater emphasis than his own colleagues and with greater emphasis than if I were addressing Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance&mdash;that he should be <Col N="614" /> ready to face this problem and deal with it in the knowledge that it could make very little difference to the taxpayer, but that it may make a very fundamental difference to the public life of this country and to the services which our people are likely to get for the next two or three generations.</P>

      <P>There is a lot to be said for what Deputy Dillon has just said. I was wondering during the last hour, as I was going over Deputy Dillon's sins, whether I can always understand a discontented man.  It would be better for one not to have a man at all than to have a man who considered that he was underpaid.  That apparently was what was wrong with Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture. He considered that he was underpaid. Therefore, he did not bother very much.  A man who feels that he is not getting enough just scotches his work. That, to my mind, was the reason why we had the condition of affairs which I was dealing with on the Estimate. But, that is no reason why the unfortunate farmers of this country should have been put in Purgatory during the last three years just because Deputy Dillon thought that he was not getting enough.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned that this whole matter should be gone over, and I am wondering whether a mistake was made in legislation already introduced and passed through this House.  One sees a condition of affairs here in which Deputies who became Ministers for two or three years can now walk off with a pension for life while others who have practically spent 20 or 30 years here as Deputies get nothing. Ex-Ministers can draw a pension for life and their salaries as Deputies as well.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill which is before the House this evening contains certain provisions relating to the nature and burden of taxation for the coming year.  I understand, too, that it provides Deputies with an opportunity of discussing the broader aspects of financial policy.  In view of the heavy financial commitments upon which the State is entering this year, commitments which will very likely increase as time goes on, this debate on the Second Reading of this Bill should be the most important debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the Governments of this country have been taking on duties which would not have been considered a quarter of a century ago to come properly within the sphere of purely State activity.  I think it has become recognised now that it has become the duty of Governments to ensure that many of the economic ills <Col N="616" /> from which a country suffers are, so far as lies within the ability and competence of Government, mitigated and remedied.  These new duties and these new responsibilities impose upon Governments annually greater financial commitments than would have been thought necessary or advisable even ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The economic ills from which this country is suffering are known to every Deputy.  It is recognised by all that our particular economic problems are chiefly unemployment, emigration, the unchristian level of poverty which obtains in the country, bad housing, lack of hospitalisation, coupled with the fact that our national resources have never been either properly or adequately developed.  The last Government courageously endeavoured to face these problems, and to my mind it made a great deal of progress.  By means of a financial policy, which was termed a capital investment programme and which was something completely new and revolutionary in the ordering of the finances of our State, the Government of the day tried to ensure that by their efforts in investing borrowed money in works of a capital nature, employment would be provided for our people and emigration would thereby be arrested.  Secondly, it was hoped to ensure that productivity, particularly the productivity of our land by means of land reclamation, would be increased; and, thirdly, it was hoped that capital goods of a social character, namely, housing and hospitalisation, would be provided for our people.  These were the aims and ends which it was hoped would be achieved by means of the capital investment programme which was introduced for the first time last year on a major scale.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in 1939 a sum of £1.5 million was spent on works of a capital nature.  Neither out of taxation nor out of borrowing did the Government of that day think fit to spend more than that paltry sum on works of a social nature, such as housing and hospitalisation, or on works of a productive nature, such as land reclamation, by the investment of capital in the actual soil of our <Col N="617" /> country.  In 1946-47 £2,000,000 was spent on works of a capital nature.  In 1947-48 £5,000,000 was spent.  In 1948-49 £9,000,000 was spent.  In 1949-50 £16,000,000 was spent, and last year a sum of £24.61 million was spent in capital investment.  In view of certain statements made by speakers of the Fianna Fáil Party, it is interesting to examine into the manner in which that sum of £24.61 millions was made up. The largest item in that sum was a sum of £11.06 millions spent on housing. Over £3,000,000 was spent on agricultural development, and over £4,000,000 on electricity development.</P>
    <P>In the present financial year Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, stated in his Budget statement that he proposed to spend £29.43 million on capital investment in the coming year. Again, it is of interest to see the principal items on which that money would be spent&mdash;£11.73 million on housing, over £5,000,000 on agricultural development, £4.75 million on electricity development, over £1,000,000 on turf development and £2,000,000 on the telephone system.  Deputies are entitled to know and, I think, the country is entitled to know what the intentions of the present Government are in relation to the capital investment programme which it was proposed would be carried out by the inter-Party Government had it remained in power in the coming year.</P>
    <P>It must be recalled that last year throughout the City of Dublin a large amount of money was spent by the Fianna Fáil Party in taking up space on the advertisers' hoardings in order to deride the financial programme of the Government by placing the pawnbroker's signs in a prominent position and telling the country, by means of these advertisements and by speeches, that the inter-Party Government were putting the country in pawn.</P>
    <P>We are, as I have said, entitled to know whether it is the Government's intention to continue with the capital investment programme and to continue financing it in the same manner as it has been financed in the past&mdash;by borrowing. If they do not intend to do so, then it is quite clear that we can give lie to those political commentators who <Col N="618" /> have claimed that there is no change between the present Government and the inter-Party Government, that there is no difference in their proposals.  We can see that there is as much difference between the Fianna Fáil Government to-day and the inter-Party Government as there was between the Coolidge and the Roosevelt administrations in America.  Last year's capital investment programme was financed mainly by borrowing, by an issue of 3½ per cent.  Exchequer Bonds, by drawings on new deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and also by drawing £7.5 million from the American Loan Counterpart Fund.  If the Government intends to go ahead with the capital investment programme this year, it is quite apparent that a large sum of money will have to be borrowed.</P>
    <P>I think I can say that if the Minister intends to go ahead with the programme and intends to raise the money by means of a public subscription to a national loan he will get the support, and the active support, of this side of the House.  I would suggest that if he is going to raise such a national loan he should do so on the basis that it is to be raised for the purpose of rehabilitating the resources of this country. He should see that it is properly advertised and he should endeavour to obtain, and I think he would obtain, co-operation from all Parties in the House in seeing that such a financial loan would be subscribed to by the public.  If he intends to broadcast an appeal for funds for such a loan I would suggest that he would ask the principal speakers of the four major Parties to broadcast also; it would thus be plain to the people that such a loan is in the interests of the country, and its success could be assured thereby.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this large-scale investment programme which the last Government proposed to carry out necessarily involves certain risks.  No courageous or bold action by any Government can be said to be riskless.  If the remedies which we think are applicable to the ills which obtain in the country at present are of such a nature as to necessitate the running of risks, these risks are worth taking.  If proper <Col N="619" /> steps are taken the risks can be minimised.</P>
    <P>One of the principal risks which such a programme of capital investment involves is the risk of inflation.  In an endeavour to mitigate this risk, Deputy McGilligan, in his Budget statement, announced that the Government had plans for a large-scale savings campaign, again on a nationwide basis.  He announced that he was happy to bring in the forces of educational establishments and various private institutions in order to help make a success of the savings campaign. Again, I would like to say I think that if the Minister embarked on such a large-scale savings campaign, he could rely on the support of this side of the House.  I would suggest that the line indicated by Deputy McGilligan was the correct one and that to avoid the dangers of inflation which a large-scale investment programme of the nature he proposed necessitates, the Minister should embark on a savings campaign. It should be on an all-Party basis, and I feel sure the Minister would get co-operation from the four major Parties.</P>
    <P>Apart from the danger of inflation, there is also a danger of a deficit in the balance of payments resulting from the large-scale imports which a programme of capital investment involves. If there is such a deficit in the balance of payments, there need not, in present circumstances, be any cause for alarm, provided it can be shown that the excess of imports over exports was due to the fact that the major items on the import list were goods of a capital nature.  The realisation of our sterling assets is a policy which should be pursued at the present time.  In England the official description of present Government policy is that of &ldquo;controlled inflation&rdquo;, a policy which is designed to finance their armaments programme.  In view of this policy being allowed by the British Government, we are facing a situation in which our sterling holdings are depreciating in value.</P>
    <P>Any system by which these sterling holdings, or part of them, can be repatriated <Col N="620" /> and invested in Ireland must be welcomed.  The Government must endeavour to ensure that these sterling holdings are realised and repatriated and not dissipated.  It is the duty of the Government to see that such imports as are brought into the country are, where possible, comprised principally of goods of a capital nature rather than consumer goods.  The fact that last year such a large amount of money was spent on imports of consumer goods is an indication of the rise in the standard of living of our people.  We cannot avoid, if the capital investment programme is to be a success, a large proportion of our imports being in the form of consumer goods but the Government must try to ensure, where possible, that imports are mainly of goods of a capital nature so that the sterling holdings which we have, and which are necessary to maintain our standard of living, are not dissipated or wasted on imports of mere consumer goods.  It is clear, however, that the only effective manner in which the deficit in the balance of payments can be remedied is by increased exports. We are fast reaching the position in which Great Britain found herself after the war and in which she still is, namely, that our standard of living depends on our exports.  The Government will have to ensure that our export drive is quickened in order that we may be in a position to pay our way and in order that we may be able to maintain the standard of living which a large-scale capital investment programme can bring about.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it is clear that the key industry is agriculture.  Recently Deputy Dillon has stated that a doubling of our agricultural production will mean increasing our agricultural exports by over 400 per cent.  It is in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture more than in those of any other one Minister, to see that these exports, which we shall require in order that our standard of living may be maintained, can be increased.  The risks of inflation and of a deficit in our balance of payments are, I think, risks worth taking.  They are risks which I think can be minimised if proper financial policies are followed by the Government. <Col N="621" /> If the Government sees that the money spent on goods of a capital nature is invested in such works as will yield the most revenue, if it sees that the money which is spent on capital goods of a social nature, is spent on those capital goods which are of primary social importance, such as housing and hospitals, and if it institutes a proper savings campaign which will be effective in mopping up any loose money in the State, if it succeeds in the export drive, I think any dangers which may exist in a capital investment programme will be minimised so that these risks should not deter the Minister in his decision to continue that programme.</P>
    <P>The Government should remember the dictum of the late Lord Keynes that what is physically possible is financially possible.  I think this should be the dictum which any Minister for Finance should keep in mind in deciding the manner in which the finances of the State should be ordered.  The Government has the duty of securing full employment for our people.  It has the duty to see that emigration is stopped. It has the responsibility to see that proper housing accommodation is provided for our people and proper hospital accommodation provided for our sick.  It has also the duty to see that, where private initiative has failed, the national resources of the State are fully developed.  If it carries out that duty by means of sane financial policies, these economic ills can be greatly eased.  The Government must realise that, if we are saved from world booms and slumps and if we can enjoy a period of peace, there is no reason why these economic ills should not be remedied within a period of years.  As we have our destinies in our own hands, if we fail to remedy these ills we shall have nobody to blame but ourselves.</P>

      <P>As one who had the honour to be a member of this House for some years before the last speaker was born, I should like to offer my congratulations to him on the best maiden speech that I have heard delivered in this House in my 29 years' membership of it.  The speech delivered by the youngest member of the House <Col N="622" /> was a model of relevancy that might be copied, or at least attempted to be copied, by many of us on both sides of the House, a speech which was clear, courageous and constructive.  I think that none of us need have any fear for the future of this national Assembly whilst the people of this country car send in here men of the calibre and the standard of Deputy Declan Costello.  The highest tribute that I can pay him is that he is a worthy son of his distinguished father.  It was a broad speech, a speech delivered not in a Party spirit, but in the national spirit, a speech freely offering, and, if I might be allowed to say so, properly offering, to the Minister for Finance of the day the assistance of all sides of the House in making a success of any national loan which it may be necessary to float to carry on the necessary capital and other works of this country. That speech was perhaps particularly welcome to some of us, coming as it did immediately after a speech delivered by the greatest humbug that ever annoyed this House&mdash;Deputy Corry.  I do not know whether Deputy Corry sprung to his feet urged on with the same sentiments that are usually responsible for his outbursts or whether he was prompted by the Minister for Finance to get up and take the line he did.  I should be sorry, indeed, to think that any prompting came to him from the Minister for Finance on that line.  Deputy Corry, of course, is the sewer pipe of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>With respect, I am dealing with a speech made by Deputy Corry.  I can assure you that nothing is so distasteful than having to deal with Deputy Corry.  Deputy Corry was concerned with ministerial pensions. Deputy Corry belongs to the Party which introduced the Bill providing pensions for Ministers and Deputy Corry voted for that Bill and has always supported it.  Indeed, it is particularly well known that Deputy Corry hoped, up to last week, that he himself was going to get an opportunity of qualifying for a ministerial pension. That is really what is wrong with him. After all his long years of service, to which he referred a moment ago in his speech&mdash;after all his faithful service in being ready always to get up and say the things which the members of the Front Bench did not want to say&mdash;he was not offered even a Parliamentary Secretaryship.</P>

      <P>I suppose that I should have more sense than to waste time in mentioning Deputy Corry's name.  It was the contrast between the two speeches that was responsible for my taking that line and also the fact that I know that Deputy Corry is used to making statements which other members of the Fianna Fáil Party are not prepared to make in this House.  I <Col N="624" /> know that balls are made and handed to Deputy Corry to be fired.</P>
      <P>I do not envy the Minister for Finance the task which is before him. He has a difficult job.  He is facing into heavy weather and he will require all the assistance that will be forthcoming, not merely from the people who sit on the benches behind him but also from the members of the Opposition, if he is to weather the storm. Whether that assistance will be forthcoming and will be a help to the extent that we would desire to be helpful will depend very largely, if not entirely, on the particular course the Minister proposes to pursue.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister will have to forget many of the statements he made and which were made by his colleagues, not merely in the past three and a half years but even in the past six weeks.  I know that it would be utterly impossible for the Minister and his colleagues to give effect to many of the things they said they would give effect to if and when they were returned as a Government.  The Minister is getting the country in a good condition. He is getting the country with fewer unemployed than ever we have had before, probably, in our history. More people are now not merely in employment but in well-paid employment than ever before.  The Minister is getting into his hands now a State in which the standard of life is higher than perhaps it has ever been in our history.</P>
      <P>I venture to say that the Minister will find it difficult to maintain the present standard, not to talk of improving on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know also, as the Minister knew during the past three and a half years, that he will be beset by many difficulties over which he will have no control whatsoever and that many of the factors which will enter into the economic and financial problems which he will have to face and deal with will arise from circumstances over which he will have no more control than the man in the moon, probably infinitely less. We desire to be helpful.  We will be critical, and severely critical, if we think that the Minister and his colleagues are pursuing a course which <Col N="625" /> is not, in our opinion, in the national interest.  Where, however, a policy is pursued which is in the national interest then, so far as we are concerned&mdash;and it will be nothing new to us&mdash;the national interest will, if necessary, take precedence over the Party interest.</P>

Quite obviously he has been a most assiduous student of the type of misleading propaganda to which the country has been treated during the three years of the late Coalition Government.  It is amazing how misleading words can be.  When Deputy Declan Costello was talking about the capital investment policy of the Government, it was quite obvious that he seemed to be under the impression that these items which the last Government segregated and classified under the heading &ldquo;capital investment&rdquo; were new and novel.  The only thing new about them was not their magnitude nor their nature but the manner in which they had been financed.  It was the proud boast of the Fianna Fáil Government during the whole period that it was in office from 1932 to 1948 that it paid its way.  Whatever it bought, whatever it built it paid for it.</P>

      <P>And they did not leave the burden to be shouldered and to be discharged by its successors. When we left office in 1948 and the Coalition took our place, they found there planned or, in fact, begun every single capital development that they pursued over their three years, even if they adopted some of them and brought them to fruition.  They also found many other proposals, highly practicable, highly productive which they scrapped and sabotaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They found ready, for instance, for initiation the proposed transatlantic air service upon which the Government had spent £1,500,000.  This development, <Col N="626" /> if it had been allowed to continue, would have become in the year 1950 one of the greatest sources of dollar income for us, and by that, it would have helped us very considerably to narrow the grave and serious gap which to-day exists in our balance of payments.  Not only would it have provided us with much needed dollars but it would have given considerable employment to our people.  It would have made the maintenance of Shannon airport and its future existence secure but it would have been a means of establishing in the County of Clare a first-class maintenance and repair depot for the planes that now fly from America to Europe and the Far East. All that was abandoned.  Those planes were sold and the aviators we had trained were discharged from their jobs and sent to earn their livelihood to the far ends of the earth.  Some of them died elsewhere trying to do for other people what we had trained them to do for us.  When these planes were sold, they were not sold at a loss.  They were sold at a substantial profit which enabled our successors to secure for themselves and their budgetary purposes the moneys that we had provided.</P>
    <P>Take, again, the case of the chassis factory which was to be provided under the auspices of Córas Iompair Éireann. That involved a capital expenditure, I think, of £250,000.  It was going to be the basis and the foundation of a new heavy industry in this country&mdash;in this part of the country I should say&mdash;one of the things which the Twenty-Six Counties of Ireland lacked then and continue to lack to-day.  Machines which Córas Iompair Éireann had bought under our guarantee were there.  They were not even taken out of the packing cases.  Again, they were sold and their proceeds were used, to some extent, I think, because I am not speaking from actual departmental knowledge on this point, either to defray or to reduce the commitments of the company to the Government.</P>
    <P>The bus station in Store Street which would have stood as a monument to the foresight and vision of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce too, was treated as something <Col N="627" /> which a rag and junk man might pick up on the street.  It was designed as a bus station.  It solved, according to those who were specialists in these matters, one of the most difficult functional architectural problems.  Few people had conceived the idea&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with this question of capital development which was raised by Deputy Declan Costello.  I am proceeding to follow that.  As I have said, not merely was every project, which our immediate predecessors carried out planned and initiated by us but, in addition, many projects which we planned were sabotaged by the Coalition Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is there and it is going now to be put to its proper use. It is going to be used for the purpose for which it was planned and for which it is being constructed.  People are wondering of course why it was that the bus station was abandoned.  I heard an explanation given, I think, in Deputy Dillon's own constituency as to why that bus station was abandoned.  I heard a gentleman saying on a platform that one of the reasons was that Deputy Norton, when he became Minister for Social Welfare and Tánaiste, was so swelled in his own self-esteem that the Government had to provide him with a set of offices with a door big enough to take a bus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I know why I topped the poll in Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the ex-Minister topped the poll or not, the fact remains that there are two <Col N="628" /> Deputies from County Monaghan supporting this Party and this Government. Deputy Dillon sits in solitary state, the lone Independent whom no man will touch.  I do not want to be diverted from my theme by these interruptions.  As I was saying, the bus station, which our predecessors attempted to sabotage and destroy, is now going to be converted to the purpose for which it was intended, a bus station.  As Deputy Norton has no longer any need for an over-expanded doorway, I assume that, in due course, instead of Deputy Norton walking in and out of the bus terminal station, we shall see buses carrying people from the country to Dublin and from Dublin to the country, people who are enabled to embark and disembark with the comfort and in the shelter to which they are accustomed when they take a train or embark on a boat. However, these things are more or less by the way.</P>
      <P>I should like, however, to point out that, again in relation to the housing problem, if Deputy Declan Costello will turn to Section 21 of this Bill, he will see a rather curious section entitled &ldquo;Capital Services Repayment Account.&rdquo;  The total amount which was provided in the 1950 Budget for the repayment of certain borrowings which the Government had undertaken was £655,000, an annuity which will have to be paid for 30 years and which during that period will carry interest at 3½ per cent.  The extraordinary thing about this sum of £655,000, which is the sole contribution our predecessors proposed to make in that year in their Budget towards the repayment of all the money which they were borrowing and spending, if my recollection is correct, is that it is less than the sum provided out of taxation by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1939 for the single purpose of subsidising the housing programme in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with my recollection.  In subsequent years, the amount of money we provided for that service amounted in one year, I think, to <Col N="629" /> about £1,100,000.  These were moneys which we provided year after year and which left no burden on posterity. Deputies opposite came in here and spent recklessly.  They borrowed improvidently and have left their successors in office and the people who will come after us to pay.  There is nothing honest, nothing sound, nothing productive in that sort of financial policy.  On the contrary, it is the policy of the rake, which leads, ultimately, to the bankruptcy of the person who pursues it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Declan Costello talks about the deficit in our balance of payments. In this year, that deficit amounts to £30,000,000.  Not one-fifth of that sum has been spent on capital goods or has been spent in a way which would enable the £30,000,000 ultimately to be repaid.  On the contrary, four-fifths of it have been spent entirely on consumers' goods which will give us no return, except to preserve an artificial standard of living which could only be maintained if production in this country were to be considerably increased. However, I do not want on this Bill to expose fully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I prefer to come to Deputy McGilligan's speech.  There was something rather revolting in the masochistic exhibition of the ex-Minister, because his speech was a criticism of his own Budget and an unveiling to nakedness of the hollowness of the financial picture which he presented to this House on May 2nd last.  It was, in fact, a nauseating spectacle.  It reminded one of the fact that, in certain low music halls, the customary stage type of performance is one which is designed to pander to the lowest instincts of the audience. <Col N="630" /> That act, I think, is known as a striptease.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan stripped his own Budget to its naked bones, but that divestment exposed nobody but himself.  This Bill is his child, which the immediate exigencies of our financial procedure compel this Government to submit to the House. The Deputy reminded the House that the increased remuneration which must be provided if the terms of the Civil Service arbitration award are to be honoured, together with the commensurate increases which will, in due course, have to be made in the pay of the Guards and the Army, will involve us in an additional expenditure of about £2,400,000 this year.  He told us that the teachers had made a claim for an increase in their salary scales, and that this claim was under consideration by the conciliation machinery which our predecessors set up.  He told us also that there would be additional expenditure arising out of the social welfare provisions, and he said that he had himself come to certain decisions regarding superannuation of former lower-paid civil servants.  Each and every one of these things was present to the former Minister's mind when he was framing his Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The then Government knew that the civil servants had availed of the arbitration machinery set up.  They knew that the teachers had made claims for increases in their remuneration.  The then Government had taken certain decisions in relation to the Guards and the Army, which we propose to honour.  They knew that they had made no provision for the Social Welfare Bill, which the then Minister had introduced to the House, and they knew they had made no provision to meet, in a full year, even the proposed increases in old age pensions and blind pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every one of these things was not merely present to the mind of the <Col N="631" /> Minister but was before every member of the Government before the Budget of May 2nd was introduced.  These will mean, as Deputy McGilligan himself disclosed to the House, many millions of pounds.  Towards this vast sum&mdash;and it is a vast sum&mdash;what contingent allocation did the then Minister for Finance make in the Budget he introduced on 2nd May last?  Here it is: &ldquo;I have, therefore, decided that I should add at least £1,500,000 to the Estimates of expenditure, not indeed to be on the safe side but as a minimum precaution.&rdquo;  The reference is column 1887, Volume 125.  £1,500,000 is the contingent provision which the then Minister for Finance made in order to meet an expenditure which he told the House this evening will run into many millions.  If there is no proper provision in this Budget for the increase in Civil Service remuneration, for the increase which is undoubtedly coming in teachers' remuneration, for the increase in the scales of pay and allowances of the Guards and the Army, if there is no proper provision in this Budget for social welfare the responsibility for that does not rest on me.  It rests squarely and firmly on the shoulders of Deputy McGilligan, who was Minister for Finance at the time when the Budget which this Finance Bill proposes to give effect to was introduced in this House, with the approval of every member who sits on the Front Bench opposite&mdash;and of Deputy Dillon who sits behind them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this matter a short time ago, I had not had the advantage of hearing the Minister's introductory statement.  I was wondering to what Deputy O'Higgins was alluding when he was bewailing the extra 2d. that the public would have to pay on their butter.  I had since the opportunity of reading the Minister's statement, in which he is guaranteeing an extra 1d. a gallon on milk.  I would suggest to the Minister that it is not enough.  I would like to point out to him that, in his own statement here to-day, in replying to my question, he said that he would have to import 3,000 tons of butter this year to meet the position of affairs he finds.  I would like to point out again the statement made by the Creamery Managers' Association, namely, that the present sterling equivalent of creamery butter prices in the United States, Canada, Belgium and Germany ranges from 449/3 to 550/- per cwt.  I am quoting on this occasion from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 13th June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking even the 450/-, when I heard Deputy O'Higgins complain about the public having to pay 3/- a lb. for Irish butter because the Minister had increased the price of milk by 1d, I respectfully point out that 450/- is 4/- a lb.  That is to be paid to the foreigner for butter owing to the actions of Deputy Dillon, that manoeuvring of Deputy Dillon, the under-paid Minister. This under-paid Minister&mdash;£2,500 was not enough for him&mdash;who was scotching his work because he was not getting enough, has brought this poverty to which the unfortunate farmers have been driven for the past three years, <Col N="633" /> and has brought about the condition of affairs that in order to provide butter for this country we must purchase 3,000 tons on the continent at 4/- a lb.</P>
    <P>That would mean according to present proposals 4/- for butter from the continent and 3/- a lb. for Irish butter.  It would mean an extra tax on the Irish people in the shape of subsidy of £350,000&mdash;a lot to pay for one man's foolishness.  If the foreign butter is to be sold at 3/- an extra subsidy must be found of £350,000.  Now perhaps Deputy Dillon knows what he is costing the nation. If we are to put an end to that condition of affairs, if we are to build up again, if we are to get our farmers back into the production of milk and butter and put an end to the stocks of cows out in the fields each with two calves hanging on to her, for beef, for the bull market, I would suggest to the Minister that he must come a little further in the line of prices.  I would respectfully suggest that he has the costings in his Department; let him get his people to work on those costings, and he should have no difficulty in finding out the increased cost of production per gallon of milk since March, 1947, when those costings were prepared.  Let him find out, and if we had to impose on the taxpayers of this country an extra £350,000, to be paid to the foreigner over and above what we pay our own people, I suggest that it should be paid at home.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for your kindness, Sir, in letting me go over that because I previously dealt with the milk question, but I had not dealt with it from that point of view, because I had not the advantage of hearing the Minister's opening statement on the price of milk.</P>
    <P>Let us now decide whether we are to have sufficient production of milk in this country to enable our people to have not alone the ration but butter off the ration as well.  Let us decide that we will at least provide our own people with sufficient butter without going to the foreigner.  I wonder who paid for the 320 or 340 cwt. of butter which were found to be unusable, the stuff that you would want&mdash;to use Deputy Dillon's own words&mdash;a gas mask if you were to <Col N="634" /> stand over it.  That was the expression he used about the Irish butter which he found in store when he came into office.</P>

He carried on in his own sweet way with the result that in February last we had again to go to the continent and purchase 74,000 tons of foreign sugar at a cost to the Irish people of £1,380,000 more <Col N="635" /> than we are paying for the same quantity of the best white sugar leaving an Irish factory.

Deputy Dillon and Deputy Morrissey knew too much and would not submit to blackmail by calling a conference of the beet growers and the sugar company.  I heard of this expedition to Cuba for the sugar and I went immediately and had an interview with the general manager of the sugar company, with the result that he met the chairmen of the beet growers supplying the four factories on the following Monday and we then increased that price by 12/- a ton.</P>

The activities of the ex-Minister with regard to wheat were not those of a Minister who had any anxiety to see produced in this country anything like sufficient wheat for our own people. No attempt was made during the last three years to increase the price of wheat until the ex-Minister made a kind of belated &ldquo;trick of the loop&rdquo; job of the wheat price for the coming year which, I hope, will now be rectified.</P>

      <P>To come back to the position as regards wheat, I suggest that the Minister, instead of following the bad example set by Deputy Dillon as regards barley, should now consider increasing the price of wheat for this harvest to a reasonable figure remembering that the price of imported wheat at present is somewhere between £50 and £57 a ton and that the price is rapidly going up, not down.  We have school-masters, lawyers, clergymen and everybody else telling us about the flight from the land.  Is it any wonder that we have the flight from the land when the earnings of any person engaged in agriculture are in the neighbourhood of £3 per week?  Is it any wonder that we have the spectacle of our young men clearing off the land day after day seeking employment elsewhere, not wanting to work at home for the remuneration they can get out of the price paid for their produce?  That is a grave and serious condition of affairs to which I am sure the Minister will devote full attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to see the land cleared of its inhabitants and whatever population there is in this country collected into the cities and towns.  We want to see the end of that.  There is only one way to end it, and that is to make the lot of the man on the land at least as advantageous and as comfortable as the lot of the man in the <Col N="638" /> city or town.  Let us try to do that and to do it in the one way we can do it, namely, by being decent to our own people.  If this State can afford to pay one and a half times the price for the essentials for life in the way of food to the foreigner surely we can pay some of it at home.  We have this degrading spectacle of £12 per ton more to the Chinaman than we pay our own people for sugar, of 3/- per lb. for butter to the Irish farmer and 4/- per lb. to the foreigner, of £26 10s. 0d. for &ldquo;mucky&rdquo; barley imported from Mesopotamia and £16 a ton for the barley grown at home; of 62/6 a barrel for wheat here and from £50 to £57 a ton to the foreigner.  Surely I am not asking for too much in this House, as a representative of agriculture, in asking that that condition of affairs be changed, that we start now to uplift the biggest industry in this State.  We have tried the other way.  We have had three years of trying the other way.</P>

      <P>Half the spice is taken out of my argument when my dearly-beloved Deputy is missing.  This is the example that Deputy Tom Walsh, the present Minister, was asked to follow by Deputy O'Higgins a while ago.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>By the ex-Minister, three months after he became Minister for Agriculture, following up a position under which Deputy Paddy Smith, the previous Minister for Agriculture, had secured on the British market a price of 3/- a dozen for our eggs.  The ex-Minister then started off on his campaign and it was a hot campaign.  He wound up with the statement I quoted a few minutes ago to the British public, that he would drown them with eggs.  When anyone is told that there is a surplus on the market, he immediately looks for a cheap price and expects that the price will come down a bit.  In the case of eggs they know that they will go bad if they are kept too long and the buyer says that he will buy them for whatever price he <Col N="640" /> likes.  The price of eggs immediately fell to 2/6, but at the same time the then Minister assured the farmer that he would get 3/- a dozen for the eggs and that he would have to pay only 20/-a cwt. for maize.  The eggs came down to 2/6 and the maize went up to 26/-. Everywhere one went around the country that time one would see in the haggard or in some other suitable place a nice little lamp burning in the middle of the floor and fine chicks cuddling in, nice and warm, and the poor woman of the house would come a couple of times to them in the evening and have a peep at them to see how well they were doing.  Dillon's chickens were doing great.</P>

      <P>Assurances were given but the price of maize had gone up to 26/- and the woman of the house, still fairly well pleased with herself, was wondering how the chickens were progressing. They grew up to be nice little pullets and then they started to lay.  The price of eggs flopped.  The maize still continued to go up in price despite the fact that Deputy Dillon had assured the farmers that the price of maize would not increase in conceivable time.  The price went up and the unfortunate farmers were faced with a condition of affairs in which they could not meet the price of the maize with the price of the poultry. They flopped on that and the Minister did not come to their assistance.  In the end, the maize went to £30 a ton and the price of the eggs fell to 2/-. That was the wind up of the ex-Minister in connection with that activity.  But what about the unfortunate small farmers who had built poultry houses, installed incubators and had incurred fairly heavy expenditure in that direction?  It was all very well for Deputy Dillon to go over to our friends across the water, tell them <Col N="641" /> what fine decent men they were and give them cheap food.</P>

      <P>No, and I do not wish to go back.  I am merely giving the House the results of Deputy Dillon's policy.  In order to do that one must go back a little way.  I would not go back at all were it not for Deputy Flanagan's interruption.  I would not have gone back to the previous price. To-day we have the position&mdash;and I would like the Minister now to remember this&mdash;where the price of malting barley is £28 15s. a ton; that is the price of grain grown for drink.  To-day the price of wheat grown to feed our people is only round about £25 a ton.  I suggest to the Minister that there is there a gap that could be filled with advantage to the growers of wheat to feed our people as against the growers of grain for the purpose of manufacturing drink.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I would like to refer and to which I would like the new Minister to give his attention.  I would like to forget the purgatory and the agony that our unfortunate farmers suffered and I would like to look at the bright side.  I would like to look to the future in which our agriculturists will be paid commensurate with their labour, in which our agriculturists will be able to take some pride in their work, and in which the worker will not be watching perpetually over the top of the ditch praying for the day when another job in anything but farming will come.</P>

In the Book of Estimates at page 129 under item P appears &ldquo;Flour and Wheaten Meal Subsidies&rdquo;&mdash; sum required to subsidise the price of flour <Col N="648" /> and wheaten meal.  I take it that is what the Deputy is referring to.  I do not know whether or not the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken over the rationing side of it.</P>

      <P>No.  At question time to-day, as Deputy Corry has just said, he had questions down on exactly the same subject as he is now discussing. That is his own statement.  These questions were taken over by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who answered them on the ground that responsibility for the particular matter dealt with in the questions had been transferred to him from the Minister for Agriculture since the constitution of the present Government.</P>
