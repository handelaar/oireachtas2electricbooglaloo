      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 2 and 6; then the Estimates&mdash;Votes 29 to 37, 50 to 53, with which it may be agreed to take No. 4, a formal motion in relation to sugar imports, and 39 to 46.  Questions will be taken at 3 o'clock.  It is proposed to adjourn until Tuesday at 3 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know, on the Order of Business, when it is proposed to give time for No. 3, the motion in my name and that of Deputy Fagan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the Deputy yesterday that we proposed to give time for it on Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for time for it to-day on the grounds that it is a matter of some urgency inasmuch as it calls in question the conduct of the Ceann Comhairle.  It is further a motion of urgency in that I am now satisfied that the Taoiseach has caused the Official Report of Dáil Éireann to be amended by the insertion of words in the printed version which were never spoken and which the notetaker never took, designed to pervert the meaning of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Deputy cannot discuss that beyond asking for time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss the Order for the Adjournment, can we not?  The Tánaiste has moved that we adjourn this evening until next Tuesday, as distinguished from the date laid down in Standing Orders, namely, Friday morning, and unless that motion is adopted by the House I understand we are required to meet on <Col N="1458" /> to-morrow morning.  Inasmuch as that motion has been moved, we may debate and divide upon it and I propose to debate that motion.  I am urging the House to reject that motion on the grounds that time has not been provided for a motion which calls in question the denial by the Chair of Deputies' rights to address the House and the action of the Taoiseach in sending for the official report of our proceedings and causing to be inserted therein words which were never spoken in this House, which the notetaker never recorded, and which are therefore inserted in the report for the purpose of prejudicing the discussion of the Taoiseach's scandalous conduct in this House on the 4th July.  The words inserted by the Taoiseach appear in column 832 of the Official Report.  The notetaker's version&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, this is not in order now.  That will arise at a later stage on Deputy Dillon's motion and can be discussed in full.  It does not come up now for discussion.  What comes up now is whether the House should adjourn until Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am urging that the House should not adjourn, because it is a matter of urgency that we should discuss at the earliest possible moment the action of the Leader of the House, the Head of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Deputy to desist from discussing that.  The merits of that may not be discussed on this occasion.  The Deputy can discuss that at a later stage on the motion to which he referred, but not now.  The motion before the House is whether we should adjourn to the date mentioned by the Tánaiste or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter before the House on that motion is the conduct of the Ceann Comhairle. The matter I want to raise now as one of urgency is the conduct of <Col N="1459" /> the Taoiseach, a very different cup of tea.  The Ceann Comhairle is the presiding officer of the House; the Taoiseach is the Head of the Government.  I am alleging that the Taoiseach has secured the introduction into the Official Report of Dáil Éireann of words that were never spoken in Dáil Éireann and I want to tell the House what these words were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No Minister for Justice or any other warrior in the Fianna Fáil Party is going to shout me down. I am going to debate now whether we adjourn or whether we do not adjourn and if the Minister for Justice does not like that he can lump it as far as I am concerned and I am going to discuss it as long as I care to discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy proposes to raise is a matter of privilege.  This is not the way to raise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising any matter of privilege now.  I am desiring <Col N="1460" /> to inform the House that there is a matter which appears to me to be of urgent importance, which calls for debate, which calls for ventilation in this House and which it is the duty of this House to discuss and consider at the earliest possible moment.  There is no reason whatever why this House should refuse to sit to-morrow morning, if it wants to sit to-morrow morning. If time were provided for the discussion of the matters arising out of No. 3 on the Order Paper this evening, the necessity to sit to-morrow morning would not arise.  There is within the scheduled programme laid down for the various Estimates two hours available this evening for the discussion of other business provided we give the remaining hour due to the Department of Justice on Tuesday.  The Government, for their own reasons, and I understand them, because they are naturally reluctant to have this matter discussed, categorically refused to provide two hours this evening and announced that they are going to take Justice for one hour this evening and then we will see what happens to the remaining hour.</P>
      <P>I want to recall the memory of the House to this fact, that in 1930, Deputy Fahy, as he then was, moved a motion in identical terms or virtually identical terms with Motion No. 3 on the Order Paper to-day.  In 1935, Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan moved such a motion and the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, rose in his place on behalf of the Government and said that Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan's failure to debate this motion at the earliest possible moment was in itself evidence that it was not a <i>bona fide</i> motion, that if he had meant what his motion said, Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan would have pressed for a discussion at the earliest possible moment and the fact that he did not showed that it was a spurious motion not seriously intended.  The same Minister to-day is most active and aggressive in claiming that Motion No. 3 on the Order Paper should not be discussed and need not be discussed. Why?  Why is he so actively aggressive? &mdash;because he does not want the Taoiseach's trick discussed in this House.  But it will be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixteen years ago the Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, objected strenuously to Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan not pressing on with a motion of this kind.  I am asking the House to speculate why did Deputy Boland, the Minister for Justice, clamour for prompt discussion 16 years ago and why does he clamour for delay to-day.  There must be a reason for that, and the reason is that he does not want to face the motion.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has now arrived, and arrived in good time.  I am glad that he should have an opportunity of hearing that I am opposing the Adjournment.  I regard the printed record of the proceedings of this House as sacrosanct.  I understand that, while it is the universal custom of every parliamentary assembly to allow a Deputy to make any formal amendments of his observations, no alteration of substance may be made in the Official Report.  I am opposing any delay in an opportunity for discussing a scandalous alteration of that character made by the leader of this House, <Col N="1464" /> the Taoiseach.  I am told by the Tánaiste that the Government will not provide time to-day, and I am told that he has his myrmidons here to vote in support of the Adjournment to deny me the opportunity of discussing my motion to-day.  I deplore this abuse of parliamentary procedure.  I deplore the disgusting reaction of the salaried ranks of Parliamentary Secretaries who are mustered here to clamour for the denial of my rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to advance a whole series of reasons as to why we should not adjourn.  I do not think we should adjourn when there is business to be done.  The Government has succeeded under a guillotine motion which was presented to the House with the approbation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in order to facilitate the Government in getting its business disposed of by the 19th July. I represent the Independent Deputies on that Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and on their behalf I agreed to sponsor that guillotine motion, jointly with the other members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in order to facilitate the Government, on the assumption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would sooner be that than a Woolworth diamond or a bleeding heart.  We had hoped to get from the Government reciprocation of the manifest desire of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to help them in disposing of their work.  I do not think the Government's attitude to-day represents such reciprocation, and I think it is the duty of anyone who is solicitous for the rights of Deputies to resist the Government's cavalier declaration that because Motion No. 3 stands in the names of two Independent Deputies it can be brushed aside.  Now, Sir, it may be of interest to know this fact, that it was canvassed amongst the Whips that if the main Opposition Parties did not support Motion No. 3 the Government would not give any time at all for its discussion.</P>

      <P>I think, Sir, the House is entitled to know that the Government's attitude in refusing time to-day for the discussion of the motion is part of their general attitude to this motion, founded on the fact that it is proposed and seconded by two Independent Deputies.  Surely, I am entitled to make the case that the least Deputy in this House, the most insignificant Deputy in this House, is entitled <Col N="1466" /> to the same respect for his constitutional rights as a Deputy of this House as is the most powerful Party in this House.</P>

      <P>Why?  I am making it. I am saying that an attempt is being made to deny their rights to two Independent Deputies.  I assert that if this motion were down in the name of the main Opposition Party, or of the Labour Party, there would be no question of refusing time this week for its discussion.  I am asserting that it is the design and purpose of the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach, by brushing it aside until next week, to create in the public mind the idea that inasmuch as this is a motion made by an aggrieved Party it is by the grace of the Government that we allow them time to talk about it at all, and that it will be done just as well next week. I will take nothing by favour from Fianna Fáil or from its &ldquo;busted flush.&rdquo; I want nothing from them by grace or by concession, but I will take from them what I am entitled to have, whether they like it or not.  It is in their power, a power rottenly acquired and soon to be lost, to take from him what any Deputy is entitled to enjoy, but only temporarily.  I will get it back.  They will not take it from me without the people knowing what they would like to do if they were fit. Fianna Fáil, which constitutes the present Government with its ludicrous &ldquo;busted flush,&rdquo; loves to denigrate and insult those who are not intimidated by its corrupt and shameless political machine.  They cannot corrupt me; they cannot intimidate me, but they would like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is not the attempt to postpone the discussion of this motion from this week to next week a clear effort on the part of the Government to suggest that it is not of any particular importance, and that it can be discussed <Col N="1467" /> at any time as well as now?  I am respectfully submitting to the Ceann Comhairle that any breach of the privileges of any Deputy, however insignificant he may be, matters more than all the tripe that Fianna Fáil proposes to contribute to the proceedings of this House during the next week.  The privileges of one Deputy constitute the whole foundation of freedom in this country.  The hogwash of Fianna Fáil for the next week is the propaganda of a bankrupt and split political Party.  I set the privilege of any Deputy of this House a thousand times before the halting, fumbling floundering of Fianna Fáil and its &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo;.  I am asking for nothing but my rights and I am not asking them from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am asking them from Dáil Éireann.  I ask nothing of Fianna Fáil and I take no benefaction they offer, but I am asking of Dáil Éireann my rights as an individual Deputy.  I may not be able to get them to-day because the &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo; and its proprietor are here in force, but the Irish people are outside and, if I cannot get my rights in our own Parliament to-day, the day will come when I can get them and I hope that when power returns to those who sit on this side of the House again, the &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo; and its proprietor will learn that their minority rights then will be more solicitously respected than a minority's right to-day is respected by the contemptible &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo; and its proprietor in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>May I submit that Deputy Dillon has come into the House to-day to reduce the proceedings of this deliberative Assembly to ridicule? At a time when an agreement had been reached between the various Parties to ensure that the business of this House would be expeditiously got through within the next week, Deputy Dillon comes in to waste as much time as he possibly can in regard to what appears to me a mere personal matter between himself and the Chair.  No Deputy has so often over a long period of years deliberately trampled upon the rules of order, deliberately brought this House <Col N="1468" /> into disrepute, deliberately attacked persons and slandered persons in this House.</P>

That agreement was entered into by Deputy Dillon that we should meet next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to transact the business as arranged.  I think that Deputy Dillon is demanding more rights than any Deputy has ever looked for in this House.  He thinks he is a specially privileged person with a right to slander people here and to ignore the decisions of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  He has not even asked that this matter, as reflecting on the Chair, should be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>The question raised this morning is whether we ought not to adjourn until this motion has been discussed and that it ought to be discussed to-day.  The point has been raised that Deputy Dillon is wasting time, on the one hand, and upsetting an orderly arrangement arrived at by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, on the other. I do not know to what extent there was a formal decision by the Committee that we would not sit on Friday&mdash;I know it was understood&mdash;but I submit that, when our minds go back to what happened in the discussion on the election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and what has gone on this morning, there are things much more important than even the waste of Deputies' time, and that we are concerned with the proper functioning of this House and the orderly discharge of its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would put it to the Taoiseach that, looking back over the events of last Wednesday, the day upon which the election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was discussed, and what we had here again this morning, the most satisfactory thing would be to accept the proposition put by Deputy Dillon, to understand the attitude of mind and <Col N="1471" /> the circumstances in which he is making a stand and asking for the discussion for which he has asked, and to have it straight away.  I do not want to go into the merits of what happened on Wednesday, and I do not want to go into the merits of the other important matters Deputy Dillon has raised, but Deputy Dillon has raised very important matters with regard to the now printed report of what was supposed to have taken place on the discussion of the election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and personally I should like to have a little more time to look into it. When members of this House find themselves in the position in which we all found ourselves on Wednesday last, when Deputy Dillon particularly, on behalf of himself and Deputy Fagan, took up the attitude they have taken, then I think it is a matter of concern on every side of the House that we do go out of our way, if necessary, to provide an opportunity for exorcising those feelings at the earliest possible moment, facing the facts that have to be put here and seeing whether we can regulate our conduct in the future in a more satisfactory way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was really largely responsible for everything that has happened and I would appeal to him to realise that and to realise his responsibility to assist everybody in the House, to help the ordinary regulation of business here and to respect the plea made by Deputy Dillon this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

      <P>Before the Tánaiste rises, I would like to agree with Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies who urge that the motion in Deputy Dillon's name be discussed to-day and that time be provided. There is no need for a rush to adjourn the business of this House.  It is only a newly-elected Dáil, hardly sitting a month, and here we are rushing and curtailing business.  A few days ago, I was deprived of my right to speak on an important Estimate, that for the Department of Agriculture.  The curtailing of these Estimates to two hours, as the Dáil is going to retire <Col N="1472" /> for the next three months, is a disgrace.</P>

I was present here on the last occasion when this whole matter arose and I want to say that, as one Deputy, I was not by any means satisfied with the way the thing was dealt with.  If it were my case, I would have adopted the very same course as Deputy Dillon adopted on this occasion.  I feel that time should be allowed, and allowed now, to have this whole matter dealt with.  People throughout the whole of this State are talking about this incident and they feel that Deputy Dillon would be the last man to disobey the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Orders, the Government has the responsibility of deciding the order in which business will be taken in the House.  For the remainder of the session, the Government has the advantage of securing the unanimous consent of all Parties, through their representatives on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, for the regulation of business.  The Committee <Col N="1473" /> on Procedure and Privileges decided that the Dáil should not meet on Fridays.  As a corollary of that decision, it was agreed that we should meet from 10.30 until 5 on Thursdays. There is no foundation for the suggestion that, in reaching that agreement, the committee was solely concerned to facilitate the Government.  The Government certainly did not use any pressure to secure that agreement, which represented, so far as we know, the desire of all Deputies, as expressed through their representatives.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, open to a Deputy to move that the Dáil should meet on Friday.  We do not think that is necessary.  If that motion comes to a vote, we will vote against it, but if the House wants to meet on Friday we will accept its decision.  I want it to be understood, however, that that does not mean that this Motion No. 3 on the Order Paper will be taken to-morrow. It was agreed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that time for the motion would be allowed before the end of the session. We are prepared to allow Government time for its discussion on Tuesday and we think that is a reasonable arrangement.</P>

      <P>Last night I listened with admiration to the case made by Deputy Lynch for the sitting of the High Court in Cork.  No doubt both he and Deputy McGrath are most anxious that there should be a sitting of the High Court in Cork.  I think that every Deputy of this House could make an equally good case for the sitting of the High Court in every town in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Take Donegal.  We have an ideal courthouse in Letterkenny, but I am not suggesting to this House and to the Minister that we should have a sitting of the High Court in Donegal.  I do suggest that the solution of the entire problem is to increase the jurisdiction of both the District and the Circuit Courts.  If the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was increased to, say, £1,000 in contract and tort, then we would have very little necessity in rural Ireland for instituting proceedings in the High Court.  After all, the judges presiding over our Circuit Courts are men of <Col N="1477" /> very high legal standing.  The majority of them are men who have practised at the Inner Bar for a considerable number of years and I think they are capable of dispensing justice equally with any member of the High Court. Remember that when the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was first fixed the value of money was much greater than it is to-day.</P>

      <P>It would, but surely I am entitled to refer to the various arguments put forward by Deputies for the transfer of the High Court from Dublin.  I am suggesting that a solution to the problem is to increase the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall allow the Deputy to proceed on this line within a certain limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that, by increasing the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts, there would be no necessity for Deputies of this House to request the High Court, as such, to go on circuit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Estimate could be cut considerably by the closing of a number of Civic Guard barracks in rural Ireland.  I know for a fact Garda barracks in this country which are manned by a sergeant and two Guards, the three of whom are married men.  I also know that these Guards, in some cases, reside as far away as three or four miles from the Garda station.  I further know that all these Guards have time to do is relieve each other for meals.  It is quite true that these three men are each entitled to an hour for each meal per day and all they do&mdash;they have not time to do anything else&mdash; is to relieve each other for meals.  The stations are closed from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.  I suggest that a number of these stations should be closed completely. If we had mobile Garda patrols at district headquarters we could save a considerable amount of funds which are now required for this <Col N="1478" /> Estimate.  Mobile patrols, motor cycle or motor car patrols at district and sub-district headquarters, would avoid the necessity for these rural stations which are merely signing on and off offices for the Department of Social Welfare.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister&mdash;I do not wish to anticipate the report of the commission which was set up by the Minister's predecessor&mdash;that he should give favourable consideration to the suggestion of closing down a number of these rural stations and setting up mobile patrols.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which the Minister should pay particular attention. It is the duty of the Gardaí to enforce the fishery laws just as much as it is their duty to enforce the licensing laws but how can they do so unless they are provided with patrol boats? In the days when Britain ruled this country, in all maritime counties we had the Royal Irish Constabulary and, in addition, we had the coastguard service. I am not suggesting that we should go back to that system but I do suggest that Garda stations particularly on the coasts of Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, should each have a small motor-boat.  We had one such boat in Burtonport for a number of years but, unfortunately, it was taken away.  It would be very interesting if the Minister looked up the number of prosecutions brought against foreign trawlers by that particular boat.  If we had these small patrol boats at each station in the counties which I have mentioned, then we would save expense on the Estimate for the Department of Defence because the corvettes, which are now patrolling the coasts at considerable expense, would not be required.  These small patrol boats could assist the fishery officers and protect our inshore fisheries.</P>
    <P>Last night, I think it was Deputy Gallagher who made a plea about the uniforms supplied to the Guards.  I support him.  I think it is ridiculous to see our Guards tied up in Prussian uniforms.  I think it was Deputy Corish who mentioned that he was anxious to see them rigged out in sports coats. He did not go so far as to say flannels. I should like to see them rigged out in <Col N="1479" /> Donegal homespun, particularly during the summer months.  I am quite serious in saying that.  If it is good enough for the inmates of some of our institutions and good enough for some of the aristocracy of the country, it should be quite good enough for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Again, an appeal was made last night for an increase in the force.  I say that the force, as it stands at the moment, is over strength, but it is not properly distributed.  For instance, at the seaside resorts during the summer months Gardaí are drafted in from all over the division to man the stations and carry out traffic and other duties associated with seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>On the Channel Islands they have a very small police force, but to augment the standing body of men during the height of the tourist season they recruit through the labour exchange physically fit men who are unemployed, and I suggest to the Minister that unemployed physically fit men, possibly ex-soldiers, should be recruited to do duty at these seaside resorts during the summer months.  In that way there would be no necessity further to recruit for the force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Call it what you like, it has been successful in the Channel Islands and in parts of England.  The force is over-manned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next I would refer to the enforcement of the law regarding cattle found wandering on the roads, particularly in the Midlands.  I might refer particularly to the road between Slane and Dublin.  It is really terrible at night motoring on it.  If we had a mobile patrol it would be very easy to effect prosecutions and save motorists from the danger they run when motoring along that road at night.  I am not referring to cattle being driven but to cattle wandering on the roads, and the number of cattle wandering on that road at night is really disgraceful. A mobile patrol on the road between Slane and Dublin and on other <Col N="1480" /> main roads and tourist roads at night would benefit motorists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period of office of the Minister's predecessor, one very progressive step was taken with regard to prison conditions, and I am sure that the present Minister is familiar with the improvements which took place when Deputy MacEoin was Minister.  I would ask the Minister, in the interests of humanity, to give attention while he is in charge of this Department to the conditions which obtain generally as far as convicted criminals are concerned.  I think that the question of the segregation of juvenile offenders from the older offenders is a very important one.  It is a principle which has been recognised in every country in the world, and it is one to which I do not think sufficient attention has been given in this country.  While there is a certain degree of segregation in our prisons between the juvenile delinquent, as it were, and the older criminal, I do not think it is sufficient.  I do not think it is right that the hardened type of offender and a body of younger offenders should be housed in one building, and it is not in accord with modern prison treatment.  Prison conditions generally here in Ireland leave very much to be desired and I trust that the Minister will give attention to that very important question, because punishment for crime which is misapplied, punishment which is too rigorous or punishment which is not based upon the examination of the individual case of each offender very often has the reverse effect to what is intended.  Instead of reforming it can very often harden and make more difficult the reformation of the criminal. I hope that the Minister will endeavour to look on this matter with at least as much humanity as his predecessor and improve the system as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to draw the attention of the Minister, as representing a Department which has some responsibility for the organisation of Dublin traffic, to the absolutely nightmarish condition which exists in the city at the present time and which has existed.  Apart <Col N="1481" /> entirely from the present alterations and improvements in the public highways undertaken by Dublin Corporation, a growing traffic problem has existed since the end of the war, a problem which is well known to every citizen, to every pedestrian, every cyclist and every motorist who passes through the City of Dublin.  It is well known that if at certain hours of the day you wish to proceed by car from Dáil Éireann to Nelson's Pillar it will take half an hour or three quarters. Recently traffic jams have been known which extended from the middle of the North Strand across to Pearse Street and which lasted for half an hour to 40 minutes because of the repairs undertaken by the corporation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to charge the Garda authorities in the city with the responsibility of evolving a system which will ease the present intolerable position.  I think that most people will agree that if one goes to Cork whence all good is supposed to emanate one must admit that the City of Cork has a far more effective traffic system than we have in the City of Dublin because of its organisation of one-way streets and so on.  The flow of traffic across the main arteries of the city is the responsibility and very onerous responsibility of the Garda authorities and one must have the utmost sympathy with the Garda officers in the city, particularly the pointsmen and those who have the job of dealing with the flow of traffic because they are dealing with something which is in an absolutely chaotic condition.  No effort seems to have been made for a number of years to introduce an Order which would make for an easier time for the Guards and a less worrying time for the motorists and cyclists.  Cyclists as a body in the city have been very much criticised and some steps are felt to be necessary to regulate the right to the space of the carriageway as between cyclists and motorists.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister as a very urgent matter, a matter of life and death apart from the loss of time and wear and tear on the nerves of thousands of people who go to and from work every day, to instruct the Garda <Col N="1482" /> authorities in the city to bring into existence a system of one-way streets and to improve the traffic regulations so that many of the present difficulties could be eliminated.  I do not suggest that it would be possible to eliminate them all simply by introducing a new traffic system, but I do say that it would be possible to eliminate a great many of them.  We are all very well aware that until such time as more bridges are constructed across the Liffey or until some method is found of easing the traffic on O'Connell Bridge and Butt Bridge such as the construction of tunnels or subways the problem will not be finally solved.  The vast majority of users of the road in Dublin City and County, and indeed in the country, are convinced that methods can be found whereby the traffic position can be eased&mdash;and that is a matter to which the Minister should give his attention.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the growing menace of destruction of public property, particularly as it affects my constituency.  It may have been observed by the Minister and by other Deputies that during the week there was a discussion at the Dublin County Council in regard to the problem of the destruction of public property.  It was instanced there that in one particular month, at a relatively lonely seaside resort, no less than a lifebelt which was there to protect human life was stolen. In other cases we have had instances of destruction of many types and kinds. The Minister should take steps to bring about a situation whereby offences of that kind can be punished in no uncertain fashion.  The present punishments do not seem to act as a deterrent.  The taking of a lifebelt, where it is necessary for the protection of human life, is a very serious matter and there should be a heavy punishment for it&mdash; if necessary even the punishment of flogging.</P>
    <P>The matter of the accommodation of Gardai, particularly in rural and suburban areas, is a problem that requires immediate and sympathetic attention.  A number of Gardaí who are married, some with small and others with large families, are stationed at various points throughout <Col N="1483" /> County Dublin and other counties. These men find it very difficult to obtain housing accommodation particularly in competition with the ordinary classes of people who are housed by local authorities, namely, agricultural workers, or labourers, or people living in condemned houses.  As a general rule, the group of men to whom I refer and their families reside in flats or rooms of a comparatively better nature than those in which you will find agricultural labourers or labourers of other kinds.  Therefore, because they do find accommodation in flats of that kind they are in a very unfavourable and unfortunate position in so far as the regulations governing housing allocation go.  It has been stated that the provision of housing for these men is not the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and that they get an allowance for housing.  I do not think it is realistic or just or fair to the Garda force that they should be left on their own oars in regard to this matter.  The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government, should take steps to see that where Gardaí and their families are in need of housing in areas in which local authorities are building houses their applications will receive favourable consideration by reason of the task they perform and the need that exists for having them in some contiguity to their barracks or station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I must be brief, by reason of the short time at our disposal, I cannot go in any detail into the remarks mainly by Deputy Lynch of Cork with regard to transferring the High Court to Cork or part of it. There is only one Cork Deputy in the House, but I should like to have it conveyed that I do not believe that Deputy Lynch's arguments on that point would bear examination.  I wish they would be examined speedily and be debated in a calm way before this becomes a Party issue.  Every second sentence of Deputy Lynch's speech contradicts the preceding sentence. There is no case to be made for transferring the High Court to Cork either on the grounds of delay or expense or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> I want to say a few words with regard to the strength of the Garda force.  There is a commission sitting at the moment and I hope that it will report soon.  As far as I was concerned, that commission stemmed from a very excellent couple of articles produced in an ancient issue of the <i>Garda Review.</i>  Garda conditions in this country were contrasted with police conditions elsewhere.  The case has undoubtedly been made, from what Deputy O'Donnell said here this morning, that the Gardaí are overstaffed, but that their strength and value is dissipated in a lot of duties that could well be taken from them and not handed over to anybody else. I should like to discover how much of the time of the Gardaí of this country is occupied in trying to prevent people in rural areas from getting a drink after hours.  It is a task which is unending and fruitless.  Yet it occupies a considerable amount of the time of the Gardaí who could spend it better otherwise, or have it left on their hands.  I think that the statistics are available in a very easy form.  The Minister might give us the statistics as to the number of police we have in this country to, say, each hundred of the population, and he might give us the crime figures at the same time so that the two things can be contrasted. It will then be seen that instead of the Garda force being under strength, as has often been complained, they are over staffed.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister last night that the pay of the Gardaí will be increased in accordance with the recent Civil Service award.  Their pay has always been related to that of the Civil Service and once the Civil Service arbitration took place and an award was given it was almost inevitable, unless there was going to be a breach of all the traditions, that an increase would be given.  At the same time, people wondered whether the Minister would give it when they remembered his very angry statement in 1949 about what Fianna Fáil was determined to prevent and would have prevented if they had got the majority for which they had been looking.  They <Col N="1485" /> have not got it now but they were in a position of power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Court clerks were referred to last night.  That has been a long drawn out proceeding because it was very difficult to get the position of these court clerks related to the position of civil servants.  Varieties of compromises were suggested and, in the end, the full compromise was accepted.  I hope there will be no delay in implementing what took so long to consider and what the Minister himself never brought to <Col N="1486" /> any conclusion when he was previously interested in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>It is brought to a conclusion in so far as another departmental anomaly has gone.  If it is not brought to a full conclusion, it is within a hair's-breadth of it.  I must say there is still room for the Minister to misrepresent that, but I hope that he will not take the opportunity.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was in opposition he marked himself out by his splenetic and revengeful statements in regard to certain people in this country, people who were alleged to be criminals.  In particular, he had a good deal to say about the man whom he and his colleagues called &ldquo;Stalin's Agent&rdquo;.  The mere fact that that individual is now a supporter of the present Government does not I suppose deprive him of his dual personality.  The Minister has now had an opportunity of looking into whatever is on record with regard to that Deputy.  I wonder will he tell us what he has discovered.  I wonder would he be prepared to repeat again what he said when, without any information, he used to throw out a variety of slanderous comments with regard to that Deputy when the Minister was in opposition.</P>
      <P>The Minister went into office full of enthusiasm to investigate the records with regard to I.R.A. procedure and proceedings, with regard to I.R.A. strength and the growth of I.R.A. strength about which he expressed so many fears when he was over here. Will he tell us if his fears have been allayed?  If not, will he tell us what he intends to do with regard to the growing strength, if there is a growing strength, in relation to these bodies which were so much on the forward move just because the present Minister had left office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister clear up one thing now that he has a chance?  Will he tell us who the people were who were responsible for the mutilation of a public <Col N="1487" /> document?

      <P>I am challenging that.  There is in existence under the laws of this House a book which is one of the most important books in the country.  It is a register of those who get certificates of naturalisation. The Minister knows there is such a book.  In that book there is one page, and one page only, that has been mutilated and distorted.  And that is the page on which Deputy Erskine Childers' name now appears.  The Minister knows what I am talking about.  In that book, and it is a very important book and a book which marks the addition to the strength of the citizens of this country by process of naturalisation, apart from the original naturally born citizens of the country, there are these additions. That particular book is governed by law.  That particular book as it runs up to a certain page is in this form: there is one entry per page and any person looking at it can find out when a person got a certificate of naturalisation and the date on which that certificate was issued.  The law says that the position of that citizen as a citizen of the country is that he has <Col N="1488" /> cast upon him the duties and responsibilities of a citizen from the date of the issue of the certificate.  On the page on which Deputy Childers' name now appears there was previously another name.  That name has been erased.  Why?  The erasure is quite clear to the eye.  One does not require an infra-red lens to bring it up although the name could be brought up in that fashion.  The erasure is quite clear to the naked eye.  It is quite clear to the naked eye that there was a name previously on that page and that it has been erased.  I do not think there is any date on the page.</P>
      <P>One turns over a few more pages and one comes to a clean page with the name of Deputy Childers' brother on it.  The official announcement that appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> stated that these two people got their certificates at the same time; at least they were included in the same notices.  Why was there all that difficulty?  I can suggest one reason and that is that on the first day on which Deputy Childers made his appearance as a candidate for election, his nomination was challenged and the certificate was then remade after that date.  The Minister can answer this quite simply.  Is the page mutiliated?  I suggest it is.</P>

      <P>There is the position. One name is erased and the notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> as I said, puts in both Deputy Erskine Childers and his brother.  But they do not appear either on the same page of the register or on succeeding pages.  There are other people in between and when we come to his brother we find that he is on a clean page without any erasure having been made.  I want to know why.  There may be a simple explanation of it.  It may have been an attempt to regularise a position which was allowed to occur through a mistake. But that mistake might have very serious consequences.  I think we all know and it will be generally <Col N="1491" /> accepted that it is the right of the citizen, and only of the citizen, to proffer himself for election.  It is the right of the citizen, and only of the citizen, when he becomes a candidate for election to pay certain expenses. On the part of anybody else it is a corrupt practice, and it is a corrupt practice which carries with it the consequences of disqualification.  It is a corrupt practice which, if indulged in by a candidate for election, has the consequences of disqualification for life.  Now, these are very serious consequences and they turn upon the page of a book.  The Minister, if he wishes, can now explain to the House the full circumstances.  If he does not wish to do so, I shall expose the matter later and let the Taoiseach come in here next week to deal with it.  I suggest that that book was cooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak only for a few moments on this Estimate having regard to the fact that the time allowed for the debate is limited. I congratulate the Minister on the fact that the pay of the Gardaí has been increased.  It is an increase which is long overdue, but there are other things which are also long overdue and which have been under consideration over a long period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer especially to the question of housing accommodation for married men in the Gardaí particularly in rural Ireland.  In many cases married Gardaí are obliged to live apart from their wives and families because they cannot secure housing accommodation locally. The Minister is aware of that, and if he is not aware of it, I would ask him to inquire into the matter and try to ascertain the number of married Gardaí who are living apart from their wives.  We have them living in one county while their wives live in another.  They are deprived of the opportunity of living a family life because of the lack of housing accommodation for them.  If these young Guards come to me or to any other public representative, we are not in a position to make any representations on their behalf because they will be <Col N="1492" /> severely reprimanded for asking us to make such representations.  I ask the Minister what method of securing redress these Gardaí have, or what way is open to them for making representation either to him or to the Commissioner? The Commissioner does not seem to give them any consideration apart from putting the matter on the long finger.  I should like the Minister to say what he would think if, in the early days of his married life, he were separated from his wife and children. Is it a good Christian practice or is it in accordance with Christian principles? When is the Department of Justice going to wake up to its responsibilities in this matter?  This is a matter which has been frequently debated in this House from the time I first entered it in 1943.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that it was debated during the period of office of the inter-Party Government for the past three years but no redress has been forthcoming. There have been promises in plenty but nothing effective has been done. Let us hope that, in the lifetime of this Government, whether it be long or short, some effort will be made to provide reasonable housing accommodation for young men in the Garda who desire to marry or who are married.  I say also that if a Garda makes representations to a Deputy or to any public representative, he should not be punished or reprimanded by the Superintendents or the Commissioner for doing so.  He should not be sent as a punishment to a station somewhere in the backward parts of the West of Ireland.  He should be entitled to make such representations.</P>
    <P>As regards the Garda uniform, I think the present uniform should be changed, especially for the summer months.  In their present uniforms Gardaí are tightened up to the neck, as if they were wearing a collar and hames.  It is an unnatural garb for warm weather.  I do not say, however, that we should adopt the suggestion of Deputy O'Donnell and provide them with uniforms made from home spun tweeds, but they should be given a lighter type of uniform, with an open neck shirt, that will admit <Col N="1493" /> some air instead of having them tightened up like criminals.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what authority or control he has in regard to the granting of licences for dances.  Perhaps he has no control at all in that direction and that the power is confined to the justices.  Is it necessary to introduce legislation to alter that situation?  I may say that young people in the country are not anxious to have late dances.  It has been stated that it would be unpopular to introduce legislation to ban late dances or to direct the judiciary to refuse licences for such dances, but I can state definitely that the young people of the country do not desire late dances.  I attend dances myself and I have not yet met any young man or woman who is anxious to remain out until 4 o'clock in the morning, but what choice have they if the dance does not start until 12 o'clock?  There is no country in the world where such capers are carried on.</P>
    <P>I have travelled all over Britain from one end of the country to the other and I can say that if one were seen going home from a dance at 4 o'clock in the morning, one would be liable to be taken into custody.  Certainly the police would want to know where you were coming from at that hour of the morning.  Yet it has become the custom in this country to hold these late dances because there is no proper system of control.  I suggest that it should be made a condition of these licences that the dances should start at a proper hour and should end at a proper hour.  From the health point of view alone, apart from the Christian aspect of the matter, it is absolutely essential that we should end a system under which young boys and girls from 16 years upwards are obliged to remain out until 4 o'clock in the morning.  They deplore that situation themselves because they have become conscious of the fact, as a result of propaganda over the wireless and of the various pamphlets which have been distributed, that it is not good for their health. No example nor no headline has been given to them in this respect.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I am very <Col N="1494" /> much opposed is the granting of permission for the sale of alcohol in dance halls.  How is it that that takes place only when the middle classes or the upper classes use these dance halls? How is it that they set the bad example?  How is it that they can procure permission from the district justice for the sale of drink in these dance halls?  One would expect that these people would set an example for the ordinary citizen, but they are not doing so.  I would appeal to the Minister if it is within the ambit of his powers, to instruct district justices to refuse permission for the sale of liquor at such dance halls.  No matter who runs such dances, whether they be hunt balls, tennis balls or any other kind of dances, he should refuse point blank to give such permission.  There are sufficient pubs in rural Ireland, too many of them, in fact, without landing them into dance halls, to sell drink from midnight to 4 o'clock in the morning. Nothing good comes out of it. The dance hall should be a place of recreation only.</P>

      <P>I had a month's holiday and having had experience of prison life I would suggest that there is a good deal in what Deputy Dunne said here and that there is reason for reform.  You do not reform the criminal by punishing him in excess of his crime.  It is unfair that you should have young boys knocking about with hardened adult criminals up to 50 or 60 years who are taken into custody to-day for a particular crime and who come up again to-morrow charged with a repetition of the crime.  The minds of young boys guilty of minor offences are warped by constant contact with such criminals.  It is the wrong place to have these children&mdash;they are only children of 15, 16 and 17 years of age.  Something should be done to segregate them so that they would not mix with adult hardened offenders.</P>
      <P>I made suggestions here way back in 1947, before the change of Government, in relation to the reorganisation of the prisons, better treatment for warders, more off-time, and better uniforms.  I wonder if the Minister ever put those suggestions into effect.  If he did not&mdash;I do not want to prolong the discussion by reiterating them&mdash;I would ask him to reconsider them now.</P>
      <P>Those are the few points I wish to make.  There are many more, but, in fairness to other Deputies who desire to speak, I will content myself with asking the Minister to consider the suggestions I have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter to which I think no reference has been made in <Col N="1496" /> the discussion is the growing menace of the travelling tribes in rural Ireland known as tinkers.  These people are not exactly tinkers.  They do not indulge in the hard work of manipulating tin ware.  They are to a great extent beggars and dealers in donkeys, goats and old horses and other similar types of activity.  They inflict a very grave hardship upon people who live in remote rural areas, particularly people who live in houses adjoining seldom used by-roads.  They camp upon these roads; they turn their horses loose upon the farmers' land and they take hay and firewood and all the goods that they require off the land.  So far nothing serious has been done in regard to this matter.  One of the things that could be done to remedy this evil is to give the local peace commissioner additional powers &mdash;the power, in the case of serious offences by those people against the property or against the liberty of individuals, to take them into custody pending trial.  The trouble in regard to vagrants is that, if they are summoned for an offence, they will probably accept the summons, but by the time the court day arrives, they have melted into thin air and cannot be found.  The powers of the local peace commissioner should be extended so that in a case where it is unlikely that the person charged will appear in court, the peace commissioner would have power to remand him in custody.  I think that would help to eliminate this injustice.</P>
      <P>People living in rural areas, particularly housewives who are left in charge of the house while their husbands are out working, find the tinkers a menace.  It is not a very pleasant experience for a housewife living in a remote district, perhaps a mile from her nearest neighbour, to see two or three hulking young men appearing at the door or arriving in the middle of the floor, if the door happens to be open.  I know that they only ask for alms, but their very appearance is frightening, and it would be a very brave woman who would refuse to help them.  I feel that it is about time the law was tightened up in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> I would like to make another suggestion, and it is this.  We should not, perhaps, direct the law against people who are regarded as the poorer section of the community, but any persons who have no fixed abode, even holiday-makers who have a tent or other mobile means of living, should be subjected to some form of licensing.  In that way the activities of vagrants would be controlled to some extent.</P>
    <P>I believe a deputation of farmers visited the Minister within the last fortnight complaining about the injustices they have suffered at the hands of nomads, and I would ask him to consider their complaints.  They have to stay up at night guarding their crops and patrolling the roads.  Not only have they to remain out of bed, but they have to gather together in groups of nine or ten, so that they will not be molested should they find it necessary to protect their crops from trespass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House more than two minutes, but I want to ask the Minister a question in regard to the Land Registry.  I hope I am not repeating what some other Deputy has already said.  There is an arrangement in the Land Commission, I understand, whereby applications for subdivision, by persons desiring to erect new dwellings, are given priority.  I realise that there are great difficulties in the way of speeding up the Land Registry.  At the same time, I would ask that some priority be given to applications for registration on behalf of persons who are erecting dwelling houses, because the loan and the second portion of the Government grant are very often not forthcoming until such time as the people are actually in residence.  I would, therefore, ask for some amelioration on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Cogan speaking about tinkers.  However, I cannot say that I agree with him, as I am for tinkers, not against them.  I say, seriously, that they are part of the social fabric of this country. If we are bringing in legislation to curtail their activities, and I appreciate that their presence is not favourable to any section of the community, we must <Col N="1498" /> make sure that we do not interfere with their democratic rights.  According to the Constitution the democratic rights of every person in the country, be he nomad or otherwise, must be properly protected.  Undue powers must not be given to any peace commissioner or justice, powers which would in any way tend to outlaw these vagrants who, as I have already said, are part of the social fabric of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask if it is the Minister's intention at a very early date to increase the strength of the Garda in the City of Dublin.  The numbers are not sufficient to cope with the increase in the population during the last few years.  The scarcity of Gardaí is very noticeable in all parts of Dublin.  In our main thoroughfares the Gardaí are very scarce indeed.  The Minister ought to do something to see that the main thoroughfares in Dublin are adequately policed.  It is amazing how efficient the Gardaí are in the City of Dublin, the amount of work they have to do and how well they do it. It is not fair to ask two or three Gardaí to look after the welfare of the people in the principal street in all Ireland.  I also hope that Garda stations will be provided in the new outlying districts. Under their new housing schemes Dublin Corporation are housing thousands of people outside the city and the time has come when there should be an inquiry into the requirements of these outlying districts.  I ask the Minister to see that something will be done to increase the strength of the Garda and lessen the duties and amount of work which Gardaí have to do in the centre of the city.</P>

I think it was most disgraceful that the Deputy should have raised the matter in the way that he did.</P>
      <P>As to the pay of the Garda, the Garda are getting paid back to the same date as the Civil Service.  When Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance he did not do that.  He left it to me to do it and they were months behind.  The strength of the Garda in Dublin is due entirely, of course, to the lack of recruiting.  There was no recruiting for the last three and a half years and the over-all strength of the Garda, including officers, has been reduced by about 570.  That should not be.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy McGilligan that the Garda are over strength.  I believe that if we had not Gardaí in these isolated districts to do non-police work it would have to be done at very much more expense by other officials.  I think the Gardaí serve a very good purpose in doing work of a non-police nature.  There has been talk about a single Guard in a station, like the village constable idea.  But nobody is supposed to work more than eight hours a day now and three Guards in a station are only equivalent to one if they are to be given the same rights as ordinary citizens and are only required to work eight hours a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of the District Court <Col N="1500" /> clerks has not been finished up yet.  I thought it was finished by the passing of the recent Bill but there is still a hold up.  I was amazed to hear the Deputy responsible for the hold up speaking in the way he did.  Having had his share in holding up the matter, he tries to throw the blame on me.</P>
    <P>I understand that the provision of a different type of uniform for the Garda would cost between £30,000 and £35,000. Anyway, I do not think it is a very big matter and anything I can do to have the Garda more comfortably dressed, I will do it, but we will have to have a fight with the Minister for Finance about it.</P>
    <P>The question of free legal aid for prisoners is a matter for legislation.  If the Deputy who raised the matter was an old Deputy I would have objected. He is a new Deputy, however, and he made his case very well and I will have the matter looked into.  The principal thing I wanted to do was to reply to Deputy McGilligan and to say the few words I have said.</P>

    <P>In view of the limitation of the time for the debate, I assume Deputies will wish me to skip the usual preliminary explanation of the details of the Estimates and to proceed at once to outline the Government's policy and intentions in respect to matters in which Deputies have indicated interest.  I propose to deal mainly with prices and price control arrangements, with industrial development and the position of the Industrial Development Authority, with the electricity position and the new generation programme. Before referring to these matters there are a few brief references to other issues which I think it is desirable to make.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked about the position concerning the Great Northern Railway.  It will be within the recollection of Deputies that in January last letters were issued to the Great Northern Railway Company from the Department of Industry and Commerce in Dublin and the Department of Commerce in Belfast referring to a joint offer to purchase the undertaking as a going concern.  It is well that it should be known that some divergence of opinion became apparent subsequently between the Minister for Industry and Commerce here and the Minister for Commerce in Belfast, and that the prospect of concerting parallel legislation as originally contemplated began to recede.  I have made myself familiar with all the documents and the records of the discussions which have taken place and the matter is at present under consideration by the Government.  In the circumstances, the Dáil will understand that I cannot say anything further.</P>
    <P>With regard to the shipping and air companies, I have requested certain reports from the managements as a preliminary to discussion on future <Col N="1504" /> development.  I do not wish to make a statement of intentions in advance of these discussions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Tourist Board, the position is somewhat similar, except that I think it is desirable that I should refer to a recent Press announcement that the board had decided to suspend hotel grading for a period.  I do not think I agree with that decision but I have asked the board for a statement of their reasons and when I receive that I will consider it fairly.  It is well, however, that it should be understood that the decision announced by the board should not be taken as definite unless it is subsequently confirmed.</P>
    <P>In the case of Córas Iompair Éireann, I have within the past few days received from the board a memorandum on its financial position with particular reference to the need to increase rates and fares.  The financial position of Córas Iompair Éireann is very serious. I understand that the board indicated in February last that it had decided to raise fares to the extent necessary to off-set its increased cost in respect of fuel and other materials and labour costs following upon certain wage increases which had been granted.  That decision conveyed by the board in February last was not implemented and I am not sure as to the reasons for the delay but it is obvious that because of it the deficit in the present year will be substantially higher than was originally estimated.  The board now tell me that it may amount to £2,300,000.  Facing a deficit of that kind, it is clear that no alteration of rates and fares can off-set it.  The board have made proposals to raise fares by 12½ per cent. and rates by 16? per cent. for both rail and road services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister mind repeating the figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>12½ per cent. for fares and 16? per cent. for rates.  Even if these increases in rates and fares should bring in the full revenue that the board estimate, it would still leave a deficit of about £1,000,000 on this year's accounts.  As an alternative to raising rates and fares, the board have <Col N="1505" /> suggested consideration of the possibility of imposing further and fairly considerable restrictions upon road transport.  That matter is under consideration, but it is obvious that in the near future some far-reaching decisions will be necessary.</P>
      <P>The extent to which it is desirable that public transport services should be subsidised from taxation is a matter upon which opinions may differ.  It will be clear that money spent in subsidising public transport services is money that will not be available for other desirable purposes.  I consider that a loss of over £2,000,000 per year is altogether excessive and that some measures will have to be taken which will bring it down considerably.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I may refer again to the decision already communicated to the Dáil that the Store Street building should be made available to Córas Iompair Éireann for use as a bus station.  Work is proceeding upon the conversion of the portion of the building required by Córas Iompair Éireann but I have been disappointed to learn that the earliest date upon which it is likely to be available for use is May next.  I had hoped that it would have been possible to use it, even if incomplete, before the coming winter and to save long-distance bus travellers the hardship and inconvenience associated with present arrangements.  I am satisfied that all the people concerned are doing their best to bring the opening date forward but the utmost that they can hope to achieve is to make it available for service, even if not fully completed, in May of next year.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to the House and of consolation to some Deputies to learn that the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann had, apparently, abandoned in April last the intention of erecting a bus station on the Smithfield site, and approached my predecessor to secure the use of his influence in obtaining an alternative site which they had then in mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Turning now to the question of prices, which is the outstanding question of public interest at the present time and which is also of grave concern to the Government, I think that we must face up to the fact that when the cost of materials and rates of wages are rising, prices will rise also.  I think it is necessary to state that clearly because the public have been led to believe, by what I regard as mistaken Party propaganda, that there is some action which the Government can take which would prevent rising costs being reflected in rising retail prices or, alternatively, that there is some margin of excessive profits remaining with manufacturers or traders which are capable of absorbing these rising costs without affecting <Col N="1507" /> retail prices.  That is not true.  Anybody who has given a moment's serious thought to the price situation here knows that it is not true but the propagation of that idea amongst the public has harmful results.  It prevents a wider understanding of the facts and it leads to a reluctance to co-operate in making effective the measures which the Government can take to limit the rise in prices or to reduce the economic consequences of the rise.</P>
      <P>There is some reason to think that the peak has been passed in the rise of raw material prices throughout the world.  Whether that is an optimistic and an unjustifiable forecast or not will be a matter of opinion; but there are grounds for hoping that the price position internationally may become stabilised before the end of the year. However, having regard to our own position, there are certain facts which must be appreciated in that regard. In each month of this year there was a rise in the wholesale price index.  In May, as compared with last year, wholesale prices showed an increase of 20 per cent.; in the same period, import prices increased by 24 per cent., and agricultural prices by 16 per cent. Similarly, there was a steady rise in wages.  The index of average weekly earnings of industrial workers rose from 105.1 in March, 1950, to 113.8 in March, 1951, a rise of 8 per cent.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these increases in wholesale and import prices, agricultural prices and wages, it is obvious that retail prices must rise also.  I think we must face up to the fact that the rise in these wholesale and import prices and wages has not yet been fully reflected in the retail price level here.  There is always a time lag before a rise in the cost of materials, or in wages, is reflected in retail prices. As against the 20 per cent. increase in wholesale prices, the 24 per cent. increase in import prices and the 16 per cent. increase in agricultural prices, our retail price level this year has risen only 7 per cent.  There is, therefore, no reasonable expectation that any general fall in prices will occur in the early future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position we have got to <Col N="1508" /> deal with, and it is in relation to that position that the Government's policy has to be determined.  It is our policy to maintain control over the prices of commodities which are scarce, or which are likely to become scarce, or where competition is absent or limited in any way, or where circumstances of any other kind exist which might permit of the exploitation of the public.</P>
    <P>I want, however, to be clearly understood. I do not regard the control of prices as meaning that prices will not rise.  I mean by the control of prices that increases will be confined to proven and necessary increases in costs.  When the first upward surge in prices occurred towards the end of last year, our predecessors made a standstill Order.  I do not know whether they had any other than a political motive for doing so.  I doubt it, because I am sure that they realised themselves that it was largely a pretence. In the event, it proved to be unworkable and was very quickly discarded. A general standstill on prices is logical only where temporary circumstances occasion the danger of a sudden rise and it is considered good policy to do without goods rather than permit them to be sold at higher prices.  During the emergency period when I was Minister for Supplies and in charge of price regulation I took that line on a number of occasions.  I told the people who were engaged in the importation of goods that I had fixed a price for those goods, that if they could get them to import and sell at that price they were free to do so, but that if they could not sell at that price then we did not want them imported at all.  A standstill is logical on that basis.  If we think there is a reason why we should freeze the price of particular commodities, even if by doing so we may create a situation in which these commodities will not be available, then there is justification for that policy.  I do not think these circumstances exist now.</P>
    <P>I read the report of a speech delivered recently by Deputy Larkin in which he appeared to advocate that policy, in which he appeared to justify a refusal to permit increases in prices <Col N="1509" /> even where an application for the increase had been fully investigated by the Prices Advisory Body and recommended by them.  Clearly, he meant, at least I took it that he meant, that we should not let prices increase even if it meant that goods would no longer be available for sale.  I am against that policy.  I am against it, first of all, because it would create a great deal of unemployment, which is a consequence to be avoided, and, secondly, because it is contrary to the over-all requirements of the present national position.  Our position is one of potential inflation, and to curtail the supply of goods by the operation of a rigorous price control of that kind would merely intensify inflation and make the problem of price control much more difficult subsequently.  I think it is better that we should maintain supplies and maintain employment rather than create scarcities by the enforcement of unrealistic prices.  That view, of course, is based on the assumption which I have made, that prices are not likely to fall soon and that international circumstances are such as to make it undesirable for us to deplete stocks or to avoid imports.</P>
    <P>The rise in the cost-of-living index in the first quarter of this year of six points between mid-February and midMay, and the still upward trend of prices is causing us very grave concern as I know it caused our predecessors concern.  There may be a temporary spurt in prices now because, during the weeks preceding the change of Government, a number of recommendations by the Prices Advisory Body for increases were not acted on.  I think that whatever justification there may have been on political grounds for that course, it was, obviously, unfair to the traders concerned, traders who had proven their case to the Prices Advisory Body. In one case, at any rate, it forced my predecessor into a decision to suspend the arrangements for the enforcement of existing prices.  Now, I do not intend to follow that policy.  I think that, when realistic prices have been arranged, strict enforcement should follow.  If, for any reason, strict enforcement is impracticable, then I would sooner decontrol entirely. <Col N="1510" /> Generally speaking, however, I do not propose to decontrol prices except where competition amongst suppliers or buyers' resistance, causing a decline in trade, makes it likely that the position will be kept in check.  There are a few cases in which I am not by any means satisfied whether the price control arrangements in force are keeping prices down or prices up, and I intend to look into these cases again.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned buyers' resistance. There has been some evidence of it, particularly, I think, in the drapery trade.  Certainly, a number of traders have reported to me that trade is slack.  I am aware that a number of factories making goods for the drapery trade are at present closed while accumulated stocks are being dispersed. It is obvious that, in the drapery trade and in other trades, people are hesitating to buy.  Maybe that is because prices are too high for their resources. Maybe it is because they are expecting a fall in prices.  The announcement of the downward trend in the raw wool market, and in the case of certain other raw materials, has created the expectation of a more rapid reflection of that position in retail prices than, I think, is likely.  I have expressed my personal view that a fall in prices is unlikely. At present, the trend is still upward.  We may get it stabilised if there are no international complications before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Because employment has been affected by the present position, I want to express the hope that trade will revive.  I know that, when Deputy Morrissey became Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1948, he thought it wise to advise the people to hold off buying, in the belief that, if they did so, prices would come down.  Whatever justification there may have been for that advice in 1948, I do not think there would be any justification for it in this year.  There is no evidence that the conditions of a seller's market exist, certainly in relation to drapery goods or in relation to many classes of consumer goods.  The position, I think, is quite the contrary.  The falling off in trade would itself be a corrective of any undue upward movement <Col N="1511" /> in prices attributable to the action of traders.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see trade reviving and employment reviving in the factories supplying the traders rather than base any expectation on the belief that a buyers' strike would affect the price level in the least.  I do not think it would.</P>
    <P>The existing machinery for investigating prices and enforcing price control is, in my view, unsatisfactory in many respects, and I propose to overhaul it.  The principal change which was made since 1947 in the machinery was the introduction of the Prices Advisory Body, a body which, I think, was intended to be temporary, of six persons who hold office to the end of the present year.  It is not clear that the Prices Advisory Body got any clear instructions as to policy and they were left largely to their own devices to do the best they could to keep the price rise in check and to avoid unnecessary increases.</P>
    <P>There has been, as the House no doubt is aware, some criticism of their methods.  I do not regard it as any part of its function to put traders or manufacturers seeking price revisions in the dock as criminals required to justify their behaviour, and certainly not to have them held up to public odium.  It is the function of that body, as I understand it, to examine applications reasonably and, when public hearings are considered to be desirable, to help, through these hearings, the public to understand the circumstances that make the price revisions necessary.  I am proposing to keep that Prices Advisory Body in operation to deal with such cases as may be referred to it, which will be, in the main, cases of general interest affecting whole trades rather than individual firms.</P>

      <P>I think that may prove to be the practice, but I do not want to suggest that I have come to a final decision in that regard.  The function of the Prices Advisory Body, the most useful function it can perform, in my view, is the holding of these public investigations where it is desirable that the facts should be elucidated in public and the public should understand what the facts are.  It is, however, necessary, as I know Deputy O'Higgins thought himself, to make it quite clear that the private accounts of individual firms will not be improperly disclosed by reason of the activities of that body.  If there are any additional safeguards required to ensure that, I intend to provide them.  I am hoping that the whole prices position will be stabilised before the end of the year so as to remove the necessity for exceptional measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says that he hopes that prices will be stabilised by the end of the year, does he contemplate abolishing the Prices Advisory Body at the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If a position of stability developed and was likely to continue, <Col N="1513" /> I do not think it would be desirable to keep that body in existence.  I am not sure what the view of those who created it was at that time, but the impression I have received from the papers is that it was regarded by them as a temporary arrangement.</P>
      <P>Before leaving the question of prices, I should refer to the question of subsidies. As the House knows, bread, flour, tea, sugar and butter are at present subsidised.  Subsidisation on the present system requires the maintenance of rationing, the licensing of traders, the supervision of traders' operations by Government officials and all the restrictions which we had hoped during the war we would, before this, have been rid of.  It is not possible to get rid of these restrictions yet, but, short of another war, we cannot contemplate their maintenance in perpetuity. That whole position is under examination, but I know it will not be easy to find a way out.</P>
      <P>I know that many Deputies on this side have strong objection to the two-price system, both on grounds of principle and in relation to its method of operation.  I have examined the possibility of abolishing it.  The cost of extending subsidies to all the sales of the goods to which that system at present applies would be £1,600,000 in a year.  We have not got the money. Having regard to the present budgetary position, there is no likelihood of a sum of that size being provided to effect that change, at least in this year.  We do not like the system, but we seem to be stuck with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, it is obvious that the cost of imported tea, imported sugar and possibly imported wheat will rise, and, with that rise, the total cost of subsidy will increase also, and that is a further complication which makes it difficult to contemplate a change of the kind desired, in view of the heavy financial commitment involved in it.  There is a further consideration in that regard. The supply position in respect of some of these commodities is not altogether as secure as I should like it to be. There is a very substantial fall in the wheat acreage this year.  The provisional estimate suggests that the fall <Col N="1514" /> may be as high as 80,000 or 90,000 acres.  During the ten months to June of the present year, deliveries of native wheat to the flour mills were 44,000 tons below deliveries of the previous year. Having regard to that decline in deliveries in the present cereal year and the expectation of a still further and serious decline in the coming cereal year, because of the decline in acreage, we have to contemplate the need for increasing imports of wheat. Under the international wheat agreement, we are entitled to get 275,000 metric tons of wheat at a prearranged price, but at present wheat purchased outside the agreement costs a great deal more, and, if because of the decline in native wheat production, a substantial additional quantity of wheat must be imported, a very heavy increase in the subsidy cost will result.</P>
    <P>Also, in the case of butter, the House is aware that home production is well down this year and it may not fully recover earlier than 1953 to avoid the necessity to import butter, even to maintain the present subsidised ration. Tea supplies are reasonably good and enough sugar has been purchased to give adequate stocks.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the Industrial Development Authority and industrial development matters generally.  The House is very familiar with the attitude I took when the Bill for the establishment of the authority was under consideration by the Dáil. I was opposed to its establishment.  I have always recognised, however, that there would be some advantage in having a body outside the Civil Service, with powers and resources to promote the creation here of new industries. By new industries I mean industries of a kind that do not exist now or are not likely to be brought into being by private initiative.  When the Industrial Credit Corporation was set up in 1933, it was intended that it would fulfil that function.  For a variety of reasons which I need not recount, the Industrial Credit Corporation did not quite fulfil the expectations which were entertained in 1933.  It may still be decided to proceed along those general lines, perhaps through some combination <Col N="1515" /> of the Industrial Credit Corporation and this statutory Industrial Development Authority.  In the meantime, this authority exists and I propose to use it.  It will, however, in future confine itself mainly to this activity of promoting new industries.  I have discussed the matter on more than one occasion with the chairman of the authority and have arranged with him as to its method of working.</P>
    <P>Up to recently, the authority has not been able to do much in that field. Only in the past three months did it get itself organised for that purpose and secure the staff necessary for it. In the period previous to that, the industrial propositions with which it dealt were mainly those which originated with private promoters, the normal type of industrial proposition which was previously handled in the trade and industry branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce. Even in that field, it was handicapped, in my view, by having passed over to it a great volume of administrative work which was previously the concern of the Department.  I do not want the House to think that the change I am suggesting will involve any fundamental reorganisation.  That administrative work was handled by the same staff, sitting in the same offices as previously, the only difference being that when ministerial action was required the matter reached the Minister through the Industrial Development Authority instead of direct from his own offices.  In future, the position will be this: The Department of Industry and Commerce will handle all these administrative matters&mdash;the fixation of import quotas, any adjustment of tariffs that may be required, export and import licences, and so forth.  It will also handle industrial proposals originating outside the Department, originating amongst private interests, and the development of existing industries generally.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority's main work will be in relation to new industries, industries of a kind that do not exist here now, where some special action may be required in order <Col N="1516" /> to bring into being a proposition for the establishment of these industries. They will work on the basis of a priority list, which I will decide, upon their recommendation.</P>

The original idea when the Industrial Credit Company was set up was that it would do this pioneering work and bring proposals to the actual state of launching, as they would not merely plan but finance them.  The Industrial Development Authority will bring the projects to the stage when a plan for the establishment of new industry exists and personnel to fulfil the plan is available. Then there will have to be an examination of the method of financing the enterprise.  That may mean either special measures, perhaps even special legislation in some cases, or an arrangement with the Industrial Credit Company.  It is because that difficulty will exist in completing these projects that I have in mind the examination of the possibility of linking the work of the Industrial Development Authority and the Industrial Credit Company in a more formal way.</P>

      <P>With regard to the personnel the House may have noticed that one member, Mr. McCourt, has resigned, because he is going into private business. He has been pressing to be allowed to resign for some time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Turning to electricity, we have at the present time the rather unpleasant necessity of having to enforce the rationing of electricity.  The main reason why it is necessary to enforce rationing of electricity is because the demand for current has outpaced the Electricity Supply Board programme for creating new generating capacity.  It is true that there was an extra spurt this year due to scarcity and cost of fuel leading to greater consumption of electricity for space heating purposes.  Essentially, however, the need for rationing arises out of the fact that the board's plans for creating new generating capacity were not large enough and were not proceeding rapidly enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> It is my view that the Electricity Supply Board has always been too conservative in planning for development. I pressed that view upon them in 1943, when the post-war generating programme was being prepared.  I am aware that in my successor's time a similar view was pressed upon them. Apart altogether from the inadequacy of the board's generating programme, I must say that I was disappointed&mdash; perhaps that is too mild&mdash;I was disgusted to learn of the form which the board's generating programme has taken.  When I was Minister previously, I laid down as policy that all future electrical development would be based entirely upon native resources, either upon turf fuel or water power.  When I left office in 1947, there were four new generating stations then on the board's programme, the Erne hydro-electric scheme which is now in partial operation and will be in fuller operation, though not full operation, next year; the Allenwood turf-burning station which was first proposed and approved in 1946 and which, I hope, will be in operation next year.  There was the Lee hydro-electric development scheme in respect of which it was originally hoped that there would be a partial development by next year.  The position is that, while the plans for the station have been completed, the contract for the constructional work has not yet been placed.  It may be placed in the near future.  There was another turf-burning station to be located at Ferbane.  That was also proposed in 1946.  It is just not possible to say when its construction will be completed.  The only new stations which have been added to the board's programme since then are two coal or oil-burning stations, one to be located at Dublin and one at Cork.  These are not minor stations.  They are intended to be quite large stations, each of them of 60,000 kilowatt capacity.  The small station which was sanctioned for the North Wall in Dublin to utilise the boiler house which was built for the refinery before that project was abandoned is also being enlarged from 12,500 kilowatt capacity to 42,000 kilowatt capacity.</P>
    <P>I want to express here a complete <Col N="1520" /> disagreement with that programme. Unfortunately, however, nothing much can be done about it now.  If I could I would reverse it.  I find that plans for these projects have been developed and equipment has been ordered.  If we were to try to reverse the position and have this electrical development based on native resources then we would be delaying the creation of the additional capacity of which we are in urgent need and we would be impeding industrial development at the same time.  I have come to that conclusion with the utmost reluctance.  This programme of the Electricity Supply Board to increase capacity based upon imported fuels means not merely a permanent loss to the nation, a loss of employment possibilities amounting to several thousand workers but also an expansion of our needs for imports of fuel in the future. I know that the board has never been enthusiastic about the development of our native resources and because of that I think they must be held to have failed in their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I know that the board could not have embarked upon that programme without the concurrence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I want, however, to be quite fair to him because all the indications on the departmental record show that he was as vigorous as I had been in pressing upon the board the necessity of planning their development upon the basis of native resources. In effect, they put him in the position that I am in now that he had little option but to accept the board's proposals for these stations when they reached him because they offered a prospect of a speedier development in generating capacity than could otherwise be obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a good case for having the board made responsible to this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Originally it was suggested to me by the board that a small coal-burning station should be erected at Cork.  That idea was approved by me upon the understanding that it was solely for standby purposes and for ensuring security of supply in Cork in the case of a breakdown in the main transmitting system. <Col N="1521" /> On the 23rd July, 1948, the board proposed to my successor that he should seek the transfer of that station from Cork to Dublin and gave as their justification for that the projected development of the River Lee.  As I have mentioned, the River Lee project is not yet at the stage at which contracts for the construction work can be placed.  That original Cork station was, however, intended to be only a small development, and when it was transferred to Dublin it was proposed not merely to install it there on the basis of a 30,000 kilowatt capacity but subsequently, in 1949, to double its size. Then having got approval for that, the board went back to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and again proposed the establishment of a steam-burning station at Cork and instead of a standby station, a station of similar size of 60,000 kilowatt capacity is being erected at Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Deputy will not take me as being prejudiced against Cork, but I do not approve of basing our electrical development on imported fuel when native resources can successfully be used.  It was subsequently proposed to increase the capacity of the North Wall station from 12,500 to 42,500 kilowatts.  It was again justified on the grounds that, in view of the need for increased capacity, this was the quickest way of getting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Each proposal had to receive the approval of the Minister and did, in fact, receive it.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with general policy and I want it to be known that, as far as I am concerned, all future electrical development will be based on turf and water power and I hope that in the course of this debate approval of that policy will be expressed by all Parties so that it will become not a Party policy but a national one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly disagree with the policy of centralising electricity generating capacity in our large towns.  From the <Col N="1522" /> point of view of security it seems to me to be madness to have a very large part of the nation's electricity generating capacity concentrated in one limited area at the Port of Dublin, and apart altogether from the security aspect there are social and economic advantages in pushing these developments around the country.  It may cost a little more in respect of transmission but there are compensatory advantages which are in my view far more important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he found himself in the position that he was asked to approve of these proposals on the grounds that they represented the speediest method of increasing generating capacity.  Clearly, responsibility for putting the Minister in that position rests with the board.  If they had been planning their development on the basis of the policy laid down far enough ahead the Minister would never have had to have regard to the speed with which generating capacity could be developed but could have concentrated on the most desirable type of development for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board's costs have risen considerably this year mainly owing to the high price of coal.  That has necessitated the higher prices recently announced.  It is very unsatisfactory from the point of view of the consumer that an increase in prices has been announced at the same time as he <Col N="1523" /> is being rationed.  It is quite unfair to him.  The only thing I can do is to try to get him out of that position as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The present programme for expanding generating capacity in relation to the estimates of the increase in the consumption of current would suggest that when the Erne comes into full production and the Allenwood station is also in production the supply will be in excess of demand and will remain so until 1954.  The position we are in at present may be repeated in 1954 if the expansion of demand is in the order now estimated.  As Deputies know, it takes a long time to get a new electricity generating station off the drawing board in an office into production and that is particularly true at the present time when orders for generating equipment are only with difficulty placed abroad.</P>
      <P>I should like to say also that I have always held the view that the Electricity Supply Board, as one of the largest commercial concerns in the country, should utilise its economic power as a purchaser of supplies to assist the development of Irish industries. I have in the past laid down that general policy for them, and again I must report that the board's attitude in that regard has been unsatisfactory. I think there is no reason why we should not now be at the stage where a large part of the equipment for the transmission and consumption of electricity could be manufactured in the country.  We could do it as well as any other country can do it for us, and the one essential stimulus required is the enthusiastic co-operation of the Electricity Supply Board in the fulfilment of that policy.</P>

    <P>One other matter to which I think I should refer is the position regarding the E.C.A.  Deputies are aware that Marshall Aid to this country has ceased, but the termination of Marshall Aid has not finished the activities of E.C.A. in Ireland.  The E.C.A. mission is remaining here, first of all to <Col N="1524" /> supervise various technical assistance projects; secondly, to arrange for the utilisation of the grant counterpart fund, and thirdly, to deal with certain temporary difficulties which may result from the United States export restrictions occasioned by rearmament.</P>
    <P>A large number of technical assistance projects were recently approved and these projects are mainly of industrial significance; that is to say, that they provide for the service of technicians directing their expert knowledge to the solution of specific industrial problems.  For reasons of which some Deputies opposite may be aware agriculture does not figure very largely on the list.  Not so many agricultural projects were included as might have been expected.</P>
    <P>Some technical assistance reports have been received.  There is one upon tourism, in which incidentally it may be well to note the American authorities have begun to lose interest.  That is being published in conjunction with certain other reports prepared by Irish parties which visited the United States and will be available to Deputies in the near future.  Another technical assistance report which I have read relates to specific mineral investigations and it appears to me to be unsuitable for publication at present because obviously considerable further inquiry will be necessary.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I think I should avail of this opportunity to express praise of the unremitting labours of the E.C.A. team in Ireland.  They have faced their tasks here with surprising energy and with an enthusiasm which is all the more commendable because it has survived many disappointments and difficulties.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I propose to utilise their services to the utmost and to extract the maximum benefit to this country from the aid which they are in a position to furnish.  The technical knowledge which they are in a position to make available, when applied to the economic development of this country, cannot but produce worth-while results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House knows, there is an industrial survey proceeding under E.C.A. arrangements at the present time. <Col N="1525" /> That survey is in its first stage.  It is contemplated that when this preliminary part of it has been completed reports will be prepared and, based upon these reports, a more specific survey will then be undertaken directed towards the developments which appear from the preliminary report most likely to be practicable.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters that I should like to refer to but I do not propose to occupy any more of the limited time for the debate.  As the House no doubt knows, there will be certain difficulties in securing rapid industrial progress at the present time due to scarcities of materials and the cost of plant and equipment.  Nevertheless, I think that considerable development is now proceeding and that, with the necessary support from the Government, it will be accelerated.  I intend to have prepared soon proposals for stimulating and facilitating industrial development in western areas, in accordance with the general policy of the Government.  These proposals will be prepared in consultation with the new organisation which is being set up under the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government.  I am sure that most Deputies will agree that there are economic as well as social advantages to be secured by the policy of industrial decentralisation and particularly in pushing development away from the East, against the natural tendency to locate it there.  It is also obvious that the methods that we used in the past to secure that result were inadequate and that they will have to be supplemented by new methods.  It is to that end that these proposals will be directed.</P>
    <P>Deputies may expect me to make some reference to the position regarding coal.  I am deliberately omitting to do so because there is a question on the Order Paper to-day in reply to which I propose to make a full statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed with portions of the Minister's statement but I found myself in agreement with a great amount of what he has said here to-day.  I must necessarily be brief in my remarks now and I think the Minister found himself <Col N="1526" /> very much restricted by the time and that he was not able to cover as fully as he would like to cover in normal times the multiplicity of activity in the various sections of his Department.</P>
      <P>In the first place, I was rather disappointed at what I thought was the unreasonably pessimistic outlook of the Minister with regard to the future trend of events, particularly in connection with supplies and prices.  I may be completely wrong.  I have my opinion and the Minister has his opinion.  My opinion is that we have passed the peak point of high prices, that the world horizon appears to be clearer than it was and that there is substantially more reason to hope at the moment, particularly within the last month, for brighter times ahead than a person might be entitled to hope, say, some time ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister's brief outline of policy appears to be based on the opinion that he is placing before the House that things are going to get worse, that supplies are going to get scarce and that the upward trend is going to continue. It may be a bit early for any of us to form anything like a hard opinion in that direction but certainly I think that it is too early to insist that policy has to be moulded on the assumption that things are going to get worse instead of better.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed at the Minister's announced determination to limit so drastically the functions and activities and powers of the Industrial Development Authority.  Even though the Minister was in his present Department for a considerable number of years in the past, and in very many directions showed thoroughly sound judgment and never gave very much evidence of making up his mind hastily or without considering the situation comprehensively, I am disappointed that, after only three weeks back in the position&mdash;before he is by any manner of means in a position to evaluate properly the work and importance of the Industrial Development Authority &mdash;he has made up his mind to curb drastically the functions of that particular body, to limit its operations and to throw it back inside the departmental umbrella.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy misunderstands me.  I do not regard this as curbing the Industrial Development Authority.  I am thinking rather of releasing it from work that can be done just as well in the Department, so that it can concentrate on what was originally intended to be its main job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an opinion. I think that opinion was arrived at too hastily.  There may be far better men inside the Department, and unquestionably there are in that Department outstanding experts and knowledgeable men in very many fields of the life of this country.  I say that without reserve or question.  But the Minister should know as well as I do that the Civil Service machine and Civil Service procedure is a procedure limiting activities and delaying work.  There is a whole chain of command.  The Minister must know as well as I do that work can be done more speedily outside the brakes and checks and inhibitions of a Civil Service Department.</P>
      <P>From my experience as a member of the Government and from my short experience as Minister in the Department of Industry and Commerce I regard that particular body as being of immense importance.  I suggest to the Minister that if his mind is running in the direction of alteration with regard to the functions or the activities or the powers of that particular body, he should go slowly rather than speedily in carrying out changes.  It may be that his mind will change.  It may be that it will not change.  But if he has to make these alterations I would rather feel that they were made after a full study of and not merely after a cursory glance over the position.  On the whole, I am pleased that the Minister does not feel enmeshed or entangled in any previous statements made by him at the time of the inauguration of that particular authority. He has shown himself big enough to trample down any statements that were made, possibly hastily since few of us are in our most responsible frame of mind when we are in the perpendicular and statements are often made when we are on our feet that we would not make in a more leisurely atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> With regard to prices and the Prices Advisory Body, there again it appears to be the Minister's intention, not immediately but within the reasonably near future, to wind up the activities of this body.  One reason advanced for that is that there may not be a continuing necessity for the fixation of prices.  Another is that it is duplicating the work to some extent of the Department.  There is a certain amount of truth in both those statements. There is a certain duplication.  But if prices are to be fixed by the Minister, and I think that for some considerable time ahead prices of certain lines at any rate will have to be fixed, it is better to have these prices fixed with the maximum degree of public confidence in the fixation machine.</P>
    <P>As long as the public have an opportunity of raising price questions that are in their minds and raising them with the right in certain circumstances to have their case heard in the open, there will be more general confidence in and a more general acceptance of the prices fixed, particularly if those prices are increased prices, rather than if the work is done behind the closed door of a Civil Service Department.</P>
    <P>I believe the work of price fixing was always done honestly and by people with expert knowledge, but the mere fact of having an outside tribunal before which people can make their case or appeal has a beneficial effect. The psychological effect on the public mind is important and I personally would thoroughly dislike, if I were operating as Minister, fixing prices on the advice purely of a closed section inside my own Department.  I would much prefer to be able to refer the matter in the first instance to a public tribunal, balanced on one side by representatives of the consumers and on the other side by people with a knowledge of business, a knowledge of accounts and a knowledge of costs, operating under the chairmanship of a judge of the Supreme Court, very well known for his impartiality and the keenness and agility of his brain.  I think it is unwise to get rid of a body such as that.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I never regarded my function <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Prices Advisory Body as <Col N="1529" /> simply a standing function.  I did not believe that the Minister's only function was to take the recommendations, sign them and put them through. Neither do I believe the present Minister would accept that situation.  But in his very, very early days back in office by a statement of his in relation to my activities, or implied activities, he seemed to insinuate that that was part of my function and that I was not carrying it out.  His charge was that there was a stack of recommendations on the table when he came into office, recommendations with regard to price increases which I had not put through.</P>
    <P>One of his colleagues translated that rather freely, and in public statements throughout the country asserted that there were stacks of orders lying on the table waiting for my unfortunate successor.  Now a recommendation is not an order until it is signed.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce I took it that, in respect of the advisory body and in respect of the prices section of my Department there was in the world in which we are living a tendency for commodities to get dearer and dearer day after day, and there was, therefore, a big and important responsibility resting on the shoulders of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to prices, particularly in relation to prices that immediately and peculiarly affect the domestic cost of living.  If the advisory bodies or boards were multiplied, and the prices section increased, I would still feel there was a very grave responsibility on me to go through all the recommendations, and be thoroughly and conscientiously satisfied that every fraction of a farthing increase on items for domestic consumption was justified and that, without being thoroughly and conscientiously convinced, I could not put my signature to recommendations increasing the prices of certain commodities.</P>
    <P>I had a number of such recommendations on my table, but I had none on my table that were deliberately left for the person who would come after me.  There were recommendations for increased prices on my table, some of them severe, some of them affecting the poorest homes in the country rather than the wealthy homes.  I was <Col N="1530" /> considering these recommendations fully.  I was not prepared to be stampeded into putting them through in full.  I was seeing if they could not be modified, and I am pleased to say that those recommendations are still on the table despite the fact that the present Minister has been in office four weeks.  They were on my table for some six or seven before that.  If I was guilty of culpable inactivity in not putting them through they could have been put through the day after my successor took over.  I am sufficiently charitable to say that the reason why they were not put through is because they are still being examined and investigated, and the present Minister is not going to put through those increases recklessly or hastily.</P>
    <P>There was one of significance, of major importance that is still there, and that was with regard to meat. That is one that has been there for the greatest length of time, so far as my memory serves me.  When that recommendation came in to me, practically coincident with it came an application to have the controlled price of hides removed and to allow hides to go to the open world market price. Obviously if hides were to go to the world market price, taking the average weight of a hide as being about 60 lbs., that would put £5 or £6 on the value of every beast.  If that were to be done, there would be no case whatever for increasing the price of beef by anything; in fact there would be a case to be considered for reducing the price of beef.  These two, the recommendation and the application, were as I say, practically coincident. My idea was, could one be granted without the other?  I was thinking of the dinner table in every home.  I was informed, to my surprise, that the granting of the hide application would bring about such an increase in the price of boots and shoes that practically every factory of that kind in the country would close down.  I was not prepared to accept right away the figures given to me verbally as to the immensity of the increase.  I asked to have that looked into and put up formally in a memo with the whole set-up of the build-up of the figure that was given to me.  There was still a <Col N="1531" /> possibility of marrying the two proposals so as to make the increased price of beef recommended not such an imposition as the original recommendation. That was the cause of the delay there and I do not believe that either the present Minister or any Deputy would suggest for one moment that it was not a sound reason for the delay.</P>
    <P>There was another reason too.  Once the price is fixed, the fixed price holds for a long time and I did not think that the price of meat should be fixed on figures obtained at a period of the year when there were no grass-fed beef cattle.  If the price of meat had been fixed six or eight weeks ago it would have been fixed at the peak point of the beef market.  My mind was running on either having two periods such as obtained in the case of milk or waiting to let the application be considered again when grass-fed cattle came in.  As the Minister is aware, this year grass was late and grass-fed cattle came on the market later in the year but I have no apology to make with regard to any of these delays&mdash;none whatever.  The delays were due to a weighing-up of the factors and the reactions of increased prices.  As I say, one of the greatest importance that was there is still there and I hope and believe that the same kind of attention is being given to it since I left as was given to it before I left.</P>
    <P>There may have been other causes for the delay.  As Deputies are aware, for some weeks before I left office we were all engaged in the general election. My constituency happens to be at the far end of the country and for the three weeks naturally I could not give the same amount of time to the Department as normally.  There may have been some other small things which came in during that period, like the recommendation in regard to peas and beans but there was no deliberate hold-up or delay on anything.  If I were back there, and a recommendation or a group of recommendations came from the advisory body, they would not be speedily signed by me.  They are the body to make recommendations and they make them honestly.  I believe <Col N="1532" /> they make them impartially; there is a balancing as between the consumer and the seller in every single case but it was never conceived that their recommendation would be final or would be binding. With regard to the body itself, I think the Minister will share with me the view that they have done their work in an exemplary manner.  I would ask the Minister to consider very carefully and lengthily before he comes to any decision to wind up or terminate the activities of that particular body.  So long as he or any other Minister has the responsibility for fixing prices, I think he will get more confidence from the public in the prices fixation machine so long as he keeps a body of that kind there and functioning.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's general statement as to the activities of the Electricity Supply Board and the rationing and price of electricity, on the whole, the case, so far as my knowledge of it goes, was presented fairly by the Minister.  I do think, at the same time, that he was unduly severe on that board.  There may be explanations with regard to the delay in providing more generating stations. I think every Minister who took up office, since he was previously in office, came up against the same problem.  I share the Minister's views that, as late in the day as this it is rather hard on the public to have to face a rationing of supplies of electricity in this country.  In fact, I felt that to an extent it could be regarded as a breach of contract for the board to canvass people to take more and more electricity, particularly people who take it on the valuation basis, which implies unlimited electricity at a cheaper rate, provided they pay a fixed sum whether they are using electricity or not and even if their premises are closed up. I always felt there was something very near a breach of contract when rationing came down on people who had their electricity under such a type of contract.  That rationing was necessary because there were not sufficient generating plants, but I suppose you have to go back to the past to get an explanation of that.  One of the reasons why, in certain cases, fuel other than native fuel was brought into <Col N="1533" /> the programme was to meet that particular situation, to try to get generating plant functioning more quickly.  I do not think the Minister, in making his statement, made sufficient allowance for that side of the question.  He was very fair to his predecessors in office, but I think the same jam as his predecessors found themselves in when they had to approve of those plants probably operated with the board too.  They were thinking of how speedily they could get the thing done.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in which I differ very much from both the Minister and the Electricity Supply Board, and that is the increased price of electricity. This application for an increase of approximately one-third of a penny per unit of electricity used came to me, I think, very shortly before I went out of office.  The application was to have the increase sanctioned by the next accountancy period which, I believe, was about five days ahead of that time. Naturally I did not allow myself to be rushed into such a grave decision.  I felt that there were other avenues to be explored before that one-third of a penny was placed on every unit of electricity consumed.  The report of the Electricity Supply Board for the period ended 31st March last is not yet available. The Electricity Supply Board is a board that has operated financially on the very soundest lines from the beginning, lines that nowadays some people might consider too conservative, too strictly orthodox.  They cannot make profits in the usual way of distributing to shareholders and others. That board has been managed in such a way that, according to the last report published, what would be profits in another company were shown at about £250,000.  I consider that, in the year gone by, that paper profit would show three times that amount in the way of an increase; in other words, a reserve of in or about £750,000.  I did feel that some of that could be directed towards alleviation of the public burden as a result of the increased cost of fuel rather than that the whole lot of it should be put on the consumer in the immediate year in which the increase occurred.  Another course to pursue was for the Minister <Col N="1534" /> and the board to make up their mind whether this dear fuel was only the result of a passing emergency situation. If the vastly increased fuel bill was only a temporary phenomenon, then the cost might be staggered over a number of years, so that the whole extra cost should not be borne by the consumer in the one year.</P>
    <P>I do not think either of these courses is necessarily or obviously the right course or the most desirable course but they were undoubtedly matters to be explored before the full brunt of the increased costs was placed on the consumer.  The Minister is aware that there is very general dissatisfaction and discontent with the electricity supply position.  Rationing came down without any notice as far as the public were concerned and then there are the increased costs.  Even in a house with the most modest consumption of electricity, particularly if electricity is used for any other purpose than light, I would reckon that this increased cost of a penny for every three units used will be a matter of 1/6 or 2/- a week on the household over the year.  The increase of 2d. per lb. on butter or any of those other increases that people get excited about fade into insignificance compared with this increased charge for electricity.  At this stage, I would urge on the Minister to take up with the board, before the next accountancy year, the question of altering the increased price of electricity, or else staggering or relaying it over a more lengthy period.  Above all, I think that the board should be asked to share the burden between their accumulated reserves and the imposition on the community.  It may be that neither of these suggestions would be feasible, but I would like to feel that every expedient was tried before such a very heavy imposition on the public was resorted to.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there is a growing tendency, and one which we should welcome, on the part of occupiers of new or recently-built houses to go in more and more for electricity. Being aware of such a trend, we should hesitate very much before introducing such a really drastic increase in its price.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to see that the <Col N="1535" /> Minister, in spite of the many speeches made by politicians, has come to the conclusion that the policy of having off-ration sale of rationed commodities at a high price is a sound one, in the public interest.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to stick the Minister.  He will always unstick himself by words.  You are not stuck with anything.  If it is a bad policy, all power is in your hands to remedy the situation.  Do not have it said about you, as a new Government, that you stood over something that you believed to be wrong.  That would be the most damaging statement that could be made against a Government. You may quibble, and you may throw phrases around but, if you continue to stand over the policy, the only explanation is that you consider it to be sound and good.  If you do not consider it sound, change it and do not produce the Minister for Finance as your alibi. If your only reason for not altering the position is that it would cost too much, remember that it would have cost your predecessor just as much, and if your predecessor was a worthy target for denunciation, then you, in the line of succession, are an equally worthy one. The Dick Turpin policy in such matters is sound and wise.  Rationing in this country is not mean rationing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rationing in this country is a generous ration.  The bread ration, the tea ration, the sugar ration, are reasonably generous rations.  The subsidy cost is high and, if the subsidy is to continue to be paid to provide these essential commodities to our people at a reasonably low price, then let those with too much money buy more in excess of the rationing and pay for it through the trousers pocket so as to keep, in spite of the rising world price for tea, the ration of tea at the old-time price.  That is a sound policy.  No matter how it may have been criticised from public platforms for the purpose of political expediency, every one of us knew that, if the Government changed, the policy in that direction would not change, and I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues in the Government on being able to live down their own <Col N="1536" /> hectic, reckless and irresponsible political propaganda of the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The time available for the discussion of the Estimate is not as long as it normally would be.  Therefore I do not propose to travel over the ground covered by the Minister to-day.  There are, however, some aspects of his policy to which I should like to make reference and I will pick just the more important.  The Minister mentioned that negotiations were proceeding with the Northern Government regarding the acquisition of the Great Northern Railway line.  When the Minister is engaged in these negotiations I hope he will follow the line set by his predecessors, because I think any other line would be one calculated to do considerable damage to the Great Northern transport system and to the national interests as well.</P>
      <P>We took the view that the Great Northern Railway line was one line and we suggested to the Northern Government that the way to deal with the problem of the Great Northern Railway line was to integrate it in a national transport authority, in other words, to have one railway authority for the whole country.  We said to the Six-County Government: &ldquo;We are Twenty-Six Counties, you are Six Counties.  We will take over the Great Northern Railway line and we will integrate it with Córas Iompair Éireann and run the entire railway services of the country on the basis of public ownership.  We will put up two representatives, you can put up two representatives, and we can find an independent chairman.  We will let that national transport authority run the entire transport services of the country.  If there is a dividend to come or a surplus to be yielded, well and good, we will share it.  If there is a loss to be made good, we will make good the loss on any agreed basis, on a territorial basis, on a population basis, on a railway mileage basis, on a track basis or any other basis an independent arbitrator suggests.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our northern friends were not prepared to agree to the establishment in Ireland of a national transport authority.  We were then set the proposition as to what was to happen <Col N="1537" /> the Great Northern Railway in its rapidly deteriorating financial position. We said: &ldquo;If you will not agree to work in with a national transport authority which will run the transport services of the entire country as a single unit, we are prepared to agree to purchase the Great Northern Railway jointly and to operate it as a going concern under a united company.&rdquo; We contemplated running it in this way: that we would appoint two directors to a board, that the Northern Government would do the same, and that there could be an independent or rotating chairman; and in that way the Great Northern Railway would continue to function as a single unit.  We were hoping at the same time that, in the light of experience and with developing friendship, it would be possible ultimately to integrate the Great Northern Railway into a single Irish transport authority.</P>
    <P>That was the stage in which we left the position.  The Northern Government said that they did not think taking over the Great Northern Railway as a single undertaking to be operated jointly by both Governments was something which commended itself to them.  At the last stage at which we saw the correspondence the position was that the Northern Government wanted to do with the Great Northern Railway what they had succeeded in doing with the country&mdash;they wanted to partition the Great Northern Railway line; they wanted to acquire and to run their portion, regarding it as their own territorial asset, and the suggestion was that we might do the same with the Twenty-Six County portion of the line.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister in no circumstances to consent to the partition of the Great Northern Railway line.  I urge him not to do that voluntarily, but to insist that if the Great Northern Railway line is to be taken over by both Governments it will be taken over as a unit, as a single undertaking operated jointly by both Governments; that both Governments will meet whatever losses are involved, as we have got to meet whatever losses are involved in Córas Iompair Éireann.  Any proposal brought to this House to consent <Col N="1538" /> to the partition of the Great Northern Railway line, if that is a voluntary act on the part of any Government here, is a proposal which should not get the support of this House.</P>
    <P>When I was concerned in the ultimate course of these negotiations, I always took the view that it would be wrong economically from a transport point of view and wrong nationally that a Government here should voluntarily enter into negotiations and agreement on the basis of dividing the Great Northern Railway line.  Nobody can take the Twenty-Six County portion of the Great Northern Railway line out of this part of Ireland.  Nobody can close it, because we can easily prevent anybody from moving a single screw out of the Great Northern Railway line in our portion of that territory.  In the long run, if people elsewhere in Ireland want to close the Great Northern Railway line we can make sure by our powers here that it will function at least to the Border; that the livelihoods of the people employed in the Great Northern Railway on this side of the Border will be safeguarded, and that provision will be made for the transport of passengers and freight within our own territory.  At least all that can be preserved for us.  We ought not to do that voluntarily.  If the other people want to partition the Great Northern Railway line, the shareholders should be told that it is they who want to partition it; the shareholders should be told that partitioning the line will be ruinous to the shareholders, and the country generally ought to know that we do not desire to have any responsibility whatever for capping the partition of the nation with the partition of the cross-border transport services of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Store Street project.  I do not want to discuss <Col N="1539" /> that matter in any acrimonious way except to say this, and even this will not be acrimonious: the Store Street project, or the Store Street monster as I prefer to call it, something worse than the Loch Ness monster, came on the market in 1949, I think it was, in this way: Córas Iompair Éireann could not pay their debts at that time.  The facts will show that at that time they were writing cheques to people to whom they owed money but they were not putting the cheque in an envelope and sending it out; they were putting it back in the safe and saying: &ldquo;This has got to stay there until we get some means at the bank to get that cheque honoured.&rdquo;  It was in those circumstances that Córas Iompair Éireann decided that they would have to abandon the Store Street project. Let me say this, and the facts can be confirmed by reference to records in the office, at the time they were building Store Street and entering into a £1,000,000 commitment, they could not pay the rates or rent on the Kingsbridge premises.</P>

I offer a challenge to the Minister to set up a commission of inquiry, a committee of this House or a commission of any kind mutually acceptable to inquire into the financial position of Córas Iompair Éireann at the time they entered into the commitment to build Store Street, and while Store Street was a building and, if you like, you can add to that the financial position at the time they contemplated building the £1,000,000 hotel at Glengarriff. I say now&mdash;and I ask that tribunal, if the Minister will accept my challenge, to investigate my charge&mdash; that Córas Iompair Éireann could not pay its way when it was building the Store Street premises.  During one of the periods when we were in the Government, earlier on, Córas Iompair Éireann came to us and said they had <Col N="1540" /> no money to pay the wages of the staff, and that we would have to give them an imprest to pay the wages to the staff.  That was shortly after we took over, and this was the body that was building the £1,000,000 monster in Store Street.  These are facts.</P>

      <P>You can have that. When they have finished the first job set them on to the next one.  I have no doubt about that.  That was the financial position on which the Store Street building started.  Córas Iompair Éireann decided to abandon Store Street, and it was only when they decided to abandon Store Street that the Government decided that they would buy Store Street for the purpose of accommodating the Department of Social Welfare whose departments are flung over 13 separate buildings in Dublin.  Córas Iompair Éireann need never have abandoned Store Street.  Nobody asked them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want to mix this thing and to get rough, we can do it. I want to keep this on a normal level plane.  Córas Iompair Éireann need never have abandoned Store Street. Nobody asked them to abandon Store Street.  I never coveted Store Street on them.  The Government never coveted Store Street.  Córas Iompair Éireann said: &ldquo;The game is up.  This financial spree is too costly.  We cannot pay for Store Street.&rdquo;  They said that they had abandoned Store Street project if anybody would buy it from them.  The Government decided to buy it only when the project was abandoned, when Córas Iompair Éireann realised that they could not complete the building, because they had not got a bob, much less the other £750,000 that was necessary to pay for the building, nor could they raise a bob because the prospect of raising money for Córas Iompair Éireann was touted here and touted even in London and they could not get money for Córas Iompair Éireann.  It was under those circumstances that Córas Iompair Éireann abandoned Store Street.  It was only when it was abandoned that the Government decided to buy it for the purpose of accommodating the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I say now to Córas Iompair Éireann, to the present board and the previous board, that if they had had the money, they could have completed Store Street.  They decided to abandon it and it was only when it was abandoned that the Government decided to buy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens that monster I personally do not care in the slightest except, I think, I should say this: I do not see any necessity for this mania for a central bus depot in Dublin.  I do not think it is necessary to have a central bus depot in Dublin.  I think you can get the same effect by having a few bus depots in Dublin.  To build a central bus depot in a portion of the city which already is cluttered with traffic, that has more traffic than any other portion of the city, where efforts are being made to relieve congestion by erecting more bridges across the <Col N="1542" /> Liffey, seems to me to be nothing short of a piece of transport daftness.  If there are to be bus depots built in the city, there are alternatives to Store Street.  There is a site lying up near the Kingsbridge, the football field in front of Collins Barracks, and for the last 30 years I have been looking at that site and, beyond seeing a circus there occasionally or a carnival occasionally, you will never find more than about 12 fellows playing football in the field.  There is an ideal site. The State owns it.  There is adequate space available.  There would be no necessity for demolition of buildings or street widening.  A bus depot on that site beside the Kingsbridge, beside the Conyngham Road garage, will enable Córas Iompair Éireann to trap every bus that comes in from the South of Ireland and every bus that comes in from the Midlands and every bus that comes in from the North, with the result that, if you take the Collins Barracks football site, which is not used for football at all, as anybody acquainted with the city knows, it will provide a first-class bus depot on the fringe of the city for Southern buses, Midland buses and Northern buses.  It will avoid the necessity for these buses to go through town and over the busiest streets in town and avoid the necessity for travelling the narrow streets which approach the Store Street building.  It will keep all the provincial buses out of the most tangled areas in the city, from a transport point of view.  If anyone wants to discover whether there is accommodation for the South-Eastern buses, he can go out to Donnybrook, where he will see a most elaborate garage in course of completion which would easily provide accommodation for bus passengers going to or coming from the South-Eastern counties.  In both cases, whether it is from Collins Barracks or from Donnybrook, the long-distance bus passengers could easily be shuttled in on a local service to the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>If I had had responsibility some years ago, I imagine that these projects would have commended themselves to me, but Córas Iompair Éireann, of all places in this historic City of Dublin and of all places in the <Col N="1543" /> built-up areas of this city, selected the most tangled scheme of all in Store Street.  There they reared up the monster we see there to-day, at a time when, as I told the House, they could not pay either rates or rent for their modest premises at the Kingsbridge. If they had contemplated just a bus depot with accommodation for operational staff and a waiting-place for passengers it would not be so bad, but instead they built this skyscraper, this architect's dream, at Store Street which overshadows the most magnificent building we have in Dublin, the Custom House.  It was that built-up area, where transport is more difficult than in probably any other part of the city, they selected as the site for this Store Street premises.  Now, apparently, they are satisfied that the ground floor, and one other floor, will be sufficient for their requirements.  If they had been satisfied with that three, four or five years ago, the bus depot would have been up long ago, but the big minds of Córas Iompair Éireann did not want a two-storey building, they wanted a seven-storey building, an architect's dream.  One would not mind so much about that if they had millions of money which they wanted to invest, or if there was an abundance of building material available, or if they were trying to employ labour. But the position was that material was scarce and labour was scarce, and that money with Córas Iompair Éireann was more scare than either labour or material.</P>
    <P>However, they have now apparently modified their demands.  I want to say again that it is a bad site for a bus depot.  You are now going to get the worst of both worlds, a bus depot below with passengers waiting for buses, with friends coming to see their passengers off, with friends coming to welcome passengers in and with nearly 1,000 of a staff in the Department of Social Welfare located in the upper building.  In addition, you will have all the visitors who call every day in the week to the various sections of the Department of Social Welfare making inquiries about the various services which that Department <Col N="1544" /> administers.  They are all going to be catapulted into the Store Street region &mdash;bus passengers, friends seeing them off, friends coming to welcome passengers, Social Welfare staff, visitors and inquirers&mdash;into an area which, it is admitted by the Dublin Corporation, is already beset with a bad traffic problem. Probably, it is not the first mistake that Mother Ireland has made, but this, surely, is going to be a real headache for her in the course of time. That will be proved within one year of the building coming into use.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Industrial Development Authority.  He indicated that he was proposing to limit the functions of that body.  My conception of the authority, in the first instance, was that of a body charged with responsibility for developing new industries, and with responsibility for surveying what new industries the country required, as well as finding the technical competence and the &ldquo;knowhow&rdquo; in order to ensure that these industries would be started, that they would provide employment for our people and goods for the nation's requirements.  It was contemplated, too, that the authority should supervise the application of tariffs and quotas with a view to ensuring that those industries which are at present being aided by tariffs would utilise that aid to enable them to supply the entire requirements of the home market in the minimum period of time.</P>
    <P>I remember the attention of the authority being specially directed to a condition of affairs in which Irish industries, which were substantially protected, were supplying no more than from 30 to 40 per cent. of the home market.  They had not, over a long period of tariff protection, been able to supply more.  The authority was directed to get after these industries, to urge them to produce the entire requirements of the home market so as to make sure that they were not just sitting back, satisfied to do a certain amount of work under the protection of a tariff, but not prepared to go out whole-hog after the entire Irish market.</P>
    <P>These were its two main functions. I think it was a mistake to allow the <Col N="1545" /> authority to engage in such matters as the issuing of licences or the allocation of quotas.  That is a job for a body other than the Industrial Development Authority.  The main function of the authority, as we conceived it, was one which (1) would drive, and drive hard and relentlessly, to secure new industries and get technical competence for their efficient administration, and (2) ensure that the Irish manufacturer was encouraged to take the fullest possible advantage of protective tariffs by satisfying as soon as possible the entire requirements of the home market.  These two functions are sufficient for a body of that kind. If other functions are now being shed I do not personally regret it, so long as the two main functions are left, namely (1) the surveying of our industrial position to see what new industries can be established and the getting of technical competence to direct them and (2) to expand our existing industries in every possible way.  If the Minister directs the authority to concentrate on these two main issues, I make no complaint whatever about any shedding of other fripperies, so long as they are sacrificed to the two main purposes of getting new industries as quickly as we can and of expanding production and employment as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible to go too fast or too expeditiously in the matter of establishing new industries in this country.  That is particularly true of vast north-western and south-western areas where there are large pockets of unemployed people who suffer from a condition of life which can be described as permanent underemployment.  It is in those particular areas that the heaviest weight of our unemployment problem is, and, unless we are going to content ourselves with seeing these people drift to Britain, either permanently or as migrants, then we have got to face up to a situation in which no course of policy can be too radical to find employment for the people in these particular areas.  Up to the present, private enterprise, for a variety of reasons into which we need not now enter, has not been prepared to develop industries in these employment black spots, if I may so describe them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> It is quite clear that, unless the State takes a hand in the development of industries in these areas, they will remain in their present backward condition for another generation.  I, therefore, urge on the Minister to give the Industrial Development Authority sanction for a scheme whereby, on being satisfied that a new industry can be established and can be successfully maintained, the authority will have power to erect a factory and, if necessary, partially or wholly, to equip the factory, and then to lease or ultimately sell the finished factory to whatever group of enterprising people are willing to carry it on, but who may be handicapped because of initial financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that if a manufacturer or potential manufacturer has a chance of establishing an industry in Dublin, or in Mayo or Connemara, he will back the Dublin proposition every time, or that if he has a choice between Dublin and any other county, the tendency will be to back Dublin, where the pleasant social life and ease of access to commercial markets offer very obvious attractions.  If we are to tempt a manufacturer into these areas where industries are most needed, it can only be done by providing facilities in the way of factory premises and partial or full equipment for the factory, ultimately leasing it to a local group.  I believe that it is only in that way that we will be able to get these people to commence activities in these areas.  That may be costly.  It is quite unprecedented to pursue a policy of that kind here, but I think it is the only way in which we are going to get industries in these areas.  The alternative is to allow things to drift in their present unsatisfactory way for another generation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Electricity Supply Board and the establishment of certain coal and oil-burning stations.  I share the Minister's view that we should, so far as possible, establish electricity generating stations on the bogs and that the best way in which we can use turf is, not by long haulage to city grates which are unsuitable for the burning of turf, but by burning it on the bog and getting <Col N="1547" /> from it white fuel over the transmission wires.  Any proposal, therefore, to encourage the establishment of power stations on bogs would have my wholehearted approval.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is the best way to utilise our turf deposits, and I believe that it can provide, as in the case of Clonsast and Allenwood, substantial employment in areas where there is no other local employment either available, or, because of the character of the land, ever likely to be available, in agriculture.  I, therefore, welcome any proposition which concentrates the attention of the Electricity Supply Board on further development along the lines of the fullest utilisation of turf and the fullest resort to hydroelectric schemes of development. Through reliance on both methods of producing electricity, we render ourselves still more independent of imported fuel; we provide growing employment for our people in conditions which give it the highest labour content; and generally we help to enrich the whole national economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to support, too, on this question of the Electricity Supply Board, the suggestion made by Deputy O'Higgins.  It is true that the Electricity Supply Board has had to pay increased prices for coal which it purchased in the past 12 months and on which it has had to rely for some of its generating plants, but it is equally true that a good deal of the increased price of coal was due to the necessity for importing American coal at high prices and high freight charges.  One hopes that that is only a passing phase and that after a relatively short time, we can settle down to a situation in which we can buy coal from nearer sources and at a cheaper rate than American coal.  I do not think the Electricity Supply Board should have increased its charges with this almost indecent haste to deal with a situation which, to some extent, is passing, inasmuch as the Electricity Supply Board will not be required to continue to pay high prices for American coal for all time.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in so far as these charges are transitory and <Col N="1548" /> likely to decrease when the normal fuel supply position is restored, the Electricity Supply Board should be required to fund these extra charges and not clamp down the whole increase on consumers at present, clamping it on, too, at a time when the consumer is denied the full electrical facilities which the Electricity Supply Board contracted to supply to him when he installed electricity and electrical fittings in his house.  I see no reason why even by an easement of the interest charges which the State imposes on the Electricity Supply Board some combination could not be found whereby the weight of this charge on the consumer would be, if not completely obviated, at least substantially modified, and I ask the Minister especially to examine that question.</P>
    <P>I do not want to travel over the whole field of prices and price control, but I want to say that I am sorry to think that the Minister apparently contemplates dispensing with the Prices Advisory Body at the end of this year. That, apparently, is based on a belief that we will get back to a normal pattern of prices by the end of the year, even though it may be an abnormal pattern in relation to what we have previously been used to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent its being continued.  If the Minister looks at the papers on the subject, he will see that it was a question of setting up a tribunal and that, at the end of the year, its appointment could be continued.  I would ask the Minister to take no hasty decision in the matter, and I am sure that even political wisdom will suggest that to him as well.  The Prices Advisory Body got, I think, an unfair start in this way, that, facing a period of rising prices for raw materials and imports, it had many applications for increased prices submitted to it, and one then read in the papers that the price of a particular commodity had been increased by a certain amount on the recommendation of the Prices Tribunal. In the minds of thoughtless people, <Col N="1549" /> that was calculated to create the impression that the Prices Body was there for the purpose of authorising in an automatic way any increase in prices which any manufacturer or distributor might desire.</P>
      <P>The tribunal ought to have been allowed&mdash;and I suggested this myself&mdash; to issue with their recommendation a brief statement stating that the manufacturers of commodity &ldquo;X&rdquo; had sought an increase in price of so much per lb. from the tribunal; that the tribunal had investigated the matter; and, having done so, recommended an increase of so much per lb.  It could then be seen that this body, far from being a body which automatically sanctioned increases, had, in fact, succeeded in reducing the demand of the manufacturer or distributor to a proportion, and sometimes a very small proportion, of what that manufacturer or distributor first sought.</P>
      <P>The tribunal is the victim of its own environment.  It has not got its case over to the public, but if it could tell its own story it would be able to demonstrate the fact that, confronted with heavy demands for steep increases in prices, it avoided those demands and only conceded demands for substantially lesser percentage increases, and then only after the most thorough investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the tribunal should be told to do that immediately, namely, to get out with each increase an explanation of what was sought and what was finally recommended.  In that way, you will convince the public that the tribunal is serving a very valuable purpose. At all events, there is this overriding value attached to it, that the consumer is associated with it.  It provides for a public hearing of applications for increased prices and if it can secure the requisite publicity for all its applications which are dealt with in public, then at least you will keep the public informed of the elements and the factors which enter into the question of fixing prices.  You cannot overeducate the public in regard to price fixation or price regulation.  Some members of the public think that the purposes of a Prices Advisory Body or Prices Tribunal is to keep prices down. <Col N="1550" /> That may not be possible in a world in which raw materials and import prices are increasing, but a public to which price control is a new and complex problem must be educated in all the factors. I suggest, therefore, that even for the purpose of keeping the public informed and keeping a check over inordinate demands, the tribunal has more than justified itself and can still play a very valuable part in bringing the public to a proper understanding of all the elements concerned.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by urging the Minister not to allow any past prejudice against the Prices Tribunal, either in its personnel or because it was set up by his political opponents, to constitute a reason for capriciously disposing of the tribunal, now that he happens to be Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The abandonment of the tribunal by the Minister will, I think, have serious public repercussions and will create the opinion that the Minister is not concerned with the public examination of prices and the elements of price control.  I do not want to say that that represents the Minister's viewpoint, but I think he at least, for the other reason, should permit the tribunal to continue, as it has very valuable uses if it is properly utilised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased this morning to hear the Minister say that Córas Iompair Éireann had decided in April last to abandon the Smithfield site for a bus station.  To my mind, as a Dublinman, of all the places that could be got in the city, Smithfield was easily the worst, a death-trap; and I do not see how any sensible man could possibly have approved of it.  I was sorry to hear him say that we will not be able to get the Store Street bus station until May, 1952, at the earliest. I think it is a shame the way the bus-travelling people have been left to suffer from the elements during all the years that have elapsed since the end of the war.  Deputy Norton has raised here to-day again all the old arguments against the Store Street station.  He or any member of the inter-Party Government should be the last to say one word about a bus station, considering that during the whole three and a <Col N="1551" /> quarter years they were in office not one step of progress has been made towards either Store Street or any other bus station.  After all that period, when we were told that Smithfield was going to be made the site, when they had gone out of office the site had not even been acquired, much less the question of building a bus station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe Deputy Davin is not aware that a number of things connected with Córas Iompair Éireann were done during those years.  Various attempts were made to rectify the position of which he is personally aware. He knows very well, too, that there was a period from 1939 in which no attempt could be made to build any bus station. Immediately at the end of the war, an attempt was made.  Deputy Norton has just referred to the fact that, even when it was started, building materials were scarce.  It was started even then, whatever the views may be about the building itself, and no delay was made. But three and a quarter years have elasped in which there was no attempt of any sort to provide for the bus travelling public by the late Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton has criticised the Store Street site and trotted out all the old arguments about the traffic and the bridges.  Those who know Dublin know that whether the bus station goes in Store Street or not at least one new bridge will have to be built over the Liffey.  He did not tell us the route the buses were to take&mdash;that they would leave Store Street and proceed up Amiens Street, the second widest street in Dublin and on by the North Circular Road.</P>

I am informed by the board that they are in a position to provide any transport required by the Kerry County Council. Having regard to the financial difficulties of Córas Iompair Éireann and considerations of transport policy generally it would not be possible to contemplate granting merchandise licences to the large number of lorry owners who had been engaged in turf transport during the emergency.

It is very unfair that we in South Kerry must employ men from another county to work for the Kerry County Council and for other concerns.  Merchandise licences in my constituency are limited to a 12-mile radius from Tralee, whereas in Dublin they have a 25-mile radius.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether any talks have taken place with the British Government since the 13th June on the subject of the supply of coal to this country, and whether he will indicate the quantity of coal which will be made available to this country in the current and subsequent quarter of the year and the source of origin and price per ton of such coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Talks with the British Government on the subject of coal took place in London on 10th July, and in order to put the results of the discussions in proper perspective I should recall briefly what has happened about British coal supplies for the first half of 1951.</P>
      <P>The original allocations of solid fuel proposed for this country by the British Government for the first and second quarters amounted to 210,000 tons and 230,000 tons respectively.  These allocations were subsequently increased to 221,000 tons and 249,000 respectively by the bodies dealing with the international allocation of European coal (O.E.E.C. and E.C.E.).  Following on the March discussions with British Ministers, an additional allocation of 100,000 tons, covering the first half-year, was promised and this quantity was delivered in the second quarter. This brought the total allocation for the half-year to 570,000 tons, which was much less than half the minimum annual quantity of 1,570,000 tons guaranteed under the 1948 Trade Agreement.</P>
      <P>The object of the discussions on Tuesday last was to impress on the British Government our expectation that, before the end of the year, the balance of the quantity guaranteed in the trade agreement would be supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to have to report that the British Government held out no hope of being able to fulfil their obligation by supplying in 1951 the minimum quantity specified in the trade agreement of 1948.  They intimated that they would continue supplies for the rest of the year at the same rate as in the first <Col N="1557" /> half of the year, with a vague possibility of a slight improvement in the last quarter.  This means that the total supply of British coal and coke for 1951 will be of the order of 1,140,000 tons or little more than two-thirds of the minimum quantity guaranteed in 1948.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs and I conveyed to the British Ministers our complete dissatisfaction with their default on the most important obligation which they undertook in that agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to supplies from other sources, as I stated in reply to a question on the 4th July, coal supplies are allocated amongst European countries, including Ireland, on a quarterly basis by the Coal Committee of O.E.E.C. at Paris and the Economic Commission for Europe at Geneva.  Allocations for the third quarter of this year have not yet been fixed.  Arrangements have been made to import coal from the United States of America to whatever extent may be required, subject to shipping being available for its transportation, during the balance of the year.</P>
    <P>I cannot forecast the prices which may be charged for coal by foreign suppliers during the second half of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the attention of the British Government been directed to the fact that their default of 400,000 tons of coal under the 1948 agreement would be taking place, if it does ultimately transpire, against the background of their exports of coal to other countries with whom they have no treaty obligations at all and if so what rejoinder did they make?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it is a fact that coal is being used at the turf generating station of Portarlington; and, if so, whether it is the policy of the Government to burn coal at turf generating stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Coal has not so far been used for the generation of electricity at the Portarlington station.  It is certainly not the policy of the Government that coal should be used in generating stations designed to burn turf.  A proposal, however, for the use of coal because of the shortage of turf supplies was made by the Electricity <Col N="1559" /> Supply Board on the 18th May, 1951, and was brought to my notice when I returned to office on the 14th June, 1951.  Having considered the matter, I have informed the Electricity Supply Board that, having regard to their present difficulties due to insufficient generating capacity and the need to operate the Portarlington station to maximum capacity, I am prepared to assent to the use of coal temporarily to augment the available turf supplies. This authority has been given on the strict understanding that it will apply only for the present year and that any stock of coal accumulated at Portarlington will be limited to the quantity required to meet the shortage in the turf supplied for this year only. Arrangements are being made to supplement the stock-pile of turf at the station.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that while coal is being used at the power station in Portarlington quite a number of private turf producers cannot get a market?  Does he not consider that it is silly and ridiculous that coal should be burnt in a power station in the heart of a huge bog?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that a canvass by a local committee of the Laherdane area was carried out at the end of the year 1948. It was clear from the results that the chances of this area being selected for early development were somewhat remote.  The board states that this was probably due to the fact that the boundary of the area as canvassed is three miles from the nearest point of existing supply.  I am further informed that, in January, 1949, the person responsible for the organisation of the local canvass was advised accordingly, and it was suggested to him that the boundary of the area might be altered so as to bring it nearer the existing point of supply.  I am informed that no reply has been received to this communication and that no further local representations have been made. In the circumstances, the board states that it has decided to defer, for the time being, a canvass of the area by its officers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that a large number of dispensaries throughout the country are in an appallingly bad state of repair, many being without <Col N="1580" /> water or sanitary arrangements, and that the medical doctors are required to render medical aid under conditions that make it impossible for them to make even a proper examination of patients attending; and, if so, if he will, either under the proposed mother and child regulations or under proposals for legislation, make available to local authorities a special grant of part of the cost of either reconstructing these dispensaries or erecting new ones so that the administration of medical services for dispensary patients may be carried out under proper conditions and without imposing an impossible burden on the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the conditions existing in a large number of dispensaries throughout the country are bad.</P>
      <P>The attention of public assistance authorities was drawn to this matter in circulars dated the 1st April, 1948, and the 5th November, 1949.  In the latter circular it was stressed that if any real progress is to be made in the improvement of local authority medical services the first essential is adequate and satisfactory dispensaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, has operated to relieve health authorities and public assistance authorities and has resulted in the assumption by the State of a much increased proportion of the costs of the health services in the country. The total grants payable from the Exchequer towards these services for the financial year 1947-48 amounted to £911,000, while the grants payable under the Act in respect of the year 1951-52 are estimated to be £4,500,000, nearly five times the previous amount. In these circumstances, there is rather less case for the provision of special financial assistance to local authorities for the building of dispensaries than there was formerly, particularly as the expenditure is of a type appropriate to be defrayed from borrowing.  I am, however, not unsympathetic towards the proposal, which I am examining at the moment.  If I find it possible to give local authorities any relief of the kind visualised, I shall do it in such a way that local authorities will not secure any advantage from deferring <Col N="1581" /> the carrying out of the much-needed improvements.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, as in other counties, a number of national schools in County Waterford are not provided with waterflushed sanitation, but I am not aware that in any of the cases in that area the sanitary accommodation is so defective that it constitutes a danger to the health of the children or the teachers. I have no doubt that attention would be directed to such cases by the school managers or by the county medical officer or by the inspectors, in which event all possible steps would be taken by my Department to have the position remedied.</P>

While condemning the site of that station, the Deputy did not tell us about its proximity to the only central railway station in Dublin.  He did not tell us about its proximity to the docks and to sea travelling facilities.  He did not tell us about its proximity to the various local bus termini in Dublin. The Deputy also said that when Córas <Col N="1594" /> Iompair Éireann embarked on this project it had no money to pay the rates or rent for its Kingsbridge premises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann for years have been in that position. If my memory serves me, on the last day of the old Dáil, on the introduction of the Budget, the Minister mentioned that he probably would want £1,000,000 this year for Córas Iompair Éireann.  Last year, I think, we passed £4,000,000.  The whole idea at the time was to help them to get out of that position by capital expenditure that would reduce expenses and enable Córas Iompair Éireann to pay its way.  Besides the Store Street bus station, there were several other proposals for capital expenditure turned down by the inter-Party Government. There was, for instance, the proposal for diesel engines, which Córas Iompair Éireann are now going to revert to.  The last figure that I heard is that we will pay £10,000 each more for them than the original price.  To my mind this whole opposition to the Store Street bus station was simply political.  It shows that the matter was not considered in any sort of impartial way.  Personally, I think Córas Iompair Éireann were very fortunate in being able to get a central site in Dublin, such as Store Street, without having to pay enormous sums in compensation for demolition of premises. The idea of erecting the big building was to provide for centralisation of all the staffs, to reduce expenses in that way and, either by sale or letting of their existing premises, to offset the cost.  I have been very reliably informed that the bus station, about the capital cost of which we have heard so much, taking the estimate as being under the current figures, could easily have produced, by letting, over £70,000 a year.  I do not think that anybody could say that that was an investment that should be sneezed at, that we should hear so much about.  As I said, I do not think that anyone who opposed it could have <Col N="1595" /> gone into the matter in any impartial way.</P>
      <P>I hope that in another few months the bus station will be in operation.  I hope it will end all this criticism that we have been hearing.  At least it will do this&mdash;it will provide accommodation for the travelling public that they have badly needed for years and which the late Government never lifted a finger to provide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The time being short, I want to refer to three specific matters. I want to underline most urgently what Deputy Norton has said about the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Norton in his view that that authority might, with perfect propriety, be relieved of the duties to which he referred of dealing with quotas and the like and have its attention directed exclusively to creating new industries and to co-ordinating the disorganised attempts of people who require certain products and of those who would be in a position to supply them were the want and the potentiality of production brought together.</P>
      <P>I want to make this point to the House, and I think it is a point of substance: human nature being what it is, it is not always easy for prominent businessmen who have been trenchantly and energetically opposed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the time being to approach him with their respective political backgrounds and discuss in full frankness the difficulties in respect of the desires they have to promote some particular industrial enterprise that may redound greatly to the advantage of the country.  That difficuly does not arise at all where you are dealing with a body like the Industrial Development Authority which, of its nature, has no politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me illustrate that by a particular case in my own experience.  About 18 months or two years ago I, as Minister for Agriculture then, notified Burnhouse Brothers that I would not continue to license the export of fallen animals in this country for conversion into meat meal in Northern Ireland unless Messrs. Burnhouse gave <Col N="1596" /> me satisfactory proof of their intention to establish a processing plant here to convert this matter into meat meal and its by-products and that, if they were prepared to do that, I would be prepared to continue to give them <i>ad interim</i> licences while their factory was a-building.  They did give me such an undertaking but then the difficulty arose that, under the Control of Manufactures Act, it was necessary that there should be associated with them certain Irish interests.</P>
    <P>I felt that there was a sort of deadlock which, perhaps, Burnhouse Brothers wanted because they preferred to continue exporting their material and were in a position to say: &ldquo;What can we do about it?&rdquo; I referred the matter to the Industrial Development Authority and told them that I desired to see this industry instituted here and gave them the background of the story.  I do not deny that within six months the Industrial Development Authority came up with a proposal.  I gulped a little when I discovered that the three Irish directors were Deputy James Ryan, Senator Hearne in the Seanad and Senator Summerfield, and it occurred to me &ldquo;Begob, my little brainwave seems to have fructified in rather odd quarters.&rdquo; But, on reflection, I was obliged to say to myself: &ldquo;Am I not blessed in having the Industrial Development Authority because the likelihood of these three men, Senator Hearne, Deputy Dr. Ryan and Senator Summerfield coming in either to me or Deputy O'Higgins to sit down and discuss a very complicated business enterprise <i>ab initio</i> was not high.  It would be an embarrassment to them and to me but they could go into the Industrial Development Authority and discuss the whole business. In fact, the Industrial Development Authority went to them because they were looking for suitable <i>entrepreneurs</i> who could represent Irish interests with this foreign firm, to set up a satisfactory business.</P>
    <P>The net result was admirable and they have arranged to erect in Ballinasloe a large plant to deal with fallen cattle and to produce, not only meat meal, but divers other by-products which would never have been produced <Col N="1597" /> in this country but for the fact that the Industrial Development Authority was able to come between Burnhouse Brothers, who really did not want to do anything but to export the raw material, and three, as it so happened, prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party, but who, in this case, happen to be the people best suited to meet the industrial need that existed.  The likelihood of any person deeply imbued in politics being able to effect that juncture is far less than if you have a quasi-independent body who has no cognisance of and who does not care what any man's politics are, but whose primary concern is to get the finance when finance is required, to get the know-how, when know-how is required and to get raw material when raw material is required.</P>
    <P>Let me give another instance where I started a scheme in order to try to promote an industry in the West.  Sea rods were being collected on the West coast at Kilkerrin under the auspices of the Department of Gaeltacht services. I had no means of knowing what was the best means of processing this material, but I felt that if a Scottish firm thought it worth their while to pick this material at Kilkerrin and ship it to Glasgow something must have been going on in Glasgow.  I laid the whole problem before the Industrial Development Authority.  I did not know what kind of yarn, whether nylon or otherwise, they were making out of the material, but I felt that whatever it was it would be as easy for us to make the yarn in Kilkerrin and ship it as it would be for the Scottish firm to make the yarn in Glasgow.  Fianna Fáil Deputies jeered at me about making nylons.  The I.D.A. reported that it was alginate yarn and was a valuable product.  The market for it is a highly specialised market, which would be very valuable if we could break into it.  I think it was a good thing that the Minister for Agriculture had a body such as the I.D.A. to which he could bring a problem of that kind.  He presented them with all his difficulties and asked them to try and riddle them out. They said: &ldquo;Pile them in and we will try to sort them out,&rdquo; and they did.</P>
    <P>There was another case in connection <Col N="1598" /> with what was reported to be a valuable deposit of china clay at Portnacloy in North-West Mayo.  I had no means, and there was no Department of State which had any means, of determining whether there was a deposit of china clay there or not.  The Geological Office had some rumour of such a deposit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Samples were sent to America years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying for a moment that the Geological Office said that there was a deposit there.  They had not the staff or the equipment to test it.  Within four weeks of bringing the problem to the notice of the I.D.A., a distinguished body of international authorities on china clay called to Portnacloy with Doctor Flood from the Irish Industrial Research Station. They went over the area and got samples.  A survey was made and everything conceivable was done.  The report indicated that what was thought to be china clay was not china clay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, a question arose about the exploitation of mineral in Connemara &mdash;molybdenum.  One of the difficulties of politics is that if you embark on ten enterprises and bring home only three successes, politics being what politics are, you expose yourself to a barrage of ridicule and insult.  I also asked the I.D.A. to investigate that case.  The best mining engineers in the world went down to Roundstone.  I do not know whether the Minister for Agriculture has yet got their report.  There is another deposit at Maam which I know the I.D.A. is discussing with competent bodies.  We found that there was no sulphur to be had in the world, one result being that the sugar company was in danger of closing down. Fortunately, we got a small quantity of sulphur from the U.S.A.  Steps were taken, in consultation with others, to extract sulphuric acid from a deposit in the Maam area.  When I tried to get a factory started in Ballinasloe it transpired that a Fianna Fáil Deputy and two Fianna Fáil Senators desired to be associated with it.  I think it is a good idea to have an independent body for promoting industry and for <Col N="1599" /> following up the possibilities of seeking out the right people.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Norton that, I think, it is a mistake to delegate to such a body a number of ordinary duties in connection with licences and quotas which should be the ordinary day-to-day operations of the Department of Industry and Commerce. A Department of State cannot do work in connection with the promotion of industry so long as the Department of Finance is there, although I understand the Tánaiste is a very formidable challenge to it in these matters.</P>
    <P>The next thing I want to say it that this country is threatened with inflation of a kind in which there is too much money circulating which can be rapidly employed by those who hold it in the purchase of consumer goods.  In certain countries that development evokes the symptom of a rapid rise in prices, as a result of surplus money chasing a stable quantity of goods, but that is not the way inflation first shows itself in our economy.  The way in which it shows itself first in our economy is a steep rise in our imports of consumer goods, financed by our accumulated sterling balances abroad.</P>
    <P>For the past six or nine months we have deliberately, as a policy, thrown the balance of trade out of balance.  A Government decision was taken six or nine months ago that we must stockpile in this country on a scale suitable to our requirements and corresponding to stockpiling going on elsewhere, if we were not to run into absolute shortage. There is no doubt that, for the past few months, stockpiling has gone on a pretty heroic scale and I think we were right to do that; but when that stockpiling operation is over, the balance of trade must return to something like normal, and of course we have to bear in mind that the invisible items must be taken account of.</P>
    <P>That feature of our economy is one of the great safety valves against the danger of inflation, because, I suggest to the Minister, if the inflationary pressure upon us becomes too strong, one admirable check which is now at his disposal and at the disposal of the <Col N="1600" /> Minister for Finance is the removal of quotas, of all quantitative restrictions on imports and the imposition of revenue tariffs on such categories of goods as may be deemed to be non-essential. If they then come in, owing to excess purchasing power in the hands of the people which the people are resolved to spend on fripperies, a considerable tithe of all the expenditure on non-essentials will go to the Exchequer, and if the height of the import price, plus the revenue tariff, exceeds their means, they suffer no hardship by foregoing the purchases because the revenue tariff applies only to non-essential imports.</P>
    <P>I want to give a warning to agricultural Deputies on every side of this House.  It is natural that there should be a certain fundamental antipathy between the economic interests represented by Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and those represented by Deputy Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy O'Higgins was explaining how certain price orders had been held over while he was Minister, notably one relating to hides and wool.  I most cordially agree with him that he and I, and his predecessor, Deputy Morrissey, had a reasonable day-to-day agreement that, where price orders affected interests which both of us felt we had a duty to defend, the Minister for Industry and Commerce heard the agricultural point of view and took it into consideration before making a final decision in the sphere of industrial economics as to any price control Order or the like. Frequently, I did not get my way and, frequently, I was overborne.  Sometimes we had to go to the Government. I held my point of view and the Minister held his, that it was necessary, and sometimes our differences had to be carried to the Government to be resolved.  Sometimes I got my way, and sometimes he got his.  We had to take the decision of our colleagues as to what, in all the circumstances, was in the best interests of the nation, but, hopping and trotting, the pair of us were about evenly matched to fight our respective corners, and, in the counsel of our colleagues, to thresh out an equitable decision in relation to the various interests represented.  Can <Col N="1601" /> you picture Deputy Walsh squaring off to Deputy Lemass?  Talk of Sugar Ray Robinson!</P>

      <P>I know what is going to happen.  I know that when I went into the Department of Agriculture three years ago the position was that I could not post a letter out of that Department without the prior sanction of the Department of Industry and Commerce, until eventually I gave instructions: &ldquo;Let no transaction that transpires in this office be mentioned, discussed or notified to Kildare Street, and if anybody from Industry and Commerce asks anything, tell them you will not tell them.&rdquo;  When I got back on to solid ground where I could call my soul my own, we proceeded to establish a normal relationship between the two Departments, but when I went into the office it was substantially run by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  You could not blow your nose in it without getting a letter of inquiry.</P>
      <P>I remeber one historic occasion.  I got a letter to inquire how I dared to establish any contact at all with the Institute of Higher Studies in regard to meteorological matters, as it had apparently escaped my notice that matters of meteorology were the province of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I invite the Minister to read my rejoinder to that communication and to frame it and hang it up in his office.  I hope he will get many such, if he ever resumes that type of correspondence with the Department of Agriculture, but, looking at my successor, my heart sinks.</P>

    <P>I bespeak from every side of the House the constitution of a composite Randolph Turpin to get into the ring <Col N="1602" /> with the very formidable warrior who is Minister for Industry and Commerce and Tánaiste at the same time. I am slowly coming to the conclusion that Deputy Tom Walsh is the nominee of the Tánaiste as Minister for Agriculture.  I thought at first he was Deputy Aiken's nominee and that Deputy Aiken was going to bare his teeth at &ldquo;Sugar&rdquo; Ray Robinson.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy Norton is enthusiastic on this subject of converting electricity into turf on bog.  Electricity is the raw material of industry in this country, in the last analysis.  Is it industry we are concerned to promote or is it our primary interest to burn turf?  It seems to me to be the acme of madness to eschew cheap power in order to have the satisfaction of burning turf costing the equivalent of £9 a ton of coal.  I admit that, if we have an abundance of power to provide all the industrial and essential services we must continue to maintain, we could consider generating a fringe surplus from turf, without too scrupulous a regard to the strict economics <Col N="1603" /> of such an operation.  But surely we ought not to carry on with the daft business of starving industrial development of power without which the development cannot take place, by refusing to supplement existing bulk supplies with oil-driven plant.  I think that is the most readily accessible fuel of the day&mdash;power plant which would boost up the total power available to something approximating to current demand.  Let local enterprises, such as that envisaged at Portarlington and Ballycloy, be pressed forward if they can be brought within the requirements of some marginal demand; but power ought not to be made the servant of local parish pump politics.  Surely if we mean business in regard to industry, we should seek the cheapest source of power, just as if we mean business in agriculture we should seek the cheapest source of raw material.</P>
      <P>These are considerations which I think the Minister might advantageously excogitate.  In regard to the idea concerning power, I do not expect him sympathetically to consider representations I have made in respect of the rights of agriculture as opposed to industry.  Those are the issues, which are made not in the shape of a request but a warning, that even if he has put someone in Agriculture on whom he hopes to be able to walk without let or hindrance, he will find that, even if he is succeeding in tramping him into the dust, there will be some survivors who may encompass his downfall if he tries to make agriculture the handmaid of industry or the footstool of industry as it used to be before he went out of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As this debate is somewhat curtailed and the time available this evening is limited, I want to deal with only one particular matter and the remainder may remain over until next week.  In reply to a parliamentary question to-day, the Minister gave the House information concerning the future allocation of coal for the remaining two quarters of the year and indicated that, on the assumption that the supplies would not exceed double the quantities supplied <Col N="1604" /> for the first half of the year, the total quantity available would be 1,140,000 tons, that is, two-thirds of the minimum quantity guaranteed under the 1948 trade agreement.</P>
      <P>As I understand the coal supply position, in addition to that, under arrangements which have been made, it is proposed to purchase a total of 500,000 tons of American coal with, I think, from recollection, 100,000 tons already purchased.  It therefore looks as if the total quantity of coal available this year from all sources would reach about 1,700,000 or 1,800,000 tons. The supplies available last year amounted to just short of 2,000,000 tons and on the present user of coal that quantity is required.  This brings into the forefront a much larger question, leaving aside the obvious breach of the 1948 trade agreement&mdash;and there is provision in that agreement for a revision of it if either party to it finds it inequitable to comply with the terms of it.  It raises the whole question of the supply of fuel and consequently the supply of power for various needs. That inevitably brings into discussion the programme of the Electricity Supply Board generating capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening statement to-day, the Minister, in dealing with almost all matters which he spoke about, was&mdash; despite the remarks of Deputy Dillon &mdash;extraordinarily mild.  In fact, the mild approach of the Government since they assumed office leads me to believe that there is some hidden purpose in it.  They are approaching the Dáil, maybe to get the Estimates through quickly, in an extraordinarily easy manner.  It may be that because they are implementing our Estimates they decided that that was a wise approach.  However, it is somewhat unreal to discuss grave matters of policy without at times becoming controversial. While I do not think there is any real controversy about the Electricity Supply Board generating programme or the fuel programme, we want to get some clarity on the position. The programme envisages four stations to which the Minister has referred and one or two smaller stations.  He referred to the four major ones which he says were approved in <Col N="1605" /> 1946 and some of them started in 1947. These were two hydro stations and two turf-burning stations.  Nobody need be concerned about the hydro stations, as it is obvious that where water power is available it should be used.  The only criticism I would offer in that connection is that I have never got a satisfactory answer as to why the Erne scheme was not started earlier.  Since the Electricity Supply Board was established and since current became available in 1930, I think that with the exception of one or two years the demand has always outstripped the supply.  My recollection is that only on one or two occasions, sometime about 1933 or 1934, was the supply equal to the demand.  Since the war, and even immediately before the war, demand has exceeded supply each year and the position is being reached that, with the curtailment of other fuels in the last couple of year and especially in view of the bad winter last year and the bad spring earlier this year, the demand has far exceeded the supply available and, consequently, rationing over a protracted period has been necessary.  Everybody recognises that there was no possibility of developing any hydro-schemes or any other generating stations during the war years, but I have never got a satisfactory answer as to why, faced with a position in which, long before the war, there was a steadily growing demand for electricity, the Electricity Supply Board and the Government of the day failed to develop increased generating capacity as rapidly as it was obviously required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two stations started before the war, Portarlington and the Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Liffey is a very small station.  I understand that the Liffey was originally considered more as a water supply than as an electricity station&mdash;Portarlington may have been started&mdash;it was a hydro scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the question of the turf burning or the hard fuel stations. Everybody in this country is anxious to see our own resources developed and see the country made independent of outside fuel supplies.  I want to say this in connection with the use of turf <Col N="1606" />&mdash;sentiment is no substitue for facts and enthusiasm in the production of turf as a fuel for the turf burning stations is no substitute for efficiency. Neither of these observations is in any way a condemnation of Bord na Móna. As far as the conditions permit, Bord na Móna has been efficient, but Deputies should recognise that in order to burn fuel economically and to have it available when required, suitable weather conditions must be experienced during the late spring and early summer.  I went very carefully into the generating programme of the Electricity Supply Board, and I had a number of discussions with representatives of the board and with representatives of Bord na Móna, when I had some responsibility in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I was never entirely satisfied that it was possible, on the results already available, to burn turf economically with an assured supply.  It is quite possible.  Turf is a very satisfactory fuel to burn in the turf generating station, but I understand that the turf available must have a water content of not more than 30 per cent.  Due to the particularly bad season last year, I think it was never less than 35 per cent. and, on some occasions, it was much higher, so high that at least on one occasion the turf put out the fire in the Portarlington station.  That, I know, engaged the attention of the teachnical officers in Bord na Móna and consideration was being given to the possibility of using turf other than dried sod turf.  It is much easier to make available turf in another form, but the type of machinery for using that turf and the plant available is different from that which is used in the burning of sod turf.  I must say that, on the results that were available, it did not seem that Bord na Móna had established that it could be done satisfactorily, and that the results would justify the Electricity Supply Board or the Government embarking upon the erection of a station other than one to burn sod turf.</P>
    <P>I must direct the attention of the Government and the House to the general fuel situation.  Having regard to the present supply of fuel in Europe, it is quite certain that in a number <Col N="1607" /> of years hence this country will not be able to get adequate supplies of coal and that we must use, as we should use, turf as a fuel.  The fact that we will require turf for domestic and industrial purposes makes it obvious that the supply of turf which will be required is considerably in excess of anything that was required in the past, with the possible exception of the emergency years.  The experience of Bord na Móna and the Electricity Supply Board has been that adequate supplies of turf to meet the demands of the turf generating stations and those of domestic and industrial users are unlikely if the full demand of the turf generating stations is to be met.  That fact, coupled with the fact that the moisture content cannot be guaranteed at a sufficiently low level means, I think, that this whole question of turf-fired generating stations should be examined.  I believe that the direction of Board na Móna and its technical advisers is up to standard, but the company and its technical advisers cannot get over the weather situation, or as far as one can gather develop to a sufficiently satisfactory state an alternative method of using turf.</P>
    <P>I know that some method of using turf other than in a sod form has been tried in Germany and Russia but everybody knows that the type of turf available there is different to that which is available here, and while the dry sod turf burns very satisfactorily here in the turf burning station, it is quite obvious that there is no guarantee of adequate supplies of turf being available to burn in these stations in the future.  Certainly, if the supply of coal from Britain and other European countries does not increase in sufficient quantities to make more coal available for domestic and industrial use, I believe that the Minister and the Government should consider what steps can be taken, in conjunction with the Electricity Supply Board, to develop still further hydro-electric schemes.  I know that the main rivers have already either been harnessed or that plans are in train for harnessing those that are suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 43 on yesterday's Order Paper was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state when the increased rates of pay approved and granted by his predecessor to workers employed on the Brosna drainage scheme will be paid and the cause of the delay in having the increase paid to the workers concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am not aware that any increase in the pay of workers employed on the Brosna drainage scheme was approved by my predecessor.  I may add, however, that the matter is under consideration and I hope to be able to announce my decision shortly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the meanest and lowest trick played in this House by the Minister for Finance in a long time.  The Minister knows quite well from the records before him from the Board of Works that the board was unanimous in recommending an increase to the workers to whom I refer.  He is right in saying that the increase was not granted by his predecessor, his predecessor being Deputy McGilligan, but the workers, accompanied by Deputies representing the constituency of Leix-Offaly met the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, then Deputy Donnellan, and the board, and it was agreed by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board and submitted to the Minister for Finance for his approval, that the rates of pay for the workers on the Brosna drainage scheme and other similar schemes should be increased with the least possible delay.  The then Parliamentary Secretary made a statement in this House in which he invited the workers' representatives to discuss their grievances and conditions of employment at any time they thought it desirable to draw the attention of his Department to those grievances.  The workers on the Brosna scheme very happily availed of the invitation the Parliamentary Secretary gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was put forward by the <Col N="1609" /> groups of workers themselves, fitters, labourers, drivers, etc.  Their case was so genuine and their grievances so real that the board were unanimous in recommending an increase, but now the Minister comes along and tells us that the matter is under consideration. Deputy Donnellan, as Parliamentary Secretary, recommended that increase and the board were unanimous in their recommendation.  I accuse the Minister for Finance now of attempting to sabotage the good work done by the previous administration for the workers concerned.  The workers on that occasion would have felt very grateful for an all-round increase of 2d. per hour.  I believe that the board were sympathetic to that request and that the Parliamentary Secretary was prepared to co-operate.</P>

I will now express my complete dissatisfaction at <Col N="1610" /> any attempt to provide those workers with an increase of 2d. per hour at this stage in view of the fact that the cost of living has gone up considerably in the past three weeks.  A greater increase will have to be given.</P>

      <P>I am most anxious to know why the Minister is standing in the way of the immediate payment of these increases.  I want to know whether he is prepared to have that 2d. rate made retrospective to the date on which it was unanimously approved by the Board of Works.  I want no time to be lost in having it paid to the workers concerned.  Those of us who know the Minister know that he never had any sympathy at any time with the working classes of this country but this is one occasion on which he is not going to get away with it.  He is not going to play low mean tricks at the expense of the workers, of the dignity of the Board of Works and of the honour of the men on the board who were unanimous in recommending an increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the cause of the delay is a deliberate attempt on the Minister's part to throw the blame on the former Parliamentary Secretary by saying that no serious attempt was made to increase those workers' rates.  I do not want to go any further because Deputies Davin and O'Higgins are anxious to have a word.  I would warn the Minister, <Col N="1611" /> however, that we will not take a slipshod reply.  We want to know when those men are to get their increase and why he is deliberately standing in the way of those workers by preventing them from availing of the generosity of his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accompanied my colleagues, Deputies Flanagan and O'Higgins, on the occasion when they met Deputy Donnellan, then Parliamentary Secretary, who was accompanied by one of the Commissioners of the Board of Works.  The Parliamentary Secretary, with his advisers, listened to the case on behalf of the different grades presently employed on the Brosna drainage scheme and he assured the deputation with myself and my colleagues that the case would receive the favourable consideration of the commissioners.  I subsequently met the Parliamentary Secretary with my colleagues again.  I do not wish just to guess at the date, as I have not got it at my finger-tips, but it was early in May before the dissolution.  We were assured by the Parliamentary Secretary that the recommendation put forward by him and sent to the commissioners for an increase in rate of 2d. per hour had been forwarded for the sanction and approval of the Minister.  I assumed that it was only a matter of course and of a short time until that recommendation would be automatically ratified.  The next I heard of it was during the general election campaign when I visited Clara on a Saturday night.  I was accompanied by a Minister of the inter-Party Government, and at the end of the public meeting I was challenged by the secretary of the workers' organisation who was accompanied by other workers who were then and still are employed on the Brosna scheme.  He asserted that the recommendation of which we had advised them had been rejected by the Minister for Finance.  I phoned the following day from my hotel to the Office of the Board of Works asking for some information on that matter, in other words, asking to know whether this was one of the usual political propaganda stories circulated in the <Col N="1612" /> area for party propaganda purposes. I could not get in touch with the officer I wanted at the time, but I was subsequently informed, and this will not be denied, because I can prove it, on the 23rd of May that the recommendation had been previously sent to the Minister for Finance and was receiving the &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo;&mdash; these were the words used&mdash;of the Minister.  That was on the 23rd May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From long experience in this House I assumed that when the Dáil is dissolved the senior civil servants as well as the junior civil servants would be very careful about taking hurried decisions&mdash;not knowing whether a new Minister would come in who would, very likely, take a different view from that of the Minister of the day.  I assumed, therefore, that that was the reason why things were going slowly. To-day is the 12th July.  In the ordinary way probably Deputy MacEntee, if he were not Minister for Finance, might be up in Belfast.  He is here, thanks be to God, and I hope he will give us the real reason.  I do not want to play politics with regard to this matter because it concerns bread and butter to the hundreds of men involved. They have been waiting a long time to get what they are entitled to get.  As I told the Parliamentary Secretary at the time, I did not accept enthusiastically the rate of 2d. per hour because I thought&mdash;and I informed him and his advisers accordingly&mdash;that the men concerned made a good case for a higher figure.  I was informed quite definitely on the 23rd May that the matter was then under active consideration.  As such a long period of time has elapsed, I hope the Minister will now inform us that he is willing to sanction the recommendation of the Commissioners of Public Works which was ratified and forwarded to the Minister of the time, some time about the middle of May.  At least we are entitled to hear the cause of the delay.  I hope the Minister will say here and now that, after all this delay, he is prepared to sanction the recommendation sent to his predecessor nearly two months ago, and that he will sanction also the recommendation to make it retrospective from the date <Col N="1613" /> recommended by the previous Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to add my voice to what has been said by Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Davin. The point has rightly been made that this application for an increase in the wages paid to the Brosna workers has been under consideration for a considerable length of time.  I was present with the other Deputies when this matter was first raised in a legitimate way by representatives of the workers with representatives of the Government.  Over 12 weeks have now elapsed.  We know that a recommendation was made by the Commissioners of Public Works to the Minister for Finance for some increase in the wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Davin has said, during the general election a lying story was spread by the present Minister's political friends that that recommendation had been turned down by the Minister's predecessor.  That was a lie.  That story was spread for foul political purposes by the supporters of Deputy Boland and Deputy Maher in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly.  It now falls to the three Opposition Deputies in that constituency to raise this matter in this House and we do so for the purpose of ensuring that these workers will get a fair measure of the justice to which they are entitled.  The work upon which these men are engaged is work of national reclamation of the utmost importance.  It is essential that the Brosna scheme should continue to get a full supply of labour and that workers employed on that important work should be properly paid.  I do not know whether it will astonish the Minister for Finance, but I am sure it will astonish his Parliamentary Secretary and other Deputies to learn that at present Brosna workers are receiving a rate of wage less than county council workers and less than Bord na Móna employees engaged on Bord na Móna camps in Tirraun and in other areas around.  That is a serious situation. It means that workers engaged on the Brosna are not being paid even the standard wage from Government and semi-Government concerns.  In addition, they are paid substantially <Col N="1614" /> less than the ordinary generally recognised rate of wage for unskilled builders' labourers in the area.  I think their right to a substantial increase in their wage has been fully established. It is important to remember that the Commissioners of Public Works, on the recommendation of the previous Parliamentary Secretary, have made a recommendation which is at present before the Minister for Finance.  I understand that that recommendation was made at the beginning of the month of May.  I do not know the exact nature of the recommendation but I hope that the longer the delay in dealing with it the higher will be the wage that will be sanctioned eventually.  We all know that under this Coalition Government which we now have in power the cost of living is rising every day.  The cost of butter which the workers have to buy has increased even in the past ten days, and we know that other commodities are increasing in price.  If we are to accept what the Minister for Industry and Commerce says, if he is going to be there for any length of time there will be a shoal of increased prices.</P>
    <P>With Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Davin I desire to impress on the Minister the justice of the claims of these men.  I do not think that the Minister's reply to the question raised by Deputy Flanagan is satisfactory.  It does not hold out much hope for the workers on the Brosna.  I trust the Minister will reconsider the position and ensure that these workers will get a measure of the social justice to which they are fully entitled.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan opened his performance by a reference to the meanest type of trick.  Apparently some individuals who, during the last general election or in the proceedings or manoeuvres preceding the last general election, had indulged in a very mean deception of the workers employed upon the Brosna drainage scheme have now been found out. From the statements made by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Davin and Deputy Flanagan it would appear that during the course of the last general election campaign they had assured the workers for whom they profess to speak in this House that my predecessor, <Col N="1615" /> the then Minister for Finance, had approved and granted an increase in the rate of wages payable to workers on that scheme.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state when the increased rates of pay approved and granted by his predecessor...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no reference in that question to a recommendation from the Parliamentary Secretary.  There is a categorical statement that an increase in rates of pay was approved and granted by my predecessor.</P>

It is quite true that on the day on which the Government were running away from the division on the Vote for the Minister for Agriculture a recommendation came over from the Office of the Commissioners of Public Works&mdash; at least that was the date of the recommendation&mdash;to the Department of Finance, making certain proposals in relation not merely to the Brosna scheme but to other schemes as well. I do not know whether the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance had any prior discussion with my predecessor in regard to the terms of that minute.

So far as the workers employed on the Brosna drainage scheme <Col N="1619" /> are concerned they have reason to be grateful to me inasmuch as my concern with their position has been much greater than that of my predecessor. Deputies O. Flanagan, O'Higgins and Davin have told the House that they were informed that a recommendation came from the Commissioners of Public Works on May 3rd.  My predecessor was in office at that time.  He was in office up to June 13th.  During the whole of that period there is nothing to indicate that he called for the file or looked at the papers.  As everybody knows, a new Government took over on June 14th.</P>

At least I have paid some attention to the recommendation which came over from the Office of Public Works.  That cannot be said of my predecessor.  May I say that except for a telephone call which Deputy Davin put through on May 23rd, in response to which he got a reply from the Office of Public Works telling him that no decision had yet been reached in the matter, none of the Deputies who have spoken with <Col N="1620" /> such heat here to-day in relation to this matter evinced any interest or exhibited any interest in it at all.</P>
