      <P>Apart from the various Bills which are being introduced, it is proposed to take items 13 and 14, that is to say, the Local Government (Remission of Rates) (No. 2) Bill, 1951, and the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Bill, 1951.  The Government is agreeable to the rest of the time being allocated to Private Deputies' Business.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, I object to the course suggested. I think that questions might get an extra hour and that the balance of the questions should be adjourned to the next sitting day.  There are a number of important items to be discussed by the House before the conclusion of the session.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of the Government to use to the best advantage every situation arising from time to time that is capable of being used towards the ending of Partition.  In international affairs, the Government keep this purpose constantly in mind as our primary and fundamental national aim.  We will endeavour to make known as <Col N="3" /> widely as possible the facts of Partition&mdash;by what methods and for what purposes it was brought about and has been maintained and the evils and injustices that inevitably flow from it.</P>
      <P>We will call, as in the past, on the help and support of men and women of our race in other countries, in seeking to convince the friendly nations of the world that the ending of Partition is a matter of concern to all who desire international peace and security and to convince the Government and people of Britain that the removal of this barrier to unreserved friendship between the peoples of the two islands will be to their advantage as well as to ours.  We will also continue our efforts to convince those of our own people in the Six Counties who are at present opposed to national reunion that their true interests will best be served by their participation in the development of an integrated Irish nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask can the Tánaiste give an indication as to when the Taoiseach will be in a position finally to allocate these Departments? If my recollection is right, the Taoiseach stated in announcing the appointments of Ministers that the present arrangement was a temporary measure and in reply to a number of supplementary questions asked on that occasion he repeated that statement. May we have some indication as to when they will be finally allocated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has received as yet any <Col N="5" /> concrete proposals from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government concerning the setting up of new industries and the provision of employment in the Gaeltacht and the western seaboard areas; and, if so, whether he will state (a) the exact nature of the proposals so received and (b) the steps that are being taken to implement the proposals received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (1) whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government has yet completed his investigations into the conditions and requirements of neglected areas along the western seaboard; (2) if a report on such matters will be issued for the information of the Dáil; (3) whether any definite decisions have yet been reached as to an all-round or comprehensive scheme or schemes by which living conditions in those Gaeltacht areas may be improved; and, if so, the nature of those schemes; and (4) if such schemes have not yet been prepared when they are likely to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste (for the Taoiseach) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of proposals have been submitted to the Government by the Parliamentary Secretary with a view to the social and economic development of the Gaeltacht and congested areas. These and other proposals are under active examination by the interdepartmental committee established to advise and assist the Parliamentary Secretary.  There is no question of the Parliamentary Secretary making a final report to the Government at any stage.  On the contrary, it is intended that the investigations which he is making into the conditions and requirements of the Gaeltacht and congested areas will be continuous.  It would be premature at this stage to indicate the nature of the proposals which have been placed before the Government. Where these proposals are approved by the Government, any necessary legislation to give effect to them will be submitted to the Oireachtas.  Where legislation is not considered necessary, administrative <Col N="6" /> directions will be given for putting them into effect.</P>
    <P>It should be appreciated, however, that the main function of the Parliamentary Secretary's office is to facilitate and co-ordinate measures by other Departments of particular interest to Gaeltacht and congested areas, for which the Ministers who have charge of those Departments will remain directly responsible and by whom any legislative or administrative measures which are deemed desirable will be initiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there have been several investigations of that kind carried out by different Governments in the course of the last 25 years?  May I ask the Tánaiste if all the information necessary has not already been obtained long ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a Supplementary Estimate for Vote 72 &mdash; Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng &mdash; is being introduced, would the Tánaiste say whether a comprehensive statement will be made, when that Estimate is being brought before the House, as to the approach of the Government to this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that should be possible, but the Deputy can appreciate that there are a number of proposals which have been initiated by the Parliamentary Secretary upon which the Government has yet to take a final decision and no indication of the character of these proposals can usefully be given in advance of their acceptance by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the prices of some raw materials have fallen recently, the over-all price position does not encourage the hope of any general reduction in the cost of living in the near future.  While some further price adjustments may yet have to be made in consequence of the rise in raw material costs earlier in the year, higher prices for farm produce and higher wage rates, there are some prospects that they will represent the final stage of the adjustment of the price level which <Col N="11" /> began about 12 months ago and that the price position may then become relatively stable.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government's policy is to secure stability if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Control is maintained at the present time over the prices of all commodities in common use which are scarce or may become scarce, or where any circumstances exist which may limit competition, with a view to ensuring that the fullest measure of protection is afforded to the consuming public.</P>
    <P>Where the position demands any extension of the present controls appropriate action is taken.</P>
    <P>It should be understood, however, that the increases which have occurred in the prices of household and other commodities are largely attributable to a substantial rise in the landed cost of imported raw materials and manufactured goods in relation to which it is not possible to exercise any control. Average import prices in the first eight months of 1951 were 22.5 per cent. higher than in the corresponding period of 1950.  So far as manufacturing and distributing costs are concerned it is the policy of the Government, whereever it is necessary, to apply official control to all essential commodities, and all practicable precautions are taken to ensure that the profits earned by the trade interests concerned do not exceed a reasonable level, and that the commodities are made available at the lowest possible price.</P>
    <P>A policy designed to maintain maximum prices unchanged, notwithstanding increases in raw material and manufacturing costs, could only result in the curtailment or even the elimination of supplies with resultant unemployment and other hardships.  While the importance of limiting price increases and achieving a position of stability is keenly appreciated, the Government hopes also to so arrange its control measures that adverse effects on production and employment will be minimised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since the present Government assumed office the people of this <Col N="12" /> country have been staggered and bewildered by the rapidity with which prices have been increased?  In view of that fact and of the urgent need, not alone to arrest these increases, but to reduce prices, can the Minister not state in more concrete terms what the policy of the Government is to reduce these prices?  Is the only hope the people have for the future what we have heard from the Minister in recent weeks and the picture presented in the Central Bank report to the Minister for Finance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Eliminating all ornate verbosity, I want to point out to Deputy Dunne that in the three months before the change of Government the cost of living index number rose by six points and in the three months after the change of Government it only rose by two points.  We inherited a situation in which the cost of living was rising rapidly and we are trying to keep it under control.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of inspectors of his Department whose services were discontinued or who were reverted to their previous posts since the 1st July last, and the reasons for the termination of their services or reversion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Prices and Charges (Standstill) Order, 1951, was made, my predecessor decided to recruit 100 additional temporary inspectors to assist in its enforcement. That number was subsequently reduced by him to 50 as an economy measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prices and Charges (Standstill) Order provided for the control of prices of 98 commodities or groups of <Col N="22" /> commodities.  By March, 1951, however, 62 commodities or groups of commodities had been decontrolled by revocation Orders and a further 12 commodities had been similarly decontrolled by June.</P>
    <P>When I investigated the machinery for the enforcement of price control Orders, I decided that 25 temporary inspectors, in addition to the ordinary staff of the Department, would be adequate, with public co-operation, to secure effective enforcement.  This number of temporary inspectors is still employed and will be added to from time to time if necessary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the hardships caused to Dublin citizens through the increase in bus fares as the increase has added five to six shillings per week to the outgoings of tenants being transferred by the Dublin Corporation Housing Department to housing areas in Finglas, Ballyfermot, Donnycarney, Crumlin, Kimmage, Larkhill, Ellenfield, Cabra and Dollymount, and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Transport Act, passed in 1950, a statutory obligation was imposed on Córas Iompair Éireann to secure that the revenue of the board should be not less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.  Also, by that Act, the control formerly exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce over the maximum charges of Córas Iompair Éireann was removed. The extent and incidence of the fare increases imposed by Córas Iompair Éireann are accordingly matters in which I have now no statutory function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to increase rates and fares generally was taken by Córas Iompair Éireann in January last and was communicated to the Dáil in reply to a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Liam Cosgrave, former Parliamentary Secretary, on the 14th February.  I am not aware of the <Col N="25" /> considerations which induced the board to delay bringing the increases into operation until September 10th. I am, however, informed by Córas Iompair Éireann that the additional revenue will not be nearly sufficient to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure.</P>
    <P>The single bus fare between the city and most of the places mentioned in the question has been increased by 1d. Similar increases have been imposed on other routes.  The fares between the city and the housing areas have in the past been on a lower level than the fares for corresponding distances on other city routes and I am informed by Córas Iompair Éireann that this position has been maintained.</P>

I would ask the Minister to ensure that these housing areas will be exempt from these extra charges.</P>

      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann already grant specially reduced fares to school children both in Dublin and the other cities.  Children between the ages of three and 15 years are charged half the adult fares at all times and children between the ages of 15 and 16 years are charged half the adult fares during school hours.

      <P>If he has in mind that I should give a direction to Córas Iompair Éireann to concede the wage rates proposed by the union, I must point out that, under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1950, I have no function in the management of Córas Iompair Éireann and no power to give a direction in a matter of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after taking up office, I was informed by Córas Iompair Éireann that expenditure was exceeding revenue to an alarming extent and that a very large deficit could only be met by further subventions from public funds.  The board was asked to submit a comprehensive report on various matters of policy, including any proposals in contemplation by them to reduce working costs.  This report, which was received on 23rd October, is at present under examination.  On the matter of staffs, the report states that the board, for a long time, has been urging the heads of its various departments to examine and report on any redundancy existing in their staffs, that the reports so far furnished indicate that there is very little redundancy, but that the board is not satisfied that <Col N="30" /> this is a true picture of the position and is having further investigations made.</P>
      <P>This is the only information I have at present as to the board's intentions and it would not appear to justify any such rumours as the Deputy mentions. If Córas Iompair Éireann should dispense with the services of redundant employees for whom they have no suitable alternative employment the compensation provisions of Section 38 of the Transport Act, 1950, would apply.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister whether he would consider suggesting to Córas Iompair Éireann that if any redundancy should arise it should be allowed to dissipate itself by wastage through death or retirement rather than that people who have given long service to the railway industry should have that service precipitously terminated.</P>

      <P>It has happened repeatedly at conferences between Córas Iompair Éireann and trade unions that senior officers of the company have expressed themselves very strongly on what they regard as existing redundancy in the company and have made it plain that they regard it as such that they would call for a considerable lay off.  That has created nervousness amongst the employees, particularly as there has been a lay off in the road freightage section in the past few weeks.  The Minister should allay that nervousness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a story current among railway workers that it has come down from higher levels that Córas Iompair Éireann have indicated that they are carrying a large redundant staff.  Deputy Larkin mentions 25 per cent.  I have heard that the figure is 2,500 employees.  Are we to understand from the Minister now <Col N="31" /> that there is no foundation for any fear on the part of the railway workers that any of them will be paid off?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say that. What the board of Córas Iompair Éireann have said is that since they were appointed they have been pressing for the elimination of redundancy &mdash; that their departmental heads say that there is little redundancy but that they are not satisfied that that is the picture.  That is the sum total of my knowledge of the board's intentions in the matter at present.

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the reservoir at Leixlip was emptied on the 1st August last in connection with the carrying out of special work to the main intake gate and screens at the intake to the turbine, and that this work was necessary in order to obviate a risk of failure of the hydro-electric plant.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that no prior notice of the intention to empty the reservoir was given by the Electricity Supply Board to any of the parties mentioned at (a), (b) and (c) of Question No. 44.  The board states that it saw no reason to anticipate that the discharge of water from the reservoir would prove harmful to fish life, as on three previous occasions (including one in January, 1951) the presence of mud or silt in similar outflows had not been apparent.  No representations were received by the board from any of the parties mentioned in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will have seen from the newspapers, the Government has decided to establish a company to be known as Córas Tráchtála Teo. to promote exports to the dollar area. The first directors of the company have already been nominated.  The objective of the company will be to place at the disposal of exporters a comprehensive service which will assist them to market their goods successfully in the dollar area.  The precise methods to be followed in doing so will be primarily a matter for the company and all necessary functions are being entrusted to them for this purpose. These functions will include the development of outlets in the dollar <Col N="47" /> area for Irish goods; the conduct of market surveys for Irish goods; the supply of information to Irish exporters about outlets for their goods in the dollar area, and to importers in the dollar area about Irish products; advising on methods of salesmanship, packaging and design, and on shipping and transport facilities; the procurement of information on the credit standing of dollar-area importers; the organisation of collective efforts to develop exports to the dollar area and the promotion of participation by Irish exporters in international trade fairs.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála Teo. may also be authorised to import and export, buy and sell in its own name or as agent for others, subject to the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  It is not intended that the company should, for the present at any rate, concern itself with exports other than exports to the dollar area.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála Teo. is not being established under statutory authority. No statutory authority is necessary for the purpose, and it is not my intention to introduce proposals for legislation in this connection.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála Teo. will be financed by grant-in-aid.  There is provision under sub-head (8) of the Estimate for Industry and Commerce for the year 1951-52 for an initial grant-in-aid of £10,000 for the company.</P>
    <P>The Economic Co-operation Administration of the United States has approved proposals for technical assistance for Córas Tráchtála Teo. which provide for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the assignment to the new company of two United States experts for one year each, to advise on organisation and operation, and to undertake a survey of potential Irish dollar exports;</P>
    <P>(b)  the carrying out of short-run market surveys in the United States for projects selected by the two experts, and the provision of expert advice on specific problems arising;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> (c)  comprehensive market surveys for four Irish products, viz., woollen and worsted fabrics (millwoven); stout, porter and ale; processed meat and meat products; and one other product to be selected;</P>
    <P>(d)  the provision of United States experts to evaluate the various market surveys and to advise on problems of expanding and cheapening production arising as a result.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the implementation of this assistance are in train.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I compliment the Minister on implementing this project and ask him if he does not consider that more representation should be given on the board to business people, people with business experience, rather than civil servants?  There is a preponderance of civil servants on the board, I think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The present contraction of orders to Irish woollen and worsted mills, which are the main purchasers of the yarns produced at Tullamore, has already received attention.  During the current quota period, the permitted importation of worsted materials of the kind manufactured in Portlaoighise has already been cut to an almost nominal <Col N="49" /> figure.  The recession in consumer buying, however, as well as the effects of the exceptional facilities granted towards the end of 1950 and in the early part of this year for the importation of very substantial quantities of cloth of the types made by the Irish mills are factors in the present position which will take some little time to rectify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to (1) and to the first part of (2) is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>Obviously the Deputy cannot expect me to disclose the details of my discussions with the representatives of the company beyond saying that I am at the moment considering the matter in the light of those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say here that I have already written to the Tullamore Urban District Council pointing out that, in my view, the present position of Salts (Ireland), Limited, would appear to be due largely to two factors, (a) recession in consumer buying and (b) the effects of stockpiling.  As regards (a) this is a factor which is not peculiar to this country only, but according to recent reports is also operating in many other countries, including Britain.  As regards stockpiling, it is to be remembered that towards the end of 1950 and in the beginning of the present year, in view of the possibilities of an emergency, my predecessor decided to grant greatly increased facilities to consumers in this country to import large quantities of fully manufactured cloth. The total additional quantities of woollen and worsted cloths permitted to be imported under these exceptional licences were equivalent to one full year's normal imports.  Until these stocks are disposed of, the fact that they are on the hands of importers in this country must be expected to have an adverse effect on the position both of the Irish yarn producers and on the woollen and worsted manufacturers. As a step towards easing the position, <Col N="52" /> the quota for the period 1st September, 1951 to 29th February, 1952, has been drastically reduced, so that only a nominal quantity of the types of cloth made by the Irish mills can be imported.</P>

So far as cloths made by the Irish woollen mills are concerned, the quota, which is normally one for 4,000,000 square yards in the year, has been reduced to 75,000 square yards, and that is only a nominal quota.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question on this subject on the 18th July last, there are considerable practical difficulties associated with the proposal to establish a turf-fired electricity generating station in South Kerry.  The question of the feasibility of utilising hand-won turf and turf produced by semi-automatic machines in generating stations is at present under consideration but the necessary investigations will take some time.  The Deputies may be assured that in the general consideration of this matter the merits of such a project in South Kerry will receive careful attention.</P>

I am informed that in south-west Clare a large proportion of the available turf has already been sold, the sales to date comparing favourably with sales achieved in corresponding periods of previous years.  Producers cannot, however, expect to dispose of all their turf before the winter and it would be advisable, therefore, for them to protect it against the weather by securing it in clamps, pending sale.</P>

      <P>He has got a very informative answer.  I reminded him of the fact that the Central Bank as lenders of last resort must necessarily be content with a very small, a very modest return on their investments in order to maintain a position of extreme liquidity.  I suggest, however, that the <Col N="63" /> Deputy should study this fact which I have revealed to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that, apparently through an oversight, there is no provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, for the purchase of land at the reduced rate of stamp duty by an Irish company incorporated after 15th October, 1947, where the shares of such company are to an extent exceeding 51 per cent. in nominal value, held by another Irish company also formed since 15th October, 1947, which does not carry on a manufacturing business even though the entire share capital of such holding company is beneficially held by Irish citizens; and, if so, if he will introduce proposals for legislation to rectify this omission.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a non-manufacturing company incorporated <Col N="65" /> since the 15th October, 1947, in which the greater part of the share capital is held by another similar company, does not come within any of the categories set out in sub-section (4) of Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947.  I was not aware, however, that any practical difficulties had arisen on this account, but if the Deputy will send me particulars of any case in point, I will have the matter examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware of the hardships caused to tuberculosis sufferers by reason of the increased cost of living and the inadequacy of the allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations to meet the increased cost of living, and whether he is prepared to increase these allowances to meet the increased prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 19th July last.</P>
      <P>In that reply, I dealt with the background to the whole question of the scope and purposes of these allowances and with the means by which health authorities could deal specially with exceptional cases.</P>
      <P>Since the date of that reply, I have specially considered whether an upward revision of the rates is necessary and I am of opinion that, having regard to the relatively generous level at which they were fixed in January, 1948, and to the discretion which health authorities have in dealing with special cases, no revision is necessary at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider that question?  I am sure the Minister will appreciate how prices have gone up since 1948 and that the purpose of these grants is to enable tuberculosis sufferers to receive an adequate allowance which would enable them to obtain more nourishment and generally maintain a certain standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that question, I would like to point out to the Minister that there have been complaints that local authorities have altered the method of allocating the grant and that when an old age pensioner reaches the age of 70 he is knocked off the allowance and put on <Col N="77" /> the old age pension, meaning a reduction from £3 or £4 to £1, which is hardly adequate in the case of tuberculosis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out this important position. Hitherto, when a person reached 70 he was allowed to continue enjoying the full benefits of the tuberculosis allowance. Recently, in several cases, the Dublin Corporation have knocked him off the tuberculosis allowance and put him on the old age pension, which means that he gets £1 instead of £2 or £3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wrong.  He should get the same total amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire from the Minister if he thinks it equitable, in the case of a small farm, when the small farmer is removed from the farm to the sanatorium&mdash;as, of course, it is right that he should be as soon as it comes to the knowledge of those concerned&mdash;or <Col N="78" /> does he think it a true reflection in such circumstances to say that the allowance ought to be reduced to £1 a week consequent on his removal from the farm?  From the family point of view, surely the removal of the head of a family, who has some directive, co-ordinating control so long as he is in the place, has the result of leaving the position that a quasi widow woman with young children is trying to run the farm with the husband gone.  Would not the Minister agree with me that in the circumstances of that small farmer, instead of lightening the family commitment, his removal to hospital rather adds to it?  It is true that she has not got to provide the bit to eat that he ate in the house, but all his management capacity, his guidance and direction, is of necessity removed and the woman of the house has to get a man in to do the heavy work about the place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Instructions have been issued to local authorities by my Department setting out revised rates of contribution which will be payable by recipients under the cheap fuel scheme during the coming winter.  The instructions follow the normal lines in requesting the local authorities to operate a fuel scheme during the winter period and indicate that revised rates of contribution should be operated as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1/6 per cwt. from persons in receipt of old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the effect of that instruction issued by the Department of Social Welfare is to increase the charges for this cheap fuel by 50 per cent. and that this increased charge is being levied on persons who receive no increase whatever on their rates of benefit under social legislation?  In the case of the blind pensioners and old age pensioners, it means cheating them out of portion of the increase which they recently received.  Does the Minister consider that there is any justification, and if so, what is the justification for increasing the charges at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Revised rates of contributions by recipients have been fixed for fuel under the fuel schemes to be operated in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire during the coming winter.

      <P>I hope the Minister will grant these vouchers at the rates which operated previously.  The Minister for Finance need not express his scorn at my suggestion.  I think it is a cruel thing to raise the charges for cheap fuel to these people, some of whom have already had their rents increased by 3d. per week under the differential rents scheme.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend to the 31st March, 1952, the period prescribed in the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940, as extended by the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1950, within which the erection, enlargement or improvement of a residence must be completed in order to qualify for a remission of two-thirds of the rates for five years.</P>
      <P>The remission does not apply in the case of houses erected by local authorities under the Labourers Acts and the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, houses in respect of which grants have been made under the Housing Acts, or houses receiving remission of rates under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts.  In effect, therefore, rates remission under this code is limited to the larger type of house which does not get assistance in any other way, either from the State or the local authority. The number of houses of this type now being erected is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> This rate remission code has always been on a temporary basis.  The parent Act&mdash;the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940&mdash; covered the period up to 30th September, 1942.  Since then the period has been extended by five short continuing Acts similar to the present Bill.  The last Act&mdash;the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1950&mdash;extended the period for completion up to 31st March, 1951. The period will by this Bill be further extended to the 31st March, 1952.</P>

The purpose of the Acts is to enable county councils to provide credit for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers to small cultivators who might not be able to obtain it in the ordinary way.  The Acts do not provide a comprehensive scheme for agricultural credit but merely one designed to help a relatively small number of cultivators <Col N="100" /> who otherwise might find it difficult to obtain supplies of seeds and fertilisers. County councils adopted schemes in the seasons 1949-50 and 1950-51 in anticipation of the enactment of legislation to enable them to do so.  This Bill will validate such schemes and will continue the legislation for a further four seasons.  There is, therefore, no new principle involved in the present Bill which is merely a continuing and validating Bill.</P>
      <P>The Acts are enabling Acts only, permitting county councils to adopt schemes if they wish to do so.  The county councils can exercise their powers under the Acts in two ways. They can make loans to individuals for the purchase of the seeds and fertilisers or they can guarantee the due payment to a merchant of the cost of seeds and fertilisers supplied on credit by him to an approved applicant.</P>
      <P>All county councils with the exception of Dublin, Kerry, Leitrim and Louth adopted schemes in the seasons 1949-50 and 1950-51.  The total number of loans in the season 1949-50 was 2,421 and the total cost of the schemes was £27,153.  The average loan was about £11.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the House will readily accept the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of the opinion that the present level of differential rents in the Ballyfermot scheme is excessive and requests the Minister for Local Government to revise the scheme so as to ensure that only the wages of the head of the family are assessed and that the maximum rent to be charged shall not exceed 15/- per week with special allowance to be made for large families of young children, newly-weds, and unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge this motion upon the House because of representations which have been made to me, and I am sure to practically every other public representative in Dublin City and County, on the vexed subject of differential rents. It is necessary at the outset to examine the purpose of differential rents.  Everybody is aware that since the end of the war housing costs have been at a very high level, and that it costs very much more now to build a house of any kind than it did in pre-war years.  However, <Col N="103" /> I want to draw attention to the method of renting which has been applied in the Ballyfermot housing scheme.  Possibly the first public representative of this country to suggest a differential renting scheme was the late Councillor James Larkin.  It was conceived at that time as a method whereby the hardships which working-class families ordinarily undergo in the society in which we live to-day could, to some extent, be eased.  It was felt that there should be a differential renting scheme which would afford these families an opportunity of paying a rent in accordance with their means.  I hope to point out to the House that in the course of the years which have passed since this scheme was first thought of and originated the whole purpose of the scheme has become perverted and obscured and that it is no longer being operated, at least in the Ballyfermot area, as a method for the easement of the difficulties of working-class families but is, rather, being operated for an entirely different purpose. The primary purpose of differential rents, not alone in this country but in other countries where the system was in operation long before we thought of it, was to render a little less difficult the problem of working-class families by allowing them, when they were unemployed or in difficulties, to have houses at lower rents.  I am afraid that what has happened over the past few years is totally in conflict with that principle.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation very often comes under fire from the rate-paying sections of the city, particularly from the more well-to-do and propertied rate-paying sections of the city, because of the alleged high rates.  I am not concerned with the question of whether Dublin Corporation rates are high or not.  They are, I suppose, at as high a level as the rates of any other local authority in the country.  In the light of that, it is interesting to learn that Dublin Corporation contributes a sum of 3/2 in the pound in respect of charges which arise from the operation of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  I do not think anybody will say that that is a very great demand upon the rates of this city for the housing of the vast <Col N="104" /> mass of working-class people we have in this city.  In fact, I suppose a case could very well be made for a larger contribution from the rates of the city for the easement of the high rents which are demanded of tenants of houses which are built under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts. Between the 1st April, 1926, and the 31st March of this year Dublin Corporation has built approximately 23,500 houses for working-class people. Immediately prior to the outbreak of the last war it was possible for a working-class family in Dublin City to obtain a four-roomed house from Dublin Corporation at a rent of 12/2 per week. In the area which this motion concerns, the area of Ballyfermot, there are working-class families who are being charged rents of 36/- per week, which is well over 300 per cent. of an increase on pre-war rents.  It is to try to remedy this state of affairs, and to bring some consideration into the minds of people for the difficulties that families are having in meeting that rent, that I am raising this motion.  I am aware that the Minister's function in this matter is merely an advisory one, but it is a function which should be exercised because it is very necessary at the present time.</P>
    <P>In 1938-39 Dublin Corporation provided three-roomed cottages or houses at 9/2 per week.  At present, the differential rents in the Ballyfermot scheme range from 7/6 to 36/-.  The lowest rent of 7/6 applies to people who are almost totally destitute and the rent of 36/- applies to families where a number of the children might be employed.  If the society in which we live to-day in this country is so constructed as to require a badly-paid working-class, and if the majority of the legislators of this country believe that that principle must prevail, then easement of the burden of working-class people must be made in some other way if it is not made by means of weekly wages.  It devolves upon a Government and local authority not alone to build houses for working-class people but to provide them at reasonable rents.  I do not think anybody will try to make the case that a rent of 36/- a week, or anything in the nature <Col N="105" /> of that figure, is an equitable rent. Those who are being housed in the Ballyfermot scheme at present must reveal to the local authority the most intimate details of their family circumstances so far as earnings are concerned. That would be an inevitable part of any differential renting scheme but, in my view, a system whereby excessive rents are imposed, as in this case, will inevitably lead to deceit and evasion, and that is socially bad.  If rents are fixed at a fair level, at a level which people will regard as reasonable, then the social difficulties to which I have referred are at least less likely to arise.</P>
    <P>I understand that the economic rent of the houses which are being built at Ballyfermot is in the neighbourhood of 36/-.  It is of interest to note that, in calculating the economic rent of these houses and for the purpose of imposing a differential rental system, no consideration is given, and no thought is taken, of Government subsidies, while we all know that, at the moment, Government subsidies in regard to this matter are reasonably substantial.  We all know that the subsidy given by the central authority to the local authority has been reasonably substantial over a number of years.  As I have said, when calculating the rents of the houses in Ballyfermot, no thought whatever is taken of the subsidies in arriving at the economic rent.  I believe that is something which the Minister should take note of because what it means is this.  It means that, under the system which is being operated, we have one half of the working-class population in Ballyfermot paying rent for the other half who are less able to pay.  That is very wrong.  I suggest that there devolves on the central authority of this State the duty of providing houses at reasonable rents.  I regard the present system operating in Ballyfermot as being an exploitation and a deception of working people.</P>
    <P>Last year, representations were made in this House by certain Deputies in regard to the operation of differential rents in other parts of County Dublin. One Deputy who is concerned in this particular motion, because he, apparently, wants to kill it by means of an amendment, sought in April of last <Col N="106" /> year and, again, twice in December, to bring home to the then Minister for Local Government the tremendous hardships which the people of the county were suffering through the operation of the differential renting system.  He urged upon the then Minister the need for increased subsidies for these houses as a method whereby rent levels might be reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the system operated by the Dublin Corporation there are approximately 50 different levels of differential rents.  Now, the imposition which the operation of this system must represent, so far as the local authority is concerned, and so far as expenditure on staff is concerned, has never been mentioned, but it must be a very considerable sum.  The application of the system, I believe, is unjust.  I base my case upon the system being unjust as at present operated.  Not only do I believe that, but, further, I think it is bad economics.  I believe it is a bad thing because it means that the people to whom most should be given, the people who make up the heart and the bones of this city, the people who keep our industries going and are badly paid for doing so&mdash;most of them&mdash;are not being looked after in the manner in which they should.  They are not being provided, as they should, with houses at reasonable rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that a differential renting system could be introduced which would be acceptable to those people.  I would urge on the Minister, at this stage, the advisability of considering the question of increasing the subsidies for the building of working-class houses.  The subsidies at present being paid were fixed some years ago.  I think the time has come when the central authority will have to endeavour to increase those subsidies, notwithstanding the difficulties which the present Government claims are facing it, notwithstanding the efforts of the Minister for Finance <Col N="108" /> to convince the House and the country that we are all heading for doom and disaster, notwithstanding the gloomy report of the Central Bank, with its criticisms of the ordinary people who are trying to live in the hard way in which they have to live, and notwithstanding the impudent statements made in that report in relation to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all those things, I believe that methods must and can be found for the raising of funds to increase the subsidies for the building of working-class houses.  If that were done it would help towards giving a reduction in the rents of those houses. But even before that is done it is necessary, I think, to impress on the local authorities&mdash;the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council as well&mdash;the need there is to take into consideration, in calculating the economic rent of working-class houses, the amount of the subsidies which are being given at the present time.  That, however, is not being done.  I see no reason whatever why the present situation should be allowed to continue.  I do not think anyone could make a case for the imposition which is at present being made on working-class people going into these houses.</P>
    <P>The differential rent scheme as operated in Ballyfermot has another effect&mdash;and a very bad one.  Recently, as is well known to public representatives in Dublin City and County, Dublin Corporation tried to get a clear picture of the absolute housing demand in the City of Dublin.  With that end in view they advertised in the newspapers inviting applications from all persons anxious to be housed by Dublin Corporation.  Whereas it was thought by most people that there would be a flood of applications, possibly to the number of 25,000, there were approximately 8,000 applications. It was a matter of great wonder to everybody who knew anything about housing in the City of Dublin that there should be so small a number of applications.  There was another advertisement published and a further approximately 1,000 applications resulted.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House and of everybody concerned <Col N="109" /> with housing to the meaning of that position.  Living in single rooms and double rooms in the slums of Dublin, in unspeakably bad conditions, in hovels, in back yards, even in stables, there are families who are afraid to apply to Dublin Corporation for houses, because if they were sent to Ballyfermot or some of these schemes they would find the rents impossible to pay.  That is a very serious development in our housing situation. It points to the fact that it is worse than useless to build houses if we do not give them to people at a fair rent. There are instances, which can be verified in the corporation, of people being rehoused in Ballyfermot from bad housing conditions in the slums and other such places, who went to live in Ballyfermot in the best of hopes that they could find a new life and rear their children in some kind of cleanliness and decency, and who were driven from there by their inability to pay the rent that was asked of them.  Such a situation certainly requires review by the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>Persons who apply to Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, generally speaking, find the loans available in a relatively short time and are enabled to build houses for themselves by such loans and by availing of the Government grant.  There are some thousands of such people living on the outskirts of the city.  The repayments of the loan amount, broadly speaking, to 30/- to 45/- per week, depending on the standard of building, the size of the house, and so on.  They enjoy two-thirds remission of rates for seven years.  The house they occupy is a realisable asset.  They have something which is very important: a degree of ownership.  If misfortune befalls a family in such a position they have an asset in the shape of the house which they can realise.  What right of ownership have the family taken from Gardiner Street, Summerhill, Capel Street, Waterford Street or any other tenement area and sent to Ballyfermot and made to pay 25/-, 30/- or 36/- a week?  None whatsoever.  Dublin Corporation have the same power as every <Col N="110" /> local authority in the country.  They can throw them out on the street without even giving them a reason.  I realise that this problem is a financial one at base.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because it is a financial one and because of the various interests that come to play upon it that the people concerned are suffering in the way they are.  Mayo County Council levies almost six shillings in the £ in rates in respect of their housing charges.  Mayo, as we all know, is one of the poorest counties in the country.  In Dublin Corporation, the City Fathers of the Metropolis, where all the wealth of this country is aggregated, 3/2 in the £ is the contribution to the housing of the working classes.  In Dublin, where there is a population of 500,000 and where the great profits of the mighty industries, such as we know them, are made, the contribution is 3/2 in the £.</P>
      <P>I believe that this problem can be met if the Dublin Corporation and the Minister come into consultation in its regard; if, first of all, the subsidies which are already payable by the Government are taken into account in assessing the economic rent.  That is the first necessary step.  That would reduce the rent of every tenant in Ballyfermot by at least 5/- a week. There is no reason why the subsidies should not be taken into account.  In fact, the only reason which was ever given to me for that system of not taking these subsidies into account is that it helps to reduce the rates.  That is not the purpose of housing subsidies. The purpose of housing subsidies is to help local authorities to build houses. The local authorities have a duty also to contribute as far as their means will allow to the provision of houses at reasonable rents.  Everybody who has had contact with the citizens in Ballyfermot knows very well the tremendous dissatisfaction that exists there in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Minister in this motion that he should review the position and that rents should range between 7/6 and 15/- maximum.  If we take the rent of a four-roomed corporation <Col N="111" /> house in 1939 at 12/2 and the rent of a house in Ballyfermot at the present time at 36/- &mdash;an increase of 300 per cent. &mdash;and put on the other side the percentage increase in the wages of the workers who went to live in corporation houses in 1939 and the workers who are going to live and who are living in Ballyfermot in corporation houses, we find that workers' wages did not increase since 1939 by 300 per cent.  Whereas their rents have. The highest estimate that could be given for the increases of wages of industrial workers in this city would be 90 per cent., and rents have increased by from 200 to 300 per cent.</P>
    <P>I know that this problem is not peculiar to Ballyfermot or to the City of Dublin, or indeed to the county where it also represents a great hardship on working people.  It is a problem which is becoming more difficult and more sharp in most counties throughout the country every day.  Is it unreasonable that working-class families should be provided with houses at 15/-?  It may be said, of course, and it has been said, that some working-class families to-day are earning very large sums of money between them and that they should have no objection to paying high rents, but people who look at the problem in a superficial way are apt to forget that, when the son or daughter of a householder, a working-class family, goes to work, he or she has to be clothed and fed and has to mix socially as everybody else has to do.  Most of them hope some day or other to get married. There is no inheritance left for them when they come of age and no property from which they can draw dividends. They have to save out of the money they earn, the few shillings they earn each week, in order to marry and rear families.  That saving, as we all know, takes long years of self-sacrifice, deprivation and hardship, but countless thousands of young couples in this city do it every week.</P>
    <P>Under this differential renting system, what is demanded of them is not that they should plan for the future or endeavour to help themselves by saving, but that they should reveal their total income&mdash;and the wages of most <Col N="112" /> young workers in this city would surprise many Deputies here because they are so low&mdash;to the corporation and the corporation then assesses the rent on the total family income.  I think that is a bad principle.  It is not alone bad but it is unworkable.  It may be a good argument to say that the children should contribute to the rent&mdash;it may be socially good for them&mdash;but unfortunately the wages of the vast majority of young working-class people, if they are thinking of marrying, are not such as will afford them very much opportunity of contributing to anything, unless they want to live like hermits.  I believe the assessment of the differential rent should be made upon the earnings of the head of the household.</P>
    <P>That is the traditional thing and what we have been used to all our lives.  The head of the family is responsible for the rent and that is what the heads of families throughout the city want.  They want to be responsible for the rent.  The method of the collection of the rent is a matter for themselves.  The method of dealing with their own families is a matter for themselves.  So long as we have excessive rents under a differential scheme, we will need to have continual invasion of the privacy of the home to find out what Jack is earning and what Mary is earning and what the other members of the household are earning. That is not a good thing.  If we had a reasonable system of differential rents, that need not operate because people would not object&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that a differential rating scheme can be operated, and fairly operated, but not in its present form as applying to the City and County of Dublin.  I do not think that working-class families in the City of Dublin are in a position to pay more than 15/- a week at present for houses.  Many of them are not able to pay even that amount, <Col N="114" /> but double that and more than double that amount is being asked of them, and I want the Minister to look into the position.  I am speaking in this matter for large numbers of people, and every Deputy who has any knowledge whatever of the city will know that this system of differential rating is causing continual trouble.  I believe in the maxim: &ldquo;From each according to his ability and to each according to his need.&rdquo;&ldquo;According to his ability to pay&rdquo;&mdash;I believe the ability of the tenants in Ballyfermot is being overtaxed.</P>

      <P>I have outlined briefly my views on this matter and I take it that I will have an opportunity later to reply to the movers of the amendment and I will be interested in hearing what they have to say.  I put the motion to the House however, in the belief, as I said before that the system at present being operated is wrong and that it imposes too great a hardship on people in Ballyfermot and that a remedy can be found in reducing rent <Col N="115" /> levels.  I ask the House to accept the motion because the people of that particular area are very hard hit, very hard pressed, at the present time in having to face the rents imposed by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;that the revision of the differential renting scheme for Ballyfermot is a matter for the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>I was very interested when I read this motion on the Order Paper.  I was interested in what was at the back of its movers' minds because I happen to know, as my colleagues on Dublin Corporation know, a great deal about this very difficult subject.  All Deputy Dunne has said has proved to me one thing: he does not know what differential renting in fact means.  In the beginning he took pride&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;in indicating that differential renting should be attributed to the late James Larkin, but he did not tell the House the approach of those who believed in it then and who believe in it now.  In pre-war days it was easy to regulate the cost of housing, to fix rents in a normal way and, where rises took place&mdash;they might be insignificant as compared to the rises which now take place&mdash;to get the Government to give additional subsidy both by way of increased grant and of increased contribution to interest charges on money borrowed for the purpose of building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that Deputy Dunne is not honest in the thing, but I certainly say that Deputy Dunne has not spent very much time in examining this problem from its origin up to now.  I would like him to go into the library of the Dáil and find out the great and rapid progress which was made between the year 1932 and the outbreak of war not alone in the actual building of houses but in the subsidising of such houses so that cheap, decent housing could be provided for the people of our country.  Deputy Dunne is trying to cash in on a <Col N="116" /> situation and I am going to show the House and put on record where Deputy Dunne is trying to cash in. It is very easy to go around among people who are suffering great hardship and organise them into vocal critics; it is easy to be the great leader who is going to get something for nothing, but Deputy Dunne has not been able to suggest to the House a way of doing it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne referred to the members of Dublin Corporation but apparently he knows nothing about proceedings there although there are some Labour representatives on Dublin Corporation.  We all differ politically in this House and form different groups and the corporation varies similarly, but this problem has been meticulously examined and analysed with a view to seeing what should be done.  First of all let me give the House my interpretation, my definition, of differential renting.  The first approach was made to it even before the war when houses were let at an average economic rent to all people but whereunder there was no possibility of giving relief to people whose circumstances had worsened since they took up occupation.  When Deputy Dunne speaks of an average rent of 15/- per house in 1939 he does not realise that everybody had to pay that 15/- a week and that if the breadwinner of a household lost his job or died there was no means by which the corporation could bring relief to his family by reducing the rent.  At the same time, at the creation of these houses, in the sense of subsidies and capital grants from the Government and from the community, they were meant for the artisan class, the working class.  Deputy Dunne is allowing himself to be led by a few other agitators who are wiser than he is himself into making a case for allowing people into subsidised houses who have incomes of £40 or £50 a week coming into their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of Deputy Dunne's friends went around and organised an objection to the corporation trying to find out <Col N="118" /> whether a man who came as a working man claiming to be entitled to a house really owned two or three branches of a pork shop or something.  They would still pay 15/-.  Deputy Dunne talks about poor working people being exploited, but the Deputy is one of those in this House who were against the repeated crime of the corporation investigating a private home or individual, and who said that the corporation had no right to find out the earnings of an individual occupying a house subsidised by the workers although he might not even be a worker himself.</P>
    <P>We decided that we would examine this thing carefully and closely to see what could be done.  The first thing that concerned us was the case where the breadwinner had lost his job, become ill or died.  We had to find means to bring immediate relief to that family without having to dispossess them of the house.  Deputy Dunne has not told us that there are people, many people, in Ballyfermot to-day, unfortunate people in bad circumstances, who pay a rent of something like 7/6 a week or less.  Every member of Dublin Corporation knows that the average rents received in areas where the differential renting scheme applies are not 30/- or 36/- a week.  Deputy Dunne knows that, but it does not suit his case to state that here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some people paying that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to those. I represent the Ballyfermot area in so far as the City of Dublin is concerned and, when the extension of the boundary will be effected, I will probably represent, or contest for the purpose of representing in this House the whole of the Ballyfermot area.  I know that attempts will be made to use what I am saying against me but I know also that the vast majority of the workers residing in those houses are sufficiently honest to appreciate our approach to the matter.  The proof of that lies in the fact that the Labour Party who, in my constituency, took the view now expressed by Deputy Dunne, did not get even a single member returned to this House and their <Col N="119" /> representation in the corporation went down to four.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne talked about pre-war rents.  It is true that pre-war rents were, by comparison with present-day rents, much lower, but does the Deputy not want to admit that when the average rent was in the neighbourhood of 12/9, or whatever it was, the wages of the workers were relatively much lower?  Does he suggest that the worker to-day is earning exactly the same as he earned in 1938 or 1939?  Does he suggest that the cost of building materials has not gone up? Let us be quite frank and straightforward about the matter.  Not only have wages gone up 100 per cent. for workers in the building trade but output has gone down considerably.  I say that without fear of contradiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that output has gone down.  I am not complaining about it.  I am telling you the truth.  Wages have gone up and, by arrangement with trade unions, output has gone down, and, consequently, the cost of houses has gone up.  You who have benefited by increased wages and a lesser output now want a reduction in rents. Is that a common-sense way to <Col N="120" /> approach this problem?  All of us in the Dublin Corporation are trying to agree on this question.  We certainly agreed that a further step should be the reduction by 1/- a week of the rent in these houses, under a differential renting system, for every child in the household under 16 years of age who is not working.  In the case of large families of eight or ten, there will be 8/- or 10/- a week reduction on the economic rent fixed by way of a further subsidy by the rate-payers of Dublin.  Deputy Dunne never heard of that.  A calculation of the increase on the rates to meet that particular benefit is 4½d. in the pound. Deputy Dunne takes figures that are of yesterday and uses them to suit his purpose.  The figure of 3/2 in the £ on the rates of Dublin in the subsidising of houses was, in fact, the figure of 18 months ago.  Since then, quite a number of houses have been built. I do not know the exact figure.  By the time our proposed housing schemes have been fulfilled and when we reach what we think will be the immediate needs, there will be approximately 6/6 or 7/- on the rates as a result of the efforts of the Dublin Corporation to meet the housing need and tax the community to bring it about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not realise what he is saying.  The vast amount of our rates come, not from the unfortunately small amount of business we have in the sense of ratepayers but from the working classes and the citizens themselves.  Those are the people who are paying.  Each neighbour has to pay for the other.  It is not a question of putting 100 per cent. on the rates of some business men in Grafton Street.  That will not bring much relief.  Every penny in the rates means £10,000.  If we put 5/- in the pound on the ratepayers who are described as &ldquo;big business,&rdquo; it would not go very far.  Our city is a big city. We have a vast number of people living there.  They are all ratepayers and a substantial sum comes in from them. Of course, the bulk of them are workers.</P>
      <P>In making his case in connection with this differential renting system, the Deputy emphasised a half dozen times that the system is forcing people in Dublin into houses at 36/- a week. The Deputy did not trouble to find out how many houses there are in the scheme at 36/- a week.  Neither has he taken the care to tell us why 36/- a week is demanded in certain cases.  If the Deputy wanted to help his fellow-worker, help the community and help us while we are representing the people in these matters, he would advise the people to understand what it all means.  Grants and subsidies for houses for the working classes should be applied to the working classes. There must be a limit to the income of the individual where such application is made.  Those people who have a substantial income should be able to contribute to their own keep and not expect their neighbours, who are worse off than themselves, to be contributing by way of rates to a reduction in their rents.</P>

    <P>The Deputy talked about houses on hire-purchase or what is called tenant-purchase. It is open to every citizen &mdash;particularly to those who are forced to pay the highest of our rents, as they would certainly qualify on the basis of income if they are in steady employment&mdash;to <Col N="122" /> make application to the corporation to acquire a house on the tenant-purchase scheme.  We are considering that.  I do not think it can be suggested that Deputy Alderman Byrne is a particular lover of mine, but he will admit that we all sit down together to see how we can meet these things.  One of the things we are in agreement on is to see to what extent we can make possible the right to every corporation tenant in Dublin to acquire his house under a tenant-purchase scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of Ballyfermot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not in respect of Ballyfermot&mdash;and there is a good reason for that.  You cannot expect people to be encouraged to become tenant-purchasers in a house which may not suit them in a matter of eight or ten years.  We are not going to lure them in to buy houses and to create the asset&mdash;this notional asset which Deputy Dunne had in mind when he suddenly became a financier.  He suddenly talks about the capital rights of the members of the working-class, when he can buy a house and create a vested interest, his equity, which he could sell when he wanted to move out. It is all right for the worker to have capital there, but it is all wrong for the business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He objects to the scrutiny, as he calls it, of the occupant of this house. He does not realise that there is a means test applied with greater force to the business community.  I do not know whether Deputy Dunne ever had the privilege or the annoyance of having to pay income-tax, but if he were in business he would have to submit to the scrutiny of the Revenue Commissioners, and all through he would realise that that is where scrutiny begins and scrutiny exists. All we ask the applicant to do is to fill in a form and state the circumstances in his income if he wants something from the community.  If you want something you must at least make <Col N="123" /> a case to get it.  There are means tests &mdash;unfortunately there have to be in present circumstances &mdash; and when people have to pay income-tax there is a means test applied.  You have to be told how much you will be let keep for yourself, what benefits you get if you have children under 16, or if you have them at college, or if there is some other particular reason.  The Deputy wants this means test on the people he abhors and hates without knowing the why and the wherefore; but he wants it for himself in a different way. When it comes to the acquisition of a house by the working class, there the Deputy agrees that capitalism shall reign supreme; but when it comes to getting the wherewithal to give that house to the working man, capitalism must be destroyed.  The Deputy does not even know what he is talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between Deputy Dunne and ourselves is this. Deputy Cowan, Deputy Byrne and myself&mdash;I do not see others of the corporation here&mdash;are partners in a scheme to provide, amongst other matters, working-class dwellings which can be either rented or bought; and we are not going to suggest selling houses to our people, under any scheme whatever, unless we are satisfied that in the long run they will get something worth the money they are asked to pay. We are building special types of houses for tenant-purchasers.  Go up to Philipsburgh Avenue and you will see houses we can sell with safety, guaranteeing that these are houses you can <Col N="124" /> put your savings into.  We are not going to argue that other types of house would be a good buy.  We must protect these people against themselves, we bad boys of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy forgot something.  During the period immediately preceding the end of the emergency, the then Fianna Fáil Government realising that house building had stopped, for the reasons well known to us, realised that with the increase in wages and the increase in the cost of materials and the other reasons, the cost of building would be very much dearer than it was pre-war.  What did they do?  I would like Deputy Dunne to listen to this.</P>

      <P>That was a fund established by the Fianna Fáil Government to give extra grants to local authorities in order that this increased cost could be met to a certain extent and thereby prevent an unreasonable rise in the rents of houses.  The fund was one of £5,000,000 and it was used as fast as the houses could be built and given to the local authorities for the houses they were building.  When the Deputy was a member of a Coalition Party that supported a Coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was in the period of office of that Coalition Government that these tremendous rises took place in rents.

      <P>What Deputy Dunne wants now, in the present set of costings, is that houses should be built, as he said himself, to be let at no more than 15/-, with allowances for large families and newly-weds, and he says ways must be found to do it.  I have not heard a single suggestion of the way it can be done.  All I know at the moment is that it costs so much to build a house.  The local authority has to get permission to borrow the money.  They get a certain amount of support from the State by way of capital grant and remission of interest charges, and where there are these suffocating people in the slums they get a grant from the Government towards the relief of interest of 66? per cent.  Of the cost of the interest charges, where there are condemned houses and they are relieving the slums.  On the main houses it is 33? per cent.  The fact is, one has got to reckon in pounds, shillings and pence.</P>

At the same time, the local authorities <Col N="127" /> should not go ahead in a harebrained fashion, causing a few people to pay unlimited sums of money to somebody at some time, from goodness knows where.</P>

      <P>The amendment I put down to this motion is that the differential rents system generally and, in particular, with reference to the Ballyfermot area is a matter for the local authorities concerned.  If and when the local authorities can design a scheme, or schemes, which can be put into operation and if they find they need further relief they can then make an approach as a united body to the Minister for Local Government with a view to finding out if further assistance can be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> It is not a matter that can be settled in this House because it is highly technical. It is technical from the point of view of whether it is to be met from the people concerned.  It is technical from the point of view of the actual housing, where they need to be built and how they are to be financed under the prevailing circumstances in the districts where the building is going on. There is no use saying we are lending money to England at less than 1 per cent.  Any money which our Central Bank may lend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that this motion will be rejected and the amendment carried.  I repeat that this is, in fact, a matter entirely for the local authorities. Each local authority must deal separately with its own particular problem quite apart from the problem of a neighbouring local authority. Nobody can suggest that the Dublin housing problem is on all fours with that of County Dublin, or on all fours with the housing problems of Cork or of any other city in Ireland.  Ours is a huge problem that will take years to solve.  Deputy Dunne talked about the advertisement of the Dublin Corporation and 8,000 to 9,000 applications for houses, and said it was because the applicants could not pay the rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problem is to eliminate slumdom and to create, as fast as possible, proper housing conditions for our people.  In roughly under 20 years we have built almost 30,000 houses in the City of Dublin, and we estimate that we may have to build a further 20,000 before we will reach what one might call a proper easement of the position. We all know the difficulties, and I say to Deputy Dunne that he would be better advised to accept the amendment and to leave the solving of these <Col N="129" /> problems, so far as they concern Dublin City, to the Dublin Corporation. We have had many consultations with a view to finding out how best to meet the situation.  We would like to have it clear cut so that, as public representatives, we can say &ldquo;that is what we have done and this is why we have done it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is easy to get up and make a case to increase this or to reduce that without having the actual responsibility of doing it.  We regard ourselves in the Dublin Corporation as a very fit body of men.  We can fight with each other, we can argue with each other, but at least we can present each other with this, that, in chamber, council, and particularly in committee, where we have no verbatim reports or no newspapers, each and every one of us has his own conscience to dictate to him how to do things in the best possible way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second Deputy Briscoe's amendment and, in doing so, I shall consider Deputy Dunne's motion.  He was very verbose in the House this evening.  He challenged me as to whether I was against the differential rent system or <i>vice versa.</i> The good turns men do live after them, or maybe I should put it the other way &mdash;the bad turns men do live after them, the good ones are often interred with their bones.  So, too, with Deputy Dunne and with the then Minister for Local Government when they first introduced the differential rent system into Ireland.  Deputy Dunne states here that he is in favour of the differential rent system.  There was never a system introduced into this country that has caused so much ill-will.  Since its introduction three years ago in County Dublin each man and woman is spying on neighbours.  They are saying: &ldquo;Thomas Peter has a house for 9/- and he is drawing more money per week than we are.  Peter Anthony has to pay 24/- per week, but Mr. So-and-So has a house for 9/- per week.  He is working with So-and-So and he has an income of £15 per week.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the whole system is vicious, and I leave the whole blame on Deputy Dunne's shoulders, because he never murmured, at least that I <Col N="130" /> am aware of, when this system was introduced.  Even if the Minister for Local Government were a superman, he would not be able, with a stroke of the pen, to rectify this gross injustice which the Deputy, in company with the then Minister for Local Government, introduced.  He instructed the various committees throughout the country to adopt it three years ago, and now he wants the Minister for Local Government to change it all as if he were Alice in Wonderland and could wave a wand.  I really had some regard for Deputy Dunne until he brought this motion forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne expects the Minister for Local Government to do what his own colleague, the Minister for Local Government, failed to do.  It would have been very easy to stop the differential rent system at the beginning.  It would have been very easy, before this system was introduced, to leave the Transition Development Fund there at that time and allow everybody to have a house at a reasonable rent.  Instead of that he expects the Minister now in charge, after a few months as Minister for Local Government, to come along and clear the bad legacy of three years' working.  If Deputy Dunne was in the Minister's shoes he could not do it.  I am still strongly opposed to the differential rent system because I feel it has brought a tremendous amount of ill-will into our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am defending the Minister on this thing.  I attended a number of meetings throughout County Dublin dealing with the differential rent system and, if you do not mind, I was at a meeting recently in the Bakers' Hall, Gardiner Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very nice meeting.  Deputy Dunne was there, and Senator Tunney.  My company was exceptionally good and we discussed <Col N="131" /> things in a very harmonious manner, as I thought.  At that meeting we were trying to get the tenants to organise as best they could in their own respective areas.  The idea of the organisation was to try to get the person who was paying only 9/- a week rent to agree to pay a maximum of some given amount and to put this proposal to the Dublin County Council with a view to their accepting an average rent from everybody no matter who it was.  This would abolish the bad system of one person paying 9/- and another paying 24/-.  This whole system is wrong and it has created a great deal of ill-will in the country.</P>
      <P>It was agreed at that committee that an effort would be made to organise all these rents.  The next bombshell we got was from Senator Tunney.  He said: &ldquo;I am not going to vote that a person paying a rent of 9/- should pay 12/6 as an average rent.&rdquo;  My colleague, Deputy Dunne, came along and he told them that he had a motion down and that he was putting it before the Minister for Local Government as soon as the Dáil would assemble.  I became very annoyed that night but I said I would wait until the motion came to be dealt with in the House. I call that arch-hypocrisy of the first water, with not a shred of honesty or decency.  During my time on the Opposition benches I dealt with the Minister for Local Government; I asked questions and I also asked them of the present Minister.  I have always admitted that I opposed the differential rent system and I still oppose it.</P>
      <P>At the same time it is expecting too much of any particular Minister to cure the bad deeds of his predecessor, because if Deputy Smith, the Minister for Local Government, were a thousand times better than he is, and if he had greater influence in the country, he could not come along and say to the Dublin County Council or the Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;You will have to change your tactics altogether in regard to this rent system.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This system has always caused trouble and will continue to do so when you are dealing with this <Col N="132" /> hypocrisy of one section of the labour element in County Dublin saying one thing and another saying another and trying to bluff the unfortunate people in Ballyfermot that they are doing something worth while for them.  At the same time they are applauding the Minister who introduced the scheme. Now they want the Minister for Local Government to eliminate the scheme.</P>
    <P>The reason I put my name to the amendment is that I feel that this matter will have to be handled first with the councils and corporations throughout the country.  I would favour even now the Minister for Local Government inviting a number of experts on this system to investigate it thoroughly.  I know Deputy Dunne agreed, of course, to the voting away of £5,000,000 from the Transition Development Fund which was responsible for the introduction of this accursed scheme three years ago.  Then he comes along and challenges me in this House.  This system has created a very bad spirit among the people of Ballyfermot&mdash;one family watching the other.  If Mary goes to work the inspector will call and say: &ldquo;Why did not you tell me that Mary was working last week.&rdquo;  Peter was working two weeks ago: &ldquo;Why did you not tell me so that your rent could be raised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I only say, God forgive the Labour Party and the Labour Minister for introducing that scheme that has been responsible for so much ill-will since its initiation.  I hope posterity will forgive them for all the bad feeling caused in our country in that way.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister should ask the Dublin Corporation to consider this whole system, not alone as far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned but the county councils and other bodies throughout the country.  Deputy Dunne is cashing <Col N="133" /> in on this thing by telling us that he has a motion that will cure all the ills. But he did not tell the meeting that day.  I spared him that day because I said I would leave it for the Dáil. He did not tell the House that day that he supported the Minister in bringing in that system, that he believes in that system now and that he believes in it firmly.</P>
      <P>I do not know if, even now at the eleventh hour, we can get down to discussing this matter away from politics completely, so that we can consider the injury that the differential rents system has caused in the country and the lack of goodwill that it has created amongst our people because an inspector in making inquiries will go to the neighbour two doors away or to some child whom he meets on the street to find out whether there is another child working in a particular house.  Instead of building up goodwill and harmony amongst the people living on certain housing estates, it is building up ill-will. The bad turns men do live after them.  So it is with the differential rents system which Deputy Dunne supported.</P>

      <P>I do not want to detain the House too long but I ask the Minister to deal with the number of examples I have given him from Ballyfermot and other areas in County Dublin.  I would ask him to consult the Dublin Corporation in regard to that matter.  Deputy Briscoe made his case here so far as the corporation is concerned.  He went into the question very fully but I will say that I am definitely opposed to the whole differential rents system.  I suggest that the only way the matter can be solved is by bringing representatives of the various councils together to see what can be done to eliminate the viciousness that has been introduced into life in this country.  A number of agitators have been busy in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to point out to the Minister that the newly-weds living in the Ballyfermot area feel that they have to pay very high rents in being called upon to pay 30/- per week for a three-roomed house.  I know the Dublin <Col N="134" /> Corporation may have its responsibilities but I suggest that it is morally wrong to ask a young married man earning £5 or £6 a week to pay 30/- a week for a three-roomed house in that area.  Why is that?  Just because Deputy Dunne agreed that the Transition Development Fund which was there to subsidise houses, should go by the board.</P>

      <P>I apologise if I am repeating myself.  I received a number of deputations from tenants in the Ballyfermot area and the more I hear of this accursed system, the more I hate it.  The longer it is there, the more it will cause trouble and ill-will. I would therefore ask the Minister to request the Dublin Corporation to supply him with a report on these schemes.  I know he cannot direct the Dublin Corporation to do certain things because we are living in a democratic country.  Deputy Dunne knows that, too, and he put down his motion merely to embarrass the Minister.  He knew he was responsible for the introduction of the whole scheme and, in fact, on a number of occasions he repeated the statement that he was in favour of the differential rents system.  I do not see how Deputy Dunne can have it both ways. I have already supplied the Minister with details of cases of hardship in the Ballyfermot scheme, and I shall continue to do so where I think hardship is being imposed.  Finally, may I say that I hope Deputy Dunne will tell the people of Ballyfermot that the bad deeds that he perpetrated when he was a member of the Government Party are still living, after that Government has passed out of existence.  Perhaps he might be able to get them to forgive him because there are a number of them very bitter about it.  I shall not make the case any harder for him because I know what a great man he is and how well he is able to bluff. I would not be trotting in the same street with him, so far as bluffing is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out, there is nothing either in the motion or in the amendment calling for the abolition of the differential rents system.  In the motion a request was made to the Minister that as the present level of differential rents in Ballyfermot is excessive, to revise it, and in the amendment it is suggested that the revision of the scheme in Ballyfermot is a matter for the local authorities concerned.  Deputy Briscoe, to my mind, made a very admirable case for the amendment, which suggests the appropriate way to deal with this problem as I understand it.  Here in Dublin, as I see it, the system of differential rents is still suffering from <Col N="136" /> growing pains and, not having reached maturity, it is causing a certain amount of annoyance.  As one who, like Deputy Corry, at another time had had some experience of such annoyance, I shall give a brief recital of the problem and how it was dealt with elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In 1934 a differential rents system was introduced in certain housing schemes in Cork.  There were 1,000 houses in Gurranebraher and 500 houses at Spanglehill, and in order to provide for people who were being removed from unhealthy and insanitary houses and from overcrowded multiple houses, differential rents were fixed from 3/- to 18/-.  Of course, there was some agitation for some time as to how these particular rents applied.  A means test was necessary in order to suit the incomes and circumstances of the various families who got the tenancies of these houses.</P>
      <P>In order to provide in some way for the varying circumstances it was decided that the first 10/- of the chief bread - winner's earnings would not be reckoned and that the first 5/- of every other earner in the house would not be reckoned, up to a maximum of 40/-. If you subtract that 10/- and the sums of 5/- to be taken into account and divide by six you get the rent of the family up to a maximum of 18/-.  If the division by six was a lower figure, then that lower figure was the rent for the particular family.</P>
      <P>For a time there was a certain amount of deception, if you like, particularly in regard to casual work by sons or daughters.  In order that the residents in each particular area would have an opportunity of bringing forward their grievance and pointing out any other way to approach the matter, a public inquiry was called for.  Inspectors were sent down from the Department to hold that inquiry and even those people who had combined in order to agitate and various others did not present any evidence whatever and were of very little help to the inquiry.  Since then there have been very few complaints, as they got an opportunity of stating their case and did not avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, children's allowances are not reckoned in the consideration <Col N="137" /> of these rents or gratuities, or awards to members of the emergency Defence Forces or things of that kind.  Instead, as Deputy Briscoe stated, of making a deduction of 1/- per head for members of the family under 16, the system adopted was to make the deductions on the lower figure of earnings amongst the members of the family. That system is going along very well.</P>
    <P>If the tenants of these houses thought their position in life and their circumstances were such that they would not be unemployed or would not be casual workers at some time, they were entitled to claim the fixed rent of 18/-, and that was done in a number of cases in which there were no more inquiries as to wages or anything of that kind.  But the corporation found, in order to provide for a big number of people in casual employment, such as dock workers who are employed when ships come in and who are unemployed when trade is slack, that a certain number of these houses would have to be kept on the differential rent basis.  In recent years, the rents of these houses vary from 6/- to 30/-, calculated on the basis I have indicated. Of course, as these matters arise, various devices can be adopted to try and give relief to the families who deserve it.  But, with the rising costs of housing at the moment, I think there is no other system which will enable local authorities to provide houses for people who have to be removed from unhealthy housing conditions and perhaps have not very much means or very bright prospects, except the differential rent system.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have some other housing schemes in the city to which these people may be transferred as vacancies arise.  But, taking it generally, the differential rent system is working well.  Personally, I am in favour of it. In the year 1947, the cost of maintenance of some of these differential rent houses went up like the cost of everything else.  In consequence, the lower figure was raised gradually and, instead of being 3/-, is 4/-, and the higher figure is 19/-.  As I said, there are 1,600 of these houses and we find them of great advantage in housing the portion of the population to which I referred.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister should be the deciding factor in connection with differential rents because I do not think he could do it and it is a matter for the local authorities.  It was regrettable to hear all the matters brought into the discussion by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Burke about differential rents. Deputy MacCarthy has stated the position in Cork.  While agreeing that we should have a differential rent system for those poor people who cannot afford the economic rent for a house, I am opposed to the tenants of the corporation being the only people to bear the costs of these differential rents.  As far as I can understand that is happening in Dublin to a greater extent even than in Cork.  If a man paying 18/- or 19/- becomes ill and cannot pay that rent, it is reduced to 6/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man is paying a rent of 36/- in Dublin because the income is a large one, what is the economic rent of that house?  As far as Cork is concerned, we have to bear in mind that some of these houses were let for a number of years at 12/- or 13/- and when the differential rent system came in the rent went up to 19/- because of the increased earnings of the families. I am living in a house on which the landlord cannot increase the rent because of the Rent Restrictions Acts. But public authorities are at liberty to raise the rents as they are not bound by the Rent Restrictions Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While agreeing that it is desirable to have a differential rent system in order that people with small incomes should not be subject to eviction because they cannot pay the economic rent, it is wrong that tenants in corporation houses should have to pay <Col N="139" /> the full differential rents in order to make up for the deficiencies of the people who cannot pay.  Deputy MacCarthy pointed out that 10/- is deducted from the earnings of the chief bread-winner, 5/- from the earnings of other members of the family, and that the income is then divided by six.  We had a very long discussion when that system was brought in and we were advocating that one-eighth of the income should be earmarked for rent, but it is fixed at one-sixth.  We should not, in connection with this matter, be attacking each other or trying to score points.  I say it is wrong that Corporation tenants only should have to make up for the differential rent of persons who cannot pay the economic rent. That is what is happening in Cork.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister can intervene in this, as it is a matter for the local authorities.  There is a good case to be made for the differential rent system.  I am not supporting the motion, but I cannot agree that the balance of the rent should be levied off the tenants of corporation houses. I think there is a case there for investigation.  I can give the House an illustration in Cork.  We have something over 3,200 houses.  The differential rents range from 4/- or 6/- per week to 18/- and 24/- per week.  The cost on the rates of housing in Cork is only 3d. in the pound.  That is evidence that the tenants in the Cork Corporation houses are making up by the differential rents for the people who cannot afford to pay rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I took office as Minister for Local Government the subject of differential renting is one to which I have endeavoured to give as much thought and study as I could.  While trying to be brief in telling the House the conclusions at which I have arrived perhaps it will make what I have to say more convincing if I confess at the outset that the differential renting system was one which never appealed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact all my prejudices were against the system and it may be that some of the immature conclusions at which I have arrived were influenced to some extent by the housing problem as I saw it in relation to county council rather than in relation to bodies dealing mainly with built-up areas such as those here in the City of Dublin and in the other cities and large towns throughout the country.  I have seized upon every opportunity that presented itself of discussing the problem with those who have definite views upon this matter. I have read everything that I could both for and against the system. I think that the conclusions at which I have arrived cannot be regarded as being in any way prejudiced by a view I held in advance.</P>
      <P>The one difficulty in dealing with this system arises out of the fact that when one meets a Deputy or a member of a local authority it is very difficult to get them to make up their minds as to whether or not they are in favour of the principle of differential renting. I noticed that tendency on the part of Deputy Dunne this evening.  I try at all times to think clearly, and if I am in doubt about some particular matter, such as the one involved in the consideration of this motion, then I wade through everything I can find in order to clear my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no use my saying I am in favour of the principle of differential renting <Col N="141" /> and then proceeding to stipulate one condition after another, conditions which may have the effect of satisfying those who are the tenants under the differential renting system in the local authority areas.  It is no use accepting that principle and stipulating a number of conditions the acceptance or application of which will have the effect of knocking the bottom out of the system.  I would invite those who have responsibility for this problem, whether they be Deputies or members of local authorities, to face up to the matter and to ask themselves the simple question: Is it possible for the State and the local authority to solve the housing problem having regard to the cost of housing now unless such a system is introduced?  Would it be fair to ask the taxpayers in this small and relatively poor country and the rate-payers&mdash;many of whom, as Deputy Briscoe has pointed out, are very poor people&mdash;to provide houses for individuals and families whose incomes are known to be sufficient to pay an economic rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we come to answer the question which I posed as to the acceptance or otherwise of the principle involved we have got to consider <Col N="142" /> a second question.  If the principle is accepted, let us decide for ourselves how the family income should be determined.  Is it fair to say, as some Deputies suggest, that the family income should be determined solely and entirely by the wage or income, whatever it may be, received by the head of the household?  Is that a fair proposition?  Would it be fair, for example, to ask the ratepayers and taxpayers of this country to subsidise a house for the head of a family who was in receipt, say, of £5 or £6 a week down to the level of that wage, while other members of his family were in receipt of £15 or £16?  Let the advocates of the system and let the critics of the system clarify their minds on this issue.</P>
      <P>I received a deputation from the area to which this motion refers and that deputation stayed with me from 3 o'clock until 7.30.  It was not the only deputation I received on this subject and I can assure the House that there was no aspect of this question into which we did not go. While I am posing these questions to the House I want the House to understand that this is primarily a matter for the local bodies all over the country.  These local bodies know the provision that is made by the State from the sums made available by the taxpayer for the rehousing of those who require to be rehoused.  The Minister for Local Government and the Department of Local Government have, naturally, an obligation placed upon them to see that the money that is provided by the taxpayer, and the contribution that is made from the rates, is devoted to the rehousing of certain limited classes of the people who want to be rehoused, and that those whose earning capacity is substantial will not be allowed to steal in upon these two sources and impose an unreasonable burden upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know as well as any man in this House how effectively one could speak outside as to the undesirability of officials of the Dublin Corporation or the Cork Corporation or officials of any local bodies probing into the affairs of the household.  I suppose that if I wanted to go on the hustings <Col N="143" /> myself I could make a case attacking all the undesirabilities of that system, and many of them would occur to my mind without any preparation whatever.</P>
    <P>As some Deputies have stated, this is a practical problem.  I am a countryman and I believe in and love ownership. Naturally, any man with that sort of background wants to see that that sort of principle will apply to every other citizen in the land, whether it be in regard to the ownership of a house or anything else.  I have said that I have been reading a little.  In the course of what I read, I came across some evidence that was tendered before a committee of inquiry in Dublin in 1938.  It will bring home to any reasonable man or woman the sort of problem with which all concerned have had to deal in recent years, having regard to general tendencies in prices and so forth.  The evidence was given by an official who had intimate connection with the rehousing activities of the Dublin Corporation. He said: &ldquo;There is the man who cannot pay rent.  My sympathies are more with that man than with the man with a small family who can pay rent.  But if a man cannot pay I must leave him aside.&rdquo;  Later, this same official makes the following statement: &ldquo;If the tuberculous case cannot afford to pay rent for a house he cannot be transferred even though he is a very deserving case.  That man has to be passed over on the grounds that although his case is very urgent the corporation is not able to suit him.  The case has to be postponed.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the allocation of tenancies officer.  I did not know myself who he was.  The inquiry was held in 1938.  Deputy Dunne stated that he is not against the principle of differential renting&mdash;yet in his motion he stipulated the maximum rent that should be charged to any tenant and he has indicated what the minimum should be. Even if effect were given to what is provided in the motion in that regard, <Col N="144" /> grave injustice could be done not only to the taxpayer and to the ratepayer but also to the person who would be obliged to pay the minimum rent, because the income of the person who would be getting away with the maximum rent might be 20 times greater than that of the person paying the minimum rent.  I should like that there should be no attempt to score one off another in regard to this matter.  I have not the slightest desire for such an activity.  This question is too serious for that.  The difficulties with which the State and the local bodies are confronted are too great to be treated in such a manner.  I am prepared to concede that if you want to be destructive you can flitter the system with a sort of half-hearted acceptance of it, with questioning the inclusion of this item or the exclusion of that item, with raising the question as to what contribution is being made by the person who is paying an economic rent towards the provision of other houses for people of the lower income classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, that is unfair and unjust.  It is an indefensible case to make.  There is no substance and no truth in it.  I am not saying that the case is being deliberately made in the sense of stating an untruth, but I say it in the sense that I would advise and hope that those who have that feeling or belief would examine the question further.  Certain numbers were quoted of people who are paying 30/- a week in respect of houses.  Deputies may take it that these rents were arrived at on the basis of what the family income is.  I ask those who are critics of that rent to say, should it be the head of the household only whose income would be taken into account in calculating the differential rent?  Is it fair to ask an unmarried daughter, or an unmarried son, who is living in the house, to pay a portion of the rent if it can be shown that the income of the whole household is from £18 to £25 a week?  Is it fair to ask the classes I have mentioned to contribute, and is it not right and reasonable to say that the income of the father, who is the head of the household, plus the income of every adult member of the family&mdash; that portion of the income which the local authority determines&mdash;should be <Col N="145" /> included in the calculation?  If one of those boys or girls gets married and breaks the family connection, then, of course, they have their own lives to face, and their income can, and must, be excluded from the calculation.</P>
    <P>I would ask those who say that that is an unreasonable approach, and that it is an unjust method of calculating the family income, to say it so clearly that the public will understand it. When they mention a rent of 36/- a week in Ballyfermot, I ask them to let the public know that that rent is based upon the known income, and that the rent of 36/- is only the equivalent of what is necessary to meet the State and the local authority outgoings in the provision of these houses, because it is not true to say that it makes any contribution whatever to the provision of houses for the poorer classes.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this House, in its housing legislation from 1932 onwards, has written certain priorities into the Housing Acts which the local bodies must observe and follow, would it be correct to allow a system to continue such as that which is described in the two extracts I have quoted from this official of the Dublin Corporation in regard to rehousing people, such as tuberculosis cases, and others unable to pay rent?  Surely, when we write into our legislation certain priorities we must see to it, in co-operation with the local authorities, that effect is given to them, and that the preferences that are there expressed will be carried out.  I would like to see some way out of the difficulty, but the only way in which I can see that being done is by the adoption of some system such as this differential renting system.</P>
    <P>I have quite a lot of material here before me, but I do not think I will have time to deal with all of it.  I do not fit in well with a situation in which my time is limited.  There is just one point, however, which I would ask Deputy Dunne to consider.  He referred to the contribution made by the Dublin rates to the rehousing of people in need in Dublin City.  In the course of his speech he took a certain view.  He, or anybody else, is entitled to take that view if he is convinced that it is the <Col N="146" /> right view.  He seemed to think that the contribution might be greater, especially in regard to certain ratepayers in the city.  What I am going to ask him is this, and I am not doing so in defence of the ratepayers whom he has in mind.  Suppose it were conceded that these ratepayers could and should make a higher contribution, what case could Deputy Dunne make for allowing another family, whose income could be clearly shown to be round about £25 a week, to be rehoused at the expense not only of the ratepayer who could afford to pay, but of the ratepayer who could not afford to pay?</P>
    <P>Since I came into this Department I have tried to approach this matter in the most objective way that any man could approach it.</P>
    <P>I have in mind many clear and unanswerable points in favour of some system to which I never felt I was wedded.  I would like very much to see some person apply his mind to those points and knock them down if he could.  But, listening to Deputy Dunne, I said to myself: Supposing Deputy Dunne is right and that there are ratepayers who should pay more, that the rate in Dublin is too small for rehousing as compared, say, with the rate charged in County Mayo: supposing he is right in his advocacy along those lines, why should he say that a family with the sort of income to which I have referred should not meet its full commitments and pay the full economic rent?  Why should a family in such circumstances, if it is possible for it to get a new house by any other means, say, through the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and by means of a grant&mdash;if the case is a sustainable one and that it could rehouse itself under more favourable circumstances&mdash;be subsidised by the local authority in Dublin or anywhere else, while there are thousands of people with low incomes who have to be catered for and are being catered for?</P>
    <P>There is one other extract that I would like to give from the evidence and the conclusions that were reached by the committee to which I have referred from the evidence of the official of the Dublin Corporation from which <Col N="147" /> I have already quoted.  This is what is said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For a very large percentage of working-class families it is impossible under the present renting system for the corporation to house them ... and a system of variable renting, related to individual capacity to pay, or differential renting, as it is commonly called, is essential.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These men were not one bit anxious, nor was I, to have officials employed by that local body probing into the affairs of anybody.  They did not want to have an official asking the man or woman what did the man earn last week, what did the daughter earn, what did the son earn, what is the total income of the family, if there was a suspicion that lies were being told. The people who arrived at this conclusion on the evidence before them were just as anxious as any of us is not to institute such inquiries, not to make themselves responsible for a system that would result in such inquiries being made.  The general position, the housing difficulties, the amount of the State contribution, the enormity of the task that local bodies had to face, were considerations that forced them and me and others to speak in favour of the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy mentioned the fact that in Dublin the position appeared to be somewhat different from what it is in Cork.  I find it hard to understand why that should be so. The only explanation one can find is the fact that the system has been in operation longer in Cork City than in Dublin.  I am not in the least surprised to hear that not only in Dublin but in other centres there is some prejudice and hostility to it because it is only natural that people who struggle and strive to get a house should proceed to protest if the conditions on which it is given are not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that is very wrong and it is happening in the Ballyfermot area.  It is wrong in every respect, whether it occurs in Ballyfermot or elsewhere.  It is, to attempt to create the impression in an area where the differential renting system operates that those who are paying an economic <Col N="148" /> rent are contributing to the rehousing of the poorer people in the same area. They are not.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I am always prepared to meet the representatives of local bodies on this question.  If they want to discuss amendments with me, if they want to revise the method by which all these things are arrived at, they will always find me open and ready to discuss and reason the thing out with them, whatever time it may take.</P>
    <P>I understand, as Deputy Briscoe says, that the Dublin Corporation are in course of re-examining the general conditions of this system as it applies here. I should like that the local bodies concerned, when putting up propositions of any kind to me as to the operation of this system, would make them comprehensive, and, if two, three or four aspects of the problem occur to them, that they would come to conclusions on them and make recommendations in regard to them so as to enable me to arrive at a proper and balanced decision.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to monopolise the limited time available to us on this motion.  If unlimited time were available I could discuss the issues involved here at greater length.  I was a local councillor.  I know how easy it is to fall for those who feel dissatisfied.  The masses who are satisfied pay their rent. The small number who are dissatisfied are loud and truculent.  There is always the temptation to a public man to make himself the spearhead of that group. Let all of us, all the Deputies, the mover of this motion and those who have different ideas and views on it, face up to this problem in an objective and realistic manner.  Unless we do that, we cannot hope to progress with the speed that we desire in the rehousing of our people.</P>

      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said that a problem of this kind deserves the most serious consideration of every Deputy and every member of the local authorities concerned.  I find myself in complete disagreement with the system of differential renting.  Unfortunately, the <Col N="149" /> system had been introduced in the Dublin Corporation before I became a member of that body.  Since I have become a member of the Dublin Corporation I have endeavoured at every opportunity to point out to my fellow councillors what I believe to be the objections to this particular system.</P>
      <P>As far as Dublin is concerned, the man who was responsible for the introduction of this system was, I understand, the late Councillor Larkin.  He was chairman of the housing committee, and he pressed very strongly for this system of differential renting. But, Councillor Larkin had a completely different conception of differential renting from the system that has been put into operation.  He believed in a system whereby a person who became ill or widowed or in any way rendered incapable of paying the economic or graded rent on the house would be entitled to a reduction in rent.  He never conceived that for every such person benefiting, ten other people would have their rents increased.  I may say about my predecessors in the Dublin Corporation that they passed the motion bringing into operation differential rents without giving the problem consideration.</P>
      <P>While agreeing that this is a problem that must be discussed and debated on its merits, it is right to say&mdash;Deputy Dunne and everyone should realise this &mdash;that in Dublin the family income must exceed £11 a week before the tenant is asked to pay the maximum rent.  It is only fair that that should be stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The family income may be made up of the father earning £6 a week, a daughter travelling in on the bus every day and earning £2 a week, a young fellow earning 35/- and a younger lad £1 a week. These sums are totalled up to make a family income of £11 a week, but every one of us knows that the young boy or girl earning 35/- or £2 a week in Dublin, paying bus fares and paying for lunch in a canteen, while helping <Col N="150" /> to clothe himself or herself, is unable to pay a penny piece towards the rent of the house.  That is an aspect of the situation which is overlooked by the people who say they want differential rents.</P>
      <P>When I went into the corporation, I was told that Cork started this system.  I only wish they had kept it in Cork.  They did start prior to the war to build houses at rents of a maximum of 18/- a week.  That was in 1934, but since then&mdash;Deputy MacCarthy will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;scarcely 200 houses in Cork have been put under differential rating.</P>

      <P>I am accepting Deputy MacCarthy's statement that fewer than 200 houses have been put on differential rents since 1934.  I admit that at the moment they are considering a scheme which may or may not be differential renting when it is completed.  On the principle advocated so much here and outside, the principle of the home and the position in that home of the father as head of the family and as tenant, if there is a system of differential renting, it is his income which should be taken into account and not the family income built up in the way I have indicated.  One of the things we are taught day after day is that the family is the vital unit and that the father is the head of that unit.  We cannot get away from that and that is the principle which ought to operate in local authorities and in the Government. I do not know who was the officer of the Dublin Corporation in charge of the allocation of tenancies in 1938 when he advocated differential rents, but I think I would be safe in saying that he had no authority from the elected representatives of the city to advocate differential renting in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is fair to the official in saying that he <Col N="151" /> advocated differential renting.  What he did say was that there was a problem which he and the corporation could not meet under the system as it existed.  He was merely stating facts and not making suggestions as to how the position should be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, and I will put it this way, that he did make a case for a system of differential renting that would enable him to house certain classes of people. That could be done without putting everybody under a system of renting, whereby ten people would have their rents increased for every one who had his reduced.  Dublin Corporation worked, up to July twelve-months, on a system of graded rents which I have yet to learn was a bad system, and when differential renting was put into operation in Dublin in July, 1950, the corporation passed a resolution that no person would be involved in the new system except new tenants, and they kept out of the system of differential renting 24,000 or 25,000 houses and flats.</P>
      <P>That is one of the practical difficulties we met in the corporation. Had the whole 25,000 or 27,000 houses been placed under differential renting there might not have been the same objection as there is, but one of the strong objections to this system is that it is applied to 2,500 new tenancies every year and that under it a means test is operated and a spirit of spying inculcated&mdash;a system of secret reports to be sent in by neighbours about neighbours: that Johnny in such-and-such a house has got an increase in wages&mdash;a system which can do considerable damage in a community.  I look on that as one of the objectionable features of differential renting.  I think that if a person has tuberculosis he ought to be in receipt of an allowance sufficient to enable him to maintain himself and to pay his rent. I am strongly in favour of that. Similarly, if a person is ill and incapable of working, he ought to be in receipt of an allowance sufficient to enable him to feed himself and his family and pay his rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> The Minister has mentioned, and, from the facts at our disposal, we know that he is right, that there are people living in corporation houses who are tradesmen earning, because of the circumstances of the moment, substantial wages.  They are earning good wages now but a few years ago they were walking the streets idle and, in many cases, hungry.  Because they are tradesmen, carpenters, plasterers, bricklayers, there may be going into these houses as much as £40 in the week, but the number of these cases in Ireland is not big.  Still, these cases are used to argue that you cannot compel the ratepayers to subsidise the rents of people earning these enormous sums of money in the week.  These, as I say, are not common cases.  Deputy Byrne and I, representing a constituency in north-east Dublin, know that these are not the conditions in very many of the corporation houses in our constituency.  We know that even with £9 and £10 a week going into a large family, with the cost of living what it is, that family is not in a position to pay a maximum rent of 36/- a week.  Food, clothing, boots, and so on, have to be purchased; bus fares and lunches have to be paid for; and there is very little left.  The position is that the vast majority of these tenants are having great difficulty in making ends meet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned a matter which, I think, is important, and it was mentioned by Deputy Dunne, too, in a different way.  The big problem, as I see it, in Dublin is that we have 30,000 families living in corporation houses. In ten years' time we hope, please God, to build another 25,000 houses; that is, 55,000 families in the City of Dublin will be living in corporation houses.  I think that is wrong.  I think it is a situation that must alarm any man who will give sufficient consideration to it. The problem is that 55,000 families will be living in houses owned by the corporation where there is an average repair bill on the corporation of £12 per year per house.  In those 55,000 houses will live between 300,000 and 400,000 citizens.  In other words, in ten years time much more than half the population of the City of Dublin will be <Col N="153" /> living in corporation houses and the other half will have the responsibility perhaps of subsidising every one of these houses.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which must alarm any person who considers it seriously. It is because of that, that we in the corporation have taken the decision on principle to sell to the tenants who are willing to buy their own houses and to encourage them in every way by the terms we will give them.  There will be no deposit to be paid and the amount they will have to pay in repayment of the moneys made available will differ very slightly from the rent they are paying at the moment.  Those tenants will, however, take the responsibility on themselves of maintaining their own houses, painting them when they should be painted and doing the little repairs which now cost the corporation £12 per house.  We are starting this scheme with some 200 houses in Philipsburgh Avenue; we are submitting proposals to the Minister and I hope that he will approve of the proposals put forward because it is the beginning of what I conceive to be a magnificent scheme to encourage people to own their own houses.</P>
    <P>Whatever system of society a person favours there is one thing which everyone should have and should be encouraged to have and that is the ownership of his own home.  I am strongly in favour of that.  We in the corporation are working out schemes whereby in Ballyfermot and elsewhere tenants will be encouraged to purchase their own houses.  In that way this enormous, this frightening, number of 50,000 or 60,000 corporation houses will be reduced and I am satisfied that a very big number of the tenants will be anxious to avail of those schemes and become the owners of their houses.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the time is limited and that Deputy Dunne wants some time to reply and consequently I, like the Minister, will leave my contribution at those few observations on the system.</P>
    <P>I have said that I am opposed to the system.  I am opposed to it and strongly opposed to it.  I can see Deputy Dunne's difficulty.  He says: &ldquo;I am opposed to the system, the present system in operation, but I am not <Col N="154" /> opposed to a system of differential renting.&rdquo;  That is a very difficult position to be in.  No matter what system of differential renting you have, the most objectionable features will still be there.  You must be either for the system or against it and I make no apologies for being against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say that in Cork at present we are building houses under the fixed rents system and are building houses under the differential rents system.  From my experience a poor man has no hope of getting a house except a differential rent house because one of the requirements in the circular sent out by the Department of Local Government regarding the allocation of houses is ability to pay rent. That is the first question that will be asked if anyone is applying for a fixed rent house: has he ability to pay rent? I think that is all wrong when we are dealing with houses built by a local authority for working-class people.  I can see no hope of housing the poorer people without a differential rent system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all against this inquiry into private affairs, but I do not see any way of avoiding it and after all if a young man and his wife are trying to rear a young family it is the greatest help in the world to them to go into a house under a differential rent scheme.  He has a guarantee and insurance against sickness and unemployment. We have a lot of casual workers in Cork in the docks and elsewhere and it would be impossible for those people to pay a fixed rent.  I met a few cases recently where people who were supposed to be earning good money down in Ford's got fixed rent houses. When they had been a couple of months in the fixed rents houses the husband was stricken with sickness, the people were unable to continue paying a fixed rent and they looked for a transfer to differential rent houses.  If the differential rents scheme was not <Col N="155" /> in existence the corporation could not house those people, first of all because of the regulation that they must have the ability to pay the rent.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the rents in Ballyfermot are, but in Cork the prewar differential rents were, as Deputy MacCarthy stated, from 6/- to 18/- and post-war they are from 6/- to 30/-.  The 6/- rent covers the rates of the house; if you like it is no rent.  Surely if a man who has had the benefit of a cheap house while rearing his family has four or five members of that family earning big money&mdash;he may have three or four tradesmen in the house&mdash;he is bound to pay a share for his fellow-worker who is in poorer circumstances.  Surely that is better than that he should spend the money on amusements or other things. Surely we cannot provide houses at an uneconomic rent for everybody who cannot pay.  When the family get married and go away and only the old couple is left you find that the rent is reduced again.</P>
    <P>I cannot visualise any other way of housing those people.  The system of fixed rents with ability to pay rent as one of the requirements to get a house is, I think, altogether wrong and will never meet the requirements of our poorer classes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion which we had on this very important matter is of great interest to those of us who are dealing with differential rents every other week.  The contributions of Deputy Briscoe and of my colleague, Deputy Burke, were significant only for the amount of personal abuse they contained. The contributions made by other Deputies were enlightening.  In particular, I must say that the Minister surprised me by the reason with which he approached this problem, although he disagreed with the views I expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to Councillor James Larkin, who originated this scheme.  Deputy Alderman Byrne reminds me that within his recollection at that inquiry when the question of rents was being considered generally ten or 12 years ago&mdash;a report of that inquiry was referred to by the Minister&mdash;Councillor Larkin indicated that <Col N="156" /> in his view the rents should be based upon one-tenth of the income.  In the cases with which we are dealing the rent is based on one-sixth of the family income.  Let us leave aside all that has been said about the tremendous number of people living in Ballyfermot who are earning fortunes&mdash;sums of £25, £35 and even £40 a week were mentioned. I know there are very few and far between who are earning such sums.  Those who like to believe it can believe it.  Let us take the case of a builder's labourer with four children, that is a very usual case, earning £6 10s. a week.  One-sixth of £6 is £1, and this leaves him with £5 a week for himself, his four children and his wife. Can anybody suggest that £5 or £5 10s. a week for six human beings to live on in Dublin is Christian?</P>
    <P>I think that the attitude adopted by Deputy Briscoe was completely unreal. He was endeavouring as best he could to make as much as he could out of a weak case and bolster up the position of himself and his colleagues on the Dublin Corporation.  Deputy Burke would make a far better hand at funeral operations than endeavouring to justify how he twisted from last year when he sought to make himself a hero in the eyes of the people of Ballyfermot by demanding that the then Minister should increase the subsidy and thus reduce rents while seconding a motion which was in effect a full support of the whole principle of differential rents.</P>
    <P>That does not matter very much. What does matter is that, in very many cases, the people in that particular area are suffering.  I am sorry the Minister did not indicate to me his attitude towards what I consider to be the important point in this discussion. In the calculation of the economic rents of the Ballyfermot houses by Dublin Corporation no cognisance is taken of the Government subsidy which runs into, I think, £400.  No cognisance whatever is taken of that.  If cognisance were taken of it, it would result in a considerable reduction and an easement of the burden on the people.  The Minister says it is wrong to say that people who could pay 36/- are contributing or helping to pay the rent for other people.  I believe it is <Col N="157" /> correct to say that a man who pays 36/- will pay a rent which takes no cognisance of the subsidy and that the subsidy will benefit some other family. The position in that area is typical and can be duplicated throughout the country.  It has resulted in considerable dissatisfaction amongst the people.  Deputy Cowan has referred to one most serious aspect of that dissatisfaction, the question of the invasion of the family privacy.  I believe that had we a reasonable scheme we would not have that discontent, the sort of suspicion that exists where the differential renting system obtains at the present time.  We should have a scheme to which the general mass of the people would have no objection. Many will ask why should the local authority house families with a very big income?  Those families are so few in number that I would be agreeable to the local authority offering them no house at all.  They should be made to avail of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act because they are so few in number.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke, particularly, and Deputy Briscoe, to some extent, took the individual and isolated case to try to mislead the House and prove a situation which does not exist.  The bulk of the people in that area, the people with ordinary working-class incomes, are being over-taxed in the form of rent.  They want some easement. <Col N="158" /> It was to try to get them that easement that I brought forward this motion.  The suggestion was made, as usual, that my aim in bringing it forward was political.  Does anybody honestly suggest that any deed ever done in this House had not a political motive?  Everything that everybody says here has some political motive and rightly so.  There is nothing dishonourable about it, but I am interested also in seeing people living as happily as they can.  I am interested in seeing that people get a fair deal. I am interested in seeing that people whose wages have been increased by only 90 per cent.  Since 1939 should not be forced to pay a rent 300 per cent. more than they were asked to pay in 1939.  It is in that spirit that I ask the House to accept this motion, in an effort to help the less fortunate section of our people, the working-class people, upon whom this whole nation depends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann considers that the minimum wage payable to agricultural workers in County Dublin should be £4 10s. a week and in all other areas £4 a week.</P>
      <P>It will be obvious to everybody that the class of workers to whom this motion refers, agricultural labourers, are badly paid.  At the present time the highest wage paid to an agricultural worker in this country is paid in County Dublin, and it stands at £4 per week.  The lowest wage is paid in a number of counties and stands at 67s. 6d. per week.  The working week in counties outside of Dublin is one of 54 hours with four hours allowed for a weekly half-holiday.</P>
      <P>The agricultural labourer in this country is a type of worker to whom I have referred on more occasions than I can remember since my membership of this House began.  I have heard agricultural workers being referred to by members of every Party always in terms of praise, always in terms which, if the poor farm labourer were in the Gallery, would make his cheeks glow with pride.  I recall during portion of the emergency&mdash;that portion when I was free to attend public meetings during election time&mdash;it was the habit and the recreation of politicians to say what great men the agricultural workers were, how they were standing in the gap producing the nation's food.  They were the frontline soldiers and they were urged to work harder and still harder to get the maximum produce they could from the soil to keep our people going. They were great men, and they were great men on 40/- a week during the years of the war.  On a working week of 54 hours they were working nine hours a day for six days a week while other workers with far less skill, of far less importance, in industries that did not matter very much to the nation, were working half the length of time that the agricultural worker was working and getting twice the amount of money that he was getting.</P>
      <P>As time passed, in some areas farm labourers began to realise that their salvation did not lie in paying heed to the short memories of the politicians but rather in their own organised strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They succeeded in lifting their standard of life somewhat so that their wages were increased from time to time by dint of organised pressure. But now we have 150,000 people in this country working for wages in agriculture, and the average wage is in the neighbourhood of £3 10s. or £3 12s. a week.  They still have a longer working week than any other class of <Col N="161" /> people.  They are still important and probably will become more important as time goes by.</P>
    <P>If the threats of war which we daily read of in the newspapers come to a climax, if war breaks out and we are thrown back again upon our own resources, the agricultural labourer will be the man in the gap.  I have no doubt he will receive oceans of praise, as he did before, but that is no good. Praise puts no bread on a man's table. Being urged to produce more does not mean very much to a man who is getting hardly enough to keep his family going.</P>
    <P>Take the case of an agricultural labourer in County Dublin who is lucky enough to be allocated a county council cottage.  He must pay 9/- out of his £4 for that cottage.  He is lucky to have £4 judging by the standard of pay in other counties, but he is still at starvation level.  No man with any initiative and no man with a few pounds who can get his bus fare away from the land will stay on the land at the present time.</P>
    <P>That is the worst thing that could happen to this country.  One of the greatest disasters that could befall the Irish nation is that the land should be deserted by these skilled operatives&mdash; and that is what they are, although when they come to town now and again they may look somewhat out of place, and are often made the jest of the more slick city dwellers.  There is greater skill in the mind and in the hand of the agricultural worker than there is in most of the artisans in the cities and towns, and there is certainly a far greater degree of intelligence and a far greater appreciation of what matters in life, because agricultural workers live close to nature.  As a class they do not own land.  They may be lucky enough to have half an acre from the council of the county in which they live.  If they are, they must keep it up to standard.</P>
    <P>The only chance they have of working the acre or half-acre, whichever it is, is during their spare time.  Until we managed to put through this House an Act to give them annual holidays and an Act to give them a half-holiday, their spare time was a very attenuated <Col N="162" /> affair.  It depended entirely upon the goodwill of the employer, and that is not a good principle to work upon. Generally speaking, in many areas there exists a happy relationship between farmers and their employees. However, there are cases, and these are not one or two, where farm workers are being exploited by their employers and where the relationship is not, as it has often been called here, a family relationship. Rather is it one of master and servant.</P>
    <P>I remember hearing a Deputy refer on one occasion in this House to the agricultural worker and his master. For most of the country that day is gone at last, or, at least, it is on its way out.  The servile attitude of mind which provoked or prompted people to think that Almighty God created two distinct classes, one the master and the other the servant, if not completely gone is passing away.  The diffusion of more knowledge in rural areas and the acquisition by rural dwellers of this knowledge is changing the attitude which conceived the philosophy that one person should serve the other. Knowledge, like bread and butter, can only be acquired by paying for it either in experience or, more often than not, with hard cash.  The few additional shillings that have been conceded to the agricultural worker have increased his thirst for knowledge and have raised his standard of living.</P>
    <P>My motion is designed to raise in this House the whole question of the payment of agricultural workers.  I will never be convinced that the farmers of this country are being badly treated, whatever may be said to the contrary. I think that they were very well looked after during the term of office of the previous Government, and the people of this country are now beginning to see in the person of the ex-Minister for Agriculture a farmer's man.  Indeed, the present Minister for Agriculture is looked upon in the same light.  In fact, taking up the paper any day we read of him putting forward, possibly in a different guise, the same ideas which Deputy Dillon was putting forward last year.  I repeat that both men have the interests of the farmers very much at heart, as is their duty.  I want them <Col N="163" /> both to take cognisance of the rights of those who help the farmers, those who keep them going and on whom they depend to add to their prosperity.</P>
    <P>When the present Government assumed office, and I think &ldquo;assumed&rdquo; is a very apt word in this context, their first act was to increase still further the price of milk.  This resulted, of course, in an increased price for butter.  That must mean a very substantial addition to the farmer's income, because it followed on a list of increases by the previous Minister. We are told that Deputy Corry and his merry men have succeeded in convincing the brewers that they should give the farmers an increased price for malting barley.  Recently the Minister for Agriculture announced that he will pay an additional 7/6 per barrel for wheat.  We must add all that to the tremendous prosperity which is the outcome of the three-years' reign of the previous Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Agricultural wages have not increased commensurate with the rising income of the farmers.  There have been slight increases, and these have been brought about by dint of hard effort on the part of organised agricultural workers in different parts of the country.  This very year I had forced upon me the unpleasant duty of upholding a strike of agricultural workers in County Dublin.  It was settled, of course, as all strikes must be settled. As a result the agricultural workers received an increase of 10/- per week. The strike was short-lived.  Perhaps, we were lucky to be dealing with farmers in County Dublin who take a slightly more liberal view of trade unionism than do the farmers elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>The increase was paid and the ruin which was foreshadowed for the County Dublin farmers was averted. When the Agricultural Workers' Weekly Half-Holidays Bill was passed through this House we were told that it would be detrimental to the cause of agriculture.  As far as this weekly half-holiday goes there are many farmers who are trying to dodge the column and they are going to be looked after shortly to the best of our ability. <Col N="164" /> This half-holiday has improved the relationship between the farmer and his man, just as we foretold.  It has also brought about an improvement in production, although Deputy Cogan and some other prophets of doom pronounced here that it would spell the end of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward a very simple request; it is simply to ask the Dáil to express its view as to what it would regard as a proper minimum rate for agricultural workers in Dublin and in the rest of the country.  I will anticipate the criticism which I know that Deputy Corry will undoubtedly level against me because I am differentiating between County Dublin and the rest of the country.  This differentiation has been upheld by the Agricultural Wages Board since it was first formed.  It is generally agreed that in Dublin City and County the cost of living is higher than in other areas throughout the country.  For that reason, a differential rate is necessary and it is to maintain that differential that I suggest a somewhat larger increase for farm labourers in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the wages of farm labourers are determined by the Agricultural Wages Board.  That is a body which the Minister might examine and abolish as quickly as he possibly can.  Perhaps it may not be known to Deputies that the Agricultural Wages Board consists of a chairman, who is a full-time civil servant if you like, four farmers to represent the employing interests, four workers to represent the interests of the agricultural labourers and, I think, two so-called neutral members.  They are always &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; against the agricultural labourer.  They invariably vote against motions at meetings of that board which seek to give the agricultural worker a few shillings more.  It is provided by statute that, where there is not unanimity amongst representatives of the workers and of the employers, the chairman shall make the decision.  In other words, there may be seven votes for an increase of wages for agricultural workers and one against, and the chairman, acting within the powers bestowed on him by an Act of the Dáil, may determine that no increase shall be <Col N="165" /> given.  The chairman constitutes a quorum of the board.  The method of selection of members of the board has been a farce for years.  I recall some years ago inquiring as to who was the workers' representative in a certain area of the country.  I was told, and when I inquired further I found the man had been working in Birmingham for three years previously and up to the time I inquired.  I do not know whether he was in that particular unit in Birmingham referred to recently by the Taoiseach, but he was in Birmingham.</P>
    <P>I think nobody will envy the lot of a man who has to live on £4 a week; much less will he envy the lot of a man who has to live on 67/6, as is the case in County Wexford, for example, and in other counties.  I know that the subject matter of this motion will not have very much weight in certain western counties where hired agricultural labour, if you like to describe it as such, is non-existent, but it is of tremendous importance for areas along the eastern seaboard and in certain midland counties where we have land which, unlike the land in the West, is literally black gold, if you like&mdash; County Kildare and parts of North County Dublin&mdash;where six months ago half an acre of land to be used for agriculture was sold for £500&mdash;the better parts of Wicklow and the Model County.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an ironic title.  It may be model as far as production is concerned, but it is a scandalous thing that in a county such as that and in other counties a man working on the land should be expected to live on 67/6 a week.  Recently the Taoiseach made a speech which got prominence in this country and indeed in every country on the known earth.  He referred to the conditions of Irish workers in Birmingham sleeping 15 in a room.  Agricultural labourers in this country with families will be found sleeping five and six in a room.  The married agricultural labourer with his wife and family living in what is known as a two-roomed mud cabin has often to live five and six in a room.  You <Col N="166" /> do not have to go to Birmingham to get conditions of overcrowding.  Were these men living under such terrible conditions in Birmingham not driven there?  Did they go to live 15 in a room of their own free choice?  They went because if they stayed at home and went to work for some of our native employers, they would be lucky to get even 67/6 a week.  Even in Wexford last Sunday I was told of agricultural workers living indoors getting a wage as low as 10/- and 15/- a week and as many hours as God sent they had to work.  If they mentioned anything about it to the Agricultural Wages Board they got short shrift. They would get their cards and then, if they wished, they could hike to Birmingham, but where would they get the fare to go there out of a wage of 10/- or 15/- a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have often spoken about the conditions of workers in this country and about what should be done for the West, but surely we should start at the beginning and not midways.  Surely we should start with the people who are the worst treated.  I do not think anybody will deny that the agricultural labourer is almost at the very bottom of the social strata in this country, so far as living standards are concerned. Play is often made of the so-called perquisites he gets, but if an agricultural labourer does work for an employer who is reasonable enough to allow him to take home some of the farm produce &mdash;and goodness knows it does not mean a snap of the fingers to the ordinary farmer if the worker is given all the farm produce he requires&mdash;it should be remembered that when that agricultural labourer goes into the small town adjoining to purchase essential commodities, he is often at the mercy of that creature, still not extinct in this country, the gombeen man, who may control all the village and half of the town, and the agricultural worker must pay prices very often higher than those paid by more wealthy members of the community for certain essential commodities such at boots and clothing, for himself and his children.  He has often to pay higher prices than he would pay in the City of Dublin.  He has got to pay a rent for his house, if he has one, a rent that will compare <Col N="167" /> with the rent being paid by other very much better remunerated classes.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that everybody in this House will agree with the motion, because I have seen and heard representatives here&mdash;it appears to me that they are very few in number&mdash;who would deny, if they could, the agricultural worker the light of day, to use an old expression, but I ask reasonable Deputies in this House to give thought to the motion and to support it so that this most important section of our people shall get greater consideration than they have got up to the present, and so that the Agricultural Wages Board, which we hope will be reconstituted at an early date, will be called upon by the Minister and by the Dáil to do its duty for the men who work on the land.  It should be laid down as a cardinal principle by Dáil Éireann that all men should be cherished equally, that we should not legislate for one section to give them advantages over any other section, and if farmers are prosperous in this country or enjoy improvements in their lot, Dáil Éireann must see to it that that prosperity is passed along down the line.  That is what this motion asks, and I urge the House to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to second this motion because it is an endeavour to establish for that long-forgotten section, the agricultural workers, rights somewhat similar to those enjoyed by their brothers in the industrial world.  It is admitted that these people work the longest hours of any workers in this country.  They perform the most difficult tasks under the most difficult conditions and they must have a high degree of skill if they are to be of any use to their employers.  I do not claim to have any particular knowledge of the work of agricultural labourers, but in my previous employment I came in daily contact with agricultural workers and their wives and families, and I am as well aware of the conditions under which they exist as any Deputy.  Anyone who has travelled the country as a national health insurance agent or as an ordinary assurance agent will be well aware that the total <Col N="168" /> cash income coming into an agricultural worker's house is at least 50 per cent. below that which is required to keep himself and his family in ordinary frugal comfort.</P>
      <P>The Holy Father, in an Encyclical, stated that a worker was entitled in justice at least to that, plus sufficient to provide as well for the rainy day in case of sickness or accident or any trouble that might befall him.  This motion is an endeavour to establish the right of the agricultural worker to a wage which we suggest is but in keeping with that express wish of the Holy Father.  Lip service has been paid from all sides of this House to the agricultural worker, and praise has been showered upon him for the terrific value he was to this country during the last emergency.  If that was sincere, then to the Deputies who gave that praise and to the other Deputies I would say that there are two questions they should ask themselves and, if they are satisfied that the answer to both these questions is in the affirmative, then they have no option but to vote for this motion.</P>
      <P>The questions, I suggest, are: Is the wage a fair one?  Is it necessary that an agricultural worker in County Dublin should receive £4 10s. per week and in the rest of the country £4, and that it would be a criminal offence for an employer to pay less than that?  I suggest, having much more knowledge of the rest of the country than of County Dublin, that £4 per week is the normal wage for the average worker in the country.  County council workers, on the whole, are on that mark.  Men employed by the Forestry Department or the Office of Public Works receive the county council rate. Creamery workers, in general, receive £4 or more per week.  Surely, then, if the agricultural worker who receives so much praise from all sections of the House is to live at all and is to continue in his employment, it is right and fair to say that he should be put on a level with the rest of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been my sad experience to see travelling by bus the children of a farm labourer who endeavoured to send his children when they had reached the age of 14 or 15 years to a <Col N="169" /> technical or secondary school out of the very little earnings he had.  These children had the humiliation of having to attend a secondary or technical school in the cut-down clothing of their father or mother, and to be ridiculed by other pupils, not because of any fault of theirs but because their father had the misfortune to be an agricultural worker and was not receiving sufficient to be able to buy suitable clothing for these children to attend these schools.  We are all well aware how bitter and how harsh school children can be to their companions. It is a desperate thing to think that because these agricultural workers took upon themselves the duties of fatherhood and managed to scrape up enough to educate their children for the state they are entitled to, these children have to suffer humiliation because their parents have not sufficient money to clothe them properly.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dunne said, the agricultural worker has to buy clothing, boots and the other necessities of life in the very same market as the industrial worker.  In fact, with the addition of transport charges, they very often cost him more than they do his comrades in the towns.  Anyone who will look upon this matter in an unbiassed manner will agree that the changing circumstances in the world are such that the agricultural worker needs to receive as much at least as any other worker.</P>
    <P>As to point number 2, whether the farmers are in a position to pay, anyone who lives in the rural areas will be quite satisfied that an additional 12/6 per week per worker will not bankrupt any farmer at the present time.  One has but to stand at a chapel gate on a Sunday and see the wealth reflected by the presence of high-priced motor cars to realise that the farmers have come into prosperity.  It is a well known fact that deposits in the banks of this country were never higher than they are at present and that most of the money is lodged by people who make their living out of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the farmer's own interests a contented worker will more than repay the increase asked for.  If there is no money in farming how is it that immediately a farm is put up for sale all <Col N="170" /> the neighbouring farmers are anxious to get it and will pay very high prices indeed in order to get another 40 or 50 acres of land to add to what they already hold.  These farmers are hardheaded businessmen.  Unless they knew they would get a good return, having secured that land, they would not buy it.  They would invest their surplus money elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the flight from the land.  Is it surprising that able-bodied men and women leave the land and seek employment elsewhere, employment which will give them a wage sufficient to keep themselves?  Is it not true that it is the lame and the halt who are left to work our farms? The aim of this motion is to give the farmers contented workers, to help them to increase their earnings and restore to the country some of the vitality that it has lost.  For that reason, I have pleasure in seconding this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;considers&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;that decisions on minimum wages payable to agricultural workers should continue to be a function of the Agricultural Wages Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Having knowledge of the position of the agricultural worker prior to the setting up of the Agricultural Wages Board, I would have many misgivings were I to agree to its abolition in the interests of the agricultural workers. Apart from the financial aspect, good work has been done by that board. The age of capitalism is gone, and we must give credit to the Government that set up this machinery in order to ensure that agricultural workers would get a fair deal.  My advice to the farmers would be to pay their agricultural workers a decent wage and thereby ensure that the labour will be there when they want the beet harvested, the cow milked and the wheat and oats threshed.  The less interference there is from Government departments in a matter of this kind the better it will be for all immediately concerned and for the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> I think this is the first occasion upon which any demand has been made for reconstitution, or the total abolition, of the Agricultural Wages Board.  I think it would be a very grave matter ta pass this motion completely ignoring the personnel of the board and indeed putting that personnel into oblivion forever.  What has been said in relation to the importance of the agricultural labourer is not by any means a case of &ldquo;gilding the lily&rdquo;. The agricultural worker is all-important in the nation's economy. He and his employer form the backbone of the nation.  If we had no agricultural workers our position would be grave indeed.  If our workers are not paid a decent wage the nation's economy will be threatened.</P>
    <P>The democratic way is the right way to do things.  I am satisfied that the Agricultural Wages Board has done a great deal to better the position of the agricultural worker and the nation's economy.  We should be very slow to do away with any instrument that has proved satisfactory.  If we hand the agricultural worker over to a Government department we will be advancing still further along the road towards that bureaucracy which has been so often condemned here in the past.</P>
    <P>The wages and conditions of agricultural workers before that board was set up are enough to make any decent Irishman blush.  Every fairminded Deputy must admit that the board has done a good day's work.  Relations obtaining between employer and employee have been bettered during the past ten or 15 years.  The farmer knows he must abide by the board's decision, and he does not blame his employee because an increase has been demanded and obtained.  No case has really been made for complete abolition. The Minister might perhaps consider the constitution of the board. Some members may have gone away or be absenting themselves for one reason or another.  From that point of view the Minister might give the constitution of the board his consideration.</P>
    <P>The good spirit obtaining between <Col N="172" /> the agricultural workers and the farmers has improved considerably, and I believe that the importance of the agricultural workers is fully realised.  As Deputy Dunne has said, we know full well the service they gave to the nation during the emergency and before it.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept my amendment. I believe we should be taking a false step&mdash;a step that would, perhaps, take many days and weeks and months of argument here to retrace&mdash;if we were to accept the motion.  Having given the Agricultural Wages Board to the agricultural worker and to the working farmer, we should not, without a solid case being made for it, abolish that board or, by interfering with its status and duties, pass the motion moved by Deputy Dunne to-night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I was rather amazed by the statement made by Deputy Dunne to-night.  I do not know where he got his stories.  I suggest he has very little association with agricultural labour and knows very little about it, to judge by the way he spoke here to-night.  I wonder who is the Wexford farmer whom Deputy Dunne found paying 10/- a week plus board to his labourer at the present day&mdash;or does the Deputy think that all the Deputies of this House are living in Dublin and that none of them live in the country?  I think the Deputy mentioned that there were some agricultural labourers working for 10/- a week, plus board, for farmers in County Wexford.  I wonder if Deputy Corish would get up and substantiate that assertion?</P>

      <P>We have heard a lot of talk here and we read a lot of inspired articles in the Press about the extra ld. a gallon that the farmers got for their milk.  I suggest that that ld. a gallon was more than offset by the increase which was given in wages.  I hope to prove that suggestion and something more than that.  If I do not have an opportunity of proving it to-night I shall do so next Wednesday in this House when I shall be dealing with another motion that is in the offing.  I only ask Deputies here who pretend to be interested in agricultural labour to act at least in accordance with their pretensions and to give to the employer of the agricultural labourer the wherewithal to pay him. I speak here as one who considers <Col N="174" /> that the agricultural labourer of this country, whether he be farmer, farmer's son or farm labourer, is entitled at least to as much as any man, whether he be an insurance agent or anything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy an explanation of that.  Some three years ago, two organised bodies in this country went into the costings of beet. Some 1,100 farmers were costed.  Out of the 1,100 farmers, not ten were found who were paying the minimum wage.  They were all paying far more than the minimum wage&mdash;and they are the tillage farmers of this country.  If the Deputy will take the trouble to look at these costings and examine them he will find that out for himself. This year, the price of beet is based on these costings&mdash;and it was, except during the short period, thanks be to God, when the gentlemen opposite were in office and their Minister refused to do so; when the labourer working at beet and producing sugar for this country found himself out on the side of the road because there were 6,600 acres less of beet grown in this country than previously, and when the men working in the factories were working a month short.</P>
      <P>The Government which the gentlemen opposite kept in office had to go to the Cuban and to the Chinaman for sugar.  They paid £12 a ton more to the foreigner for sugar than for the best Irish sugar produced here by Irish labour.  No less than 74,000 tons of sugar were brought into this country last February, having been purchased from the Cuban because the then Minister put down in black and white:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We consider that the agricultural community were far too generously treated by the previous Government and we cannot agree to an increase of 4/6 a ton on beet.&rdquo;  Let us find out what was paid to the foreigner for the 74,000 tons of raw sugar which went to the four factories.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>From that day in 1947 until the roots were shaken under those gentlemen over there, and they made a death-bed repentance, they gave, out of the bottom of their full hearts, a solitary ld. per gallon to hand over to the <Col N="176" /> farmer to meet all his increases in the costs of production between 1947 and 1951.  It is, as a result of that action and of that attitude by those Deputies, that the milk is not there now, and that you are paying the foreigner to produce butter for you.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne spoke about farmers' motor cars.  The only decent, respectable motor car that I see around the chapel gates on a Sunday morning is the one used by insurance agents.

      <P>If the Deputy would cease interrupting we could get a bit further on this motion.  If he does not, of course, I cannot help it.  I suggest that the proper attitude on this matter would be to have a committee set up, if necessary of Deputies of all Parties, to investigate the whole economy of the agricultural community at the present day and to fix prices for agricultural produce on such a basis as will enable the farmer to pay a wage as least on a par with the wage paid in any other industry in the country.  The agricultural worker, whether he be a farm labourer, or whether he belongs to that unpaid class&mdash;farmers' sons&mdash;or whether he be the old farmer himself who gets <Col N="177" /> nothing at all, is better entitled to have that condition of affairs brought about than any other section of the community.  I suggest it is only just that that should be done.  We have this lip service about the flight from the land and all the rest of it carried on by school teachers and others when they meet around the fire at a Muintir na Tíre meeting and talk about the unfortunate downtrodden farmer. They talk about the flight from the land and what should be done to keep people at home.  Deputy Kyne talked about the farmers.  Unfortunately, the farmers are not in the same position as the trade unions, but I hope that that will not always be so and that nobody will be allowed to buy land except a farmer's son, in the same way as you cannot be a tailor unless you are a tailor's son, a carpenter unless you are a carpenter's son, or a baker unless you are a baker's son.</P>

      <P>All these so-called trades are closed.  I suggest that if we have any seriousness in this debate or any intention to approach this problem as it should be approached, we should deal with it on these lines: first, find the cost of production; secondly, fix the cost of production, plus a fair profit, and give that to the farmer, and, thirdly, compel the farmer then to pay a wage to the agricultural labourer.  That would end the danger alluded to by Deputy Dunne and which I admit, namely, that there will be nobody left on the land but the cripple or the old age pensioner.  That is the position that we are leading to. When I hear talk here about increased production I wonder where the increased production is to come from. It will not be brought about by a condition of affairs where the farmer, according to the costings produced by, I think, Mr. Barry, on a 35-acre farm earns £3 a week.</P>

      <P>A request was made to the then Government in 1948 by the sugar company for an increase of 4/6 a ton on beet, which was refused. These are facts and cannot be denied just as it cannot be denied that the refusal by the State to pay an economic price for milk from 1948 to 1951 brought about the condition of affairs that we, and agricultural country, had to go abroad and buy £3,000,000 worth of butter from the foreigner.  The farmer was not paid his price and he could not pay the labourer.  The labourer left and there was nobody to milk the cow, and I have seen, and have brought Deputies to see, barns containing 15 to 20 cows and two calves suckling each cow, producing beef for John Bull, which was a better-paying proposition.</P>
      <P>You cannot get blood out of a stone. You cannot get money where it is not. You cannot expect a farmer to pay a wage if he does not get the money to pay it with.</P>

      <P>The first man to suffer when costs increase is the agricultural labourer.  He is the first man in the troupe to go.  Anybody could see that condition of affairs coming about for the past four or five years.  As I said in this House a short time ago, the agricultural labourer will soon be as scarce as the Red Indian.  The only thing the agricultural labourer has to sell is his labour, and he will sell it in the highest market, and more power to him.  He would be a fool if he did not. He is not too much concerned about production.  I have as much, if not more, experience of agricultural labourers as any Deputy.</P>
      <P>I know that he is prepared to give a decent day's work at any time.  He is prepared to help his employer at times when he need not.  That has been my experience of agricultural labourers all my life, and I have been dealing with agricultural labourers since I was turned into an agricultural labourer myself at the age of 13.  I turned up at the farm and did my day's work.  I did not care anything about a 50-hour week at that time.  It was nearer to 95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the condition of affairs in which Labour come in here with a motion of this type.  I have seen motions of this kind being introduced <Col N="180" /> by Labour and within a week afterwards I have seen Labour trotting into the Lobby to prevent the farmer from getting the wherewithal to pay.  You cannot have your loaf and eat it.  I have seen labourers in other walks of life, in the building trade, doubling and trebling their wages, doing less work per hour, laying less bricks per week or per day, and I have seen the building contractor being paid for every bit of it.  We want the farmer to be treated in the same way.  We want the farmer to get the wherewithal to pay his labourer a decent wage.  He is entitled to that, and you are not going to put the farmer in a position in which he can pay a decent wage by preventing him from getting it.  The sooner Labour come to realise, that is, if they are honest in their proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy himself is always out of order.  I never yet saw him in order.  He was not even in order when he pretended that it was he who got the price for barley, an admission which Deputy Dunne said we should be thankful for.  The more one examines this problem, the more one <Col N="181" /> realises that if we were to step up production in this country, if we are to put our people in a position in which they will no longer be dependent on the foreigner for essentials of life in the shape of food and if agricultural labour is to be kept on the land, you will have to give, not the £4 mentioned here, but the wage of a skilled tradesman to the agricultural labourer. Agricultural labour is entitled to that wage because the agricultural labourer of to-day has to know how to drive a tractor, how to work milking machinery and how to look after a reaper and binder, and he is therefore entitled to the wage of a skilled tradesman.</P>
      <P>I am prepared at any time to make a fair bargain with those who even pretend to represent agricultural labour. On the day on which they say they are prepared to back a Bill in this house that all agricultural produce shall be paid for on the basis of the cost of production, plus a fair profit, costs to be made out and ascertained, on that day I shall be prepared to support a Bill fixing the minimum wage of agricultural labour at £6 per week.</P>

      <P>In that way, we will be changing the whole aspect of our agricultural economy and we will no longer be dependent, as agriculture is to-day, on the man who is mentally deficient, a cripple or an old age pensioner because these are the only classes of people who I believe, will work on the land of this country to-day for the minimum rate of wages which the State allows.  I give that as a present to anyone who wants it.  It would be far better economy for us to work on that basis and if those who pay such great lip-service to the flight from the land at Muintir na Tire meetings worked on that basis, there would be less flight from the land.  We would have a happier country and at least we would not be dependent as we are at present on the Cuban for our sugar, on the Mesopotamians for some other commodity, the Iraquis for another and on the people of Formosa <Col N="182" /> where we sent for sugar two years ago.</P>
      <P>The four sugar factories would be working for at least two months extra in the year producing sugar for the Irish people and we would not have the shameful position in which 74,000 tons of raw sugar were brought into this country, with the assistance and connivance of the Labour Party, to supply the Irish people with sugar&mdash;paid for out of the taxpayers' money to the amount of over £3,000,000.  Agricultural Ireland, the land which in the old days was supposed to be flowing with milk and honey, last year had to send out to the Danes for Brian Boru's butter and is now going to New Zealand for butter. That is the condition of affairs which the policy of drift carried on here has brought about.</P>
      <P>There is one way and only one way in which to end it, because the flight from the land is not confined to the hired agricultural labourers.  The farmer's son to-day sees that his value as a worker on the land is about £3 or £3 5s. a week.  He sees the fellow working on the acre taken from his father's farm as a builder's labourer earning £5 12s. a week digging the foundations of houses and it will not be long until he jumps across the ditch and says&mdash;&ldquo;Good-bye, Daddy; I have got a better job.&rdquo;  The flight from the land is not confined to the agricultural labourer&mdash; the farmer's son and daughter are going as well.</P>

    <P>It was only yesterday that I was on an interview board and there came before us two girls, the only daughters of a widow with 120 acres, from Beaufort, County Kerry, looking for jobs as probationer nurses.  Nobody was left at home but the widowed mother.  That is what is happening to the land of this country and that is what is happening right along the whole line.  It is time it was ended, and there is only one way of ending it. You will not end it by motions like this; you will not end it by coming in here to throw mud on the men&mdash; decent men, I take it&mdash;who were selected by the previous Government, selected, some of them probably by the Deputies themselves, for the Agricultural Wages Board.  They are not a Fianna Fáil selection.  They are <Col N="183" /> the selection of the last Government, including this man whom Deputy Dunne said should be kicked out.  I would hesitate very seriously before suggesting that Deputies Dunne, Larkin, or Corish selected Labour representatives on the Agricultural Wages Board who were not fit for their job.  Surely they were not responsible for selecting the individual alluded to by Deputy Dunne who was in Birmingham for three years and whose name still appeared as a representative on the Agricultural Wages Board. Deputy Dunne, I admit, had several flights of imagination here this evening, but I do not know whether his imagination flew so far as that.</P>
    <P>That is the situation as I view it, and that is why I suggest that this problem, the problem of our production on the land, is too serious to be tackled in this manner.  It would need the joint effort of every Party and Deputy in this House.  The suggestion I have put forward is the basis and the only basis on which it can ever be done successfully.</P>

      <P>I had hoped in supporting the motion to refer to a few points in the vein employed by Deputy Davern in moving the amendment although I naturally disagreed with him.  Unfortunately the peculiar contribution of the famous Deputy Corry in his old Joxer Daly fashion has tended to reduce this discussion to a level lower than that of any discussion which ever took place in this House.  I am sorry to say that this motion which should have been discussed in an orderly and respectful manner has been anything but beneficial.  Take the statements made by Deputy Corry. Unfortunately he has gone.  I am sorry that he has gone because although it might be drifting a little from the motion I intended to answer him.  If, having made false statements, ridiculous statements, he wants to run, if he wants to make a Dunkirk of it, I will say good luck to him.  As far back as 1947 or 1946 I had occasion to know of many cases not far from Deputy Corry's old homestead, and not so far from where he lives now, where we had to bring the Agricultural <Col N="184" /> Wages Board inspector to employers because they refused to pay even the nominal wage laid down by the board. At that time the line of action which Deputy Corry has so noticeably taken in the last few years was less noticeable. At that time he was not so vocal in his demand for costings.  It must therefore be correct to say that in that period he was somewhat satisfied with the prices the farmers were getting.  I thought that he might be careful in offering suggestions about costings to Labour members in this House although I believe that those members would accept his suggestion if he were sincere about it.  We do say that even the agricultural community are entitled to the cost of production plus a fair profit but it is on the words &ldquo;fair profit&rdquo; that we must differ from Deputy Corry and his followers.  Not so long ago when dealing here with prices he quoted the figures of a well-known personality, a professor in Cork, but unfortunately on that occasion Deputy Corry found it suitable to add figures of his own to the figures finally submitted by that gentleman.  Therefore, how can even he believe when he uses words such as &ldquo;fair profit&rdquo; that we will assume that that &ldquo;fair profit&rdquo; is arrived at in a proper businesslike fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming back to the motion&mdash;I do not want to delay long as I do not believe there is need to do so&mdash;I differ from the line of approach taken by Deputy Davern in his amendment. His approach to the question was clear and outspoken.  He simply stated that instead of giving £4 a week in country areas we should leave the matter in the hands of the Agricultural Wages Board.  May I remind Deputy Davern of his own very unfortunate talk when a few years ago the board refused to consider in any way the right of farm workers even to call for a meeting of the board to hear their just claims for an increase in wage.  It was only on the eve of a general strike in Cork County, where, according to Deputy Corry, employers were throwing money hand over fist to their employees, that the Agricultural Wages Board agreed at the last minute of the last hour.  It was in 1946 or 1947 and the Minister for <Col N="185" /> Agriculture agreed to have a meeting called to deal with the question.</P>
    <P>Apart from that I believe that Deputy Davern's amendment is, unintentionally perhaps, sidetracking the discussion on this motion because the motion does not say anything about taking from the board or leaving to them the right of establishing a minimum wage; it simply suggests that this House agree to a minimum wage of £4 per week.  If that is passed and the responsibility is taken by members of the House, particularly by Deputies representing industrial areas and large towns, then I am sure that the motion is a clear indication to the Agricultural Wages Board.  They as a body are responsible for decisions, or at least they are partly responsible because the chairman is nominated by the Minister, and I presume that their decision comes back to the Minister for ratification.  Deputy Davern's amendment can hardly hold pride of place because it asks for something completely different from the motion itself.  However, that must be left to the members to decide.</P>
    <P>I will ask members to state quite clearly their approval of the motion irrespective of what Deputy Corry has said, and I, please God, will not stoop to waste time in answering him. I would ask the members to consider this motion clearly and simply and if they are genuine in their desire for decent conditions for agricultural workers, and if they would like to see a decent type of people living in rural Ireland, then they have an obligation to vote for this motion.</P>
    <P>Other than that, I think the matter should be cut and dry.  Naturally, people looking at it from a different angle may have a different view on it. I honestly believe that the agricultural community is not the downtrodden class that we have been led to believe they are for the last three-quarters of an hour by this Deputy. The agricultural community, it is true to say, have enjoyed a measure of prosperity, not only for the last three years&mdash;I am speaking as a member of a Party which does not try to deny another Party its rights&mdash;but for the last seven, eight or nine years.  During <Col N="186" /> that period the farming community have certainly gained financial advantages which we are proud they have gained, but they should be honest enough to admit they have gained them.  Yet, during that self-same period they have denied, in many instances, the right of the farm worker to the minimum agricultural wage and they only gave way when we were forced to bring in the inspectors in connection with those cases.  Therefore it is quite clear that our approach to this matter cannot be either 100 per cent. on the side of the farmer or 100 per cent. on the side of the worker. I believe we should be 100 per cent. for Ireland in this matter.  If we deplore&mdash;as we all do&mdash;the flight from the land, we must understand clearly that our first duty is to see that the flight from the land is completely stopped. This can be done by giving decent living conditions on the land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned scarcity. He referred to various matters in the past.  Of course, he had to bring in Brian Boru.  I do not know whether Brian Boru was short of milk, but I do know that Deputy Corry forgets that even during the period when we were supposed to be importing foreign butter, we had large exports of milk in the form of powdered cream and chocolate crumb.  If that is so, it follows that the farmers themselves not only helped the export market but contributed to the factories making powdered cream and chocolate crumb.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry must realise that, while he throws out the old cry about offering £6 a week, he offered the same thing 12 months ago.  When on this side of the House Deputy Corry refused to support the right of the farm worker to the half-holiday.  He refused to support the right to a week's holiday and now he is refusing to support the right of the farm worker to a decent wage.  I would ask the members of his party, who are honest, sincere and courageous enough, to show they are determined that the farm worker will be justly, decently and Christianly treated by way of a just wage.  The one way they can do that is by voting for this motion.</P>

      <P>This is my first time <Col N="187" /> to speak in this House.  I have come to this House as a farmer.  I work alongside my farm workers every day, although if I come here I am told I am not a worker.</P>
      <P>Some matters have been mentioned by Labour members, and if they exist they are very unfair and unjust.  If there are workers in Wexford who are paid at the rate of 15/- or 10/- a week it shocks me that this condition of affairs should exist.  I do not like to see this gloomy picture being painted between the farmers and the farm labourers.  I come from an agricultural part of North Tipperary where the farmers and the farm labourers work side by side and where they all sit at the one table.  Of course, they will argue with you that the farmers are very well off and prosperous at the present time when they see them going to Mass in motor cars, but would not the House think that the farmers are entitled to that comfort if they work long hours?  I am proud to come from the land.</P>
      <P>With regard to this matter of looking for milk and butter, the last speaker mentioned the chocolate crumb factories.  I say that the chocolate crumb factories are wrong, because we cannot have both butter and chocolate. Let us have butter before chocolate. I think it would be very wrong and also unfair to go away from the Agricultural Wages Board.  I have as much regard for the farm workers as any man, but I would ask the Labour members to keep to the Agricultural Wages Board because they themselves voted for it. I think the members of that board will give a fair deal to everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. T. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. T. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, I have very little function in this matter.  The Agricultural Wages Board was set up by the Government in 1936.  Many of us know why that board had to be set up.  Prior to 1936, many of the agricultural workers in the country were not getting a sufficient wage for their labour. The Agricultural Wages Board was set up and was composed of representatives of the workers and the employers <Col N="188" /> with a chairman appointed by the Minister for Agriculture.  I cannot see why there is any objection to that board.  There is representation from the workers and the employers.  Surely it is not beyond those people to make an agreement and to decide upon an economic wage as far as the workers are concerned?</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that the wage fixed by the board is not a maximum wage.  It is a minimum wage.  I would also like to point out&mdash;it has been my experience&mdash;that the minimum wage does not obtain to any great extent in the country.  As a matter of fact, it is my experience that the wages paid are far in excess of the minimum wage.  Of course, I would say, in passing, that it shows how far Deputies Kyne, Dunne and Desmond are representative of the agricultural workers of this country.  Having regard to the statements made here to-night, I would say that they actually have no knowledge whatsoever of the conditions of the agricultural worker.  The Agricultural Wages Board was set up for the purpose of fixing a minimum wage but there were other conditions in connection with which it had to lay down regulations.</P>
      <P>For instance, they had a weekly wage to consider.  In many parts of the country we have conditions obtaining where you have a weekly wage. That condition obtains in practically all of Leinster and in portions of Munster.  Then in other districts you have an hourly wage, in other districts a monthly wage, and in others a half-yearly wage.  All these had to be taken into consideration by the Wages Board in fixing an amount for each of the various districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, they had to take into consideration different districts.  For instance, you have a special wage for the Dublin area.  You have another wage for a portion of Kildare, Cork City, Meath and Wicklow.  Again, you have a different wage for Clare, Limerick&mdash; adjacent to the city&mdash;and parts of Waterford and Kilkenny.  All these areas had to be taken into consideration in fixing what was considered an adequate wage.  The reason for that differential in many parts of the country is the proximity of many <Col N="189" /> parts to the towns, where you pay a higher wage because of the higher cost of living.  We know that in the areas around Dublin there would be a higher cost of living than there would be around the town of Kildare.  We also know that the farmers in County Dublin may get a higher price for produce than the farmers around Kildare. Consequently, the Wages Board have evaluated the wage there and have given the highest wage to the agricultural workers there&mdash;or rather they have fixed the highest minimum wage. It has happened and is happening&mdash;it has happened in County Dublin, for instance&mdash;that even though the minimum wage was fixed there was a strike later.  The wages in Dublin were increased by 10/- a week, after negotiations between the worker and the farmer.</P>
    <P>I believe that as far as the functions of the Agricultural Wages Board are concerned they have been satisfactory up to the present.  I remember, prior to 1936, back in the 1928-29-30 period, we had a slump in this country and agricultural wages fell as low as 10/- a week, due to the slump.  When prices increased the farmer increased the wages.  So it is to-day that there are very few men working for the minimum wage in this country.  I am surprised that any Deputy should state here that an agricultural worker was working in County Wexford for 10/- a week.  I would go further and say that if I were a Labour representative for County Wexford I would not permit that to happen.  The machinery is there, the Agricultural Wages Board is responsible for seeing that the Act is carried out, and I am sure that in no case have they refused to consider representations made by a Deputy or by their inspectors in order to ensure that at least the minimum was paid.  Therefore I do not believe these things are happening.  It may be the imagination of some of our Deputies, or this may be said for the purpose of making a good case here in the House, but I think it shows great lack of knowledge of the actual position.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just said that there is more than the <Col N="190" /> minimum wage paid.  Is not that a case for a review of the present wage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of fixing a minimum wage.  After that there are various reasons why more is paid. We know all men are not of the same efficiency; we know that there are some farms where one agricultural worker is regarded as being a member of the family and is given special treatment, so he cannot get as high a wage as another man, though he is getting it in kind.  Anyone with any knowledge whatsoever of agricultural conditions knows that what I am saying is true.  There are different conditions also in industrial concerns In some cases you can press a button and put a machine in motion and press the button again to stop it.  That does not obtain on the farm.  We know some farmers are paying much higher than the minimum wage.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to continue with the Wages Board, as I do not think there is any other machinery more suitable. Does Deputy Dunne want this House to fix a wage for agricultural labourers all over the country?  He mentions £4 here.  There are farmers paying far in excess of £4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

Does Deputy Dunne want to make a <Col N="191" /> case for the inefficient man?  I know what Deputy Dunne would like&mdash;to make a case for himself.  We have men on the Agricultural Wages Board.  It is my responsibility as Minister to nominate those people and my function finishes there.  Deputy Dunne would like this House to say that he and his colleagues should be the people who would make nominations, but while it is my function to do it I will nominate the people.  I believe that the board has fulfilled its service and I do not know of any machinery that would improve on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief on this matter.  I was very disappointed this afternoon when I heard the Minister's reply to my question.  In fact, I was amazed at the contents of the second paragraph of that reply in which the Minister stated that the charges made by me concerning recent appointments would not, if true, amount to a breach of the regulations and could not, in his opinion, invalidate the appointments.  Bearing that statement in mind and realising that approach, I fail to see that there is any justice in this country.  The Minister's reply amounts to an avowal that a man could obtain by intrigue, or otherwise, any type of employment in a responsible position in this country.  The Minister's Department is relying on an alteration made some years ago. Under Section 2 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, all such appointments should receive the sanction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know when that position was altered, why it was altered, and who made the Order. The Minister's reply states that the appointment of a home assistance officer is not his responsibility but one for the county managers and the local authorities.  I fail to see why the Minister did not take action irrespective <Col N="193" /> of the alteration to Section 2 of the Act, when I submitted evidence to him showing that these were political appointments.  I have copies of letters which I received from two candidates who were seeking the post and I am quoting now from one of these letters.

      <P>As you are aware by now, the new public assistance officer for Glencar district was appointed because of his political affiliations.  It goes to prove that your statements in the Dáil about the county manager were quite correct.  He certainly is working hand in hand with Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>I had a chat with your friend, John Murphy, about the appointment of Jeremiah Sullivan, Dreenagh to Glencar.  I am sure you are well acquainted with this man's past record.  He got 18 months for the criminal offence of discharging a number of shots into Murphy's house in 1935.</P>
      <P>I think it only fair that you and your other supporters in the present Government should do all in your power to have the Minister withhold sanction of Jeremiah Sullivan's appointment pending a sworn inquiry being made into those irregularities....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This letter is signed by a Mr. John Walsh, who is the secretary of the Clann na Poblachta Party in the Glencar district.  That letter in itself is a clear indication of the position in County Kerry, and in regard to these appointments, and it bears out everything that I have already stated.  The Minister should realise what we are up against down there irrespective of this section which he quoted to-day in such an evasive manner, evasive in the sense that he and his Department are avoiding the issue when dealing with the serious matter which we are up against down in Kerry.  We are faced with a man whose technique is very clever, who is well versed in political matters, and who is backed up by an organisation. I submit, and I can prove my statement, that there was a full rehearsal of this business before the county manager even set about the formation of the selection board.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot add very much to what I said to the Deputy to-day in reply to his question.  As I stated, the position is that the county manager has the appointment of these officers under the Local Government Act, 1941, and as long as he complies with the regulations laid down in 1943&mdash;that is, the regulations regarding local government officers' appointments, I am afraid I cannot interfere with his appointments.  As I pointed out to the Deputy to-day, even if what he says is true, I am advised I cannot do anything.  Even if what the Deputy alleges in regard to canvassing took place and that the best person was not appointed, I cannot do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asks me to hold an inquiry.  An inquiry would cost the local authority a considerable amount of money.  Usually an inquiry costs up to £600 or £700.  Whatever an inquiry might bring out, or whatever report the inspector might present, the fact remains that the appointments have been made and could not be upset.  I think it would be unfair, therefore, that I should order an inquiry and put the local authority to a certain amount of expense when there is no hope of upsetting anything that has been done, even if all the allegations that the Deputy has made are true. <Col N="200" /> I, therefore, told the Deputy in my reply to-day that I did not see any point in holding an inquiry and I am afraid I cannot depart from that.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Irish Legal Terms Advisory Committee established under the Irish Legal Terms Act, 1945. The primary function of this committee is not to publish legal text books but to advise the Minister for Justice in regard to the making of orders declaring equivalents in the Irish language of legal terms.  The Act provides, however, that the Minister may, after consultation with the committee, arrange for the publication of forms and precedents in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>Nine legal terms Orders have been made to date.  So far no forms and precedents have been published.</P>
      <P>No grant is paid to the committee, and the only expenses incurred under the Act are an annual allowance paid to one member who acts in a part-time capacity as a secretary of the committee, travelling and subsistence allowances for members and the cost of publishing legal terms Orders.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in the erection of new primary schools which are not being connected to an existing public water main and public sewer, the consent of the respective local authority dealing with sanitary services is first obtained; and, if not, whether he will so arrange in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases of new national schools which are not to be connected to public water mains and public sewers, the sanitation provided is of either of two types, viz., waterclosets, with a septic tank system of sewage disposal, or dry latrines.  It is the policy of the Department to provide water-flushed sanitation for all new schools where the circumstances permit, i.e., where a suitable water supply for flushing purposes is available or can be made available and where it is feasible to connect the closets to a public sewer or, failing this, to provide a septic tank system of drainage.  If water closets cannot be installed there is no option but to provide dry latrines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every case in which it is intended to provide a septic tank system the manager is required to obtain the approval of the county medical officer for the proposed scheme.  The approval of the county medical officer has not hitherto been sought in cases where dry latrines are being provided.  As I have stated in my reply to the Deputy's other question, the managers will be asked, in future, to submit plans for <Col N="218" /> new schools to the respective local authorities for approval.</P>
