      <P>Loans for the purchase of boats and gear were made by the Fisheries Branch of my Department until 30th September, 1931.

Up to 31st March, 1950, £45,951 has been repaid and £17,113 written off as irrecoverable, leaving a balance outstanding of £3,768. The position of the Sea Fisheries Association as at 31st March, 1950, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Exchequer, in regard to advances made since 1st October, 1931, is shown in Appendix 12 in the Report on Sea and Inland Fisheries for the year 1949.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>With a view to securing as much uniformity as possible in the conditions governing the payment for wet time, county councils were advised on the 27th January, 1949, that, where weather conditions interfere with the operations of road workers, payment of wages should be made to the nearest half-day worked, that is, that payment be made for a half-day (morning or afternoon) irrespective of the actual time worked in that half-day and that men reporting for work in the morning should be paid for that half-day even though weather conditions render work impossible.  Similarly, where men are asked to report again in the afternoon, any who do so should be paid for the second half of the day, even though the weather does not, in fact, improve sufficiently to enable work to be done. I have no power to insist on the adoption of any particular scheme, but I may say that the recommendations have been adopted in the majority of counties.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will indicate (1) whether satisfactory progress is being made in the building of the new hospital at Gurranebraher, Cork, which was originally intended as a fever hospital but is now proposed to be used as an orthopaedic hospital; (2) if contractors have been appointed to carry out the electrical and heating installations, and, if so, when were they appointed; (3) whether any time limits have been inserted for the completion of these contracts, and (4) whether he is aware that the building contractor can employ bricklayers and carpenters only until these sub-contracts are completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) Noel C. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  Certain essential alterations in the plans necessitated by adaptation of buildings originally intended for a fever hospital for use as an orthopaedic hospital, and some difficulties which have arisen in appointing sub-contractors for the heating and electrical installations, have impeded progress on the building of the new hospital at Gurranebraher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The appointment of contractors for the mechanical and electrical services was approved by my Department in December last.  It is expected that a formal contract for the electrical work will be entered into within the next week or so.  It is hoped that the <Col N="1347" /> formalities in regard to the heating sub-contract will be completed without further delay.  Difficulties experienced in obtaining assurances regarding the supply and delivery of certain materials in order to ensure compliance by the proposed contractor with the completion period for the contract have delayed the completion of these formalities.</P>
    <P>(3)  It is intended to insert time limits for completion of the sub-contracts to correspond with the programme for completion of the main contract.</P>
    <P>(4)  I am aware that, owing to the difficulties mentioned, the employment of tradesmen in the finishing trades must be restricted until progress has been made with the heating and electrical installations but there is every hope that, with the completion of contracts for these latter installations, it will before long be possible to extend the range of skilled employment on this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that my Department is in constant communication with the local authority and its technical advisers in efforts to ensure that the remainder of the work will be completed as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state whether a tender was accepted for the electrical contract last April by the Cork Corporation and that it has since been awaiting the sanction of his Department?  Is he aware that, due to this great delay, there is a grave possibility that the cost of this contract will be practically doubled and that there is now great difficulty in obtaining supplies which were far more easily obtainable at that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties which arose, as I said in reply to the Deputy's question, arose largely out of our inability to get an assurance from the electrical contractor that supplies would be available to enable him to finish the work within the alloted time.  Having received that assurance we were then in a position to accept the tender and to allow him to go ahead with the work.</P>

It is a matter, of course, on which the House might be asked to judge, but I do not intend to ask the House to do so on this occasion, as grave disorder did not arise as on a previous occasion.  I <Col N="1349" /> should like Deputies to realise that penalties will follow from any such conduct on the Adjournment in future, and that the Ceann Comhairle would be inclined to ask for greater penalties for disorder on such an occasion than on the occasion of an ordinary debate because continued interruptions, or conduct of that character, would utterly destroy the efficiency of an Adjournment Debate.  A Deputy might be allowed to speak, and then if disorder arose, the Minister would be prevented from replying.  Sometimes there is a tendency also constantly to interrupt a Deputy who has the right to speak on the Adjournment.  I now wish to inform the House of the fact that penalties will follow such conduct on the Adjournment in future, not at that time but on the following day.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I tried to point out the damaging effect which the policy, or shall I say, the changes and uncertainty of policy, so characteristic of this Government, had upon, and was calculated to have upon, public morale.  That brings one to what should <Col N="1351" /> be the kernel of this debate from one point of view.  It brings up to inquire what is the policy of the Government, the general basic policy or considerations which direct the Government in their approach to the nation's business. A perusal of their history over three years gives no clearer picture than the facts which I tried to enumerate last night.  As far as the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for this matter, is concerned, we can trace what he has purported to do; but the net result is that, at the present moment, neither the people in the country nor Government supporters themselves, I think, know on what basis the Government is facing its present problems.  One cannot get any clear indication as to what their outlook is.  We do not know, for instance, definitely whether they are still content to go along the line which the Taoiseach characterised as the hypothesis of peace.  Neither do we know whether they are conditioning their policy by the probability of economic difficulties in the future, let alone the possibility of something worse.  When one looks at their actions, there is confusion and contradiction, as I hope specifically to show in a moment.  On the one hand, there will be talk about preparations for emergencies and preparations for difficulties, but on the other hand when efforts are made to probe the situation with questions, and when the figures relating to the economic situation are examined, one sees that the old drift is simply continuing.</P>
      <P>Now it is almost impossible to get down to a common basis of discussion on this important aspect of national housekeeping unless we are quite clear what are the fundamental considerations basing Government policy.  I must confess that I myself am utterly confused, and I know very many other people are also, to know what is this Government doing, or what is their outlook.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin says &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo; Perhaps he may resolve the following set of inconsistent facts. <Col N="1352" /> I will give him chapter and verse for them.  The Minister for Finance started off two years ago&mdash;the record is here in Volume 110 of the Official Reports and he will be found reported both in the Vote on Account and in the Budget statement&mdash;by laying down &mdash;I gave the quotation last night&mdash;a policy of retrenchment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a policy of retrenchment, the cutting of the cost of living and similar statements which we have come to associate with Fine Gael.  That policy, of course, was not carried out.  The figures on the front of the book in the following three years demonstrate and show conclusively that, of course, that policy was not carried out.  But all the while, during that period, you had right up to the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate last year, the standpoint that you were to face ultimately a period of normal peace&mdash;to use the Taoiseach's phrase, he was legislating for peace or basing his policy on the hypothesis of peace, and those who attempted to draw attention to the difficulties and to the worsening of the international situation were laughed at and were described in all sorts of unflattering terms, and were dismissed with contempt by the Taoiseach and other Ministers.  I can understand that.  We are told that that was the official attitude of the Government. The thing which it is hard to understand is that, while this statement was being made, the drift was allowed to continue.  As I say, it belied the protestations of Fine Gael both in regard to retrenchment and the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we came to the Supplies and Services Bill, and, overnight, there was a change in attitude.  The official attitude up to then was that the Government considered the retail prices situation satisfactory.  I think that is actually the phrase of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That stand was again taken up last December or at the end of November.  But the facts were too strong to allow that misrepresentation to continue and, as I pointed out last night, it led to an immediate panic.  Then we had the spectacle of <Col N="1353" /> the Taoiseach, in Wexford, I think it was, talking about foolish optimism and an anxious time ahead and, overnight you might say, beginning to realise that the situation was serious. We had the Tánaiste rushing in with his price freeze and we have been allowed to believe that the Government's policy since then is to be determined by the &ldquo;anxious time ahead&rdquo;.  In other words, that, economically, we are to prepare for the difficult time ahead, whatever it may be&mdash;and we all admit now that, whatever is coming, the time ahead is likely to be difficult&mdash;and, what is more, that certain defence preparations were to be made.  But, with these protestations, we find again a disparity between action and protestation, as in the case of the previously held Fine Gael policy.  What do we find?  While the Government were working on a hypothesis of peace with their primary aim retrenchment, reduction in the cost of living and the cutting of State expenditure&mdash;three big pleas of the present Minister for Finance&mdash;the State expenditure goes up, the cost of living goes up and there is no retrenchment.</P>
    <P>Here again we find exactly the same type of phenomenon characterising this Government.  Last December there was every sign that at least they did realise what situation had to be faced.  As I say, there was every indication of panic.  There was the price freeze on the part of the Tánaiste. That must be a rather chilly matter when he contemplates it, in view of the results as disclosed day by day in the papers in regard to defreezing. You had the Minister for Defence announcing certain changes and purporting to start a defence drive.  But, again, check performance with protestation and the same characteristic of this Government is to be found. Obviously, most of the talk about defence was a big bluff.  Week after week and day after day efforts have been made by questions to drag from the Minister for Defence any indication that something is being done, and I leave the Deputies themselves to analyse the answers given.  The fact is that there was a certain amount of talk, that there was a meeting, and <Col N="1354" /> that there was little else done.  What was worse, the attitude adopted was such as to sabotage&mdash;to use a very common phrase&mdash;any real effort which might be made to deal with this problem. The Red Cross was launched on a campaign and then left to it.  Surely no more damaging thing could be done to any organisation, particularly a voluntary one, than to go through the forms of starting them off on a campaign and then leaving them high and dry.  It is like launching a vessel in a canal and then letting the water run out.  That is what was done.  There was one big flourish and thereafter the relevant Department has not even the information required to handle the problem.</P>
    <P>I am using these to exemplify the typical attitude of the Government.  On 7th December, the Government were going to do nothing about the First Line Reserve.  Before January was out, a scheme was advertised.  What is the result?  A scheme is advertised, but no member of the Government goes out to try and support it.  A certain number of recruits come in and the Minister comes in here and says it is a failure and, more or less by implication, says that somebody drove him to it.  What kind of a Minister is he to admit that he would take his decision because somebody kicked him into it and then come along and, because it does not work, blame the somebody? That is an extraordinary concept of government.  Surely it is the Government's responsibility to assess what is the right thing to do and to do it irrespective of whether it will be popular with certain people or with their opponents.</P>
    <P>These are just two examples of the attitude of this Government to national affairs.  The same trend can be found now in the attitude of the Minister for Finance on the present occasion.  He made a short speech when introducing this Vote on Account.  Last night I traced the history of and the damage that was done by the shuttlecock, improvident measures taken in regard to turf, the cost of living and other matters.  I might here consider the cynical attitude disclosed by the Government to the nation's finances. No further pretence is being made that <Col N="1355" /> they are going to achieve retrenchment or about the cost of living.  But the Minister comes in here and tells us quite frankly that spending has gone up.</P>
    <P>Assume for the moment that the Minister for Finance were to face the present situation as it is and give him the credit for facing up to it, as we thought the Government were going to face up to it last December.  What would be the position?  Surely all the efforts of the Government would be turned towards directing our financial resources in a way that would safeguard as far as possible supplies for the future and safeguard our future generally. None of us could complain, for instance, about expenditure which involved real stocking-up.  None of us could complain about expenditure in present circumstances that would lay in plant or make arrangements for a day when we might be more isolated.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  First of all, we find that the Minister apparently has no very definite information and, from the tone of his approach to this, one would almost gather the impression that he was not very interested in getting any more definite information. Be that as it may, the record itself shows this statement to his credit:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some stocking-up undoubtedly is being done at present but it is not an easy matter to distinguish what has been done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to say that that there has been a very definite increase in consumption, particularly in the consumption of non-essential goods in the country.  He excludes food, clothing, fuel and rent as being in the essential class.  Therefore, notwithstanding the anxious time ahead which the Taoiseach spoke of, notwithstanding the dissipation of our assets which is allegedly being done to facilitate proper development here&mdash;repatriation of the assets it was called&mdash;notwithstanding all these protestations here, we find a situation where money was being squandered on non-essential consumable goods, goods from which, when they are gone, there is no benefit thereafter.  That is the way we are to <Col N="1356" /> face the anxious time ahead.  I think I am well within my rights in characterising that attitude as cynical, improvident and dangerous.</P>
    <P>Let me come now to the next paragraph in the Minister's speech.  He comments on the fact that there has been a rise in import prices and he says that that rise in import prices is not yet matched by a corresponding increase in the return for exports.  You have then the improvident situation in which we are squandering our substance in buying non-essential goods while, at the same time, a trade situation is complacently allowed to continue in which we are paying more for what we import than we receive for the good food we export.  As far as one can see this Government has made no real effort to adjust that adverse balance.  In the very next sentence the Minister says: &ldquo;The rise in import prices is to some extent the product of devaluation.&rdquo;  That may well be; I shall deal with that in a moment.  One would imagine, considering the nature of our exports, that had there been a provident policy enforced by this Government we could at least have kept parity between the prices we paid for our imports and the prices we received for our exports in so far as devaluation affected the problem.</P>
    <P>I am basing all that I say now on the Minister's own statements.  If that is the situation, then that is yet another indication of the failure of this Government to face up to its responsibilities. The Minister says in that same speech: &ldquo;Shortages have already made their appearance....  It is expected that these will become more acute.  At the same time it is hoped that there will be an upward movement in export prices.&rdquo;  Shortages will become more acute: what lead has the Government given as to its policy in relation to that problem?  I find it very hard to deal with this matter in the absence of any specific indication as to what the Government will base its policy on; I wonder does the Government know its own mind in the matter.  Be that as it may, there is obviously on the Minister's own statement a failure to stock up essential commodities.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with that in his reply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> The general financial policy of the Minister for Finance can have an important influence on the attitude of those responsible for our imports.  Yet, many of the actions and statements of this Government have been such as to create uncertainty in the minds of business men.  They have also helped to set class against class and that has militated seriously against the proper preparation of this country for the difficult times that lie ahead.  Having said that, I anticipate that I shall be accused by Deputies on the Government Benches of war mongering.  No matter what comes, and let us all hope that ultimately war will be avoided, there is a difficult economic situation ahead.  Temporary shortages will occur.  If we are to weather the storm now is the time to make preparation, even at this late hour.  We have already lost three valuable years.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the approach of the Minister for Finance to these problems once more.  The only inference I can draw is that he considers it his function to try to find the money; having found the money, financial policy does not matter much thereafter. I referred last night to the cynical disregard of the real requirements of the nation in favour of the more narrow requirements of providing revenue.  The question is as to whether or not the Minister is in fact permitting the particular state of affairs to exist to which he makes reference in his speech when dealing with the consumption of non-essentials. I wonder does the Minister want that particular state of affairs to continue because it will give him the necessary revenue.  It is quite clear that if he can encourage the consumption of these non-essential goods his revenue will remain very buoyant.  If his revenue remains buoyant, then he will be able to evade for the moment at any rate any increases in taxation rates.  That seems to be the policy. Just as he seems to completely disregard the problem of the future of the country in his policy of borrowing, so he is prepared to exploit a particular opportunity again completely disregarding the future.  If he can encourage spending on these non-essential <Col N="1358" /> goods they will bring him in a big revenue and his problem temporarily is solved.  Apparently he can then sit back quite complacently about the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce some time ago discussed this matter.  He referred to the standard of living of the people generally.  He said that the people's living standards were of particular significance at a time when essential lines of essential foodstuffs were available to all citizens.  He gave certain figures: &ldquo;Expenditure on drink, tobacco and amusements had doubled since 1938 and amounted to no less than £44,000,000 in 1949... £8,000,000 was wagered on Irish racecources last year and bets placed in bookmakers' premises doubled an equivalent sum so that, without reckoning dog track betting, about £16,000,000 was expended on gambling last year, a threefold increase since 1948.&rdquo;  I am quoting now from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 30th January, 1951.  Some innocent people might think that the emphasis laid by some members on the Government Benches on this matter is to be used as an excuse for certain steps that might be taken in the future.  It seems to be more likely, however, that this Government's attitude is to continue to encourage expenditure in those categories so that the Minister for Finance will be relieved of difficulties in finding the money to cover the various commitments which he must meet.  In other words, in so far as this Government has any policy at all, it seems to be the deliberate, set policy of the Minister for Finance to encourage spending in these categories, to allow the frittering away of our resources in these categories and to allow the time when we should be preparing for the anxious time ahead&mdash; again to use the Taoiseach's phrase&mdash; to slip by improvidently, as the last three years have been allowed to slip by.</P>
    <P>Explanations are commonplace matters with this Government.  The trouble about this Government now is that they have explained so much that their own explanations trip them up.  Explanation after explanation has eventually <Col N="1359" /> destroyed the last vestige of confidence which the country had in them.  Deputies know very well from their contacts outside just how true that statement of mine is.  It sets one wondering as to what future we have to face if this kind of thing continues.</P>
    <P>We got some indication of the weakness of this Government and the weakness of the Ministers concerned just before Christmas.  One could perhaps forgive, if it was genuine, the mistaken idea that the Government had in working blindly on what they call the hypothesis of peace up to last October and if they had been sincere in trying to prosecute that policy, but there is no evidence in the history of the facts to point to any such sincere effort.  They come and they panic on prices, and then they shuttlecock back again.  One asks oneself what might one expect if they were really faced with a serious problem, what would they do, what could the country hope from them.  That, again, is a question that many people are asking.  In other words, we are left in this position in this debate, that we have no real indication as to what basis the Government is facing the future upon.  We might be able to get somewhere with it if we had that, but without that fundamental basis everything is confusion.  Having witnessed the shuttlecocking back and forth, the talk about normality one day and crisis the other, about freezes one day and defreezing the other, and so forth, with all that confusion, the country does not know upon what general basis this Government proposes to move towards the future.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the damage to public morale last night.  Many of the difficulties of this Government at the moment arise from the damage that was done to public morale by them. The lack of confidence in themselves has been fostered and engendered by themselves.  The cynical making of promises, the exploitation of grievances without facing facts, the attempt to pretend that facts beyond the control of a Government were within the control of a Government, as was done more than three years ago&mdash;all these <Col N="1360" /> things are having their repercussions on themselves now.</P>
    <P>It is rather amusing to hear Ministers saying now that there are factors outside their control, external factors.  That is very true, but they would find their path easier and they would find it easier to lead the people in facing the difficulties of the moment had they taken up a different attitude with regard to these same factors some years ago.  How do they expect people to believe them now when they say these things or to follow any of their indications, when their utterances and representations of so recent a time as three years ago are still ringing in people's ears, when they have left people disillusioned and soured with them, when they got votes on the promise of decreases in the cost of living, for instance, and then gave their subsequent sorry performance?</P>
    <P>How can the farming community have any confidence in a Government that led them up the garden, first with oats, then with potatoes, then with fertilisers, then with eggs and poultry &mdash;the latest?  How could they have confidence in a Minister whose only consistent indication was that he would develop or encourage the agricultural economy of this country for the benefit of neighbours across the water rather than for the long-term benefit of our own people at home?</P>
    <P>I was just looking through the devaluation file.  I see two very interesting headings.  They are very interesting with reference to the facts to-day.  The Government and their supporters, in a chorus, will blame devaluation largely for the rise in the cost of living.  I would like to show Deputies the headline of the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 20th September, 1949&mdash;&ldquo;No Significant Rise in the Cost of Living, Assurance by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  I heard Deputies referring to and I saw reports in the newspapers about the cost of fertilisers, but in Galway, in the same month, the Minister for Agriculture assured all and sundry that maize and fertilisers would not go up in price.  Both maize and fertilisers have since gone up in price.  It is very hard to see what confidence any group of people can <Col N="1361" /> have in a Minister or a Government that adopts that approach.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister for Finance has come in, I would like to address this query to him.  It would make it easier to understand both his figures and his statements if we could have some definite indication as to what was the basic consideration in Government policy looking towards the future.  What is the Government's estimate of the present situation and its likely future developments?  If one had that clearly and unequivocally it would be easier to understand the trend of things and it would be easier to understand what policy lies behind the Government's present actions.</P>
    <P>I might repeat the point that I was making.  Perhaps it will save the Minister being briefed by his advisers. It is simply this, that up to a short time ago it seemed that everything was being conditioned by what the Taoiseach characterised as the hypothesis of peace.  I understood that to mean that the estimate was that there was no likelihood of international difficulty involving this part of the world and that the Government of the moment could safely proceed along a hypothetically normal course.  It is quite obvious that things have changed.  It it quite obvious from the state of affairs in the world at the moment that that course cannot be taken.  It is a matter, perhaps, in the final analysis, for a guess as to what the future holds; but whether it is going to result in a conflagration or whether it is going eventually to work out through a difficult period in a way which will avoid a catastrophe, in either case the time ahead looks like being difficult and one of shortage.  I think the Minister would help very much if he could, with definiteness, state the considerations which lie at the basis of the Government's outlook at the moment and we can rejoin issue with him on the matter, if necessary, on another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera last night and to-day took a line which I could appreciate from somebody else who had not, perhaps, got his training. I find it difficult to accept the viewpoint that the Deputy is as innocent <Col N="1362" /> as he would make it appear, or that he has innocently misunderstood the position, as his speech would make it appear.  Last night he took the Fine Gael Party to task at some length because we in this Party had opposed, and had stated we would continue to oppose, squandermania.  I want to make perfectly clear, in case there is any lingering doubt really at the back of the Deputy's mind&mdash;though I do not believe there is&mdash;that the viewpoint of this Party is no different at all from the viewpoint that was correctly expressed by the Minister for Finance on the Vote on Account three years ago.  Deputy de Valera quite deliberately omitted stress or reference to the one conditioning factor in that speech.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when he was speaking on the Estimates that had been prepared by Fianna Fáil but that were brought in by this Government, due to the change of Government, referred to the outlook that was so clear in them, that those Estimates justified the viewpoint that money was being spent in them without any regard to the purposes for which that money was being spent.  The Minister for Finance made the position quite clear then when he said that this Government were looking for economies in public expenditure, save where the expenditure was going to be reproductive or save where it was socially desirable.</P>
      <P>The entire basic difference between the policy of this Government and the policy of Fianna Fáil was that they were prepared to waste the money of the people on things like the £11,000,000 scheme for a new Parliament House, whereas we are prepared to show faith and confidence in the future of the Irish people by investing that money in a way that will bring reproductive employment to the people and that will tend to alleviate and improve social conditions.  That is the basic difference between the two policies, and it is a difference that I have no doubt the people on this side of the House are entirely united in accepting.  It is, of course, a difference which Deputy de Valera did not for his own purposes wish to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> During the whole course of this debate&mdash;and I have listened to or read most of the speeches on the other side that were made in the course of the debate in so far as they were published&mdash;I heard only one constructive suggestion.  That suggestion was made by Deputy Lemass, and I will refer to that.  There was a great deal of destructive criticism; there was a great deal of ballyhoo, but there was only the one constructive suggestion.  It is a constructive suggestion inasmuch as it did suggest a line of policy, but it suggested a line of policy which I think was totally and absolutely undesirable in the time in which we are living.  That suggestion was made by Deputy Lemass, when he resumed yesterday, and when he said that in his view the amount of public investment should be levelled down to the amount of public savings.  That was the whole tenor of his resumed speech yesterday&mdash;that the figure for public investment should be levelled down to public savings.  The viewpoint apparently that the Deputy wanted to get over to the House was that he could have it both ways.  He wanted to suggest that the Minister had allowed public investment to run riot, but in reply to a question put to him from this side the Deputy on another occasion stated that he was not against any particular item in the capital services budget submitted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is quite typical of the whole outlook of Fianna Fáil.  They want to make a grand global statement which they think will sound nice or will read as a nice heading in the <i>Irish Press</i>, and at the same time they want to run away from their responsibilities in making that statement when it comes down to particularising, because cutting out one item or another might not suit them from their political point of view.  I want to make this clear, so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, and it ties in with part of the speech made by Deputy de Valera. Nobody is going to deny that the times in which we are living are likely to be difficult from an economic or a shortage point of view; nobody will deny that in these times it is essential <Col N="1364" /> and more than ever necessary to build up the strength of this nation.</P>
    <P>Where I fundamentally differ with Deputy de Valera is that he wants to take the men of this country away from economic work and put them forming fours on the squares of the Curragh or somewhere else, while I want to ensure that in the time that lies ahead they will be utilised to the fullest advantage in building up our economic resources and, while supplies are available, that we will make the utmost use possible of those supplies.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear to anyone who has considered the matter that if three years ago there had been in this country the enormous expansion in our Defence Forces which Deputy de Valera then advocated and has advocated consistently since, the result would have been that to-day we would have less houses built, less land drained and our whole economic structure would not be as strong as it is.  We would have had, perhaps, some additional people in the Defence Forces who had been in them in the last emergency and who knew in consequence the rudiments of army training, but that would not have affected by one iota the real efficiency or the real force of our defence, because that must depend on material equipment as well as on personnel, and this House has been assured on more than one occasion by the Minister responsible that so far as the provision of additional material equipment for those forces is concerned, no question of money has ever stopped him; the only thing that has stopped him has been whether these materials were available for purchase or whether they were not.</P>
    <P>The whole outlook of this Government and the whole outlook of Fianna Fáil differ fundamentally in that respect, because we want to ensure that the wealth of our people is being invested in things that matter.  We are not interested in some of the schemes which were under consideration by the previous Government at the time they went out.  I am not going to suggest that new buildings in the City of Dublin might not, perhaps, be a contribution to the artistic features of the city; I am not going to suggest that they might not be desirable but I am going <Col N="1365" /> violently to suggest that they are not desirable until we have done something towards building up our economic fabric in a way that will bring us a bigger return.  The whole stress of the speech of the Minister for Finance three years ago was that he was going to ensure that the resources that this Government could employ would be utilised in the promotion of reproductive schemes or schemes that were socially desirable and that all the resources of the State would be set out in a big way, as they were set out in a big way by the same Minister when he was responsible years before for the introduction of the Shannon scheme.  He emphasised that it was that type of investment that was desirable and not a type of investment which merely meant the building of large new public buildings in the City of Dublin.  I think the Minister can quite truthfully say, when we look over this Book of Estimates, that it does achieve that aspiration to some degree.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in any detail with any of the items for capital services but I want the House to realise that if we were to adopt the viewpoint of Deputy Lemass, that our investment should be levelled down to our savings, it is quite clear that many of the items of capital services set out in the Estimates could not be carried out, and that the people would have to do without some of the work which it is proposed to carry out.  If Deputy Lemass were sincere in making that suggestion he should have followed it up by suggesting some items which he thought should be deleted and suggesting a figure which he thought we could invest in schemes for the public good.  We had a suggestion from Deputy Major de Valera dealing with the heading that appeared in newspapers over the Minister's speech in September, 1949. I remember listening to the speech that night as well as the Deputy.  I have not read the full report since nor apparently did the Deputy, but it is quite clear that what the Minister did say was that there was going to be no immediate increase in prices due to devaluation. In fact the Minister for Finance was perfectly correct in that <Col N="1366" /> and events bore him out.  There was no immediate increase although some people imagined that the following week would have seen an enormous jump.  Facts have since borne out the Minister's statement.  I do not know the justification for the heading that was put on that statement, just as I do not know the justification&mdash;in my opinion there was no justification&mdash;for the heading put on the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the beginning of December.</P>
    <P>I could excuse people who had not facilities available, by way of the verbatim Report of the Debates, to check up on what was said in the House, for misinterpreting what was said by Deputy Cosgrave, but there was no excuse whatever for Deputy de Valera or Deputy Little trying to suggest by implication that what the Parliamentary Secretary said was that there had been no increase in the cost of living.  The Parliamentary Secretary said nothing of the sort.  What he said was that there had not been an increase up to the beginning of the previous six months and the verbatim Report of the proceedings of the House is perfectly clear in that respect.  In a factual statement made later in that debate by Deputy Larkin, it is perfectly clear that Deputy Larkin's point was that the increase started a couple of months earlier.  He believed that the rise had started in April whereas the Parliamentary Secretary thought it had started in July.  Of course the heading that was put on the statement in the newspaper reports was the only thing the public understood.  Having got that heading members of the Fianna Fáil Party proceeded to go out and to make whoopee.  The mistaken heading was the only thing understood by the public and Fianna Fáil proceeded to take full advantage of that mistake.  I could understand that at the time but there is hardly a genuine explanation for the continuation of that line now.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the debate on the cost of living and the imposition of the freezing Order is quite a simple one.  There is nobody on this side of the House so foolish as to think that we can control the price of things coming <Col N="1367" /> in from outside but we were quite determined that the public would be able to see and realise that the price of commodities could only be increased to the same extent as the price of these imported commodities over which we had no control had been increased. We were determined to ensure that the passing on of that increase was going to be done in a fair way and that the proportion of our people&mdash;it was not everyone who would do it&mdash; who wished to take advantage of the shortage position that had been created, and who wished to take an unfair advantage of an international rise in prices were not going to be allowed to do so to the detriment of the community as a whole.  It was never suggested from these benches that everyone engaged in Irish history was going to take that dishonest line.  It was never suggested that shopkeepers and those engaged in the distributing trade were all necessarily rogues and that they would take advantage of the community but, unfortunately, there were certain individuals who would not hesitate to take such an unfair advantage of consumers and the steps which we took did effectively prevent that small proportion of traders from taking an unfair advantage of the community because of the international situation.</P>
    <P>We heard some discussion in a general way in this debate as to the manner in which our people are living. There has been since February, 1948&mdash; and we on this side of the House are very glad to be able to say it&mdash;a substantial improvement in the standard of living of our people.  We were in the situation then that it was not possible to get many of the things that can now be procured with much greater facility.  Naturally enough, when standards expand like that the cost of additional purchases is going to rise. If a comparison were made with the cost of living across the water and here, one would find perhaps that their cost of living in certain degrees might be lower when one takes into account the meagre amount of their meat ration, the meagre amount of other rations they receive, and then compare <Col N="1368" /> these with the amount of food which families in this country can purchase. Quite clearly, we are able to have a better standard of living, and so it is natural that the cost to us should be a bit more.  It is equally natural that our people would prefer that.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any doubt whatever in the minds of the people in this country that they are now in a position to purchase more than they were able to purchase in February, 1948.  There has been a rise in wages, and with that a substantial improvement in the position of the people. In consequence of that they have been able, to some extent, to overcome the effect of what was put on them by Fianna Fáil when the standstill Order was brought in without an equivalent standstill Order in prices at that time.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance said nothing of the sort.  That is another of the same kind of twist which the Deputies opposite are always anxious to put on any statement, just as Deputy Vivion de Valera lectured us last night for three quarters of an hour on the question of Fine Gael financial policy without ever adverting, though I asked him once to do so, to two most important qualifications that there were in the Minister's speech of three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the other Deputies on the opposite side also gave us a long lecture&mdash;I think it was Deputy Vivion de Valera but I am not absolutely sure of that&mdash;on the subject of turf and of the present arrangements which, he said, were being belatedly made for the coming season.  The Deputy was rather unfortunate that he did not, before last Sunday, make clear what the policy of Fianna Fáil in this regard was going to be because if he had perhaps the <i>Sunday Press</i> of March <Col N="1370" /> 4th might not have published the article it did.  I am sure those opposite have read that article.  That article makes clear beyond question that, in the mind of its contributor, the arrangements that are being made for the current season for the production of turf are far better than the arrangements that had been made before.  It is not for me to put any emphasis on what the contributor in the <i>Sunday Press</i> said.  The facts are exactly as that contributor of the article has stated.  I can speak from personal knowledge of the position in Kildare. In regard to the people who came to work in the turf camps and live in the hostels in those days, there was an unfortunate feeling, as a result of which they left their work.  They were not satisfied, and did not believe that they should come back themselves in the future and bring others with them.</P>

It is no good for the Deputy to take the view that it is not true.  It was there on the records at that time.  I want to make one suggestion in regard to general financial policy to the Minister.

      <P>There was another reference by Deputy de Valera or Deputy Kissane, I am not sure which, to the question of stockpiling and storage.  So far as the main things that we want to keep in this country are concerned, the real difficulty is that there is not the storage space.  If we had the storage space, we would not, for example, have the situation that we had last autumn when mills <Col N="1374" /> and warehouses could not take in the native wheat because there was not enough room for it in the stores.</P>

      <P>Of course there is not.  When the Deputy's Party left office there was not anything like the storage space there should have been. That storage space has been to a very small degree already increased, but to quite a substantial degree the building of the additional storage space has got beyond the blue print stage.  The Deputy can ascertain by inquiries in Dublin what is being done.  One of the real difficulties during the war, as Deputy Briscoe must recollect, was that we were dependent on regularity of shipping space.  It was not a question of being able to pile up.  We had to depend on its coming in in regular bottoms.  That is one of the real economic weaknesses that we have here and one of the weaknesses which I say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate this if he goes down the country.  I am not making any point against the Deputy's Government, because I think they were right.  But, during the war a lot of land had to be got for the purpose of feeding the people.  If we continued on the same basis, it would mean that if there was another emergency the resources would not be there.  The situation is that over the past three years these resources were being built up and <Col N="1375" /> have been built up again, and that we are in a far more favourable position now to withstand the difficulties of an emergency in regard to the production of wheat than we were three years ago when this Government took over from the previous Government.</P>

That is perfectly obvious to everyone.  I believe it is perfectly obvious to the Deputies on the Opposition Benches, but they will not admit it.</P>
      <P>This Government, as I said at the outset, is working consistently along the lines of an economic policy which I refuse to believe Deputy Major de Valera is too stupid to understand.  I believe he understands it very well, but will not admit it.  It is our policy to ensure that there will be invested here not the restricted limited savings, to which Deputy Lemass referred yesterday, but the maximum amount of men, labour and material which will ensure reproductive utilisation for the betterment of our people as a whole and not utilisation on those things which will not bring any real benefit, an outstanding example of which was the plan of Deputy Aiken for the new Parliament building in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>This year the country is faced with a Bill for £83,000,000, around £14,000,000 increase over 1948 when this Government first took office. The figures for 1947 were round about £59,000,000.  These are audited accounts.  £59,000,000 was the amount of money spent in the last year in which Fianna Fáil was in office.  In addition to an increase of £14,000,000 over and above 1948, the present Government has borrowed £39,000,000 from the Irish people.  It has also borrowed £128,000,000 from the United States of America.</P>

      <P>Dollars.  If you convert those dollars into pounds you get something in the region of £42,000,000. In addition, we have been allocated grants to the extent of $18,000,000. Where is this money being spent?  In what way is it proposed to spend it? Last year the Minister for Finance informed us that he was adopting a new method.  He introduced capital expenditure.  Many of the items included by him under that expenditure were paid for by the Fianna Fáil Government out of direct taxation.  Nothing new is being done by this Government, with the exception perhaps of the land rehabilitation project.  We have been told by the Minister for Agriculture that he intends to spend £4,000,000 per year on that scheme. Last year he spent £472,000 on it, plus £160,000 on machinery.  Where has the balance gone?  Where has all the other money gone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What other money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The money that was borrowed.  No new scheme has been introduced over and above the schemes that were in existence when Fianna Fáil was in office.  The same amount of money was spent on land <Col N="1377" /> reclamation under Fianna Fáil if one includes the farm improvements scheme.  What new schemes have been introduced other than land rehabilitation? If one takes lime, one can put against that the subsidy given on fertilisers. One is just as high as the other.</P>
      <P>The estimate presented in 1948 by Fianna Fáil was for £70,500,000. According to the present Minister for Finance, the value of the £ was then 10/-.  To-day the value of the £ has been still further reduced.  I am sure the Minister for Finance will not quarrel with me on that point.  There has been a further devaluation of at least 10 per cent. and the Estimates have gone up by 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Since 1948 we have borrowed a sum of £39,000,000 so we have in all a bill of £83,000,000.  When the Coalition Government took office the national debt stood at £100,000,000.  To-day it is £183,000,000.  Would any Deputy run his own business in the same way as this Government is running the country?  The Government is tying a millstone around the necks of the people.  The deadweight debt has increased. Interest and sinking fund has gone up from £3,250,000 to over £6,000,000.  That money will have to be found during the next 30 years.  If a farmer were to borrow money and run round enjoying himself until his capital liabilities far exceeded his assets, as they do in the case of the State liability now, he would not have his farm very long.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that the people are spending £44,000,000 per year on drink and £16,000,000 on cigarettes.  Is that a good policy?  Yet, we are told by responsible Ministers that the country was never better off.  Possibly that is so.  We are spending more on amusements anyway.  During the 16 years Fianna Fáil was in office many important schemes were initiated and many important steps were taken.  We paid £10,000,000 to England and in return were given relief to the extent of round about £80,000,000.  We got back our ports.  To pay our liabilities we borrowed £38,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We built more houses per year than <Col N="1378" /> are being built to-day.  During the period that Fianna Fáil were in office, we divided more land than is being divided to-day.  We gave higher prices, <i>pro rata</i>, to the farmers for cereal crops than are being given to-day.  The only increase that there has been is from Britain in the price of cattle so that it is foolish and useless for Ministers to say that the farmers were never better off.  They are well off. They were well off before this Government came into office and it is not anything that was done by the present Government that has made them well off.  Fianna Fáil made them well off when they changed the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal, the rancher policy, and brought in a tillage policy. If the policy that now obtains and that the Minister for Agriculture wants to pursue is continued, in a few years' time the farmers will not be well off.</P>
    <P>It is admitted, of course, that the people in rural Ireland are able to pay their way, but there is a section in this country&mdash;and many of the Deputies on the opposite benches know them&mdash;that may not be as well off.  I wonder if the people who are living on unearned incomes are better off to-day than they were five years ago.  What relief have those people got?  Their cost of living has gone up.  There has been no reduction in taxation as far as they are concerned and yet, taking National Loans, for instance, their dividends are the same.  Those people are not better off. It is very easy to say that the country generally is better off but there are sections of the people who are not better off and that fact should be well known to some of the Ministers and to the Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>
    <P>What would happen to a man who was running his own business in the same fashion as the Government is running the country, borrowing money for, in many cases, useless and unproductive projects?  It is not the first time that I have stated that, in my opinion, the land reclamation scheme, as it has been carried out up to the present in many parts of the country, will be unproductive, that by the time the two-thirds that the Government will pay and the one-third that will be contributed by the farmer are expended, the land will <Col N="1379" /> not be worth the amount of money expended on it under the scheme.  Time alone will tell.  I know land that they have attempted to reclaim, and I know that nothing on earth can make it value for the money that will be expended on it by the time they are finished with it.  The Land Commission are buying land at £10 per acre for afforestation purposes.  Some of the land that is now being reclaimed will not be any better.</P>
    <P>There are many things I would like to say in connection with the general policy of the Government over the past three years, and particularly in the present year.  If that policy is continued, it will be bad, not merely for some sections of the people, but for the country generally.  Let me take agriculture, for instance.  Again taking the value of the £ as in 1948 and assuming that I am correct in saying that there has been a reduction of 2/- in the £ since then, the price of wheat to-day should be increased by 12/6 per barrel.  If 62/6 was an economic price for wheat in 1947, when Mr. Smith, who was then Minister for Agriculture, fixed the price in October of that year for the following harvest, then it must be an uneconomic price to-day, or, putting it in another way, if Mr. Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, believes that the farmers are getting an economic price for wheat to-day, then, in 1947, they were getting far in excess of its value from the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is one or the other.  The unfortunate thing about it is that the Minister for Agriculture cannot be moved, and as a result of that we will have less wheat grown in this country next year.</P>
    <P>I have had the experience during the last week or two of speaking to seed merchants.  I have been told that the number of people looking for seed wheat has dropped considerably, and that they are not taking anything like the same amount of seed as they took in other years.  On the other hand, I have been told by maltsters that they have had increased applications for seed malting barley in this year.  That means that we are going to reverse the policy and that we are going to produce <Col N="1380" /> barley to make drink rather than produce wheat to make bread for our people.  The present price of wheat at 62/6 represents 3/1½ per stone.  The price of malting barley is fixed for next year at 57/6 per barrel, which represents 3/7 per stone.  Is it good policy, is it good economics, is it good national policy, that we should produce malting barley for the purpose of making available drink, which is a luxury, and prevent, because it is a prevention, our people from producing a commodity which is the necessity of life, namely, bread?  If they were induced by way of a better price, there is a great number of farmers who would increase their acreage under wheat, and it is very necessary that the acreage under wheat should be increased. If war or an emergency should arise, what would be the position of this country in regard to supplies of wheat and flour?  On 27th February, 1951, I asked the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;column 565, Volume 124, Dáil Debates&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;if he will state the total quantity of (a) seed wheat, and (b) millable wheat at present in the country, and (c) the estimated quantity of wheat required to meet our normal requirements of bread and flour for 12 months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer I got on that occasion was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) Approximately 230,000 barrels of home-produced seed wheat have been assembled by the authorised seed wheat assemblers, and approximately 60,000 barrels of imported seed wheat have been landed or are in course of delivery.  In addition, some 47,000 barrels of selected milling wheat which would be suitable for seed if required are being held in reserve.  No information is available as to the quantity of wheat retained by farmers for seed.</P>
    <P>(b)  On the 10th February, 1951, the flour millers held approximately 178,000 tons of wheat, as well as approximately 12,000 tons of wheaten flour.</P>
    <P>In addition, a further 99,465 tons of wheat are on load, on passage, loading or freight in course of arrangement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> The estimated quantity of wheat required to meet our normal requirements of bread and flour for 12 months is approximately 480,000 tons and our total supplies as set out above are sufficient to meet our bread requirements at present rate of consumption up to September 30th, 1951.  We are at present negotiating the purchase of a further 97,000 tons of wheat which will be brought forward as storage permits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My calculation is that, taking all the seed wheat that the Minister states is available, we have around 376,000 barrels of imported seed wheat.  Last year we grew 366,000 acres of wheat.  But 376,000 barrels are not sufficient to seed 366,000 acres.  It will take anywhere from 23 to 24 stones, normally, of spring varieties, to seed an Irish acre, so that we have not enough seed wheat at the present time to seed the acreage that was grown last year.  Even if we had, even granting the 97,000 tons that the Minister says he has negotiated for&mdash; granted that these were delivered&mdash; and even assuming we were going to get one ton per acre of the 366,000 acres that were grown last year, if you had an emergency in the morning I calculate, taking all these things into consideration, that normally, with the consumption at 480,000 tons of wheat per year, we would run out of flour in June, 1952.</P>
    <P>That is something the Coalition Government should be concerned about. They have a greater responsibility than trying to kill the schemes that were initiated by Fianna Fáil.  The people who are charged with the responsibility of government have something more to be responsible for than baiting the men on these benches or telling them that their schemes were wrong.  They have the people in the towns and cities and in the country to feed and they have to ensure that, if they are going to fulfil their obligations to these people, they will at least provide them with bread.  That is one of the responsibilities of government.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government, largely through the Minister for Agriculture, are failing in their duty.  The Minister is not giving a price that will induce <Col N="1382" /> our farmers to grow wheat in preference to malting barley.  If you had an emergency in the morning, and we were unable to get wheat, as might happen, we might have other countries very anxious to supply us with bread. We heard at Question Time to-day the Minister for Defence answering a question regarding warlike stores.  He told Deputy de Valera that the position was entirely unsatisfactory, that orders had been placed and they were not delivered, and that the British attitude to this country was entirely unsatisfactory.  Is it not good policy on the part of Britain to keep us in a disarmed condition?  Is it not good policy on the part of Britain to keep us from growing wheat?</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that the person responsible for growing the foodstuffs our people require has been in league with Britain, not merely recently, but seven or eight years ago, when he wanted the people of this country to walk with heads erect into the British Empire.  He has not changed.  The leopard never changes its spots.  The Minister for Agriculture has never changed his outlook.  His spiritual home, his political home, is still across the water.  For that reason it is time that the Government, and particularly the representatives of Labour in that Government, who also have responsibility, would see to it that provision is made so that our people will be supplied with bread.</P>
    <P>If we want to retain our independence, if we want to carry out the policy announced by the Government and supported by Deputies on this side of the House&mdash;a policy of neutrality&mdash;we must make preparations for war.  We must prepare to defend that policy and the first essential is to have food for our people and for our Army.  What attempt is being made by the people responsible for doing that?  We are making provision, of course, for malting barley to be consumed, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, in the form of drink to the extent of £44,000,000.  There has not been a word about that.  The Minister for Finance will not say a word about it. He is deriving a good revenue from it and because of that he will keep silent.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Defence said this <Col N="1383" /> evening, the British are reluctant or unsatisfactory in supplying warlike requirements, whatever they may be.  I wonder would we have met with the same unsatisfactory position had we dealt with continental countries?  We were told here in 1948 about the wonderful agreements made with Britain, when the British negotiators insisted on this country sending them 90 per cent. of our cattle and giving permission to this country to send only 10 per cent. to the continent.  I wonder if the position had been reversed and if we had not been so much linked up with the British as we have been for the past three years&mdash;and we are heading in that direction every day&mdash; how we would fare?</P>
    <P>We have seen how that agreement was kept.  We have seen our people this year left without fuel.  If the fly-by-nights that the Minister for Agriculture talked about then were permitted to come here and purchase our cattle, I wonder would our Army be devoid of these warlike stores that the Minister for Defence talked about? Unfortunately, it has been the policy of many of our Ministers down through the years to become more closely linked with the people across the water.  It should at least now be time for them to realise the position in which they have placed themselves. The agreements they made in the last three years have been broken or unfulfilled. What about the poultry and egg agreement in 1948, or the agreements about coal, butter or bacon? Have all these agreements been fulfilled? It is time the policy of Fine Gael should change and that the outlook of the Minister for Agriculture should change.  There is one thing that can be done, but it must be done very quickly if this country is to be assured of a supply of wheat for next year.  A change of attitude must be announced this week regarding prices.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Sweetman talking about turf production and how easy it was going to be made for county councils to produce turf this year.  He gave his experiences in County Kildare. Let me give mine of County Kilkenny. Kilkenny County Council have been told they must produce 13,000 <Col N="1384" /> tons of turf and create an iron ration of a two-years' supply at least.  In the peak years during the emergency, when we had men available, and equipment, and when we had carried out development work on the bogs and everything was ready just to walk in and cut and save the turf, the peak was 7,000 tons per annum.  This year we are told that we must produce 13,000 tons.  In 1947 when we produced 7,000 tons we were permitted to buy from the small producer, the farmer with a family who went out on the bogs, cut the turf and sold it to us. That will be denied us this year.  We have been told by the Minister for Local Government that he will not permit that to happen, that all our requirements must be produced through the county council by direct labour.  We were able to produce only 7,000 tons in 1947 with all the equipment and labour we then had.</P>
    <P>Now we have to come and develop these bogs again and redrain them. Had the policy of Fianna Fáil been continued in 1948, had we been producing turf each year, had our councils been compelled to produce it, a situation such as has arisen now would not have arisen.  We would have kept our people who had been working on the bogs during the four or five years prior to 1948 at home. We would have had the equipment and we would have had the reclamation work done so that this year, when the necessity again arises, it would not have been necessary for the Minister for Local Government to come along and say: &ldquo;You must make provision for a two-year ration of turf in 1951.&rdquo; What was the reason for discontinuing the production of hand-won turf?</P>

      <P>I should like to go back but, now that you have changed your opinion regarding it, I do not believe there is much use in discussing it.  You have come back to the Fianna Fáil policy and that is something gained.  Now that you are coming back to the old schemes of policies of Fianna Fáil, I might mention tourism. Tourism is another little scheme that the Coalition Government killed.  They talked about the English people coming over here to be fed.  They talked about the palatial hotels erected by Fianna Fáil and the amount of money which they alleged was misspent on tourism.  After two years, they discovered, to their amazement I am sure, that the tourist industry was worth £35,000,000 to this country.  The goose that was laying the golden eggs is dying and, now that she is almost dead, they are trying to revive her by spending a lot of money in an effort to restore tourism.  There are many other things which the Coalition Government did but I am not going to waste the time of the house in going into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> I should like to call attention to two statements made recently by the Minister for Agriculture.  He said that the people were never so well off as they are at present, that this was a land following with milk and honey again. He said that we had full employment on the land, that the population was increasing and that it had never been so high since the days of Brian Boru. On the 19th of December, 1950, the Social Welfare Department issued a report.  Just to show how prosperous the rural community, but particularly the farming community, felt themselves, I might mention that, according to that report, the number of people engaged in agriculture on 1st June, 1949, was 16,755 fewer than on the 1st June, 1948.  Therefore we had an exodus from the land between June, 1948 and June, 1949.  That does not look as if the people were happy and contented, &ldquo;never so prosperous as they were at the present time&rdquo;.  The Minister also stated that we had full employment.  The unemployment figures have gone down but yet on the 24th February this year there were 63,000 people registered as unemployed. Therefore all the things we have been hearing from the Minister for Agriculture are not quite so true as he would have as believe.  We still have our unemployment; we still have emigration and the flight from the land.  If this is to continue, I believe that when Fianna Fáil comes back into office to clear up the mess left by the Coalition Government, we shall have our work cut out for us.</P>

      <P>It is a moral certainty. It is going to happen whether we hope for it or not.  The people are going to do it; they are only waiting for the opportunity at the moment. Give them the opportunity and you will see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I referred to all the points which I wanted to cover but I should like to add that notwithstanding the fact that we are faced with Estimates this year totalling £83,000,000&mdash; £14,000,000 over and above what Fianna Fáil asked for in their last year of office&mdash;and notwithstanding the <Col N="1387" /> colossal amount that has been borrowed&mdash;I am not satisfied that this country is run in the best interests of the people.  I believe myself that this land rehabilitation scheme is not a good scheme.</P>
    <P>So far as the expenditure of all these moneys is concerned, the one good scheme that I have seen is that which was initiated by the Department of Local Government, the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Good work is being done under that Act.  In my opinion it would be far better if the Minister for Agriculture got out of the picture altogether and left the drainage of land and the avoidance of flooding on the roads to the county councils.  They would do a far better job than he and his experts in the Department of Agriculture are doing. The money allocated would be far more usefully spent.  It would serve the interests of the people better if that work were left to the county councils.  That is the only scheme that I can say is giving value for the money that is being spent on it.  The work is done by our own engineers.  I am certainly going to vote against the giving of £83,000,000 to this Government unless the Minister is able to tell me, and tell those who are in opposition, that it is going to be spent in the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to agricultural prices so far as wheat and milk are concerned.  These should be increased. If we have regard to the change in the value of the £ the price of milk should go up by 3d. a gallon.</P>

      <P>We had the extraordinary experience this year of having to import butter.  During the last 12 months we exported butter to Great Britain at 266/- per cwt., while we imported butter from New Zealand and Denmark at 376/- and 379/- per cwt. That is not good policy, and I am sure the Minister for Finance will agree that it is not.  Would it not be far better to ensure a supply of butter sufficient to meet the requirements of our own people by having more milk produced? <Col N="1388" /> The Government could have that if they held out any inducement to our farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that Deputy Walsh would have taken a different line from that taken by a number of the Opposition Deputies, but I was doomed to be disappointed.  I had hoped that, while he might criticise the things that we did not do and the things that we did do, he certainly would not complain of the cost.  Most Deputies on the opposite side would want to make up their minds as to what really they want.  For the past three years they have claimed that this Government, under the present Minister, has been trying to carry out retrenchment, and that the Party that I belong to was tied to the tail of a Fine Gael Minister who was laying the axe everywhere he could.  They have told us that the country was left defenceless, that the Garda force, due to the lack of recruitment, was almost extinct, that turf production was being discontinued, that the transatlanic airways had been stopped, that the short-wave station had been scrapped, that mineral development and research had been stopped, and that the Place Names Commission had been discontinued. But, suddenly, a change has come over them, and this year they say there is squandermania in this Government, that they have gone mad on spending, and that, never before, has the country been faced with such a debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite complain of the size of the bill that has to be met. Surely they cannot expect, if the Government takes heed of their demands, not only their demands, but demands from all sides of the House, that improved services should be carried out, that increases should be granted to civil servants and all in State employment, that all that can be done without increasing the cost. Opposition Deputies who are loudest on their local councils demanding bigger grants and cheaper loans for housing, for roads, for sewerage, for water supplies, for hospitals and for schools, decry here the effort that is made by the Government to meet those demands.  By asking questions in the Dáil and by speeches they advocate <Col N="1389" /> better wages, better conditions, better pensions and superannuation for all Government employees, and still they ask that all that should be done at the same cost as when they were running the country under worse conditions so far as all those various classes of people were concerned.  If they were honest with themselves they would know that all these demands of theirs must cost more money.</P>
    <P>They claim throughout the country that money to-day has only half the value that it used to have.  They say that the ordinary employer has to meet twice as high charges in the way of overheads to carry on his business, but they deny the very same concession to the people who are trying to run the Government.  The Minister for Finance must necessarily find that money has only half its value so far as the running of the country is concerned if what the Opposition Deputies say is true.  If better services are given they have to be paid for.  We in the Labour Party are demanding and asking for better conditions for the people of the country, and when the piper comes to be paid we are not going to complain.  We realise that the Minister is no magician.  He may be a wizard of finance, but he still will have to find the money if he is to increase wages and salaries, and give improved benefits to the aged and the blind.</P>
    <P>We have had experience in the past of Opposition Deputies putting forward claims which they themselves must not have believed to be true.  Deputy Walsh referred to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  He claimed that it was the only good thing that this Government ever did.  When the late Mr. T. J. Murphy was putting that Act through the Dáil, we had Deputy after Deputy on the Opposition Benches claiming that the local councils would be swamped with lawsuits if authority were given to the officials of local authorities to enter private lands in connection with flooding on county or main roads.  Every local authority in the country has availed of the grants made available under that Act.  I have yet to hear of one single case where a council has been mulcted in costs for damages.  It certainly <Col N="1390" /> has not happened in my county where we have taken our full share of the grants that were made available. We have done a great deal of necessary work under that Act, and have been enabled to give employment to hundreds and hundreds of men over the past three years.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of opposition which I feel is unfair.  It is the duty of those on the other side to expose flaws in legislation or in suggested legislation sponsored by the Government, but it is not their duty to oppose, whether a thing is right or wrong, or whether it is good or bad. I suggest that they are adopting the very same attitude on this Vote on Account as they did on that Act. Irrespective of whether there is any good in the Government, they are claiming that it is bad.  That, I suggest, is a bad policy and one that is not good for the country.  It is a policy that is calculated to break down the morale of the country if it is persisted in.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is constantly made by the other side that this Government stopped the hand-won turf production. Is it not a fact that on the files of the Local Government Department there can be got a copy of a circular issued by the then Minister in August, 1947, which was sent to all county councils, indicating that hand-won turf production was to be stopped in favour of machine-won turf production to be carried on by Bord na Móna?  Whether or not that was a good policy I am not prepared to say.  In actual fact, at the time and for the years following, it was not a bad policy, as we would get better and cheaper turf produced by machines.  Surely it is ridiculous to suggest that we stopped it and that the other side would have continued with hand-won turf?  It is quite true, as Deputy Walsh said, that if we did not agree with that circular we could have disregarded it and continued on, but, because of the circumstances then obtaining, we carried on on the lines which the Local Government Department indicated.  I see no reason why an apology should be made for doing so.  It would probably be too much to expect the dyed-in-the-wool supporters <Col N="1391" /> of Fianna Fáil to believe it, but it is a fact that that circular can be produced and it should be procured. It was read at certain county council meetings.  It was read at a meeting of the county council of which I am a member and I am certain that it was not a bogus circular.</P>
    <P>If, by reading a morning newspaper, Fianna Fáil supporters can be convinced that after 16 years of meditation there can be produced out of the air a scheme of social welfare better in all respects than the one which has been introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare and at no cost to the person who takes part in it, then surely they would believe anything that is told them by their own Deputies or leaders. I suggest to Deputies on the other side that the people of the country have now decided that the hopes of a general election being called on account of the Independents voting against the new Bill have been dashed to the ground. Even if they were not dashed to the ground, the working people, the old, the blind and the sick of this country will look to this side of the House for services that were denied them for 16 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps before I devote myself to an examination of the general economic position of the country, I might correct a statement which has just been made by Deputy Kyne. I was Minister for Local Government in 1947 and I did not terminate the hand-won turf scheme.  I did issue a circular indicating that the production of hand-won turf could be better undertaken by the specialised organisation which had been set up by the State under the Fianna Fáil Government for the development and exploitation of our peat resources rather than by the improvised organisation which had been set up in time of emergency under the county councils.  I pointed out in the circular that the work of reconstructing and restoring the roads which had been so heavily damaged during the emergency was urgent and that for that purpose the Government were giving a free grant, I think in that year of over £2,000,000 and in the following year of over £4,000,000, to enable the county <Col N="1392" /> councils to employ their skilled staff and their experienced engineers upon the job for which they were originally recruited.  That was the purpose of the circular which was issued by me in 1947, and which transferred the responsibility for producing hand-won turf from the local authorities to Bord na Móna.  What happened in the year 1948 was the responsibility of the Government of that day and not of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to look at the figures which appear on the volume of the Estimates for the Public Services for the year ending 31st March, 1952, in respect of which we are now considering the Vote on Account.  We have there set out the total cost of the Supply Services for the year broken up into two components&mdash;the capital services which are costed at £12,079,000 and the Supply Services which are estimated to cost £70,956,000.  In all, and this is the significant relevant figure, the Government anticipate that during the coming year they will spend no less than £83,000,000 of the people's money. Whether that money comes from taxation or whether it comes from inflation, it is money taken out of the pockets of the people and used by the Government for their own purposes. It is quite true that you can do more harm to the economic structure of the country if you take it in one way rather than in another.  I venture to say that when the Estimates for the Central Fund services are before the Dáil it will be quite clear that irresparable damage is being done to the finances of this country by the policy which is being pursued by this Government since it came into office, that is, of borrowing where they ought to have taxed to defray public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we have here this figure of £83,000,000 for the Estimates for the Supply Services for the coming year. But let nobody in this House deceive himself that that is going to be the whole tale or toll of expenditure.  At the moment, we are endeavouring to cope with Supplementary Estimates that are falling upon this House as the leaves fall in autumn.  They are pouring <Col N="1393" /> in upon us in a spate, in a full flood tide, indicating the extravagance even at the last moment of the eleventh hour of the Government under which the people are now groaning. It is impossible to keep track of them all.  In some cases, it is impossible to check them all; but they are miserable in information, grandiose in magnitude and prodigal in conception. Over and above the £78,000,000 which we were asked for this time last year, we have been asked to provide in round figures, and not taking into account any broken thousands, over £1,500,000 within these past few days.</P>
    <P>During the year which is now closing, over that £1,500,000 additional which is now being demanded, the Dáil voted another £500,000, making, so far as I can ascertain, the total amount asked for under the head of Supplementary Estimates at least £2,000,000.  Now we may take it as certain that when the financial year 1951-52 is drawing to a close we shall again be asked, either in the last month of that year or during the course of the year, to provide at least another £2,000,000 over and above the £83,000,000 with which the country has been confronted during the past few days.  That will make £85,000,000 in all for what may be described as the normal expenditure visualised under the expensive policy of the present Government.  In addition to that, and there is no provision for it in this volume, the Minister for Social Welfare has indicated that the Government will look to the taxpayer to provide&mdash;it will not provide&mdash;another £1,000,000 for old age pensions.  We have then an additional £4,600,000 as the contemplated State contribution under the Social Welfare Bill, if it ever becomes law.  When we tot all these things up we find that the true estimate for Government expenditure during the coming year, so far as we can visualise it, is of the order of £90,600,000.  That leaves out of account the £3,400,000&mdash;or, shall we put it this way, the burden of the Minister for Social Welfare's stamps, £3,400,000 of which is to be provided by the worker in the first instance&mdash;some may succeed in passing this part of it on to other members of the community&mdash;<Col N="1394" /> and £4,600,000 to be found by the employers which will definitely be passed on, with added profit, to the consumer. The position may be roughly summed up as follows: over and above the amount which will be provided by taxation, definitely imposed as taxes and not cloaked as contributions, there will be this £8,000,000 additional burden imposed on trade, industry and agriculture to be passed on by the producers in practically every industry except one, namely agriculture, to the consumers and ultimately to the taxpayers.  The real expenditure then with which the community is confronted at the instance of the Government, and in order to serve the Government's ends, is not £83,000,000 as appears on the Book of Estimates but almost £100,000,000 if it will not exceed that sum.</P>
    <P>Let us now turn for a moment and contemplate the Minister in his earlier swashbuckling days when he came in here proclaiming proudly that he would cut everything and then suddenly found that he was about to cut off the nose of the Coalition in order to spite its Labour face.  In the days when the Minister was still preaching the Fine Gael policy, in the days when he was all for retrenchment and reductions in the cost of living, in expenditure and in taxation, the actual expenditure under the last Fianna Fáil Budget, according to the Minister's own speech, for the year ending 31st March, 1948, on all supply services was £58,527,000.  To-day, as I have shown, the probable expenditure forced by the Government upon the community will be about £100,000,000, or £42,000,000 more than it was in the year which closed on 31st March, 1948, an increase of over 70 per cent. in public expenditure and concomitant public taxation.</P>
    <P>We know that, just as Deputy Kyne endeavoured to justify the present inflationary expenditure on the grounds that a great deal of it will be spent on social services, the Minister, if his memory fails him, will probably take that line also when he is closing this debate.  It will, perhaps, be salutary then to remind the House and the Minister and the Fine Gael members of the Coalition Government what the <Col N="1395" /> present Taoiseach said in respect of the Budget of 1947-48, under which £58,000,000 was provided for the supply services.  On the 13th May, 1947, at column 72 of Volume 106 of the Official Reports, Deputy Costello, as he then was, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Has he ever adverted to the fact that high taxation in itself takes money from those who would have saved it, thereby creating an asset in building up the economy of the State, or from those who are unable really to pay it, thereby creating a hardship for some section of the community?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I gathered, the whole purport of Deputy Kyne's speech was: &ldquo;We are going to spend £83,000,000 in this year and let the taxpayers and the producers and the workers of this country-remember that you cannot have an omelette without breaking eggs, you cannot spend money without increasing taxation,&rdquo; and, as the present Taoiseach told us when he was in opposition, in 1947, you cannot get that money without taking it &ldquo;from those who would have saved it, thereby creating an asset in building up the economy of the State, or from those who are really unable to pay it, thereby creating a hardship for some section of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Taoiseach's attitude towards the comparatively moderate expenditure, the really and truly moderate expenditure of that time as judged by the standards which prevail to-day.  Then the Taoiseach went on to gibe at those who, like Deputy Kyne, said: &ldquo;We are spending all this money on social services.&rdquo;  I trust that those who believe that the Taoiseach's heart bleeds for the suffering poor will remember the words which I am now going to quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Here we have him spending away.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;He was referring to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no proposal for the reduction of Government expenditure or for economy.  It is not even envisaged that there shall be any restriction in Government activities. <Col N="1396" /> He is on the left of the economic thoroughfare there because, as has been said by speaker after speaker on the opposite benches, the money is wanted for social services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I assume, will be the excuse of Deputy Kyne and, indeed, of the members of the Fine Gael Party who were never on the left of the economic thoroughfare until they were goaded there by the need to keep Deputy Kyne, Deputy McAuliffe and Deputy Desmond in harness behind them, if one can put it that way, or&mdash;should I say?&mdash;in harness in front of them, drawing them and drawing Fine Gael where it did not want to go.  I am quite content.  You can dispute with each other which of you is leading.</P>

      <P>Let us leave that for one moment.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Costello as he then was, had no use for this money which was being spent on social services because&mdash;I am quoting from column 73, Volume 106&mdash;he went on later to say this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Spending on social services is the excuse for everything.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;So he sneered.  Is not that the excuse which will be trotted out on every Labour platform, every Fine Gael platform, throughout the coming general election?</P>

      <P>Mark this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The existence of social services is an indication of ill-health in the body politic.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So, accordingly, we may take it that the fundamental belief of Deputy <Col N="1397" /> Costello in the year 1947 would be that a State without social services, a State, say, like the bad old days of 1834 or perhaps before the poor law was introduced, would indeed be a happy State and his ideal form of State and a State to which, if he had then the power that as Fine Gael Taoiseach he has to-day, he would have reduced this country.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The existence of social services is an indication of ill-health in the body politic,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>said Deputy Costello in 1947.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In any case, as has been said, they are nothing more than a row of medicine bottles showing disease in the household.  The sounder your economic fabric is, the less need there is for social services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, quite suddenly, in this country which has grown more prosperous under the Coalition Government, when we have a higher standard of living than we ever had before, there comes a demand for increased social services, notwithstanding the fact that the present Leader of the Government said in 1947 that the sounder your economic fabric is the less need there is for social services.  Let those people, those newcomers in this House, who accuse us of being reactionary, who hold us out as people who have ever oppressed the less fortunate elements in our community, listen to what the then Deputy Costello had to say about the Fianna Fáil Government, when they were in office and he was in opposition:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But, because of the policy of the Government, who have reduced agricultural production, caused the cost of living to rise to soaring heights, and because of the malnutrition which people are suffering from, we require these additional social services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The social services which Fianna Fáil introduced&mdash;and it has a proud record, but not a reckless one, in regard to the expansion of the social services&mdash; were introduced because production, industrial production, was increasing and we were able to support those services without imposing any heavy <Col N="1398" /> additional taxation upon our people for that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is quite clear that now the Taoiseach has become an addict to medicine bottles. He has suddenly burgeoned out as the great apostle of social services.  There was a book published recently with the title <i>Late Have I Loved Thee</i> and when I read this declaration of the then Deputy Costello about the social services and the medicine bottles it immediately recalled that book to my mind.  I thought how apposite it would be to apply it to the Taoiseach's present attitude in regard to social services&mdash;late have I loved thee.  Then I think we might recall another quotation&mdash;&ldquo;I would not love thee half so much, loved I not office more&rdquo;.  That is the real reason why we are having all these measures forced, as everybody knows they were forced, upon a reluctant, unwilling, incredulous and sceptical element in the present Coalition.  What has all this long struggle been over the years in order to bring this Social Welfare Bill to birth?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that history has shown in regard to Fine Gael.  They may not have very fixed principles.  In fact, looking at their record, again I am reminded of another quotation: &ldquo;a merciful Providence fashioned them hollow on purpose that they might their principles swallow.&rdquo;  They may not be very tenacious about their principles, but I can tell you that the history of the Farmers' Parties and the Centre Parties and most of the other minority <Col N="1399" /> Parties in this House shows that Fine Gael has a very voracious appetite indeed, and that there are many people who thought themselves independent of Fine Gael, but once they found themselves in the clutches of Fine Gael they speedily disappeared, some of them into the ranks of Fine Gael, but most of them out of the public life of this country.</P>
      <P>Let me, however, get back to this interesting review of the political development of the Fine Gael Ministers. I have disposed of that great humanitarian, Deputy Costello.  Let me now consider our politically profligate Minister for Finance.  It is interesting to read what he was saying on this question of public expenditure and public taxation in the year 1947, when the last Fianna Fáil Budget was before the House.  He had opened his speech with an historical dissertation about, I think, the origin of the word &ldquo;rap.&rdquo; He said, according to an answer which the <i>Irish Independent</i> gave, that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A rap was a base halfpenny really worth about half a farthing, issued in Ireland in 1721.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Based on that opening theme we come to this point, then, in Deputy McGilligan's speech, made on 28th May, 1947:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At this point we have a Budget which I have taken throughout as being only £30,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was then endeavouring to show that the £ sterling in 1947 was only about half the value of the £ sterling in the year 1932 or 1939.  I wonder what value he thinks the £ sterling has to-day? He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is, of course, a danger about equating a £60,000,000 Budget to a £30,000,000 one.  If everybody had doubled his income since 1938 or 1932, it would be easy to bear that sum.  It would, at least, be as easy to bear a £60,000,000 Budget as it used to be to bear one of £30,000,000. Of course, that is not the situation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Neither is it the situation to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If you look through the Book of Estimates, you will find that the <Col N="1400" /> human personnel in the background have not had their wages doubled or anything like doubled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have shown that so far from the public expenditure and the consequent public taxation being £30,000,000 or less than £60,000,000, what it was in 1947-48, it is nearer £100,000,000.  I do not think anybody's remuneration has been doubled or trebled under the Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy would be more expert with the pea and thimbles.  However, these things should not be drawn into the debate. Deputy O'Leary had better remember that there are people who can use their tongues just as well as he can. At any rate, we have an honourable career.  I was saying that nobody's remuneration has been doubled or trebled since Fine Gael took office. Within the past few months I think some workers in some employment, some sheltered industries, have secured increases of 12½ per cent. or increases not exceeding 12½ per cent.  But that is a long way from making up the difference between £58,000,000 in 1947-48 and the £100,000,000 that is staring us in the face as the burden which will be imposed upon this country during the year 1951-52.  I want to continue this quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So far as the home factor is concerned, it has been very definitely penalised by the distortion of the money value.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very apt quotation from Deputy McGilligan, because under him as Minister for Finance there has taken place in this country a distortion of money value such as never before has been experienced in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1931 Britain went off the gold standard and our currency followed suit.  But from 1931 until 1950 the purchasing value of our pound remained <Col N="1401" /> definitely very stable in terms of dollars and certainly very stable in terms of sterling, if only because that, for reasons of convenience and because of the inter-linkage in our trade, we were tied up to sterling.  What happened only a few months ago, comparatively speaking, when our currency was distorted to the extent of being devalued by over 30 per cent.? Has there been any corresponding increase in the remuneration of any person in this State?  In some ways this devaluation has resulted in very substantial benefits for the Exchequer; because by reason of the inflation of money values, due to the depreciation of our currency, the amount of money which has been collected, the number of Irish pounds which are being collected in customs and in excise and in other duties, <i>ad valorem</i> duties, has very considerably increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not, in any presentation he has made of the financial position of the State, adverted to the fact that he has been a member of a Government under which a patent and open distortion of money values took place.  Therefore, since, as he has told us, distortion is a very big factor in increasing the burden of taxation upon the people and the consequent hardship which it inflicted upon them, one may say this, that whatever was the position in 1947-48, when the Supply Services cost less than £60,000, it is much more than proportionately aggravated this year when the expenditure is likely to be, as I said, in round figures, £100,000,000.</P>
    <P>Then what did Deputy McGilligan say about social services?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is nobody,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;going to say social services?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy, as he then was, was looking for an interruption.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What is the necessity for social services?  Because people cannot live on the money they get when they sell their services for a money return.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I assume, appeals to the Labour Party.  That expresses, perhaps, the view of the Labour Party and the outlook of the Labour Party in regard to social services, but does it express the view and the outlook of most of the <Col N="1402" /> members of the Fine Gael Party?  Do they believe that, in certain circumstances and at the present time, the mass of the workers of this country &ldquo;cannot live on the money they get when they sell their services for a money return&rdquo;?  Is that what Deputy Dr. O'Higgins is going to proclaim in his constituency, what Deputy T. F. O'Higgins is going to proclaim in his constituency, what Deputy Coburn is going to announce from the housetops in Dundalk&mdash;that the mass of the people living in Dundalk cannot live on the money they get when they sell their services for a money return&mdash; because, remember, that is the principle, and the only principle, on which Deputy McGilligan was prepared to justify expenditure on social services.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say, and, mind you, it has a bearing on this muchboosted social security scheme:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;More and more people are being driven to what the Americans call the bread-line.  More and more people are being driven to be dependents on the State.  Taxation is not merely a matter of income-tax, the tax on income that people draw.  It falls on everything we do and everything we consume.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark the words.  Deputy McGilligan believed in 1947, even with the figure which we were spending on social services then, that more and more people were being driven to be dependents of the State because he went on, merely by implication, to draw the conclusion that with more and more social services, we have more and more taxation and that more and more fruits of the people's labour were going to be diverted from the individual uses, the special, specific uses of themselves and their families to the use of the State.</P>
    <P>In fact, we can put this in another way.  More and more people, because of the amount of taxation, are not only becoming dependents on the State but more and more people are becoming slaves of the State.  Let us look at the figure given by Deputy Lemass, a figure taken from the official returns of the national income, showing that out of every pound that was earned or produced in this country no less than 5/4 was being devoted to the services  <Col N="1403" /> the State.  The position, of course, is very greatly aggravated to-day.  One can express the position in terms, shall we say, even more fundamental than those of money or currency&mdash;in terms of labour.  We can say that to-day the majority of the people are giving two days out of every seven to the State and a great many are giving more than that.  The fact of the matter is that under this Government, the people&mdash; the workers, the wage earners and the enterprising elements in this community&mdash;are being reduced to a position of economic serfdom.  Why is that being done?  Because we have a Government which is using the resources of the community, not in the interests of the community as a whole, but in the interests of those political Parties who have banded themselves together in order to create and maintain that Government. The reason why we are being reduced to that position is because we have in power a Government which feels it right to treat all the resources of the community as one huge slush fund.  I shall give an example; one little instance will show what the true position is.</P>
    <P>In the Supplementary Estimate which is being submitted to the House for the Department of Industry and Commerce there appears an item of £6,365. It is true that this sum is a mere fleabite in comparison with the £100,000,000 of which I have spoken; but let us see,, nevertheless, what this £6,365 is being asked for.  It is for the purpose of maintaining a body which is known as the Prices Advisory Body, and it represents just two months' cost of that body.  I would be safe, therefore, in saying that when it gets properly going and is properly installed it will cost the taxpayers of the State no less than £40,000,000 a year.  That is a body which was set up with such a great flourish of trumpets by the Tánaiste, acting I think for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The trouble about the Tánaiste is that he is apparently the cuckoo in this Government&mdash; you cannot keep him out of other birds' nests.  This body was set up after the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1404" /> had aroused the country to a state of boiling indignation when he told the housewives of the country that they were suffering from a delusion if they thought that prices were increased or had been increasing for many months past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did not say that, then he must have said this: that prices were rising and that the cost of living was going up.  You cannot have it both ways but, in any event, the deluded people of this country somehow or other got the impression that the Government was telling them that the cost of living was stable and that prices were not going up.  They were in such a state of seething indignation that the Tánaiste had to come here and make one of his usual forthright attacks on industry and industrialists, on those who are engaged in giving employment, in producing things and in marketing and selling commodities.  They brought in what they called a &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; Order. The significant thing about the &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; Order is that it has turned out to be a frost.  We have had the whole set-up completely exposed in the past few days.  Two-thirds of the items included in the schedule&mdash;I am talking in round figures or in rough fractions&mdash;had to be suddenly removed from the schedule and the prices are now to be adjusted in the normal and regular way.  But though we have had the collapse of the Order, though it has been shown to be not merely ineffective but even stupid from the point of view of the future economy of this country&mdash;yes, and of the future employment of the workers of the country and the cost of living in the near future in this country&mdash;its reactions have been disastrous.  Notwithstanding the collapse of the policy embodied in that Order, yet all this political stunting is to cost the taxpayer over the last two months of this year, £6,365.  That, as I say, would represent £40,000 per annum.  Why was it done?  Why had we this stunt? Why was this Prices Advisory Body <Col N="1405" /> set up?  In order that this £40,000 might be spent in providing what has been described elsewhere as &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;.  That is why it was done. Mr. Norton's friends are sitting pretty on the Prices Advisory Body.</P>

It is an extraordinary thing that the price of everything which had been bought under the auspices of the Government, and out of which the Government was making a concealed profit, was allowed to go up, while the legitimate traders of this country were faced with financial disaster.  They were compelled to overburden themselves with commitments to the banks, they were compelled to carry heavy stocks and to stop buying raw material when they ought to have bought it, and were even driven to the point of having to stand off for a week or two the very workers in whose interests the one time Leader of the Labour Party proclaimed that he was introducing this price freeze Order. Is it any wonder that with this record of extravagance, of ineptitude, of futile and fuddling mismanagement, the people of this country are crying out night after night, as they go down on their knees: &ldquo;How long, oh Lord, how long?&rdquo;</P>

They maintain close contact with business circles and trade organisations, and in general are in a position to furnish advice on all problems connected with the business of exporting to the country concerned.  This type of work is of particular value in our circumstances since many Irish firms who produce goods for which a foreign market may exist cannot afford the expense of searching for markets abroad themselves.</P>
    <P>Before the war Germany was one of our most important export markets and we had a Legation in Berlin which dealt with any trade problems which arose.  In the last three years this trade has revived and in 1950 we sold nearly £1,500,000 worth of goods to Western Germany, which is now our fourth most important customer.  The resumption of trade with Germany on a large scale was made possible by the conclusion of a trade agreement with Western Germany in July, 1949, and its renewal the following year.  Under this agreement we have substantial import quotas for our products, and the efficient working of the agreement, which involves the periodic call-up of the quotas and the allocation of import licences against them, makes it essential to have continuous contact with the German Government Departments concerned.  The volume of work involved is very considerable.  To handle this work and generally promote the sale of Irish goods in Western Germany a Consulate-General was in the summer of 1950 established in Frankfurt, which was then the seat of most <Col N="1409" /> of the German economic ministries. This Consulate-General is now being transferred to Bonn, which has since become the German administrative centre.</P>
    <P>A summary of our exports since 1948 shows that in the year 1948 we exported £75,000 worth of goods; in the year 1949, £396,000 worth, and in the year 1950, £1,491,000 worth.  I ask the Dáil to grant this token Supplementary Estimate for this Consulate-General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of questions occur to one in regard to this Estimate. The first is: was it not possible to consult the Dáil before the appointment was made?  I think it is a very bad practice to present the Dáil with a <i>fait accompli</i> and then ask for the money.  If there was a special urgency one has to take that into account, but I think that immediately the Dáil met afterwards it should have been presented with this Supplementary Estimate to get sanction for this appointment. I do not think that anybody can object to the appointment in itself. There is no doubt that Germany is a great nation and that there are great possibilities of trade between Germany and ourselves.  Germany was represented here for a large number of years diplomatically and we hope it will one day be represented here diplomatically again.</P>
      <P>I do not think that on any side of the House there can be an objection to the establishment of this Consulate-General. I mentioned the desirability of consulting the House in advance when appointments of this sort are being made.  I think the need for that is growing more imperative every year. Both the total Estimates for the State and the Estimates for this Department are increasing by leaps and bounds. When the Minister for Finance of the new Government was threatening to come down with his axe on various services I thought that this particular service which was actually mentioned by the Minister was going to suffer severely.  I knew that it is one of the hardest of the State services to get understood by the ordinary Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small states, if they want to be represented, have to face a disproportionate expense in foreign <Col N="1410" /> representation.  Seeing how slender our resources relatively are, one would expect that there would be very severe criticism of this particular Vote.  In the year 1947-48, the total expenditure on the Department of External Affairs was in the neighbourhood of £186,000.  Now, however, it has gone up to over £500,000.  The Estimate for the service for the coming year is £515,000.  In addition to that, there is a sum of £31,000 for European co-operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only giving that as an example of the desirability of the Dáil being consulted in advance about any new expenditure.  I feel that I cannot quarrel with this appointment, but I do think that the time has come when we will have to consider very seriously every additional expense in any Department, including the Department of External Affairs.  In defence of the expenditure on that Department last year, we had the plea made that the money was mainly required to bring the facts of Partition to the attention of other peoples.  That is a very important service.  I see no reason, however, why there should not be a special Vote so that the expenditure for that particular service can be isolated from other expenditure.  That has so far not been done.  But the point, at any rate, is that the time has come when we will have to consider seriously whether expenditure is not outrunning our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, very important that we should have a careful consideration of every new expenditure.  In any case, we ought not to have the Dáil presented with appointments which have already been made, if it is possible to avoid it.  I agree that you have to make provision for exceptional cases.  Sometimes things have to be done urgently, and it may be necessary, in the interests of the State, to empower the Department to make appointments.  But that ought to be quite exceptional and, if it has to be done during a period of Recess and could not have been foreseen, immediately Parliament reassembles one of <Col N="1411" /> the first matters to be brought to the attention of Parliament should be the ratification of any appointments that have been made during that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am subject to correction, but I think I indicated, in introducing my Estimate last year, that I proposed to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for a Consul-General in Germany.  I do not want to be tied to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but even that should not interfere with what I regard as good procedure. Even if that general indication was given, when the moment for action came and money had to be provided it would have been better parliamentary procedure, in my opinion, to bring it before Parliament at that stage, and to indicate what were the services required and what was the expenditure likely to be incurred.</P>
      <P>There is another point in this connection: under what headings have these savings been made since this extra expenditure has only to be met to the extent of £10?  Possibly the Minister will give us some indication of that.  I think it is useful to know in what direction savings have been effected.  We have not been given particulars, but the Estimates state that savings have been made.  The question then is, if savings have been effected, in what direction did we over-estimate?  What were the things we undertook to do but failed to accomplish?  These savings probably represent some particular step that was foreshadowed but was not undertaken, or some particular item of expenditure, in one direction or another, which ultimately had not to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another small point of detail in regard to a sum of £159 for a Consul.  I take it that is some additional cost that will be incurred.  From the point of view of presentation, I think it would have been better if the total amount required for the post had been set out.  I do not know whether it is usual to do that, but I think it would be a better system; the total amount required should be shown, including the official's salary as well as the other expenses, and any deductions <Col N="1412" /> by way of set off should be indicated.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the general question of policy which will really arise when we come to consider the main Estimate for the Department. This expenditure is justified mainly on the ground that it facilitates and is likely to improve our trade position with Germany.  The improvement of our external trade is of fundamental importance to the well-being of the country.  I do not know to what extent the Department of External Affairs has accepted responsibility in relation to our external trade.  It would be interesting to know what liaison now exists between the Department of External Affairs and the Department of Industry and Commerce. Arrangements varied in the past.  At one time the Department of External Affairs took over a good deal of responsibility but that responsibility was largely transferred to the Department of Supplies during the war.  It is of fundamental importance to us that our external trade relations should be carefully looked after by our consuls.  In order to do that efficiently it is essential that there should be close co-operation between the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of External Affairs, and our potential exporters. At one time it was suggested that our foreign representation should be expanded in order to deal with this important matter.  I think that suggestion should be followed up by the Department of External Affairs.  That is the Department which should take initiative and which should urge on the Department of Industry and Commerce to greater efforts.  The two Departments should be closely linked. It is not easy to arrange matters so that our consuls can do the type of work necessary to bring about an expansion of our export trade.  They can do a certain amount but they cannot do as much as trade agents directly operating can do.  I think we should consider now whether we should not expand our whole organisation in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough for the Department of Industry and Commerce to produce statistics here in proof of <Col N="1413" /> what is being done.  It is not so easy for the Department of External Affairs to do that and that is one reason why, since it is peculiarly vulnerable to criticism here, I was particularly anxious when I left office that that Department should not be crippled by any unfair or undue reduction in the amount necessary for its particular purposes.  In my opinion we have now reached the other extreme.  We have reached the stage at which we have to carefully watch and ensure that we are not spending beyond the limit the country can afford.  There is nobody so dull-witted that he cannot find things to do if money is no object.  If he has unlimited funds at his disposal he can do all manner of things, things which in themselves may be quite useful but which the limited resources of the country should not be asked to pay for; better results might be achieved with the expenditure of the same money in some other direction. That is always a problem where resources are limited.  I think the danger point has now been reached unless there is a trade section which shows positive material results for expenditure. Anybody who can show any expansion of trade has positive proof to show that the expenditure is justified.</P>
    <P>I did make a suggestion before as to another direction in which expenditure might be curtailed.  We have a Council of Europe with a centre at Strasbourg. If that is to mean anything, it should be a centre in which one nation can make contact directly with the other nations in the council.  I think that is how it should work if it is to be of any real or permanent value.  That centre should be used by the several States of Europe represented on the council in order to bring about a diminution in the cost of their diplomatic representation in the various countries.  This is something into which one cannot rush; one must consider it very carefully.  The question is whether by having representation at Strasbourg one could not limit one's representation in Paris, Germany, Belgium, Holland, etc.  I think that is an angle that the small nations in particular should examine. A single representation at Strasbourg <Col N="1414" /> would obviate the necessity for the present multiplicity of representation in the various States of Europe.  We are not opposing this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few observations to make somewhat on the lines of those made by Deputy de Valera. One of the dangers that I can see in relation to the Department of External Affairs is that we can very easily overlook the fact that we are a very small country.  I gathered from the Minister that the principal justification for this expenditure is because our exports to Germany have increased substantially over the last three years.  Naturally, everyone must welcome that increase in trade.  Looking at it from the broader point of view, that is the justification for the increased expenditure in the Department of External Affairs. There is a point which I have raised before and which I should like to mention again.  The Department of External Affairs is getting a completely new type of work to do.  The old idea was that it was a Department that dealt with external relations of a diplomatic nature rather than a trade nature.  As far as I can judge, the Department of External Affairs now is dealing with matters of trade more than with ordinary diplomatic affairs. If that is so, is the Department properly constructed for that particular work?  Are the people who represent us as Consuls-General, Consuls and representatives properly trained to carry out that particular duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that at all.  The one simple item that is before us deals with the appointment of a Consul-General consequent on the setting up of diplomatic representation in Bonn.  The Minister has justified that on the grounds that it has brought about an increase in trade between this country and Germany which has resulted in exports to Germany in 1948 worth £75,000, in 1949, £369,000 and in 1950, £1,491,000.  Obviously, I do not want to suggest that our representative in Bonn is not suitable for that type of work.  I was only widening the scope of my argument slightly to deal with that particular aspect.</P>
      <P>In the past few years the Department of External Affairs, undoubtedly, has taken a considerable interest and a considerable part in economic affairs and, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, nobody can object to this particular expenditure so long as it shows a good result.  What I want to suggest is that trade development between this country and Germany may be accelerated by a different type of representative, one who is trained in industry and commerce and who has experience of what we can provide in the way of industrial exports.</P>

      <P>That is an aspect that properly should be considered on the general Estimate.  I intend to raise it there but I merely availed of the opportunity to express some doubts as to whether the expansion of what may be termed the diplomatic aspect of the Department of External Affairs is the best medium for achieving greater trade benefits for the country. That is the only suggestion I will throw out.  I have mentioned it before.  To some extent Deputy de Valera adverted to it just now.  As far as the particular <Col N="1416" /> Estimate is concerned, it certainly ought to be approved.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask whether any difficulties have arisen with reference to our trade with Germany by reason of the ban which the West German Government has found it necessary to impose on imports, owing to difficulties which have arisen with the European Payments Union, and whether these developments will have any disadvantageous effect on the course of our trade relations or are creating any obstacles.  I hope that is not the case.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would also inform the House as to whether there is any export organisation in contemplation, either by way of Government service or representative of Irish exporters who are seeking trade with Germany, and whether, if there is such an organisation, any assistance is being given by the Government to enable that work to be carried on and, if there is no such organisation, if the Government contemplate the establishment of an export organisation which would give exporters who are not in a very big way of business and have not the necessary experience of international trade, financial assistance and advice to enable them to secure a foothold in the German market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this Supplementary Estimate has been brought before the House because it gives me an opportunity to deal with at least two items which are causing me great anxiety.  I am anxious about the worries of my dearly beloved friend, the Minister for Agriculture, in finding a market abroad for butter.  I would like to bring to his aid the Minister for External Affairs in this matter, particularly in respect of this Estimate, seeing that the Danish Government succeeded in selling to the American forces in Germany a large quantity of butter last year at the enormous price of 489/- per cwt., and in selling to the German people some 100,000 cwts., at 414/- a cwt.  I think if the people over there for whom this Estimate is being passed did a little business in that line, it would be far better than selling to Britain at 271/- <Col N="1417" /> or selling in Paris at 98/- a cwt. less than the Danes get.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I urge on the Minister for External Affairs that he should take that particular matter up.  It might enable us to get rid of the very great question of getting an economic price for our agricultural produce.  I would also urge him, now that we have, according to what the Minister for Agriculture stated recently&mdash;he has been tramping over the country looking for a market for the famous eggs we were to produce for Britain&mdash;a possible chance of another market, to take the matter up with Germany.  I am sure that is a country where we could get a good market for the eggs. Perhaps in that way, on those two items alone, we might be able to relieve the pressure on the Minister's unfortunate colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, and we might get a good return and increase the relations between the German nation and ourselves.</P>
      <P>We have now, it would seem, got over the fetish that was so often thrown in our faces when Fianna Fáil were the Government, of alternative markets.  Now we are agreed there is, after all, a chance of getting a better price in alternative markets on the Continent than in Britain.  I think more forward use can be made of our representatives in these countries by seeing that they are kept in touch, that they know what we have to sell, and if they can get a price for that which will not be a giving-away price, like they are offered by Britain at the present time, it will be all to the good. I am glad to have had this opportunity of calling attention to those two articles, namely, butter and eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Party on this side of the House has, of course, pointed out that it might have been better for the Minister to have come to the House a little bit sooner to explain this Supplementary Estimate.  Since the intervention of Deputy Cowan, I want to say to the Minister that I regard the Department of External Affairs as a very important branch of our Government services, particularly with reference, apart from the diplomatic side, to helping the development of our <Col N="1418" /> exports.  Deputy Cowan said that there should be some consideration given to the appointment of other types of officers than those we already have.  From the knowledge I have and I will not say it is little, I would hesitate to make any suggestion which would alter the personnel of our external affairs service.  I happen to know, not of my own experience, but through many people whom I have met, that we have been fortunate in the services the officials of that Department have rendered to this State, wherever they may be.</P>
      <P>There is one problem that arises. The Minister more or less explained the Supplementary Estimate in relation to the development of trade with Germany, justifying the appointment of this Consul-General.  I agree that is a good reason but, like Deputy Corry, I have great fear that unless that Department continues to interest itself in trade relations with other countries after they have arranged a trade agreement, we are going to fall very steadily.  The Minister for External Affairs must know that the Minister for Agriculture in his Department has his own external affairs trade relations over and above and in spite of the External Affairs Department.  The Minister must know that that will not be conducive to a good understanding.</P>
      <P>We make trade arrangements with foreign countries.  There is a long discussion specifying the items which will be exchanged between the two countries.  The Minister for Agriculture then comes along and explodes the trade agreement by disposing of the goods elsewhere that have been committed to the particular country with which we have concluded the agreement.  I would like to see these services continued under the control of External Affairs.  Our officials, wherever they may be changed to, have always understood our needs and how to put those needs before the people of other countries.  I would not like to see any other type of personnel attached to it than already exists.  The Minister ought to use some restraining influence over what Deputy Corry has described as his unfortunate colleague.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this Vote.  I am fully conscious of the fact that we will have ample opportunity on another occasion to discuss the Department of External Affairs and therefore I do not propose to spend many minutes discussing this token Vote for £10.</P>
      <P>I was particularly impressed by the information which the Minister gave the House and the reasons why this Vote for £10 has been introduced.  He pointed out that, in addition to the good which the appointment of this Consul-General would do with regard to advising Irish firms engaged in the production of goods suitable for sale in Western Germany, there were other advantages.  He gave the House valuable and encouraging information.  He said that trade with Western Germany has increased within the past three years almost out of all proportion. Deputy Cowan said that between 1948 and 1950 its value rose from £75,000 to £1,490,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the appointment of this <Col N="1420" /> Consul-General, in addition to promoting trade with Western Germany, will have other beneficial results.  I am sure the person appointed will have all the necessary qualifications.  Deputy Cowan need have no doubt that the Minister, in view of the position he occupies, will not appoint a dud, because that is what he said really means; that is the implication which Deputy Cowan wishes to convey to the House.  I do not agree with that at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of voicing my protest against the cowardly and insidious attack made on the Minister for Agriculture. The introduction of this paltry Vote for £10 is taken advantage of by Deputies Corry and Briscoe to make an attack on the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I should like to express agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Coburn.  I think that the line pursued by Deputy de Valera was the correct approach to the Estimate&mdash;that we should consider <Col N="1421" /> technical questions as to procedure on an Estimate like this, rather than make an effort to introduce other matters of a controversial nature which can and should be discussed on the main Estimate.  I have had the opportunity since the Minister spoke of consulting his speech on the occasion of his last main Estimate and I find that the Minister did state quite specifically on that occasion that he proposed introducing this Supplementary Estimate for the particular purpose for which it has been introduced.  I am glad to know from the Minister's remarks that trade relations have improved and that the doctrine, regarding alternative markets has, under this Government and this Minister, a certain amount of reality.</P>

      <P>I should like at the outset to say that I did, as Deputy O'Higgins was kind enough to remind the House, mention the fact that it would be necessary for me to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to create this new post when I introduced the original Estimate.  I am sure that Deputy de Valera will appreciate that it is not always possible to include in advance provisions for the setting up of a new post.  There are a number of considerations involved that affect not merely the home Government but the Government which is the recipient of the new post.  Deputy de Valera, Deputy Cowan and some other Deputies discussed the question of foreign trade in general.  I am very glad to find that there is an appreciation of the importance of developing foreign trade.  In my view it is absolutely vital for the improvement of the standard of living of our people and also for making provision for a higher population, that we should have a <Col N="1422" /> foreign trade.  It is the only way in which we can provide the goods that will be required to maintain a higher standard of living and a higher population. I think the indications at the moment are that the population is rising and this renders the extension of a foreign trade a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to give complete control of foreign trade to any one Department.  There are a number of different Departments involved&mdash;the Department of Industry and Commerce whose function it is to deal with manufactures at home, the Department of Agriculture, whose function it is to deal with agricultural exports, the Department of Finance, which is directly involved often on account of currency considerations and, lastly, the Department of External Affairs whose officers abroad really carry out a lot of the work.</P>
      <P>The Department of External Affairs has shouldered an increasing responsibility in economic matters in the last two or three years by reason of the development of economic co-operation. The work of O.E.E.C. is largely channelled through the Department of External Affairs, since it has been the policy to establish an economic section in the Department that deals with this particular aspect of the work.  There is also a section dealing exclusively with foreign trade in the Department. In order to co-ordinate the interests and the work of the principal Government Departments involved in foreign trade, the Government set up a Foreign Trade Committee, consisting of representatives of the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Finance and External Affairs. That committee meets at practically weekly intervals in the Department of External Affairs.  In that way, the interests of the different Departments are correlated.  I am glad to say that so far the results that have been achieved in the development of foreign trade have been very satisfactory. Before the war our export trade to countries, other than Great Britain, ranged between £1,000,000 and £2,000,000.  In 1948 it was £5,5 million; in 1949 it was £5.2 million; in 1950 it was over £8,500,000&mdash;almost doubled in two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> Apart from that, as Deputy de Valera has quite justifiably pointed out, the Department of External Affairs is often subject to criticism, and criticism which is easy to make frequently appears hard to rebut.  I should point out that the Department of External Affairs has played an extremely important part in obtaining for this State a sum of 18,000,000 dollars through its work in connection with E.R.P. and O.E.E.C.  Therefore, I have not the slightest qualms in justifying the expenditure of the extremely small sum incurred by the Department.  I think I pointed out to the House on other occasions that the cost of the whole Department, including its offices abroad, is smaller than the cost of one single post of a major Power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that any true comparison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a useful comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the annual expenditure provided for in the British Budget over £3,000,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to do for our small country the best we can. We still have to contend in many cases, so far as Britain is concerned, with an organisation which is able to afford one embassy which is larger than our whole Department.</P>
      <P>Another basis of comparison is the percentage which we spend in the Department of External Affairs in relation to national income or in relation to Government expenditure. These percentages show that we spend less than other comparable countries. These are consideration which, I take it, really would more properly arise on the debate on the overall Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan raised a question as to the type of person required in relation to trade promotion.  That is undoubtedly one of the problems.  Largely in order to overcome that particular difficulty, we have selected in three cases trade attachés from outside the Department.  Boards were set up in order to select them, and they were selected from outside the Department. <Col N="1424" /> The one difficulty, especially in a small service like ours, is that the officers have to rotate.  It is bad from the diplomatic point of view to leave them too long in the one post or in the one service. That general policy has been accepted in all services in other countries as well.  In the case of a purely trade or commercial attaché the reverse is the position.  The longer he can stay in the one post the better.  He acquires a knowledge of the trade in that country and makes contacts which can be valuable to him, and he should be in a position to remain there as long as possible. In the case of the three commercial attachés, we have one in New York, one in Chicago, and one in Paris, who is not whole-time.</P>
    <P>In the case of Consuls-General, Ministers and Ambassadors, the position is different.  The policy of the Department has been to ensure that each of these officers would acquire experience in the economic and trade fields as well as in the diplomatic field.  The work of the Department is divided into diplomatic work, political work, consular work dealing with passports and estates and so on, economic work, trade, cultural work and information.  The aim is to ensure that all the officers of the Department will have a reasonable grasp of the work of all these different divisions in the Department.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Derrig raised a question about the position of Germany in regard to E.P.U.&mdash;European Payments Union.  Germany has had considerable difficulty in regard to payments. Various remedial measures were taken, but on the whole, so far, the results have not been extremely satisfactory. An analysis of E.P.U. countries' position at the end of January, 1951, showed that Germany was near, once more, the point of exhausting her credits with E.P.U.  It was, as a result of that position that the German Government suspended most of its imports in order to make an examination of its existing imports with the view to eliminating the waste of foreign exchange. For the present, the suspension of imports is to be regarded purely as a temporary measure for that purpose, and does not, for instance, affect import agreements in which the payment of foreign currency is not due <Col N="1425" /> until after the 1st May, 1951.  I hope that by that time the payments position will have been rectified.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera asked how the necessary savings had been effected in order to enable the Department do with a token vote of £10.  The savings were effected because a number of posts in some of our missions abroad had not been filled for the whole period for which provision was made in the additional Estimate.  There was delay in filling the posts.  He also raised the question of the salary of the Consul.  The position there is that he only took up duty recently and, therefore, the portion of his salary which becomes payable to the Supplementary Estimate is for a very short period of time.</P>
    <P>I think these were the main points raised by the Deputies.  There is good co-ordination between the different Departments in relation to foreign trade.  That co-ordination, as I have explained to the House, is maintained through this Foreign Trade Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <P>By and large, it is all centred in the Department of External Affairs, but you always have conflicting interests as the Deputy knows, between the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and very often the Department of Finance.  By maintaining a position of neutrality and by trying to provide a good service, the Department of External Affairs exercises a good deal of influence.  I think that is the position in every Government in regard to conflicting interests between Departments.</P>

They will remember that when we raised this issue, not merely last year, but three years ago in this House, when the Minister for Finance was pursuing that ruthless policy of ill-considered cutting down, which has left this country virtually defenceless in the midst of the world crisis that is now round us, in order that he might justify to some extent the pledges that he and his Party had given, that if they were returned to office, that they would ruthlessly cut down expenditure.</P>
      <P>I have shown in the course of my remarks how hollow and insincere those pledges were; how the men who made them duped and betrayed the people who put their confidence in them at the 1948 Election, believing that they were sincere when they said that they would cut Government expenditure ruthlessly and that they would bring down taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The will recall that the only response which was evoked from the Government was that gibe of the Taoiseach's, made, I think, in July last year, that we were talking about a mythical war. I wonder will anybody say that the war in Korea is a mythical war, that the Americans who are dying there are dying mythical deaths&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We shall have another chance to raise this issue in a more specific way.  All I want to say is that I think a lot of the money that is being provided for the 60 or 70 services which are going to account for the £83,000,000 in the Book of Estimates would be better spent in putting this country in a position to try to maintain the peace and freedom which it has gained at such high cost.  I do not believe that will be done under a Coalition Government.  I do not believe that will be done under the present Government.  The people do not believe it either.  The one thing that is sapping the morale of the people is that they are almost without hope. There was a time when they thought that public men had some principle and that they were prepared to make sacrifices for their principles.  There was a time when they thought that public men were prepared, if necessary, to go into the wilderness with these principles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to show that the Government has been wasteful and extravagant in its general approach to this matter and because of that wasteful and extravagant approach in matters of administration we are now facing to-day a probable expenditure during the coming financial year of £83,000,000 for the Supply Services alone.  Surely I am entitled to point out the errors that have been made by the Government and the mistakes that have been made by the Government and, if one likes to put it that way, the deliberately corrupt policy of the Government in its exercise of the power of patronage which has involved the community in this heavy expenditure.

On the Vote on Account the general economic policy and financial policy of the Government are the two main items that can be discussed.  It is obvious to anybody with parliamentary experience that if we discuss details of the administration of the various Departments we shall have a duplicate debate on the Estimates all over again.  I prevented Deputy MacEntee from dealing with the Baltinglass incident because it does not properly arise under either of the two main subjects for discussion, the general economic or financial policy of the Government.

      <P>We have had a very sorry headline or example set to employers by members of the Government in regard to their treatment of old-established employees.  It is not much wonder that there is a great deal of discontent, a great deal of apathy, among the workers, when they see that the men whom they trusted to look after their interests, the men whom they elected to look after the interests of the wage-earners, can stand by and support a Government which, without cause and without reason, dismisses or passes over the claims of an old and faithful servant to preferment, when an opportunity to secure that preferment arises.</P>
      <P>Things have been done by this Government which certainly would seem to justify and excuse the attitude of any unjust employer in this State. We do not seek to justify, extenuate or excuse injustice to the workers, but we say that some employers, who might like to take advantage of what the Government has done in relation to its employees, could very well say that they were merely following the example which had been set for them by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have virtually concluded.  I only want to say that we have had an admission from the Minister, the ex-Minister, for Defence to-day which will alarm the people.  We have been told that military supplies, which we urged the Government to procure when they were procurable, are no longer available to the people of this country.  The people see us facing a very dangerous future, and they are beginning to wonder whether they have not been manoeuvred into that position by the deliberate policy of some elements in the Coalition, some <Col N="1435" /> elements who, on the one hand, would like to see us an easy prey to influences from the East, and some, on the other hand, who, in future, just as they have in the past, would be as anxious to see us defenceless against aggression from a nearer source.</P>
    <P>The one thing that the people are beginning to be concerned about is when they are going to get a Government which is united in principle, which is coherent and determined in action and which will be prepared to face up to its responsibilities and not endeavour to shirk them, as this Government has done continuously since it took office.  Every thorny problem has been put on the long finger.  Everything that cried out to be dealt with urgently has been put, as the Minister for External Affairs said, into abeyance. We cannot face the future with a Government imbued with that mentality. We want to have in this country a united Government.  The country knows that the present Government is not united.  We want to have in this country a Government headed by an experienced statesman. Everybody knows how mismanaged the international policy of this country has been under the present Taoiseach. The people are all hoping, as I said, for the day when the general election will come and they will know that it will be no longer necessary for them to go down on their knees and pray: &ldquo;How long, O Lord, how long?&rdquo; because the day of their deliverance will have come.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister is spending too much money altogether. These Estimates are huge&rdquo;&mdash;that is the latest war-cry and theme song of our own little Deputy MacEntee and his back-benchers.  What will happen to the country now is a mystery. Things have changed completely.  They have changed so much that Deputy MacEntee must run from the House hell-for-leather, having insulted everyone. When we are discussing matters here, if there was less reference to the past, less war-mongering and warscares, <Col N="1436" /> and if there was a more businesslike manner and if we faced the future and tried to fashion it in a sensible, honourable way, we would be far better off and we might be acting up to our responsibilities on behalf of the people who sent us here.</P>
      <P>During the debate a few Deputies from the Opposition made certain statements that perhaps are worth recalling or reviewing.  Deputy Aiken referred to the difficulties in obtaining essential capital equipment and machinery during 1947.  Perhaps it is true that there were such difficulties.  He said that the conditions were not so bad during 1948 and 1949.  May I ask the Opposition, would Fianna Fáil, who were then in power, have obtained it? If they say that they would, then the Estimates at the time would have had to show provision for the expenditure involved.  No one would have objected to their trying to secure essential machinery whereby they could hope, after the war years, to try to build up a satisfactory economy.  On the other hand, Deputy Aiken found it suitable to object to the present Government not getting adequate machinery and essential supplies in 1948 and 1949 because, he said, they could have been obtained at a lower price then than in 1950.  Does he not know that the same complaint as they have been making for the last week was made last year on the Estimates?  They said last year that the Estimates were too high.  It is a case of trying to keep their loaf and eating it at the same time.  In my belief, all this is a matter of propaganda, political propaganda, which will not succeed in getting anyone anywhere in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken mentioned that items of capital development of a particular kind may lead to inflation.  He mentioned housing grants, money provided for farmers and money provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act. Does Deputy Aiken, who at one time held a responsible position as Minister, suggest that, before engaging in a large-scale housing programme, the matter should be carefully considered simply because, in his opinion, it might lead to inflation?  Before we provide the plain people with necessary homes, <Col N="1437" /> are we to consider, first and foremost, the danger of inflation?</P>

      <P>I am referring to the remarks made by Deputy Aiken, and if the Leader of Fianna Fáil wishes to say otherwise, that is well and good. I am drawing attention to some of the statements made by members of one Party.  They complained that members of Government Parties make different statements.  They go to pains to show that in the Government there are various Parties.  Why it is that the one Party in opposition has so many speakers who will strike out in a different line is, I believe, far more puzzling.  He mentioned that in 1947 Fianna Fáil raised £3,000,000, in a somewhat different way, of course, from the way he is pointing out that money is being raised by the present Administration.  He mentioned it was raised from taxation.  Well, without being hard on anyone we are entitled to ask where did most of the £3,000,000 raised in 1947 go?  Did it go to pay £2 5s. a week to workers in the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time, though, some of us were advocating an increase in wages.  For many years there was a standstill Order which prevented an increase in wages.  That may be the collective responsibility of the entire Government or the Cabinet of the day.  We are entitled to draw attention to hard facts, things which cannot be contradicted.  It is still questionable as to how the £3,000,000 were spent.  When they were speaking about the amount in the Estimates now they forgot, of course, the amount of money spent in the past.  It is quite clear that the Opposition will only mention the value of money when it suits them.  At times they stand up here and talk about the cost of living and say the value of the pound has depreciated so much.  At other times they do not wish to mention that because it does not suit them.  They do not forget to tell us that the value of the pound is somewhat different now from what it was in pre-war days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken struck another extraordinary point.  He mentioned that increases in salaries and social services were not enough considering the cost of living.  Last Friday Deputy Ryan said that the increases given since 1947 in social services and to old age pensioners and the increase that is proposed now are sufficient, in his opinion, taking the cost of living as it stands. There you have two responsible people, ex-Ministers, one saying these increases are not enough and the other saying they are.  We expect consistency at least in the views of ex-Ministers. How can new members, back-benchers, <Col N="1439" /> be expected to understand the views expressed by two men sitting together, belonging to the same Party, when they say completely different things?</P>
    <P>With all that, I believe that the new members here have one advantage. Thanks be to God, I believe there are many members in the same position as I am.  We maintain that if we are to get anywhere we will have to remind the older members that it is time for them to give up their cross-fire and their bickering.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Vivion de Valera spoke for quite a long while and there were a few points in his speech that I would like to refer to.  He mentioned turf.  I come from an area where turf has been and can be produced and I have always advocated the desirability of using turf as a fuel.  It is true to say that there are people to-day who would turn in disgust if you mentioned turf to them because of their sad experience during the emergency.  We all know that if there was a racket in anything in this country there was a racket in turf, not in all cases by the producers and not by the distributors. The fact remains, however, that some people made a huge fortune out of it. I have no intention of going into these matters in detail.  All I suggest is that in any future operations in turf, may God keep us from adopting the system that was in operation when we were making gangsters out of people who never thought they would amass so much wealth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera made another important point when he was speaking about taxes. He mentioned that it pays the Government at the present time to have such huge returns out of taxes on drink, etc.  He was pointing to the huge consumption and the advantages that the Government gain.  While Deputy de Valera was pointing out that the consumption of drink was an advantage to the Government, we had a Deputy down in Cork saying it was scandalous for another Minister, the Tánaiste, to ask the workers to give 1/7 per week towards their own <Col N="1440" /> advancement in the future.  Apparently he considered that the Tánaiste was pointing out that they should have that in drink.  There again we had a glaring case of two prominent members of the Opposition, Deputy Vivion de Valera and Deputy McGrath, one saying just the reverse of the other. That is a continuation of the attitude of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe was worth listening to.  His approach was a sensible, businesslike approach to the subject.  He made, what I thought, a few slips of the tongue.  Deputy Briscoe said that large scale housing was not the programme of the Coalition Parties; it was the programme of Fianna Fáil.  He mentioned that Fianna Fáil were more interested in social welfare.  Perhaps I will admit he is right and perhaps I will have to change my views about Fianna Fáil and the interest they take in the welfare of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputies here to realise that Fianna Fáil have become so interested in the social welfare of the people that, within a couple of hours on last Friday night, they drafted and handed out to the people a new scheme of benefits which they found themselves unable to formulate in the 16 years they were in office.  There is no doubt that if they continue along that line, the people will soon realise the extent of the loss they suffered when Fianna Fáil left office.  Deputy Briscoe also mentioned that the working man and his family counted first with Fianna Fáil Deputies.  That is right too.  Were the road workers in County Cork not first on the list&mdash;Deputy McGrath was <Col N="1441" /> not a councillor at that time&mdash;when Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Local Government, sent down a big order signed by himself saying: &ldquo;Give these men 2d. a day extra.&rdquo;  Mind you, that was backed by the Government of the day but, thanks be to God, we made sure that the 2d. a day was not accepted in spite of the Christmas card sent down by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>I remember also the struggle we had in the South when there was a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, and when we demanded an increase, a couple of shillings a week, for farm workers.  In this connection, I might recall that a Deputy from Limerick pleaded that Deputies on this side of the House who were representing dairying constituencies should use their influence with the Government on behalf of that industry, but it was little influence this Deputy used when we asked the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, for certain advantages for the farm workers.  He was and he is a member of the same Party from which, Deputy Briscoe says, the working man receives first consideration.  The working people cannot be fooled all the time.  They were not fooled by the fact that neither a Front Bencher nor a Back Bencher of Fianna Fáil said to the farm workers when they needed support: &ldquo;I will support you&rdquo;.  They did not support them and the farm workers have not forgotten it for them.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy spoke of the big increase in this Vote in connection with the Department of External Affairs.  Naturally, as I am trying to keep within the rules of order, I have no intention of going into details on that matter, but I would say that I believe that whatever money was spent in that Department for the last three years, more was done in these three years than was ever done before by that Department.  In regard to defence, Deputy MacEntee spent a considerable time deploring the condition of defence in this country and in attacking the Minister who was in charge of that Department for the last three years.  The answer in connection with defence is a simple one and a brief one.  When we had a defence force during the emergency years, the conditions <Col N="1442" /> of service and the pay given to the young men who joined the Army were not to the credit of this State. It was not a very pleasant thing to note that a lot of them crossed the Border into the Six Counties to see if they could obtain better conditions there.  I am not saying for one moment that that practice should exist or should continue, but I believe that, in order to have a sufficiently strong Army, if we need it, we will have to pay the men adequately who join the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Departments of Social Welfare and Health, a Deputy on the opposite benches said that he considered that it was a waste of money to have two Ministers, to look after these Departments.  Yet mention was made here last week of the fact that Fianna Fáil, when in power, realised the importance of having a separate Ministry for the Department of Social Welfare.  We realised the importance of it also, and we can only say that it is the confusion in the minds of some of the Opposition Deputies that is leading them into the position that they do not actually know where they are.</P>
    <P>As regards expenditure generally, while it is a pleasure to hear a Deputy express his view if it is constructive, honest and sincere, I wonder why Opposition Deputies do not concentrate on some particular item when they object to what they call the huge amount of money that is being provided? Why have they not been honest and sincere enough to realise that out of the money provided, housing, thanks be to God, is going to take a goodly share?  Money is also being provided for rural electrification and grants are being given to farmers for the provision of water supplies for farm buildings.  Money is being provided also for the land rehabilitation scheme.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act cannot be forgotten, and increases have been provided for the health and social welfare services of the State.</P>
    <P>If Deputies opposite object to the large amount of money that is being spent, will they go so far as to say that in their opinion any of these items should be cut out?  There is no <Col N="1443" /> use in crying over spilt milk but when one realises that, in the 1930's three houses could be built for what one costs now, one gets an idea of the opportunities which were lost during the term of office of the last Government. Three families in rural Ireland could be put into decent homes for a sum which now has to be expended to provide housing for one family.  Did Deputies opposite say anything about the delays in building in years before the war?  It is true they built some houses, but how many people in the city of Cork are still waiting for houses?  How many people in South Cork have been waiting years for houses?  With that question comes another one: what Party was in power here during the years that these people were living in slums?  Thanks be to God, it was not the inter-Party Government.  Now, we know the position has changed, and that with a continuance of the present policy of the inter-Party Government it will be changed still further.  People will get adequate shelter, and their health will be provided for in so far as it is possible to do so by means of the moneys provided in these Estimates.</P>
    <P>The members of the Opposition have attacked this Vote on Account.  Reading between the lines, what they are trying to do is to say that too many houses are being built, and that too much consideration is being given to health services and social welfare. Deputies opposite may laugh, but I challenge them, when speaking, to tell us why they left the people in the condition they did.  Many a time when they were the Government they said that money was not the obstacle.  If not, what was the obstacle to the doing of the things that I have mentioned?  As a member of one of the Parties supporting the Government, we will do what we can to provide for the needs of the people in housing and in other matters. If we believe in the true concept of Christianity, then we cannot allow vested interests to prevent us from putting the true principles of Christianity into operation.  We must see to it that we will fulfil our life's ambition, which is to serve the people we represent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> Another line taken by Opposition speakers was to try and drive a wedge between the various Parties on this side of the House.  We believe, of course, that in doing that they are simply wasting their time.  They have failed to realise the advantages which accrue from having various Parties co-operating in the government of the country.  The views of each Party can be considered.  If you have four or five Parties supporting the Government, the programme of each can contribute its share towards providing a genuine common constructive policy.  In that way you can get good work done for the country.  We had the experience, of course, in the past, when there was no disunity in this country, but then men became divided afterwards.  When they were united they had a grand, glorious policy.  They then believed in the old cry of Sinn Féin amháin.  That cry was forgotten when men had been riding too long in the saddle of power. They forgot the promises which they had made in the early life of their organisation. In the early years we believed they were sincere in making promises. But, unfortunately, power can very often become a most destructive weapon, especially if the views of those who get into power are based on the philosophy of autocracy.  That is what I believe happened, that autocracy gained the upper hand.  If those men had continued with a genuine democratic policy, they could, I think, have done much better.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee stated that money was used by the Government for its own purposes.  Surely, the Government is the property of the people. It was the people who put the Government here.  If a Government is spending money for the advantage of the people, who are the owners of the Government, so to speak, then I believe that such a Government can rightly say that it is carrying out the wishes of the people.  We can leave it to the people to judge whether the money is being wisely spent or not.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have attacked this Vote on Account.  I would be quite satisfied if they went so far as to offer some alternative suggestion.  They did not do so.  Destruction was their war cry.  Surely, they do not believe that, <Col N="1445" /> after adopting the scorched earth policy, they would be able to come back and build up the ruins of their own destruction.  They have not so far made one suggestion as to how in a democratic and constitutional way we could carry on with a smaller sum of money than that asked for here. Fianna Fáil, through Deputy MacEntee, complained that one of the Parties in this Government was trying to swallow all the others.  I would like to say that Deputy MacEntee, and some other members of his Party, made a valiant attempt to swallow up some of the Labour Party members, but they failed.  Those Labour members who supported Deputy MacEntee's Party for some years came to realise that democracy and autocracy can never march together.  We believe in the co-operation there is between the Parties supporting this Government, and that this co-operation will give the people all the services they require. May I mention, in a friendly and neighbourly manner that Deputy MacEntee complained about the Taoiseach and all the medicine bottles.  All that I will say on that is that Deputy MacEntee has been handed his medicine during the last three years, and has not yet swallowed it.  It is too bitter for him.</P>
    <P>Complaint was made about the action of the Government in connection with the Price Freeze Order.  I think we are justified in drawing attention to one effect of it, and that is that in parts of the country in the case of certain commodities, there was a reduction in prices.  That proves that there was justification for the Order.  It also proves that certain people, by their own actions, have condemned themselves in our eyes, when overnight they had to make certain reductions.  Deputy Childers is entitled to laugh if he pleases.</P>

      <P>That is true.  We remember, however, that members of the Fianna Fáil Party complained, when eggs were 3/- a dozen.  Did they not say that the Minister for Agriculture was robbing the people in Dublin and in the cities?  On the other hand, we had members of that Party saying throughout the country that the Minister was not giving half enough.  We had the Party divided into two sections, one speaking for the cities and the other for the country.  In connection with the Price Freeze Order, while I am not going to condemn anyone, I still believe that there were manufacturers and wholesalers who, while protected themselves, abused the power they had.  It is common knowledge throughout the country that you had large wholesalers who had their warehouses stocked with materials of various kinds, some of which they had purchased eight, ten or 12 months ago, and on every occasion when there was an increase in prices on the world market, they were ready to jump theirs.  Some of them even refused to release stocks from their warehouses until a point was reached when they could say gloatingly to themselves: &ldquo;Now we have the people where we want them.&rdquo;  If, for no other purpose, the Order was necessary to bring such people back to their senses and make them realise that this Government believes in giving a fair crack of the whip to producers and consumers.  In that way, I believe the Government were justified in the action which they took.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is incumbent on me at the outset to correct a false impression which has been created in the minds of Deputy Desmond, and perhaps other Government Deputies, that the Opposition is criticising the amount of the Estimates for the coming financial year for the aske of opposition alone and because we were objecting to such a huge volume of expenditure. I should like to remind the Deputy that it was not for the purpose of criticising the amount alone, but because the Minister for Finance, when he first assumed office, relieved himself of all responsibility <Col N="1447" /> for what he described as the excessive sum of something like £65,000,000 and promised a policy of retrenchment, so far as he could achieve it.  Now the housekeeping bill has gone up to £90,000,000, with millions more for capital expenditure and some millions more which are being got through Marshall Aid.</P>
      <P>This side of the House has no quarrel with the amount of money spent so long as it is wisely spent.  It has no quarrel with the Taoiseach's oftrepeated promise to repatriate external assets as long as these assets are spent in the proper direction.  As Deputy Lemass pointed out, our external assets of something over £200,000,000 were repatriated in the last 12 months to the extent of something like £30,000,000 and, as far as could be seen, there was very little to show in the way of capital goods imported for that sum.  On the contrary, it was shown that they were mostly luxury goods.  If that was what the Taoiseach meant by repatriation of external assets, it was nothing short of dissipation of external assets.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputy Desmond also that Fine Gael, the dominant Party in the Government, before they assumed office, promised a reduction of £10,000,000 in expenditure and in their first year of office, instead of a reduction of £10,000,000, expenditure went up by something over £10,000,000.</P>

      <P>During the course of this debate, this side of the House has also been accused of destructive criticism, an accusation which has been repeated from the first day the Government came into power.  Deputy Desmond accused the Opposition of being guilty of the crime which the Opposition have alleged against the Government, namely, of speaking in different voices on the same subject.  It is not the duty of the Opposition as such to direct policy in the country.  If one man holds a different view and expresses it in the course of the debate, he is entitled to do so.  But it is a far different thing with a Government when its members individually make pronouncements week after week, one conflicting with the other, thus creating in the minds of the investing public, the manufacturing public and the producing public such a confusion that they do not know where they stand with regard to Government policy.  It is a different <Col N="1449" /> matter altogether for Opposition members to make criticisms.  But, when it comes to the Government speaking in different voices, the people do not know where they stand, and that is the position at present.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Desmond does not know that the policy of this Party, when facing any major problem, is that the problem is discussed fully and candidly at a Party meeting, that the majority decision prevails and is presented to the public.  I do not know what the position was before the Fianna Fáil Government left office, but since I came into the Party that is the position.  It is a position that I stand over and endorse.  It is carrying out the democratic principle when, in the Party, we can discuss our different points of view, hammer them out, and present them in a unified form, whether by way of criticism of the Government or suggestions for the better government of the country.</P>
      <P>I also deplore the misrepresenting of statements made by the ex-Taoiseach before the last general election. Apparently, remarks were made last night with regard to a wage of £2 5s. 0d. per week.  It was rather low-down propaganda, to say the least of it, that the Labour Party, before the election, should take a simple statement used for comparative purposes and ascribe a meaning to it which was never intended to be conveyed and blazen it across the front pages of newspapers in advertisement form with the heading, &ldquo;A wink is as good as a nod to a blind horse.&rdquo;  If the public fall for a device like that, they are no better than blind horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to what might be described even by Government Deputies as constructive criticism, I should like to deal with some matters presented under different headings in this Vote on Account.  Under agriculture, we find that millions of money are being provided for the importation of wheat.  It is a very short-sighted policy that a Minister for Agriculture, whether through personal prejudice against a particular cereal or in an attempt to discredit a predecessor in office, should deliberately undermine the economy of the country by cutting the <Col N="1450" /> wheat acreage by almost 50 per cent. in the short period of three years in office.  The present acreage of wheat is something over 300,000.  It is nothing short of sabotage in present circumstances that the nation's own resources of wheat should be allowed to be dissipated to such an extent that, in a time of need which may come at any moment, we will be dependent on half the acreage of what we were dependent on in the last emergency.  It is said, of course, that the Minister for Agriculture is prejudiced against the growing of any cereals whatever, that his whole agricultural economy is directed to raising cattle and feeding his old and valued customer with beef from the plains of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This old and valued customer has, of course, proved to be a greater fly-by-night than any of the fly-by-nights to which the Minister has referred on so many occasions in this House over the last three years.  It is suggested in the cities that that same Minister is impoverishing the urban dwellers in order to enrich the farmers.  I am no expert in agricultural matters but from remarks I have heard from Deputies supporting the present Minister and from remarks I hear from small farmers throughout the country I find the same accusation is levelled against the Minister in relation to the small farmers, namely, that he is impoverishing the small farmers in order to feed the people in the cities and towns.  I can speak for city dwellers and I do not believe I am making any startling pronouncement when I say that food is dearer now than it ever was during the emergency period.</P>

      <P>With regard to butter, I think the action of the Minister for Agriculture is an outstanding example of the shortsighted policy of the Government.  By the grace of God, we had a good year in 1949-50 and we had increased butter production.  That did not apply in the following year with the result that butter production fell considerably.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture could not, unfortunately, resist the temptation after the good year to export butter in order that he might be able to record that in one of the years of his ministry we were in the happy position of being able to export quantities of butter, such quantities as had never been exported within recent memory. That was an outstanding example of shortsighted policy, because within 12 months we had to import butter and we had to import that butter at a dearer price from that at which we exported our own butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot deny that butter was exported at the end of 1949 and during 1950, and that butter had to be imported at the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951.  He cannot deny the price at which the exported butter was sold was far less than the price at which the imported butter was purchased.  I think that is quintessentially very bad housekeeping, to say the least of it.  The Minister for Agriculture is credited with being a clever man and with being a good business man.  Apparently that is so in relation to his own particular business, but the Danish Minister for Agriculture is a cleverer man still because he can sell butter, which is alleged to be inferior in quality to ours, at a higher price than our Minister for Agriculture can get for his butter abroad.  The same Danish Minister for Agriculture can get 90/- per cwt. more on the Continent over and above the price our Minister can get for a product that we assert is superior.</P>
      <P>I think it is bad policy from the economic point of view to pay £31 a ton for foreign wheat while paying our own farmers, whom we are supposed to encourage to grow wheat, £25 per ton.  I think it is a bad policy economically to pay our own farmers, whom we allegedly encourage to produce beet for the manufacture of sugar, £12 per ton less than we pay for imported sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal now for a moment with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I have been talking to manufacturers throughout the country and their feeling is that the Department of Industry and Commerce is permeated with a spirit of indecision and lack a directive policy.  Certainly that has been the case for the last two or three years despite the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority. The boast has been made many times by the ex-Minister for Industry and <Col N="1453" /> Commerce that more people are employed to-day in industry than were ever employed in the history of our State.  I am not in a position to deny that and I accept the Minister's word for it but I would like to remind the Minister that that employment did not come into existence overnight or indeed within the last two or three years but is the result of the hard work and foresight of his predecessor and the Fianna Fáil Government in general in their policy of industrialisation. I do not believe the Minister will deny that.  He has never denied it so far and, therefore, I take it he accepts that that is so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest that anything I say will meet with the approval of the Minister or his colleagues. I do assert, however, that increased employment within the State within the past two or three years would not have been possible were it not for the positive long-sighted policy of industrial expansion implemented by the Fianna Fáil Government in the 16-year period to which the Minister for Finance has so often referred.  It is to the credit of the present Government that that industrial policy has been adopted and endorsed in the main, but there are some notable exceptions. The exception to which I want to refer is the abandonment, immediately on assumption of office by the present Government, of the heavy engineering industry.  Anyone who had any idea of what such an industry would mean to the country realised that it was absolutely essential to have a heavy engineering industry so that we would not be dependent on outside sources for all forms of heavy machinery and equipment.  I am not familiar with the details of the type of machinery that would be produced but I am informed by a reliable source that if we had such a heavy machinery <Col N="1454" /> industry at the moment, the shortages and the threatened shortages of implements necessary for agricultural and industrial expansion would not be so keenly felt.</P>
      <P>About 12 months ago the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the expansion of the cement industry. I listened to him in the House when he assured us that all the plans were laid, all the necessary moneys would be allocated, within the framework of existing factories, for considerable expansion in the output of cement. Nobody will deny that that expansion was not only desirable but extremely and urgently necessary.  Nevertheless, within 12 months, I was more than surprised to read that nothing had been done, despite the positive assurance the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave in the House.  Candidly, I was under the impression that this expansion had gone on at a pace in the intervening months.  Now we arrive at the position when we are not able to produce more cement than we were producing prior to the advent of the present Government, a position which is greatly to the discredit of the present Government, which as far as the cement industry was concerned, when they came in, had the ball at their feet.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have again to refer to the unfortunate policy of centralisation of industry.  I am not blaming this Government or the former Government for that but I will say that every Government that permitted the centralisation of industry in and around Dublin was guilty of almost a crime against the proper progress of this nation. Admittedly, there has been some small extension of industries in recent months and years.  The number of factories stated to have been set up is about 60.  I know some of them which are not in a position to employ more than four or five persons.  Certainly, some of the factories within my own constituency employ only a handful of people.  However, I shall not refer to the employment which is available in these factories but to the fact that most of the larger factories that are being erected at the present time are concentrated in and around Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> It is abundantly clear that industrial expansion, to have any proper meaning, must take effect along the southern and western seaboard.  In case of another emergency, undoubtedly, we will need all the productive capacity in industrial fields that we can command and we will certainly need easy access from outside sources to these centres of production.  It is elementary that it will be more difficult to get goods to Dublin than to any other part of the country.  England, as was proved in the last war, will be unable to supply us with essential raw materials.  Therefore, we shall have to look to the west for most of the raw materials that we will need.  It would be foolhardy to expect ships to negotiate the British Channel during war-time when there are ports such as Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway on the southern and western seaboard which would be far easier of access and far safer for incoming ships.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the fact that the addition to the total tonnage of ships under the control of Irish Shipping, Limited, in the last few years has been scandalously low.  It is a sad reflection on this Government that the tonnage added is represented by two or three colliers.  Every ship of any size that we have was acquired during the emergency or was exchanged in the years immediately following the emergency and before this Government came into office.  It is about time that the Government saw to it, even if they were assured that there would be no emergency, that more ships and better and bigger ships were provided.</P>
    <P>There are ample opportunities for the development of our ports.  Some harbour authorities are expending considerable sums of money on the development of ports to ensure that larger ships will be able to berth and unload there.  I was not in the House to hear it last night, but I have read in to-day's papers that a charge was made by the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Fianna Fáil Government were guilty of failing to provide adequate storage space for essential commodities.</P>

Before the Fianna Fáil Government came into power, along the quays of Cork, there was a small mill known as Furlong's Mill.  Anyone walking along that quay can see the enormous expansion in storage space for imported grain and home-produced grain.  Silos have sprung up there almost overnight, with the result that, instead of buying all our wheat and flour from Liverpool and Birkenhead, we can produce wheat and import the little that we require&mdash; in fact, the great quantity that we require under the policy of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;and, at least, be able to mill our own flour.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the price of coal at the present time. I agree with my colleague that it is scandalous that people in and around Cork should be asked to pay 15/- a ton more than the people in Dublin are being asked to pay.  I think it is most unfair, apart altogether from the fact that Dublin people are relatively better off financially than the Cork people.</P>

      <P>Well, wages are higher generally in Dublin.  I think it is unfair from a national point of view that people in one part of the country should be asked to pay a higher price for an essential commodity than <Col N="1457" /> people in other parts.  It is high time that the Governments would ensure that all parts of the country have an equal right to whatever supplies of coal are available, and, most important of all, that they should be asked to pay the same amount for it rather than give the people in one area an undue and unfair advantage over people living in other areas.  It is very significant that in the North they are asked to pay £6 2s. 0d. a ton for the best coal, while in Cork we are asked to pay £9.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the apparent lack of housing facilities provided by the Fianna Fáil Government during their term of office.  I do not know from what book of statistics he was reading, but he was completely awry in so far as his housing figures are concerned.  He said that Fianna Fáil left nothing but slums after their 16 years in office.  I remember in one part of Cork with which I am very familiar there were at one time acres of uninhabitable houses, unhealthy houses, levelled to the ground, and in their places we have to-day fine roads and avenues of new houses.  There were something like 3,000 houses built in Cork during those years and it must be presumed that they house between 15,000 and 20,000 people.  So far as I remember, I never saw any Minister going with bell, book and candle or blowing of trumpets to open these housing schemes.  They were opened quietly and the people were allowed to enter them without ceremony or display.</P>
      <P>I might mention for Deputy Desmond's information, and for the information of the House generally, that at the moment in Cork City there are almost 7,000 applicants out of a population of something like 100,000 people waiting for houses.  I would say, allocating four people to the family, that that represents almost 30,000 people, or about one-third of the entire population of Cork, and those people are in dire need of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A pretty poor effort after 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind Government Deputies that in the three <Col N="1458" /> years in which they have been in power only 300 houses have been built in Cork, which is a disgraceful figure by any standard&mdash;less than 100 a year. With 7,000 people on the waiting list it will take something up to 60 years at the present rate of progress before all the people are housed.  That is a sad reflection on the wonderful new housing drive we hear so much about.</P>
      <P>So far as I can understand, the housing drive at present seems to be firing on only one position.  I am not blaming the Government entirely, but all the same I say that a Government composed to a large extent of Labour Ministers could help a little more in an important matter of this sort.  I would like the Labour elements in the Government to bring home to the skilled labour groups that there is no shortage of work in each and every one of these groups, that there is no danger of their security or as regards continuity of employment, that there is no fear of their employment being jeopardised by admitting more to these skilled trades than are admitted at the present time.  I think this is one of the outstanding problems in regard to the housing drive.  It is a matter in which Labour Ministers and Labour Deputies in particular could help more than any others.</P>
      <P>I think the position in Cork at present is that some of the skilled trades groups will not allow any apprentices in or, if they do, they allow them in in such small numbers as to be of no material advantage to the housing drive.  I think if they examine the position objectively they must realise that a wide expansion of the bottleneck into these trades is due and will in no way interfere with the continuity of their employment.  The mere fact that 7,000 applicants are waiting for houses in Cork should be sufficient to convince even the most jealous members of these skilled trades&mdash;and I mean jealous in the sense that they are jealous of the right of entry into that trade&mdash;of the reasonableness of my suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said in this debate about defence, and it is suggested with a certain amount of justification that the attitude of this Government <Col N="1459" /> to defence is only lukewarm.  I think that attitude is possibly animated, to a large extent, by unfortunate views that are held in various directions that this country is only wasting money in spending it on defence.  I think it is an open secret that during the war, as a result of the pitch to which our defence forces were brought, any nation that had designs on this country for strategic or other purposes realised that even if they could overrun the country it would be far too expensive for them to hold, in equipment and manpower.  I hope sincerely if our policy in the next war, if there is to be another war, will be the same, that we will have defence forces of sufficient size to ensure that the country will be too hot for any invader.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, as Deputy Desmond would say, I would like to comment on the general air of uneasiness that is in the country.  That uneasiness is not brought about alone by the feeling of an impending international crisis, but rather by the feeling that there is in the Government a lot of inactivity, and a lack of realisation of their responsibilities in an emergency.  That impression is strengthened largely by reports of recent events within the Cabinet and also by the fact that all too frequently we have those assertions both inside and outside the House of harmony within the Cabinet itself.  If there is harmony within the Cabinet, why is it necessary to assert it so often?  Surely, in any Cabinet in which relations are harmonious it should be unnecessary to assert it and almost shove it down the throats of the people that they are working together in one happy family in the best interests of the country?</P>

      <P>Not in the slightest.  I will admit that it is a bit early in the year especially with snow falling, to have another general election and I hope that the Dáil will stick it out for another couple of months.  There is one remark that I should like to make and it is this, that instead of speaking in support of Government policy, Government Deputies direct their speeches in criticism of the attitude of the Opposition and to charges of obstruction and of unfair tactics against the Opposition. I think that kind of effort from the Government Benches is not only useless but, if I may say so, damaging to their own interests.  When they criticise the Opposition, it is obvious that they fear something in that Opposition, and as a result of recent events, I think they are perfectly justified in fearing the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;according to the Minister for Finance or right according to himself, whether he transgressed certain statistical lines or not, he certainly did bring his mind to bear on questions of economic importance to the country.  I should like to find some points of agreement with the Opposition because there are so many obvious and startling points of disagreement with them.  After all, we are all Irishmen and we should endeavour to find points of agreement rather than adopt the niggling attitude of some other Deputies of the Opposition who failed completely to understand the purport of this debate and addressed themselves to mere attempts to create an election atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the splendid tenor of Deputy Lynch's speech was rather beclouded in the last quarter of an hour, when he descended into the Fianna Fáil rut of accusing members of the Government and sections of the Government of doing certain things as if these things were crimes&mdash;accusing the Government, for instance, as he did, of trying to maintain themselves in office for the next two years.  What on earth does he expect the Government to do?  To kick themselves out of office?  Apparently he expects this Government to advertise as much as possible disagreements and disruptions within the Cabinet. Surely the whole sense of a Cabinet is to impress upon the people unity of purpose and common agreement?  The way Deputy Lynch does that, in the tortuous mode of logic in which he has been reared in the ranks of Fianna Fáil, is to confess one thing in order to conceal the opposite; apparently what they have to say to the public is intended to convey something entirely different from what it appears on the surface.  That is, unfortunately, too prevalent in this House.  We should try to get away from it.  We should try, as I said, to seek points of agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were one or two points on which I agreed with Deputy Lynch and which I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider gravely and favourably&mdash;his remarks in reference to heavy industry for instance.  It is true, perfectly true, as those who studied economics and who have some <Col N="1462" /> experience in this matter know, that one of the principal defects in our economic system in this country is that we have a lack of heavy industry.  I am not at all in consonance with the Government or any section of the Government in any action they took, for instance, in regard to Córas Iompair Éireann, which deprived us of an attempt to expand heavy industry. It may be said in justification of the Minister&mdash;it may be his line and I should like to hear him, if it is&mdash;that perhaps it was too early in that period of our economic development to devote certain capital assets and expenditure to the provision of such a heavy industry.  That argument may be feasible enough, but to me it carries little weight.  To my mind we have achieved such an expansion of the secondary and lighter industries, industries for the production of consumer goods and so on, that we should by now get down to the backing of the secondary and minor industries by the provision of a heavy industry of the type adumbrated in Deputy Lynch's speech.  I think that should be the purpose of the Industrial Development Authority, a body which was very unjustly criticised and a body which I believe has rendered good service to the country in the short time it has been in existence.  I believe they should address themselves further to that question.</P>
    <P>The Government, if they want to know the position of heavy industry, need take only one example which would perhaps give them a great deal of disquiet did they know the exact situation.  They have an opportunity now when we have this proposal of joint ownership which is suggested in regard to the Great Northern Railway. There is a railway system of vast importance to the economic welfare of this country and the engineering shops of that industry are in a lamentably out-of-date condition.  I think there is no machine shop of that character in such an antiquated and old-fashioned state as the Great Northern Railway shop at Dundalk.  The average age, I think, of most of the milling and other machines would be about 50 years.  On the closing of this important line and its amalgamation with the other <Col N="1463" /> sections of our railway industry, it would behove the Government to take into consideration the re-equipment of the essentially fundamental basic heavy industry that is necessary to keep the transport system of this country in first-class condition.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Lynch made some remarks in regard to the development of harbours.  That is a matter which should also be pursued by the Government. They have an opportunity to do so now.  There are many of our harbours along the east coast.  The harbour at Greenore, which has been very much neglected, has a capacity to take vessels of up to 20,000 tons.  At the present time, that port is dealing with practically no traffic whatever. A harbour such as that could be wisely used in the interests of the economy of this country.</P>
    <P>On one other point of small detail I want to express my accord with Deputy Lynch, and that is in regard to skilled tradesmen.  Now, it is a sore point perhaps, and he may twit the Labour Party members on being unable in any way to affect the situation. Skilled tradesmen are generally craftsmen with long traditions behind them, and it is very difficult, even in the midst of world wars and of crises of one sort and another to get them to depart from those traditions.  An illuminating instance of that occurred some time ago.  I personally discussed this matter with a tradesman and, as many of us have done, assured him and his union that there was 20 years of solid work ahead in the building industry, and that there could not be any reversion to the distressful days of unemployment, such as there were previous to the development of the housing programme.  That is a thing on which they harp very much.  The illuminating answer I received, bearing in mind how difficult it is to try and change the tenor of those people's ways was, &ldquo;What about the 21st year?&rdquo;  It looked so far ahead, recalling a memory of the distress they suffered during those days when unemployment in the building industry used to be so acute, and indicating that they are still dubious about opening their ranks to allow of <Col N="1464" /> a greater number of apprentices than they have catered for in the past.  But, by so doing, they are undoubtedly holding up the housing programme in the country which could be expanded so that something could be done for the rest of the country on a par with what has been achieved so magnificently by the Corporation of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Complaints are being made about the slowing up of this programme.  In Dublin, two years ago, they built 2,000 houses, last year they built 2,300 houses, and this year they are to build 2,600 houses.  That shows a stepping up of the programme.  Yet, despite these facts there are long lists of people still waiting for houses in practically every town in the country.  We can say that, despite labour difficulties and despite the difficulty in regard to materials, a great deal is being done in regard to that housing programme. These are matters on which I would express my agreement with Deputy Lynch, but with some other members of the Opposition Party I could find no agreement on those lines whatever. Neither did their speeches impress me, nor does the reading of their speeches indicate that they are likely to deserve well of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, for instance, like Deputy Briscoe does seem to think that the major part of his speech and most of his contentions should being the nature of a demand for an election. It used to be a habit with the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the Taoiseach, first to look into his heart and see what the Irish people wanted. In fact, it appears to me that Deputy Lemass is seeking to usurp the purple, and is beginning to look into&mdash;I do not know whether he has a heart or not&mdash; some part of his anatomy, because he wants an election immediately and says that the people are crying out for an election.  He does not even bother to read the speeches of his own Front Bench members.  From a close reading of Deputy Aiken's speeches, I can see no such desire whatever.  On two occasions he has talked about the continuation of this Government in office that no one can remove.  He does not indicate that there is any great desire to remove them.</P>

Deputy Lemass evidently thinks it is much better to have a return to power on his hands at 55 than to have it at 65.  It appears to me that, as far as one can see, the position of Fianna Fáil has become slightly unstable, to say the least of it, since we had the declaration of the Minister for Social Welfare in regard to the new scheme. I think the new type of argument which Deputy Lemass used in his speech was to the effect that they considered this increase in the old age pensions as a bribe to certain vested elements in the Government ranks to try and bring them to book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire, in the slightest to go into details of the scheme or to transgress the rules of order laid down for this debate.  What I want to show, however, is the demand for an election as instanced in the speeches of Deputy Lemass and Deputy Briscoe.  I could give four different quotations from speeches of Deputy Briscoe made, of course, before this announcement from the Minister for Social Welfare in which he showed that he was chafing at the bit, too, talking about appeals from the hustings, how they were to shuttle this Government out of Office and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, however, when he came to the discussion of these economic and financial questions, instead of following that, sort of lost control of himself.  He started off on this criticism of the Government and this demand for an immediate election, saying that the people wanted an election, without giving us one iota of evidence and without showing a single instance of a public body or even a debating society which had passed a resolution expressing the wish that there should be an election.</P>
      <P>Who wants an election except Fianna Fáil?  Naturally enough, Fianna Fáil wants an election because they are the Opposition and they are getting older every year.  Some of them will be due to retire before they get back to the ministerial benches and, naturally, they want to have an appearance on the hustings as quickly as possible.  Unlike Deputy Lynch, who thinks it is dishonest of the Government to try to remain together and to keep in office, I do not think it is wrong or any crime for Fianna Fáil to ask for an election, but I think they should be more honest in the type of propaganda they use to achieve their ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying when I was so rudely interrupted by Deputy Allen, with a view to putting me off my course of thought, the line of argument <Col N="1467" /> previously advanced by Fianna Fáil, as I take it, was that the economic situation of the country could ill-afford a social welfare scheme of the nature suggested by the Minister for Social Welfare, one of the ten points which brought together the Coalition.  Now, it appears that Fianna Fáil have turned a complete somersault.  They are going to burden the country still further by imposing taxation and, rather than have this insurance scheme in which every man and woman who contributes will have a categorical right to certain benefits as an insured person, they are going to make it depend on the whim of the Minister.</P>

    <P>However, there is something which, to my mind, is far more important than even this magnificent scheme of social welfare, and, though it may not be considered directly as a part of the financial or economic system, it is of transcendent importance.  It is much greater than most of the matters discussed here to-day and will ultimately affect our economic and financial welfare in perhaps greater degree than any of the details to which we addressed ourselves in the course of this debate.  It is more serious and more important than the remission of taxes by the Minister for Finance, the remission to which he several times referred in his disputation with Deputy Lynch, of £7,000,000 on <Col N="1468" /> beer, tobacco, amusements and nonessentials.</P>
    <P>It is more important than the export of butter which seems to have taken a great hold on the minds of several of the Deputies.  It is more important than the cost of living and that is a matter which is of very high importance, particularly to members of the Labour section of the Government.  It is more important than the rising standard of living of which we have had abundant evidence produced here by the Minister for Agriculture and it is more important than his policy or lack of policy, or all his various diversities of thought.  It is more important than the reduction in unemployment and the increase in employment.  It is that, as a primary basis for expanding the industry of the country and for improving the social life and economic welfare of the people, this Government has been able to achieve political peace within the country since it came into office.</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, is of far greater importance and is the highest and greatest justification of this inter-Party Government.  For the first time in 30 years, we have had three years of internal peace, and that, I submit, has an important effect upon the economic and financial welfare of our people. Without that basis of internal security and peace, there is no hope of democratic expansion for this country.  We were held up during the Cumann na nGaedheal régime and during the Fianna Fáil régime&mdash;during the régimes of the two previsions Administrations&mdash;by internecine warfare in this country.  That, happily, has ceased to exist, and all those who participated in the inter-Party Government, no matter how much we may disagree on points of policy, on sectional points, with the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and no matter how much we may disagree with the Minister for Finance in his orthodox or sometimes slightly unorthodox handling of the finances of the country, each one of us can pride himself on having participated in the erection of a governmental system which brought peace to this country.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who openly advocated <Col N="1469" /> that the only way of removing Fianna Fáil from office was an alliance and co-operation between the Opposition Parties.  I advocated it in Labour newspapers in this country and across the water; I was not realistic or wise enough to know that Fine Gael could be incorporated in such an inter-Party Government, thinking that it would be sufficient for the other Left Opposition groups to command sufficient support to put Fianna Fáil out of office.  I remember the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, when he was merely a Deputy, approaching me when these articles of mine appeared to ask whether Fine Gael could have a place in this system of Coalition or inter-Party Government.  I did not think it possible at that time&mdash;I was not wise enough to know but now that we have this Government in office and have seen it operating for three years, with all its creaking and all the criticisms that can be levelled at it&mdash;we have no pretensions whatever to perfection, any section of the Government or the Government as a whole&mdash;I can say that the Labour Party did well and very well in supplying an inter-Party arrangement such as this which has brought peace to the country.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Lynch was speaking, I was twitted that I supported the Coalition for what I could get out of it.  I still do so.  I think that the Labour Party is getting a great deal out of it and more than they could possibly have got under any arrangement with Fianna Fáil.  The day of inter-Party arrangements has come.  I do not think that Fianna Fáil will ever come back to power as a one-Party Government.  I think they will find that they will have to become reasonable enough to take assistance from some of the other sections in this House.  They may have to depart from their very high-handed attitude that they and they alone have some secret that endows them with an administrative ability which no other Party in the House has.  I think there would be more co-operation amongst Irishmen and amongst Parties if Fianna Fáil were to depart from that high-handed attitude, and if they tried to understand that the era of one-Party <Col N="1470" /> Government has passed.  Things pass in this world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always pleased to be educated, whether in victory or in defeat.  As an Irishman, I maintain that my function is to do what I have <Col N="1471" /> to do as well as I can for the country as a whole.  This Government deserves endorsement for its economic and its financial policy, as outlined by the Minister for Finance in his speech on this Vote on Account&mdash;though it may not be such as can obtain full endorsement from the Labour Party as an orthodox body.  However, we understand that, as things are, we cannot have everything we want but as much as is possible for the common good. We have to relate that to the other Parties and other sections in this Government.  In so far as that has been done, the Minister, as we have shown, and as many speakers have indicated, has done as well as could be expected in the present situation.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have accused the Minister, in regard to the present situation, of not so ordering the economics of this country as to fit us to defend our position in the event of the outbreak of war.  Deputy Aiken referred to war.  He criticised very stringently the attitude of the Taoiseach in regard to the lack of preparedness, as he called it, of this Government.  I think the matter is quite simple.  I think that Deputy Aiken was unwittingly answered by Deputy Lynch, who stated very simply, and without going very deeply into the matter, that during the last emergency, as we called it, any of the belligerent Powers who might have had designs upon this country&mdash;while they might have felt that it was possible for them to achieve their aim of taking over this country&mdash;would have found it, to use his own phraseology, too costly to maintain their position here.  That is still the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Major de Valera has, for a long time past, been pursuing a statistical inquiry as to the nature of our Army resources.  By now, he knows exactly how many privates, captains, B.L.s, B.A.s, M.A.s, B.Sc.s, and every other professional rank, we have in the different categories of our armed forces.  He must know almost how many buttons are on the trousers of every private in the Army as a result of all the questions which he has put to the Minister for Defence.  Where <Col N="1472" /> does this get us?  I am sure everybody realises perfectly well that in an armed conflict we, as a small nation of somewhat more than 3,000,000 people are less in numbers than some sections of the continental armies in the past war. The Russian Army consists of 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 men and the army under the command of General Eisenhower will be something up to 12,000,000 men.  We are a very small nation and we must make use of the differences between the contending Powers to ensure and to maintain our neutrality.  We must see to it that, with the least possible strain on our economy, we provide defence forces which will make it uneconomic and costly for any Power to maintain a position here against our will.  I submit that any Power which might attempt to maintain a position in this country against our will, with our present preparedness, would find it too costly to continue their hold upon this country.  As I see it, this Government has no intention of being run into a state of war preparedness by any criticism of the Opposition that they are not doing enough in this matter.  Their attitude should be that they will hold to the policy that there is a continuing peace to the very last moment that it is possible to do so and in that way avoid having to impose an undue strain upon the economy of this country.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in Great Britain is forced to cut across its whole programme of raising the standard of living of the people of that country, whose welfare it undoubtedly has at heart, because it must devote vast sums to rearmament&mdash;sums which could otherwise be devoted to capital expenditure and thus tend to increase the prosperity and happiness of the people of that country.  It must do that in order to defend the position that they think is necessary.  But, as far as we are concerned, they have unlimited power at their command.  Relatively speaking, as far as we are concerned, they have unlimited power at their command. We have no such power in our economy.  We cannot stretch our economy as they can stretch their economy.  Our economy is not elastic as their economy is.  We are a small <Col N="1473" /> nation but I am perfectly certain that the nation as a whole would give a good account of itself whether it was prepared under Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal, Fine Gael or an inter-Party Government.  No matter what Party or group of Parties were in power at the momentous time that a foreign power sought to take over the territory of the Irish Republic I am perfectly assured, as I am sure every other Deputy is assured, that the Irish people would not be let down.</P>
    <P>The Government of the day has undertaken a certain amount of stockpiling with regard to a scheme of preparedness. Deputy Briscoe doubts this very much and took the opportunity of criticising it.  He said it was not real stockpiling but that the increase was accounted for merely by an increase in the price of wool materials for uniforms and so on.  If Deputy Lemass, who also criticised very efficiently the lack of stockpiling, were to use some of his industrial interests and approach any bank in the country with a proposition about stockpiling in whatever industry interested him, I can assure him that he would find a choice welcome.  A very obvious conclusion for anybody who is informed upon these matters is that the banks would not be so generous as they are at present to manufacturers did they not know that they had the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole.  That is the way to test their seriousness.</P>
    <P>There is no possibility of any Deputy in this House giving actual statistical information regarding stockpiling in any industry, but I am perfectly certain that the Industrial Development Authority has given thought to this matter.  That is quite obvious from the fact that some important Ministers have been sent across the water to deal with the question of shortages or prospective shortages and other relative matters.  It is quite obvious, therefore, that the authority has considered stockpiling and that they did not just take an excursion for the good of their health.  They have thought well at the present time to survey the whole market and the possibilities of improving the situation in this country.</P>
    <P>There are certain products such as <Col N="1474" /> sulphuric acid which are stockpiled by every combatant, every would-be combatant and every near combatant.  It has 1,000 different uses, takes 1,000 different forms and has 1,000 derivatives that are necessary in industry after industry.  Like other commodities it is bound to become scarce and the price is bound to rise.  The same is true of tin and steel and other natural materials for warfare when there is a threat of war.</P>
    <P>Naturally there should be stockpiling in this country and it would be foolish of the Government not to survey the situation.  They should do their utmost to see that any section of the industrial community which was stockpiling in view of imminent scarcities and shortages were adequately supported and what they require mainly is financial support.  In any case many of the shortages are of a relative or territorial type and are not absolute shortages. Goods can be obtained but the price has gone beyond the limit and has skyrocketed far above the price which obtained before this crisis took place.</P>
    <P>It is for the industrial authority, the Minister for Finance, and those who are experienced in guiding them to strike a balance and to judge how much money should be devoted to this commodity or that commodity.  They must exercise a nice discretion and must not unduly burden the country by having on hands enormous quantities of stocks in the event of a real peace in the future.  If the present situation, threatening though it may appear in certain sectors of the international front, eases, we may possibly have a return to peaceful conditions for another period before an actual war breaks out in Western Europe. There is no certainty that war will break out.  Nations may snarl at one another and form groups and coalitions before and behind the Curtain, but yet they may never come to armed conflict.  The international situation in Europe must always be judged from the point of view of the economic situation in the United States.  We must consider the problems of the American capitalists in their attempt to gain a European market and to see that it will not be closed against them as it was on the advent of Adolph Hitler. <Col N="1475" /> Things are in a state of flux and there is no absolute certainty regarding the outbreak of a European war, no matter how threatening the situation may be in the Far East.  That situation may become more threatening in India and Pakistan and spread throughout the Asian Continent, but I cannot see why we should do more than take cognisance of the situation and prepare to an extent which is compatible with the undeveloped state of our economy.  I cannot see eye to eye with the Opposition whose terms would make one imagine that they had been reading an overdose of American war literature. They seem to imagine that we are a power of the same magnificent stature as the United States, one of the Benelux powers or something akin to England itself.  That is far from the fact. Our economy will stand very little strain.  This Government has undoubtedly exercised a degree of caution not perhaps fully in keeping with the ideas of the Labour Party, but be that as it may, they have formed a constructive policy which suits our people as a whole.  It suits the Parties in the Government and ensures the continuance of the support of the different sections forming it.</P>

      <P>Some time ago, when I was informed that the job to which I am about to refer was created in my constituency, and although I know the Parliamentary Secretary's capabilities where matters like this are concerned, I did find it hard to believe that he would think of appointing to a position such as this, one of the wealthiest men in my constituency.  I am not questioning this matter because I have any illfeelings against the particular individual: I am questioning it because my constituents resent having positions such as this filled by wealthy people, while they feel that there are men equally as honest, equally as deserving, <Col N="1476" /> equally as capable of filling the post, as is the particular individual to whom I am about to refer.</P>
      <P>We are living at a time when a lot of our young men have to leave this country because they cannot find employment, a lot of men who are highly educated, a lot of men who are trustworthy and reliable and quite capable of doing any work that would be given to them.  Very little effort has been made to try and fit them into positions. To-night I am putting before the House and before the country a most glaring case.  On last Thursday I first questioned this matter.  I asked the Minister for Finance if a Mr. Flannery of Milltown, County Galway, had received an appointment from the Office of Public Works and if he would state the salary, the date of the appointment and the conditions of employment.  As the House will recall, I was informed by the Parliamentary Secretary that the person to whom I had referred was appointed as paymaster for the Special Employment Schemes Office at a remunerations of 1½ per cent, of the amount of the payments he made.  I further tried to ascertain what this would amount to per week or per month, but of course, the Parliamentary Secretary got out of that by saying he was not in a position to tell me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the same question. He contented himself with stating that the remuneration varies from month to month.  I asked him a few supplementary questions and I think the replies he gave would be very interesting to a lot of people who sit on the benches behind him.  This is one of the supplementary questions:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Would the Parliamentary Secretary state if any effort was made to find a person who had no means or income, who would fit into the job better than the individual who had <Col N="1477" /> a public house, a grocery, a drapery, a hardware shop and farms of land?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply the Parliamentary Secretary gave to that was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would the Deputy furnish me with evidence of the statements he has made?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know to what statements he was referring, because there is nothing in connection with this particular individual that the Parliamentary Secretary is not well aware of, seeing that he lives practically in his house all the year round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no harm in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit, but here is what has harm in it, here is what is resented by most people.  The Parliamentary Secretary then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As the Deputy is aware, for the position of paymaster you have to have a trustworthy individual.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, does he mean to insinuate that the only trustworthy individuals we have in Ireland are the shopkeepers, the graziers and the landlords?  If I read into this rightly, that is what he means.  Further, he said: &ldquo;You want a reliable man.&rdquo;  Now, Sir, I hold, and a lot of people in my constituency hold, that we have an army of young men available for employment.  Some of them may belong to his own organisation, a lot of them may belong to the Fine Gael Party, to Clann na Poblachta and to Labour.  I do not care to which of those Parties they belong, but I do say that we have in County Galway young, decent men who are reliable and trustworthy and who are capable of taking such work, and who have no other employment, and that they should get preference of jobs such as this one.  As I have said, this is a wealthy individual, a man who has his own business to look after and whose hands are pretty well full if he makes even a feeble effort to look after it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of that question, I found it necessary to put down a further question for to-day's Order Paper, <Col N="1478" /> under a number of headings, to give the Parliamentary Secretary a reasonable opportunity of giving me a reply to the questions to which I wanted answers.  I asked if the Minister would state the area in which this man would operate.  I was told he would operate in the rural districts of Tuam and Glenamaddy.  This individual has been an organiser for the Parliamentary Secretary, and the areas referred to here which this individual is covering are the areas that comprise about 75 per cent. of the constituency which the Parliamentary Secretary has the honour to represent and which I have the honour to represent as well.  I hold that the appointment, in the first place, is very suitable for the Parliamentary Secretary, because the State will be paying an organiser for him.</P>
    <P>Under (b) I asked who did the work heretofore.  It was not being done by anybody before.  The people who were getting any money from the Board of Works were being paid direct by the Board of Works.  Therefore, I hold that it was a job that was being created for this particular individual. In (c) I asked whether the vacancy was advertised and the qualifications required.  I was told: &ldquo;The vacancy was not advertised; the principal qualifications are probity and trustworthiness and ability to perform clerical work involved in the discharge of wages sheets.&rdquo;  As I pointed out, I am certain there is an army of young men who could be found to do that and who have no other employment. In (d) I asked whether there was any examination or interview and the reply to that was: &ldquo;There was no competitive examination; Mr. Flannery was interviewed by officials of my office.&rdquo;  I pass from that without comment.  In (e) I asked on whose recommendation Mr. Flannery was selected and I was told: &ldquo;The appointee was one of a number of persons whose names were submitted to me, and he was selected by me as being the most suitable for the post.&rdquo; I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to-night the names and addresses of the other candidates, because otherwise I will not believe any statement made by the Parliamentary <Col N="1479" /> Secretary.  I want this case threshed out in public in order to put it before my constituents and let them judge whether or not this is the only reliable and trustworthy person the Parliamentary Secretary could find in that constituency from his Party or any other Party to fill this particular job.  In (f) I asked if this man will still be free to pursue his political activities and the answer I got was: &ldquo;He cannot engage in any political activities which would interfere with the proper discharge of the duties of the post.&rdquo;  Some time ago a political test was put to all Fianna Fáil employees in the County Galway.</P>

      <P>The reply I got to that was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not aware that there is any prohibition against appointing to the post of paymaster a person who is the owner of licensed premises, but, on <Col N="1481" /> the other hand, I would consider such an appointment undesirable. The person in question, however, has not yet taken up his duty pending the completion of the fidelity guarantee bond required in such cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary completely avoided giving me a reply to that portion of the question and kept very far away from the fact that a few days after it became known that the appointment was being made, in case it would be questioned here, in case this House would be led to believe that Mr. Flannery would be capable of paying in his licensed premises the people whom he would be paying week after week and who were employed by the Board of Works, thereby collecting from them the wages they had earned, Mr. Flannery was told to transfer his licensed premises lock, stock and barrel to his wife, so that the Parliamentary Secretary could tell the House that this man owned nothing.  But the Parliamentary Secretary was forestalled and so was Mr. Flannery.</P>
    <P>I asked a few supplementary questions to-day.  In reply to one of my supplementary questions, the Parliamentary Secretary thought fit to refer to something that happened very many years ago.  Deputy C. Lehane had been primed to ask a certain supplementary question and the Parliamentary Secretary, of course, answered very conveniently. This is the answer he gave to it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have the very self-same authority to-day and I have followed the self-same procedure as Deputy Hugo Flinn had on the 18th November, 1932, when he appointed Deputy Killilea a paymaster for the Board of Works.&rdquo;</P>

He was a man who was quite prepared to work and earn a bob if he could get it.  He got a job valued at less than £2 per fortnight from the Board of Works.  He held that job for a few months.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to make political capital out of that he can do so; but I will meet him and beat him again in my constituency in County Galway.
