      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order as set out in the Order Paper: Nos. 1, 3, 5, 9&mdash;and, with 9, 6 and 7 shall be put for decision&mdash;8 and 4.  It is proposed that the House will sit to-day until midnight.  If that arrangement is considered satisfactory, I suggest that the Taoiseach might be called upon to conclude his Estimate at 9 o'clock and that the questions on 9, 6 and 7 be put at 11.30, which would, I think, just leave time before midnight to dispose of No. 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indeed refreshing to listen to a young Deputy speaking on a rather hackneyed subject in a manner that is both original and courageous.  Deputy Declan Costello brought to the consideration of the problem of Partition a logical, sincere and young mind.  Some Deputies said last night that he spoke without appreciating the realities of the situation, that he made good debating points in theory but that they had no basis in reality.  It might be desirable for those who think in that fashion to re-examine the whole problem themselves.  It is possible that those who have been in close contact with this question, probably prior to the time at which <Col N="1998" /> Deputy Costello was born, overlook aspects which are clearer to him.</P>
      <P>Some of the Deputies from the Northern Counties who speak on this question are invariably intolerant or impatient towards Deputies representing the rest of the country.  They appear to suggest that only those who live in the Ulster Counties really understand the difficulties.  Very often the man who is standing close by a wood cannot see it as clear in outline as can the man who is standing upon a hillside some distance away from it.  It is, therefore, possible that a fresh young mind applied to this problem may see its difficulties with clearer logic than those who have been dealing with it for years.</P>
      <P>Candidly, I have never been entirely satisfied or in complete accord with the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Government towards this problem but I think their manner of dealing with the matter has been more prudent and less dishonest than the attitude of their opponents. Partition is a national problem of tremendous magnitude.  If it is dealt with in the right way and a solution achieved, our country will become immeasurably stronger.  If it is dealt with in the wrong way, we may find ourselves drifting towards national disaster.  Because of that, I think it is a matter that requires the most careful consideration.</P>
      <P>There is a general acceptance of the view that force must be ruled out in the solution of this problem.  Whether that view is accepted by all our people is open to question.  There are various ways in which coercion can be applied. One can have military coercion.  One can have economic coercion.  Coercion can be applied directly by our own people or indirectly by inducing some other country to bring pressure to bear on the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we decide coercion is to be ruled out, there is only one alternative and that is peaceful persuasion, or a serious and sustained attempt to win over at least the majority of the people within the Six Counties to our side.  It is essential that we should indicate our objection to the manner in which this State was established and the way in which it was carved out without any reference to our historical background <Col N="1999" /> or to economic or geographical considerations. At the same time we have to remember that 30 years have elapsed since the late King George V came over to Belfast and established that little State on the North-East of our country. Those 30 years have left their mark particularly on the boundaries and institutions of the Six Counties and it will be a difficult task to obliterate that mark.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this problem, we should get down to essentials and make it clear whether or not we want to abolish the Six Counties State and the Border or secure the establishment of national unity.  The two things are not identical.  Possibly it clarifies things to a certain extent for people to say they are against Partition, but it would be a more realistically factual statement for people to assert that they are in favour of national unity.  One can have many partitions in a dwelling but the dwelling remains all the time a single unit.  We can have in an independent Ireland a number of self-governing States while at the same time preserving the essential unity of the nation.  I think, therefore, we should indicate clearly that what we want to do is not so much to abolish Partition as to establish national unity.</P>
    <P>The basis on which this separate State exists in Northern Ireland is fear and mistrust of the people in the remainder of the country and of the Irish nation as an entity.  The first objective of a sane, progressive policy directed towards national unity should be to remove that fear and mistrust.</P>
    <P>If we indicate to the people of the Six Counties that they can have their Parliament if they wish, that they can retain the institutions which they have at present and that all we need is that they should recognise, accept and become affiliated with this State, then I think we would prepare the way to a certain extent for national unity.  In addition to that, we must I think be prepared, and a start should be made right now, to establish a better relationship between the people of the Irish Republic and the people of the Six Counties.  That better relationship can be established by closer contact, particularly on economic matters, to start <Col N="2000" /> with.  There are transport problems, hydro-electric problems, drainage problems and other matters of that kind in which there is a community interest as between the Six Counties and the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In meeting representatives of the Six Counties and discussing with them these problems, we would be preparing the way, I think, for the establishment of a certain amount of mutual confidence.  It is true, and it must be accepted, that the position of the Nationalist majority in the Six Counties is a difficult one, that their path is a hard one to travel, but, in dealing with this matter, if we want to remove mistrust and establish confidence, we should deal with the injustices that are being inflicted on our Nationalist brethren in the Six Counties in a constructive way, aiming not at showing up these injustices for the purpose of destroying the Six-County State, but rather to reveal them for the purpose of having them removed and rectified.  That is a constructive approach to this matter.  If instead of exposing the injustice of, perhaps, the gerrymandering system or of the enforcement of law in the Six Counties, all over the world, we were to take up these matters directly with the Government of Northern Ireland and seek to have these wrongs righted as quickly as possible and the position of our Catholic fellow-countrymen in the North of Ireland improved, then we would be taking a long step towards establishing that better relationship between this State and the Six Counties which is desirable if national unity is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>There are people, and there will always be people, who cherish the hope that there is a short way towards the solution of the problem and that that short way is to use force by which the Government of Northern Ireland could be swept away and the Six Counties brought completely within the State, but I think the long way might be the surer way and that it might have more lasting results.  Even if national unity could, on the surface, be achieved by force, the achieving of that result would mean, in effect, civil <Col N="2001" /> war, because we must accept the fact that the people of the Six Counties and the people of the rest of Ireland are all citizens of the Irish nation. Civil war always leaves behind it bitterness and bitter memories which it takes years to eradicate.  I think that the action of the Dublin Fire Brigade during the emergency, when it went to Belfast to assist the people there, did more for the cause of national unity than much that is talked about on public platforms.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also that there is one factor which must make for the eventual establishment of a united Ireland, and that is the position of the Protestant minority in the Twenty-Six Counties.  So long as their position is secure, so long as they can say to their co-religionists in the North that their position is satisfactory in every respect, that I think will make for a strengthening of the ties between the two States.  Because that is so, I deplore in the strongest way certain statements that were made in this House recently.  We heard a statement from an ex-Minister in which he said in referring to the Protestant minority in the Twenty-Six Counties: &ldquo;If trouble comes we shall send these Brookes and fifth columnists across to the place where their spiritual home is.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">

      <P>An even more deplorable statement was made here by another ex-Minister while he was actually Minister.  I quote from the Official Report of the 14th February, at column 19, in which the Minister for Agriculture is reported to have said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There will be no bitter memories kept but it is right to warn the major-generals that if they think they or their gallopers can start their tricks again, they will find there is a limit to the forbearance, the tolerance and the readiness of our people to forget them.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>As members will see from the Book of Estimates, a total sum of £22,620 is required for the year.  Of that a sum of £7,600 has already been voted, leaving the sum I have mentioned now, £15,020, to be granted.  There is an increase of £650, but that is due entirely to the progressive increase in increments and to some changes in grading of staff.  I am informed that certain changes have occurred since the preparation and publication of the Estimates, and that that may need a Supplementary Estimate for a relatively small sum.  That will be dealt with, of course, in due course.</P>
    <P>There is nothing, I think, in the Estimate that calls for any particular comment by me.  Some questions may be raised in the course of the debate, and I shall be very glad to reply to them.  My predecessor initiated a custom of making a general survey, which, I think, was a very good one. Most of the financial papers have been published by this time.  We have got the Central Bank reports, the Budget Statement, and the other papers that were circulated at that time, all of which give us a fairly extensive picture of the financial situation.  The purpose of such a survey would be to go over the Government's work during the year and indicate the progress or lack of progress that has been made in certain directions.  On this occasion, particularly as we have some important motions on the Order Paper to deal with, I think it is just as well that I should break the custom which I hope will be continued.  It is particularly <Col N="2005" /> advisable and it gets the House down to discuss questions which are fundamentally more important than a repetition of the questions that are raised generally in the separate Estimates for the Ministers.  However, I feel that it is better that I should not adhere to the custom now.  The main purpose of the survey would be to consider the general governmental policy, what it is aiming at and what has been achieved.  It is my intention to refrain from doing so, but if there are any questions raised, I naturally will be only too happy to answer them.</P>

I think it has been noticeable here in the House, in the introduction of their Estimates, that none of the Taoiseach's Ministers made any effort to make any declaration of policy in respect of their Departments. I think the House rather expected, as I expected, that at least on this occasion, on the Vote for the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach would take great pains to indicate the general lines of Fianna Fáil policy.  The only indication of Fianna Fáil policy that the House and the country has had was in the nature of the 17 points that were published in the daily papers a day or two before the election of the Taoiseach. In this House last night the Minister for Finance painted a somewhat gloomy picture and made a forecast which, I think, the Fianna Fáil Party themselves would not stand by. We were expecting that the Taoiseach would take an opportunity this morning to give us an idea, at some length, of what the Fianna Fáil policy may be in the future.  Of course, the Taoiseach may say it will be the same as it was in the past, but circumstances have changed and times are different from what they were, possibly, in 1947 when the Taoiseach went out of office.  I think it is only fair to members and to the country that we should be given a statement of policy before the House adjourns, however long or short that statement may be.</P>

      <P>It is usual for <Col N="2006" /> Ministers, in dealing with their Departments, to indicate the work that the Departments have been engaged on and what they propose to do in the immediate future.  Ordinarily, the Taoiseach's statement, if he were to go on the lines that were suggested by Deputy Corish, would be simply a repetition of those individual statements that have been made.  For instance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would naturally deal with the industrial side, the Minister for Agriculture would put forward agricultural proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Minister for Finance would deal with the financial aspects.  If the Taoiseach were to go over a survey of these grounds, it would simply mean a repetition of the debates that have taken place on all these Estimates.  However, I do admit that the Ministers have not given a survey of the policies of their particular Departments, and it is probably because they have been in office for such a short time and have had to take over the work that has been already done.  They need time to find out on what lines activities are moving, to make up their minds how they will change these activities should a change be necessary, how they will speed them up in certain directions, if it is a question of lack of speed, and so on.  It has not been possible for the Government to deal with the Estimate under review as it would ordinarily be dealt with.  Neither has it been possible for Ministers to present their departmental reports in the recognised manner.</P>
      <P>As far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, general Government policy may be summarised under three or four heads, namely the political head, the economic head, the social head and the cultural head.  One can always summarise our policy, or indeed, the policy of any Government, under these heads if they are taken separately.  As far as the political head is concerned, there is one outstanding political problem that has been dealt with to a certain extent in the debate on the Estimate for External Affairs.  In so far as it affects our relations with Britain, it is very natural that that should be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not dealt with.  I do not think the Minister referred to it at all, and the understanding was that the Taoiseach would deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact in regard to that, if I had been permitted to proceed with my statement, I would have said I was under the impression from the speeches I have listened to since the Dáil started this morning that there had been a discussion on that subject.  For instance, there was a reference to the statement of Deputy Costello (Junior) on that matter and then there was a reference by another Deputy this morning. Therefore, I concluded that that matter, to a certain extent, had been dealt with.</P>
      <P>There are two motions on the Order Paper which, undoubtedly, in one form or another will bring up this question, so that the big political question, namely, the unity of our country, will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Then let us take the next one, the economic question.  The economic policy of Fianna Fáil, and it must be the economic policy of anyone interested in the well-being of the country, is to utilise the natural resources we have to the full.  There may be a difference of opinion on different sides of the House as to the method by which that can be done.  We have indicated many times how it ought to be done.  We were pursuing for a number of years a policy of development.  The natural resources of our soil would naturally be developed by the Department of Agriculture by having such a policy as will improve the general conditions and the productivity of the soil and pursuing a policy with regard to agricultural production which will make the best possible use of the soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing is the development of resources like our bogs.  Obviously, the policy of anybody who wants to use the resources of the country to the best advantage will be to make use to the fullest extent of these bogs, whether from the point of view of producing fuel for domestic purposes or utilising them for the production of power.  Water power is another resource which should be utilised to the <Col N="2008" /> full.  That is the purpose, for example, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in pushing ahead the work of the Electricity Supply Board in these several directions.  Then there is the exploration of our mineral resources to see exactly what we have and to put them in an order of priority as far as development is concerned, if an order of priority should be necessary.</P>
    <P>These in general are the natural resources which occur to everybody.  The development of these resources to the full and the utilisation of the credit and the capital and financial resources of the country for that purpose is obviously in line with our general aim which has been stated so many times. You have then the development of the natural resources of the country and of agriculture, as well as the development of the industrial side, the manufacturing industries.  It is obvious that the best industries to develop are the industries for which we have raw materials here.  If we have raw materials at home they will be available in times of crisis when there are difficulties of transport, etc., and when raw materials would not be available otherwise.  The industries that depend on raw materials which have to come in from abroad and which may be prevented in times of crisis from coming in are not fundamentally as sound as the industries based on home resources.</P>
    <P>The building up of our manufacturing industries is the other side of our economic policy.  We have gone ahead with that and we propose to proceed further with it.  Our policy is based on the utilisation of private enterprise to the utmost extent.  But where private enterprise is unable to do a specific piece of work, where the resources do not appear to be sufficient or private enterprise does not seem to be willing and initiative is lacking, we have always held that the State has the right and the duty to come in and supplement the efforts of private enterprise. As to the particular industries that should be established, again there is a priority in regard to these industries. The more fundamental ones naturally come first.  If you take the ordinary <Col N="2009" /> needs of man: food, clothing, shelter and fuel, these are the fundamental needs and obviously our industries should be directed towards the provision of these fundamental needs.  I am only giving a general idea because the Deputy was anxious that I should give a sort of general outline of what we intend doing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social side, again our aim has always been to try to improve the general standard of living in the country, to make it possible for as many people as our resources will permit to be maintained in a reasonable standard of comfort.  That has got to be done, first of all, by their own efforts and where the efforts of the individual, through circumstances over which he may have no control, fail or are insufficient, the State should come in and by a sort of mutual social insurance, if I may put it in that form, try to help the weaker members&mdash;those who are weak, not through any fault of their own, but through circumstances over which they have no control.</P>
    <P>I have often pointed out that one has to be very careful how one proceeds in cases like that, because to give aid where it is not necessary has very undesirable results.  If possible, we ought to try to encourage people to do the best they can for themselves.  From the point of view of human character, that is the best thing to do and the aid should be given only where necessary. On the other hand, one has to be careful not to follow a policy which would cause hardship in cases of that sort.  It is a very difficult matter and naturally there are differences of opinion as to where exactly one could draw the line, where one is giving help which is not necessary and where one is withholding help which is necessary and should be given.  We feel that the resources of the community, if properly husbanded and carefully managed, ought to be sufficient to meet our reasonable needs in that respect.</P>
    <P>We admit that we would not move in some of these directions as fast as other people, perhaps some members on the Labour benches, would like to go.  The difference between us in these cases would be the question of estimating whether the policy of going in a particular <Col N="2010" /> direction would be really a weakening policy on the one hand or a policy beyond the resources of the country as a whole which, if adopted, would mean that in a very short time you would produce greater evils than the evils which you try to remedy.</P>
    <P>On the social side, obviously the first thing which comes to one is the question of housing.  Housing is fundamental. Decent homes are absolutely necessary for human well-being and, consequently, the provision of houses to the fullest extent necessary and possible is, I would say, the one of our social activities which requires most attention.  I feel I am justified in saying that, from the Government point of view, the continuation and speeding up, if possible, of the provision of houses for those who need them will be the most fundamental of our social activities.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of public health.  I think there is a sort of general agreement that the matter of public health is one that requires immediate and vigorous attention.  I do not agree with a number of people who say that things are in a desperate state.  I think there is a great deal of exaggeration.  There are obvious things that should be done and I think the resources of the community are sufficient to deal with them.  On that side, we intend pressing ahead in the direction in which we have mentioned.  There are other social services as to which a general indication was given when we were in opposition.  We indicated in general terms the direction in which we will go and we will keep as close to that as possible, subject to any closer knowledge which we may derive from statistics, etc.  For instance, there were some statistics that were given by the former Minister for Social Welfare here and it seems to me that they were absurd.  These have to be examined.  At the time I was going to question further as to what the figures were based on.  If the figures were as he gave, it is quite possible that the thing would not be done.  If, on the other hand, our estimate proves, on close examination, to be nearer to the truth, then, of course, we would be <Col N="2011" /> able to keep to our programme.  But, if there should be any deviation from that programme&mdash;if there is such, and I am not saying that there will be&mdash; it will be due to the fact that, on closer examination, with better statistics, we may find that some of our projects are beyond our means.  I hope nobody will take it that I am saying that as a fact.  I am simply looking at the problems that concern us immediately.  The continuing of the particular projects for dealing with social services and public health are two of the immediate tasks that face the Government, tasks to which, during the Recess, we will, I hope, devote our attention and when the Dáil reassembles I hope we will be in a position to meet them in a concrete and definite way.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this question, perhaps I might refer to the question of the Gaeltacht and the attempt which we propose to make to try to have some co-ordination of the services that are dealing with, not the Gaeltacht alone, but the congested areas.  As the House knows, we set up a Parliamentary Secretary responsible to the Government to try to co-ordinate these various services so as to meet the special needs of these areas.  Attempts have been made in the past to deal with these areas and they have not been very satisfactory.  You have, of course, this sort of contradiction that you are anxious to have as many people in rural areas as you can have and, certainly, if people have to leave any of the areas that we call congested areas, we are anxious that they should not leave the country.  The problem is how to get decent conditions of life and reasonable opportunities of decent living for the people in these areas without moving them from the areas. The general idea was to move them out, We are trying, or will try, to see to what extent we can develop in those areas means for giving employment. Two or three things suggest themselves. There is, for instance, the question of dealing with some of the bog areas that are there in two ways, one, in developing the bogs from a power point of view and another the reclamation of the bogs, to see whether, by using <Col N="2012" /> modern methods, certain modern techniques, these bogs can be utilised for the production of crops of one kind or another.  Then there was, for instance, the idea that originated with the former Minister for Finance, the present Minister for External Affairs, namely, to utilise areas like that for the growing of tomatoes and produce of that kind, where you have not soil to utilise the energies that come to us directly through the sun.</P>
    <P>I think I can pass on now to the cultural side.  On the cultural side, there is the fundamental question of trying to restore the language.  The restoration of the language is fundamental. I think it is accepted as being a national aim.  It is accepted by all the Parties.  I do not know, if there was an absolutely free vote taken in this House, how many would vote against.  I do not think there would be many.  There probably are some who take the view that the language has nothing to do with nationality fundamentally or at least that it is all a bit of foolishness, that one language is quite sufficient and that the whole world would be very much better off if we all spoke but one language, and they trace back and talk of the Tower of Babel, and so on, and the results, as being a curse.  In this country, we have not taken that view.  The majority of our people have not taken that view. We have taken the view that our language is so closely associated with our nationality that for the ultimate preservation of our nationality in the world as it stands to-day it is a necessity or, if it is not an absolute necessity, it is highly desirable.</P>
    <P>The problem then arises, what are the steps that we can take to restore the language?  Anybody giving any fundamental thought to the matter, obviously, has to rely on two main sources for development.  The first is the Gaeltacht, the preservation of the area in which the language is spoken, and its extension, if possible.  That is number one, and it is vital and it is in that connection that it is important that the Parliamentary Secretary and the work that has to be done in those areas do not, in fact, become an anglicising instead of a nationalising agent so far as the language is concerned.  It <Col N="2013" /> is one of the great difficulties that, if done unwisely, when you introduce modern industries into those areas and develop them from an economic point of view so as to give a livelihood to the people there, the danger is that at the same time you are introducing anglicising agents.  That must be carefully watched and it may be very difficult indeed to manage to have the economic development that one requires and to do it quickly and at the same time to prevent the evil results following.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not better to develop these areas economically than to have the people emigrating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is not that.  The Deputy will see that it is not merely the emigration.  My point is that we want to try to have all that, that we want to keep the people there, and the aim must be to find employment for the people without bringing in anglicising agents.  It will be very difficult to do that.  I am not saying that we have the choice that the Deputy has mentioned, that that is necessarily the choice.  I hope it will not be the choice because it would be a very difficult one if it ultimately came down to that.  The trouble is that it may not solve the emigration problem to any large extent, but it may very well destroy the core of the people who are there and get them to lose the language too.</P>
      <P>I am as much alive to the importance of the economic side as the Deputy is, but everything humanly possible ought to be done, if we are serious about the maintenance of the language, to see that the anglicising results do not follow.  The aim is the maintenance, at least, of the Gaeltacht at present and, if at all possible, its extension, and if I were managing it personally and I were asked to suggest places for immediate development, the areas that I would choose, other things being at all equal, would be the areas that immediately are on the verge of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I could get these areas developed for giving employment to other Irish speakers, I would hope in that way to extend the area of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. By planning carefully, and using to the <Col N="2014" /> utmost whatever opportunities are available, I think it should be possible to move along in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that you can have general directions, but that when you come down to details there may be different considerations, and that one has to leave the person who is doing a thing a certain amount of discretion and freedom.  What I want to say is that different people will put slightly different weights on different aspects, and that when considerations and decisions are being arrived at, one person will put a bigger weight on one factor than another person will.  You can never leave out the human element completely in any human organisation. I was saying that if I were that person and had to apply these considerations, then, if possible, I would choose in a certain way.  As Head of the Government and as far as the Government is concerned, that is what we will try to do.  That is what the Deputy wants to know.</P>
      <P>With regard to the development of the Gaeltacht and the congested areas, as long as I have been in politics, and certainly since the old régime passed, there has always been the suggestion of reconstituting the Congested Districts Board.  There has been a good deal said from time to time about the good work that was done by the old Congested Districts Board.  Anybody who has given any thought to that problem will realise that there are two things operating.  One is that things which are far away, as they come back, always become golden in the sunset and that the work it did has always been magnified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there is this, that conditions now are quite different.  It was one thing to give to a group of <Col N="2015" /> people practically absolute power to take an area of land and cut it up, to say that A would get this, that B would get that, and that C would get something else.  Any complaints that were to be made had to go over to London. Fortunately, the centre of authority, and the place for making the complaints, is now not London, but here. We have representatives here from every part of the country who will examine everything that is being done. If there is any fault to be found, it will be talked about.  If things which passed as being well done in those days were done here in present circumstances, they would be regarded as things that were by no means well done.  Under the Congested Districts Board, when A got a certain holding and B was deprived of it, if there was a complaint it had to go to Westminster and nothing more was heard about it.  That is not the position now.  If B thinks that his complaint is a good one he sees his local Deputy or somebody else. We hear complaints about things that are being done rather than anything about the good work that is being done.  You hear the two sides at any rate.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to pass judgment on the work that was done, but I know that the conditions under which similar work is being done to-day are so different that you are faced with a very different problem altogether. Nobody would agree that to-day you could, for instance, give power to any group to make all these changes just as they themselves considered them to be immediately right.  The nearest thing that we can do to meet that situation is, I think, to do what we are doing.  It is a beginning anyhow, to see whether any special organisation can be developed which will co-ordinate the various activities in these areas so that a common definite purpose is aimed at.</P>
    <P>I think, by means of that division into sections, I have covered the ground on the whole.  If someone were to ask me to go into details, I would say, in regard to the agricultural side, that as far as we are concerned, we will try to do everything we can to develop the growing here <Col N="2016" /> of all crops which are necessary for both man and beast, so that in a time of crisis we may not be short. In regard to sugar production and all those things which go to make the country self-sufficient and self-supporting, that policy will be followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember as much about the Shannon scheme as the Deputy.  We had been sold, so to speak, the Liffey scheme long before that.  The reason for the Liffey scheme was because there was an immediate demand, and it was a smaller beginning.  We felt that if that were done it should be done by Irish engineers&mdash;if foreigners had to be brought in it would be a small scheme &mdash;and that further developments could be continued later.  It was a question of developing water-power.  I am talking now for myself.  I do not know what views were expressed by other people.  It is a long time ago.  But I do know that, as far as we were concerned, our aim was to develop the Liffey as being the best way to begin. I am speaking for myself, but that was the view of some of us who were interested, particularly in developing the Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is next the big problem of emigration.  The figures that I have from the statistical Department have not been re-checked as they should, but they are really very disquieting and have been progressively increasing over the years.  If serious action is not taken the result will be the complete impoverishment of our country through <Col N="2017" /> the departure of our people.  I was in England recently, and heard there appalling stories about the conditions under which some of the workers who go from this country are living.  I am trying to get some verification of the statements made to me, but they are appalling, and it is a very sad thing indeed to think that our people who leave this country and go to other countries live in conditions in which nobody would dream for a moment of permitting them to live here.  If some of our workers who are living abroad were living in such conditions here, there would practically be an internal revolution.  Nobody would stand for it at all.  We want to try to develop employment in various directions and we would ask the help of other people in an effort to see that, even if there is not perfection, we will at least have the best we can.</P>

The important thing is to get employment and what I have been appealing for is that, when reasonable efforts are being made to provide employment and fair conditions, perfection is not asked for immediately and that people will remember that, in doing these things, they are driving people to conditions which are many times worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration then is a fundamental question and the one cure for it, I am quite willing to admit, must be the provision of employment.  The former Parliamentary Secretary has said&mdash; and I am not in a position to gainsay what he says&mdash;that there was employment available during recent years. The trouble is whether it is available in the right places.  It is not always enough to have employment available somewhere&mdash;it requires to be in a particular place.  There are certain conditions in connection with it, and it is, of course, one of our terrible modern problems.  Deputy McGilligan used to quote extracts, without quoting my speech, from statements I made in the past about emigration and migration. I said, speaking in the past, that it was one of the unfortunate things that we had the temptation to people in the country to go into the towns.  It is <Col N="2019" /> very difficult to get rid of that tendency. The only way I can see or anybody can see is by trying to bring about an improvement in rural conditions.</P>
    <P>One of the efforts towards improving rural conditions was the provision of electric power and of some of the amenities of the city for the rural areas, but, with the present shortage of building materials, it is not possible to do some of the things one would like to do.  One of the things we did hope to do was to encourage in various ways&mdash;again, only supplementing where it was necessary&mdash;the provision of village halls in an effort to give the country areas some of the amenities which attract them to the cities. Another thing we tried to do was to develop the smaller cities.  We are becoming top-heavy in this country by reason of the capital&mdash;it is a case of much will have more&mdash;attracting more and more people.  If you wish to establish an industry, you find that all those connected with it will want to come into the neighbourhood of the city, because they think they have a local market and that transport and other costs are less, so that there is great difficulty in inducing those who are about to start industries to go out from the city.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the Minister for Social Welfare that we should try decentralising even some of the Government Departments, to try to get down to some of the other cities and not have them all here.  There are certain headquarters staffs which you may have to have here, but, in the case of the divisional staffs, it ought to be possible to accommodate them elsewhere. It cannot be done overnight, but it is a question of having a definite policy and pursuing it over a long period.  I believe that the former Minister for Health, who is now Minister for Health again, Dr. Ryan, did agree when he was examining this matter that we could put a considerable portion of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare in some of the other cities.  I was speaking to him recently about it and the difficulties&mdash;there were always difficulties &mdash; appear to <Col N="2020" /> have been somewhat added to.  Another way would be to try to push new industries into cities like Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny, Sligo or Galway.  These would be ways of trying to keep people nearer to the land, of preventing them all crowding into the cities and keeping them as far as possible on the soil.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to make this type of speech but I hope it will give an indication to Deputy Corish and others of the general line on which we will try to proceed.  The particular steps being taken from time to time will appear in legislation or administrative action. If the Deputy looks at the 17 points he mentioned, he will see that they are only specific details, all coming under the general heading.</P>
    <P>I might also talk about our attitude towards capital development and so on.  The principal difficulty in that respect, of course, is the fact that the savings of the community are not sufficient of themselves to meet the capital development which is necessary, or could be envisaged as desirable. In this case, we have to move with caution.  If we disinvest foreign investments, we have to see that they do not put us in a position in which ultimately we will find ourselves without the necessary resources and will be compelled absolutely to deal with whatever savings there are, and work on them alone, so that these resources, our foreign investments, in being invested here must be invested with care.  It is not sufficient to have what I might call non-financial results. For instance, a man who is living on an ordinary farm or an ordinary estate could spend too much on improving the amenities there.  If he intends to invest money in it, he must see that the investment will be productive, in the sense of providing him with an income.  He could, of course, spend some of his income in improving the simple amenities on his farm.  Some of these things may be essential, as in the case of providing a house or taking care of his health.  These things are so fundamental that they would be regarded as necessities.</P>
    <P>A private individual who has an income may say to himself that he must <Col N="2021" /> look after his income, but at the same time he must not allow his health to deteriorate.  If by proper use of some of his income he could improve his health or save himself from some illness, obviously it would be his duty to use some of his income in that way. Again, if he wanted a reasonable dwelling to shelter himself properly, he would have to use some of his capital resources to do that.  These things are justifiable, provided that in such cases a man had some regard to the money he was spending and its relationship to the things he required.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if a man intends to give up some of his previous investments&mdash;to disinvest, as it were&mdash;he should see that the income produced will enable him to continue permanently&mdash;and not merely for a year or a few years&mdash;in that state of comfort to which he was accustomed formerly. These are common-sense things which do not require much discussion at all.</P>
    <P>We felt that the policy of the previous Government had not sufficient regard to the speed at which they were diminishing the external assets, which were income-producing.  We felt they were not alive to the fact that the savings of the community were not nearly sufficient to meet the rate of expenditure on which they were engaged.  I do not think I should keep the House, other than in making this general survey; but I hope I have said sufficient to indicate to some extent the general aims of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government giving a lead?  The problem of Partition has been before this country for a good many years.  Our policy had been at the start not to accept certain things which other people accepted and which made difficulties.  We had been proceeding <Col N="2022" /> on the line that by exposing injustices and by exposing what was wrong, making those things known generally, we would gradually bring about a change in that situation.  We agreed with the previous Government that the first thing necessary was to make the facts of Partition as widely known as possible.  That has been common ground.</P>
      <P>All that can be done by any Government which is honest about Partition is to use any circumstances that come their way, having the object of ending it in mind and sincerely intending to use to the best advantage any circumstances which may come their way to try and end it.  I could not have told here at any time, for example, that the ports were going to come back, but I did have at the back of my mind that any situation which arose that would enable us to get those ports back should be availed of by us to do so. Circumstances may come our way again &mdash;we cannot create them, we can only avail of them&mdash;which we may be able to utilise towards ending Partition.</P>
      <P>We know that, in regard to Partition, the nation's aim and right is only a just one.  I have not taken the view that we will force it by military action, forcing the people in the North to come in, or that we were likely to cajole them either.  I felt that the proper way, in dealing with our minority, was to say to them: &ldquo;You are entitled to the fullest rights, you are entitled to justice, but not to any more; and also, the people you are dealing with harshly are entitled to justice, just as much as you are.&rdquo;  As far as we are concerned, the basis of our policy on this point would be to utilise any circumstances that came our way to let these people realise that we were going to be fair as regards any political differences that might be there.  We pointed out this in the past and I do not think there was any change in the recent Government in regard to pointing out on what lines a practical solution, a just solution, could be arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have indicated more than once that, if the powers which the British Government are unjustly holding from this country were transferred here to an Irish Parliament and there were proper safeguards for the minority who <Col N="2023" /> would be under a local Parliament in the Six Counties, that local Parliament would be permitted to continue with the powers they have at present. Apparently there has been no move towards acceptance of any situation of that kind.  Remember, in regard to that, I have always said that that was more than just&mdash;at least, that it was almost unfair to the majorities that existed in places like Derry City, Fermanagh, Tyrone, South Armagh, South Down and so on.  If there were a question of dividing this country in accordance with political opinions, it would mean that those areas that formed a continuous area where there was a majority against Partition would have to be cut away from the rest&mdash;and the area left over would not be much more than a little over two countie.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised by some Northern papers on account of a statement which I made recently.  These papers said I had made a selection out of the Six Counties when I referred to Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, South Down and South Armagh.  They forget altogether that they made a selection out of the whole of Ireland.  Surely, if they were entitled to make a selection out of the whole of Ireland, I would be much better entitled to make a selection out of the area they were cutting off?  If there were to be any cutting off on the basis of local opinion, that area would probably embrace less than one half of the area which is cut off at present.</P>
    <P>If this problem were being started anew and if one were confronted with the statement: &ldquo;Here is a continuous area in which there are people who hold very firmly to political opinions different from those which are held by the majority of the people and they are entitled to have a Government of their own,&rdquo; you would say: &ldquo;Very well, let us examine this problem and see its extent.&rdquo;  If you proceeded in that way and had a local plebiscite, there is no doubt whatever you would only get a small area, something about 30 miles around Belfast which would be entitled to separate itself, if one were to admit that basis.  Whether that basis would <Col N="2024" /> be accepted by any nation is another matter.  I do not think that any nation would accept that as a basis, but it might be considered a reasonable and just basis for giving it a local Parliament, so that the local Parliament should not extend, if you were tackling it anew, beyond that restricted area I have mentioned, an area of about 30 miles around Belfast.  You could see that point of view of getting the greatest possible agreement.  You could cut off that area and give them a local Parliament with full powers that would not be inconsistent with the natural unity of the country as a single State.  But as we are not tackling the problem as a new one, and as a larger area has been cut off and as a certain time, unfortunately, produces certain results, we have said that we would be willing that the present boundaries should remain, provided that those who are within these areas should have guaranteed to them the full rights and equalities of citizenship.  These rights we know are denied in many cases. There is a positive effort being made to try to prevent places like Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh from having their rights retained.  If houses become vacant, an effort has been made to prevent these houses being given to those who stand for the unity of the country.  Methods of that sort are, from the point of view of ordinary civil liberties, to say the least of it, scandalous.</P>
    <P>If I am asked: &ldquo;Have you a solution for it?&rdquo; in the sense: &ldquo;Is there a line of policy which you propose to pursue, which you think can, within a reasonable time, be effective?&rdquo; I have to say that I have not and neither has anybody else.  All I can do is choose the methods which seem most likely to produce the best results.</P>

      <P>It is not we who have been depending on that so much. It is not we who have been talking about that too much.  We do expect and hope to get the help which was very valuable to us in bitter times in the past from our people abroad.  We do hope to get support from the people in the United States.  They have been <Col N="2025" /> working to try and make that support as effective as possible.  We do hope to get support from our people who are in Australia, New Zealand and in other parts of the States of the British Commonwealth.  They have been sympathetic.  If you want to bring the facts to the notice of the public, you will naturally go in the first instance to the people who are likely to be receptive and who do not start out with a feeling of hostility to you and who are not suspicious of you.  We have been trying to bring the facts of Partition to the notice of the world and in these countries we have been trying to get those people to help us to the fullest extent they can.  But to what extent they can, I am not prepared to make any statement.  I know they will do the best they can, but whether that will be effective or not I cannot say.  I do say that in general we ought to let the people in the North know what the truth of our attitude is.  If it were possible to convince them, then our problem was solved.  If it were possible, the most satisfactory way of going about this problem would be to try to win to our side the people who are opposed to us at present. What are the chances of success in that direction?  We certainly ought to do that to the extent it is possible. About one-third of the people in that area are our supporters and want to have the unity of the country.  What you have really to win over is, therefore, the difference between one-third and one-half, that is, one-sixth.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have rubbed both ways.  We are able to deal with each occasion as it demands.  I was about to say that I had met previous British Governments and although I had very little time, I can assure the House that the subject which occupied most of the time in any conversation I had with any British Ministers was this question of Partition.  I believe it affects fundamentally the relations between the people of this country and Britain.  I believe these relations are of wider importance than the well-being of the people of the two islands and it is on that basis I have tried to work.  I think that is a fundamental truth.  It is not pretence.  I think it can be proved to be true to anybody who looks into the question.  We have tried to make it appear and have it recognised that it was not merely an Irish interest and our first and foremost interest but that it was also a British interest to deal with this matter.  It is particularly of <Col N="2027" /> interest to us in this country and our friends in the North.  No matter how the world goes, these people and ourselves are going to live on one island here.  We have been one for many centuries and we are going to remain one unless there is some terrestrial cataclysm that we need not make any calculations on.</P>
      <P>We will have some more, no doubt, about the question of Partition.  Unlike Deputy MacBride I am not going to promise, and I cannot promise in truth, that this will be solved within six months or two years or any specified time.  I do not want to pretend that the solution is around the corner, but I do say that we will proceed with the same tenacity of purpose in that regard as we have with regard to many other things.  I do hope that we will be favoured with good fortune in that particular matter, and that our efforts, as they are inspired by feelings of fair play and justice, will be successful, but I cannot say any more. I do not want to pretend to this House that I can say any more.</P>
      <P>With regard to force, which has been mentioned a few times, we had to deal with that problem back in 1921. We had to deal with it specifically when the question of negotiations began.  At that time we definitely said that force as a solution of that problem was not contemplated by us. We said that in the fundamental conviction, first of all, that if it were successful it would not give the ultimate results at which we were aiming, and secondly, that it was not even likely to be successful.  From these two points of view, therefore, we were satisfied that the best national policy was to say at once that force as a solution was not contemplated, so that when we made that definite statement the suspicions of various kinds which were sought to be aroused might be allayed, and that the ground might be made somewhat more favourable for other methods by which we hoped to make some progress towards a solution.</P>

      <P>I think that <Col N="2029" /> Deputies have every reason to complain of the procedure which has been adopted by the Taoiseach in introducing this Estimate.  It must be a cause of great disappointment and some embarrassment that he has not followed the practice which I initiated last year and of which he approved last year and of which he indicated his approval again this year.  Instead of that, instead of having a survey of the economic conditions of the country, instead of giving some account from the statistical material available to him from his own Department of the progress or lack of progress in the various sectors of our economic life, he has treated the House for over an hour to a somewhat discursive speech which contained nothing but vague general propositions of a very superficial character and which was obviously made extempore.</P>
      <P>The procedure adopted by him is rendered all the more embarrassing for the reason that the Government have decided that the two very important motions which are on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Seán MacBride have to be discussed as part of the discussion on the Estimate.  The Taoiseach has sat down without giving us the slightest indication, other than saying that there will be no free vote on those motions, as to what the attitude of the Government is to be towards those motions.  We do not know yet in what respect the Government is going to prevent a free vote; we do not know whether it is going to allow these representatives from the North to get the right of audience in this House and in the Seanad; we do not know whether or not the attitude of the Government will be to prevent them coming in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out, when I was interrupted rudely by a new Deputy in this House, that we do not yet know what the attitude of the Government is on these two motions.  Speaking first as is my duty on this Estimate it will fall to me to indicate my attitude on these two motions without having yet heard the Government's attitude or the reasons for that attitude or without even having heard the reasons which impelled Deputy MacBride to put down those motions or the arguments on which he bases those motions and commends them to the House.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has justified the attitude he has adopted first of all of not giving any indication of general policy but a vague discursive disquisition on general problems passing as Government policy by relying on the fact that they have not been sufficiently long in Government to formulate a Government policy.  Surely they knew what their policy would be when they formed a Government.  Surely during the last few weeks they should have been able to formulate not details but the broad general aspects of a Government policy and it is these broad general aspects of Government policy which particularly and practically solely fall to be discussed on this Estimate.  This Estimate as Deputies know gives an opportunity to the House to discuss not details of Estimates, not details of departmental policy, but general Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House was entitled to be told by the Taoiseach to-day what is general Government policy.  We listened for over an hour to these vague general propositions.  With the exception of the very short remarks he made on the policy of the last Government in reference to capital expenditure, there is very little in those general propositions with which the whole of us could not agree.  Listening to that speech and listening to the tone of that speech, one would have thought there were no differences between the various sections of this <Col N="2031" /> House on Government policy on a vast variety of matters.  It is well-known that there is a wide cleavage between what we believe or think to be general Government policy and the policy that is advocated by those of us on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>When I was introducing this Estimate last year I understood that the practice that I was initiating&mdash;and of which Deputy de Valera, as he then was, speaking from these benches, approved and indicated to-day his intention of following&mdash;was to give to the country an objective survey of the results of Government policy during the previous 12 months.  The Taoiseach has in his Department, attached to his office, the Director of Statistics and his staff.  It would not have been necessary even to indicate in the course of his remarks to this House what was the general policy of the present Government, but he could have given that objective survey which I gave last year, based upon facts and on statistics supplied to me by the Statistics Branch of the Taoiseach's Department and by the officials of the Department of Finance.  We were entitled to have that survey.  It could have and would have been useful to Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>Had it been possible to do so, I have no doubt that that survey would have been given to this House for the purpose of demonstrating to this House that the policy pursued by our Government from July of last year until June of this year was proved to be a failure. We would have been prepared to face up to that position had the facts justified it but at least we were entitled to know, with the materials almost exclusively available to the Taoiseach from the Statistics Branch of his office, what had been the effect of the Government's policy during the past ten or 11 months.  That could have been given objectively from the material provided by an independent officer, the Director of Statistics, a person who has been given by the unanimous consent of this House, I may say, a position of independence and responsibility in order that the House and every Deputy in the House and every person in the <Col N="2032" /> country may be furnished with statistics which will be reliable, praiseworthy and produced from a competent source.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach was not in a position to give us a general survey of the proposed Government policy, other than the discursive disquisition we listened to for an hour to-day, at least he certainly could have fulfilled his duty as head of a Department and given to this House some indication of the working of the Statistics Office of his Department during the past 12 months.  That would have been useful and valuable information because it is only by reference to statistics that we are able to judge and evaluate Government policy in action.  I am entitled to draw the conclusion, from the failure of the Taoiseach to give that information to this House&mdash;information which was available to him from his own Department and which could have been supplemented by the expert financiers in the Department of Finance and checked and counter-checked by them &mdash;that the results of those statistics would have been to justify the last Government's policy in action during the 11 months' period from July of last year to June of this year.  We are entitled to draw that conclusion.</P>

      <P>If I would be wrong, the Taoiseach had an opportunity of demonstrating on this occasion that we were wrong.  I am entitled to draw the inference&mdash;as I believe it will be drawn throughout the country&mdash;that that information was available.  It was given by me objectively last year in the course of a survey I made of the economic position of the country, apart from the indications I gave of the then Government's policy.  It was available to the Taoiseach and it could have been given.  I have no doubt that if it had demonstrated some of the things which he and his Ministers have been saying about our policy during the past few months and even over the years when we were in office, that information would have been available and stated by the Taoiseach to-day.  We are, therefore, justified in concluding that that policy which we carried into <Col N="2033" /> effect in the three years we were in office was a policy which had brought success and prosperity to every section of the people.</P>
      <P>I demonstrated last year by statistics that the result of the policy which was in operation during two and a half years was to bring to every section of our people an increased standard of living, increased agricultural production, more employment than ever before in industry, more employment in rural Ireland than ever before to the point where there was practically full-scale and full employment in rural Ireland.  The national income had greatly increased.  The figures given by me at that time of the national income were estimated figures, but they were proved to be accurate and even to be an understatement of the figures of national income that were produced subsequently by the Director of Statistics. I assert to-day that the policy pursued by the last Government was fully justified in its results and that the only way in which any Government policy can really be tested is by reference to the objective, responsible and independent office of the Director of Statistics which is attached to the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment upon remarks that were made during the course of the last 12 months upon the work of that section of the Taoiseach's Department, the Office of the Director of Statistics.  I do so because I feel that it is the merest justice to those responsible officials who man the Statistics Department of the Taoiseach's office, that they should be justified in this House in the face of the irresponsible and ill-informed criticism that was made upon them and upon their office and work by certain Deputies of this House and by certain other influential parties throughout the country.  Ill-informed, irresponsible and unfounded criticism was directed against the Director and his staff in reference to the compilation of the cost-of-living index figure.  I want to put myself on record as having supreme confidence in the complete responsibility and independence of the officials, from the Director down to the <Col N="2034" /> lowest official in that Department, in the compilation of all official statistics.</P>
    <P>The figures were called a farce. Deputies, I suppose, who used that expression in this House hardly realised the implication of what they were saying.  Certainly they demonstrated that they did not know what they were talking about.  I think it is only right that I, on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the House, should pay the tribute which is due in justice to the Director and his staff in reference to their compilation of official statistics, and above all to their independence in doing so, and give the lie to that irresponsible and ill-informed and ignorant criticism that was so rife and rampant in the months before Christmas last year.</P>
    <P>We have had no indication from the Taoiseach as to what the activities of the statistics branch of his Department were during the past 12 months. Accordingly, I pass from that.  In the course of the remarks made during the Taoiseach's speech, the only thing I could pick out as being any criticism by him or by his Government upon the policy pursued by my colleagues and myself in the last Administration was a reference to the policy of productive capital expenditure which we initiated and carried through with supreme success in the short time we had while in office.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to address my remarks to-day mainly towards justification of that policy and to demonstrating the real nature and the fundamental character of that policy, a policy which has been so frequently misrepresented and so frequently distorted by members of the present Government when they were in opposition and by them to-day as Ministers of the Government since they came into office. Before I go into that aspect I shall have to examine in some detail the circumstances surrounding the whole matter, because the country is being deluded as to the character of that policy and as to the approach we made in the implementation of that policy by the suggestions that have been so frequently made in the past and were <Col N="2035" /> repeated here last night by the Minister for Finance and hinted at to-day by the Taoiseach that we, in devising and framing our policy and carrying it into effect, were unmindful of the dangers attendant upon it.</P>
    <P>I want to show here and to demonstrate to the House and, through the House, to the people the falsity of the criticisms that have been levelled against that policy and I want to give some indication to the people of the real character of that policy and the fruitful results that were accruing and would still further have accrued from it had we remained in office.  During the course of the general election campaign I endeavoured in speech after speech to prise forth from any of the then Opposition speakers what their attitude was in reference to our policy of productive capital expenditure.  I failed to find out what it was.  Up to the present moment notwithstanding the speech made by the Minister for Finance last night and taking into account the very short references made to-day by the Taoiseach and his implied criticisms of that policy, I still have no idea what the attitude of the present Government is in relation to our policy of productive capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>We were told to-day by the Taoiseach that he objected to that policy because we did not have sufficient regard to the speed at which we were spending our external assets or to the fact that savings were not sufficient to finance the projects comprised within our policy of productive capital expenditure.  The Minister for Finance last night referred to what he called &ldquo;the rapid dissipation of our external assets&rdquo;, and he purported to give what he described as the truth at long last about the last discreditable three years.  If it is discreditable in a period of three years, and three years is a very short period indeed within which a policy had to be initiated, devised and carried into execution in very difficult times, and in a period of great international stress and financial and economic dislocation throughout the world, to do what we did, and if it be discreditable that we are able to point out at <Col N="2036" /> the end of that short period that there was no unemployment in rural Ireland, that the national income had increased to a level it had never reached before, that our agricultural exports had doubled and our industrial exports quadrupled, while at the same time we were able to put into operation a hospitalisation programme, social services and increased old age pensions, and all without increasing taxation, if it be discreditable, then I take great credit in being discreditable.</P>
    <P>I think it is gravely wrong that a Minister for State, and particularly a Minister for Finance, in a speech such as that made by the Minister last night, and without any reasons stated and without giving any adequate examination or any adequate facts or arguments on which to base his conclusions, should suggest to the country that the Minister for Finance in the last Government was so unmindful of his duties as to neglect the advices he got from competent Finance officials that he was heading the country towards financial ruin and disaster. That action of the present Minister for Finance is one that must be gravely deprecated as being contrary to the best national interests of the country.</P>
    <P>In considering this Estimate it would have been our duty, had we been able to do so or had we been given any facts on which to base a considered opinion, to ascertain if there were any fundamental principles underlying and directing general Government policy and thereby informing and guiding departmental policy.  The Taoiseach said to-day that had he done what he was asked to do by Deputy Corish he would have been merely repeating what should have been stated by his colleagues in the Government when speaking upon their various departmental Estimates.  That statement alone demonstrates the fact that the Taoiseach does not understand the fundamental character of this debate whereunder we deal with general Government policy and not the details or particulars of departmental policy.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government we set out with certain principles to guide <Col N="2037" /> us.  The first of those was that we should take every possible advantage of every moment of peace, uneasy though it was, in order to build up our national economy, to strengthen and develop our resources and to create conditions in this country where emigration and unemployment would be stopped and stopped forever.  We felt that we should not allow ourselves to be frustrated; we felt our efforts were not to be frustrated by the fact that the international situation was menacing and the financial position here was weak.  We felt the best way of building up the country or defending the country against possible disaster from international friction and disturbance was to build up our economic and financial structure, to strengthen it and thereby provide a real defence against attack or disaster accruing from the menacing international situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to know now if that policy will be pursued by the present Government during the period in which they remain in office, be it short or be it long.  I urge the Government to take advantage of every moment of peace to build up our financial and economic strength.  We set ourselves the headline&mdash;and I think we followed the headline&mdash;that we should not allow political considerations to impinge upon our economic problems.  I have a suspicion, more than a suspicion, that political considerations are impregnating all the thought and all the considerations that the Government is giving or will give to the very serious and difficult financial, economic and social problems that confront them in the framing of their policy.  In framing any Government policy, any Government can only avoid the traps and pitfalls set by the impact of these political considerations by remembering always the basic principle that Government is the trustee for all sections of the people and that, unless the general international interest requires it, and urgently requires it, no particular section of the community should be allowed to take an undue advantage at the expense of any other section.</P>
    <P>Political considerations have forced <Col N="2038" /> this Government to-day to break that very fundamental and basic rule. There is a long queue of interests clamantly demanding from the Government, as they demanded from us, considerations at the expense of the taxpayer. Farmers, or any section of the farming community, who demand that their claims, just though they may be thought to be, should be given priority over other sections of the community, whether it is the poor or the worker in the towns and cities, should remember that queue and before they get their demands satisfied they should pause and consider the injustice that is being done, or that may be done, by putting other sections of the community out of their proper place in that queue.</P>
    <P>We had&mdash;and I am sure the present Government will have&mdash;to face another very grave difficulty, the difficulty of reconciling what seemed almost irreconcilable. I think Deputy Dillon in a speech made recently in this House drew attention to that very great difficulty of the reconciliation of different interests.  You have the industrial interests in active conflict, at least with the agricultural interests; you have the pull and tug between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture.  You have the conflict between town and country, the conflict between the consumer and the producer; the conflict between all sections of the people and the just rights of the taxpayer.  You have as an example of that problem, to which general Government policy must be directed, the question as to whether the raw materials of agriculture should be taxed or whether it is better policy to try to reduce the cost of production for our farmers rather than to give the benefit of tariffs and quotas to fertiliser rings or to people who want to set up industries here which will have the effect of increasing the cost of raw materials for the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>These are matters on which we should get some enlightenment from the Government.  As an instance of the difficulty of reconciling the number of conflicting interests of various sections of the community, we had the <Col N="2039" /> question of hides and the price of hides.  On the one hand it is clear that the producers of hides were suffering an injustice from not getting the world market price but the Department of Industry and Commerce put up the case, and very properly put up the case, that if the farmers got a just price for their hides, then the price of boots and shoes would go up for the working sections of the community in the cities and towns.  I want to know if the Government have given any consideration to matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>The really fundamental principle underlying all the policy of the last Government was large-scale productive capital investment by the State. That was criticised over the period since it came into operation, by members of the present Government and their followers, when they were over here on these benches.  It was criticised last night by the Minister for Finance and to-day by the Taoiseach. The significant feature of all these criticisms is that they are merely destructive.  They overlook the tangible results that were obtained by the operation of that policy for every section of our people.  They criticise it without giving any reasons for their criticism.  If there is anything wrong with the policy, if there are any items included in the capital programme which was devised and put into operation by us, then let us be told what these items are, the objections that are taken to them, the nature of these objections, and let us have them examined by argument and by reason so that a just conclusion can be come to on the facts and the arguments.  I do, however, object, and I am entitled strongly to object, to the ill-informed and vague criticisms that have been made by the Minister for Finance and some of his colleagues in the present Government without giving us, in the first place, any indication of what items of that capital programme they object to or without saying where we should call a halt or why we should call a halt to any particular item.</P>
    <P>We have had a reference by the Minister for Finance to what he calls the discreditable period of the last <Col N="2040" /> three years.  Let him tell us why it was discreditable, why and where this capital development is wrong, and then we shall deal with and answer those charges.  We set out with a full realisation of the problem we had to solve. Emigration, unemployment and underemployment of our men, the nondevelopment and under-development of our natural resources were endemic in this country for many years.  This country suffered from the lack of full employment for our men and of our material resources.  We set out, as a Government, to see that whatever could be done would be done to provide more employment and opportunities for stopping emigration, to increase the standard of living of our people and, above all, to bring about the productive use of our resources in men and materials.  Having studied the problem, we believed we found a solution.  The Minister for Finance said or purported to say last night that much of the expenditure included in Deputy McGilligan's capital Budget could not be relied upon to add in any material degree to the income of the nation.  That is a mere statement without proof.  It is a mere statement without any advertence to the fact that the results of the policy of productive capital investment, and the development of the resources of the State, cannot be obtained in a month, a year or even in two or three years.  The work done by Deputy Dillon will inure to posterity for centuries to come.  The fields that he caused to be fertilised, the stock that he caused to be improved and the schemes for the development of agriculture that he initiated were only beginning and the test and the results of that policy, even within a few short months or a few short years, have demonstrated, not the ill-success of the policy but the falsity of the arguments upon which the criticism of that policy is based.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach to-day said that the general Government policy was to encourage private enterprise and to supplement it, where necessary, by State activity.  That was our policy. He could have stated that policy and taken it, as it was taken, from speeches that I have made and that several of <Col N="2041" /> my colleagues have made.  That was our policy&mdash;State investment supplementing private investment, private investment based as far as possible on the development of our resources: but we felt that it was not possible to develop our resources or to increase the standard of living for our people, unless private investment and private savings were supplemented to a very considerable degree by State expenditure.</P>
    <P>Can we have agreement on that principle, because that was the principle on which we based our capital expenditure policy?  We set out to achieve and secure a more buoyant expanding national income, and the achievement of that expanding national income, which was well on its way when we left office, would have secured an automatic increase in the revenue of the State, in the annual money available for the housekeeping expenditure of the State and even in capital expenditure. It would also have done far more; it would have gone a long way towards increasing the standard of living of our people and solving the problems of emigration and unemployment that menaced us.  We knew that the task that we had to fulfil was to increase that national income.  The way we increased it was by the projects which we initiated and were carrying on when we left office, and which were included in the capital Budget that was put before the House and the country in two successive Budgets by Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance.  Every relevant factor was stated by him, and by us all, to enable the country to judge as to what we were doing.</P>
    <P>We exercised the <i>urbe me fides</i> with our people, and we were justified as a Government by the people themselves last year when got the biggest loan subscribed to here in this State by the people of this country since the inception of the State in 1922.  The Minister for Finance now must needs state that a discreditable period of financial malpractice was carried on by Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Finance, and by his colleagues who supported him in the inter-Party Government.  What are the facts that can justify a remark of that kind, which does not damage us because the <Col N="2042" /> people know what the value of our policy has been to them, but which does damage to the people of the country?  It demonstrates a fact, or it seems to me at all events to justify a suspicion to which I referred earlier in my remarks, that Government policy is largely actuated by political consideration, and that there is merely an endeavour to show the people that the general Government policy of the present Government is somehow, and in some way, different from that which was carried on by the last Government.</P>
    <P>We knew that, in order to increase the national income and to secure greater buoyancy in the national income it was necessary, in the first place and above all things, to secure greater productivity.  Day in and day out in this House and outside it, we expounded general Government policy, and when I or my colleagues were speaking of it, we emphasised, in the first place, the absolute necessity for increased production, particularly agricultural and industrial production. Every effort was made and every help given to the agricultural community and to those engaged in industry to achieve that greater production.  We bent our energies, our policies and our actions towards securing increased productivity and a greater export trade, not for the purpose of the home market alone.  Our eyes were not bounded, in devising our policy, by looking for its results in the future merely in the home market; we looked to a greatly increased export trade, because we knew that unless there was increased productivity, particularly in agriculture, that unless agriculture was organised so as to create a surplus for export, it would be impossible to increase the national income, to stop emigration, to give employment and, above all things, to rectify the depreciation in the adverse balance of trade between this country and the people abroad from whom we purchase.</P>
    <P>We knew that productivity was necessary and that an export trade was necessary.  We knew that the only way to secure that increased productivity and that increased export trade was by the initiation of those various schemes of capital expenditure financed, as far <Col N="2043" /> as possible, from the savings of our people.  We emphasised again and again the necessity for saving.  You would think, from the speech of the Minister for Finance last night, that he had just discovered the real solution for all our economic ills, for all the distress and misery caused by all the malpractices of Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, and the last Government when they were increasing employment, increasing production, aiding industry and agriculture, increasing the national income.  You would think he had found the real solution when he appealed for savings and laid down a series of propositions and asked general consent for them.  He took those from our policy.  Those general propositions, in so far as they are tenable, were taken direct from the policy of the inter-Party Government and were the foundation for our policy of capital expenditure, productive capital investment of the savings of the people in their own country and for their own people.</P>
    <P>We knew that it was necessary to have those savings, that it was necessary in a period when inflation was threatening&mdash;and when, may I say, in parentheses, inflation never really overtook us all during a period of at least two and a half years while we were in office&mdash;that there should be savings.  We believed that our people should be encouraged in habits of thrift, that those savings were necessary in order that our people should get out of the habit of dissipating them in what are known in economics as consumer goods.  We appealed for those savings last year, and when introducing the Budget Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, again made an appeal for those savings and spoke about the necessity for them.  Now it would appear from last night's speech that the present Minister for Finance is the only person who ever thought of it.</P>
    <P>At column 1884 of the Dáil Debates of 2nd May, 1951, Volume 125, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Making all allowance for the <Col N="2044" /> exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious.  We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.  Additional saving would ease the congestion that now exists and causes consumer demand to seek an outlet in imports.  It would relieve the pressure on the balance of payments and help to confine external disinvestment&mdash;or surplus imports&mdash;to what is needed for home development or stockpiling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on in his speech, at column 1906 of the same Volume of Dail Debates, he again referred to the necessity for savings, and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I must, therefore, sound again the note struck at the beginning of my speech by emphasising the critical importance at the present time of increased savings.  They are essential for national development on lines on which there is a general agreement.  No one interested in the improvement of our social and economic conditions would suggest that the State capital programme should be abandoned.  While some may advocate curtailment, many will share the view that it should be pressed forward with all possible speed because of the uncertainties of the future.  To make room for State spending on the present scale, however, the public must be prepared to abstain to a greater extent from spending.  Over-spending by the nation as a whole could only increase the rate of external disinvestment for unproductive purposes.  In other countries where private savings are deficient, it is necessary to impose taxes to make up for the saving that the public ought to do.  I feel that we are not yet constrained to adopt this expedient.  It is preferable that means of stimulating voluntary savings should first be fully tried.  The Government have, therefore, decided to organise an intensive campaign to promote savings, especially amongst <Col N="2045" /> those of the younger generation who have not yet been properly initiated in the habit of thrift.  It is hoped to enlist the support and enthusiasm of educational bodies, trade unions and other voluntary organisations in this campaign.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was an indication of Government policy in reference to this capital expenditure and the necessity for saving and the utilisation of savings. We were about to initiate an intensive campaign and ask the assistance of trade unions and organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Farmers' Clubs, the Countrywomen's Association and other bodies of that kind to weigh in behind that campaign for thrift and savings.</P>
    <P>You would think from the Minister for Finance's speech last night that he was the only person who thought about savings for the first time when the present Government came into office. Not merely did we know and emphasise again and again the importance of saving, but we emphasised the importance of putting those savings into proper investments.  We emphasised the proper nature of these investments and the kind of investments that were proper to be adopted on sound economic principles if our programme of productive capital investment was to be a success.  We pointed out the dangers that were inherent in the programme and in the policy.  We directed attention to the fact that a very large amount of the moneys which we were expending and proposed to expend on the capital projects was to be devoted to housing and to the provision of schools, and we emphasised that in order to get proper returns for these capital moneys that we were expending, the nature of the investment should be such as either to give a direct productive return in the strict economic sense of the term or to give a return socially or on human improvement principles.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that we were spending and proposed to spend a large amount of money on housing. The Taoiseach referred this morning to his housing policy.  We are justifiably proud of our achievements in connection with housing.  We were building houses at the rate of 1,000 a month <Col N="2046" /> before we left office.  We said that no unreasonable financial considerations would hamper us in our determination to solve the housing problem throughout the length and breadth of the country within the shortest space of time.  We pointed out the danger of that policy because, judged by strict economic principles, judged by those principles of Victorian economics which apparently have impregnated the present Minister for Finance, that policy was an unsound policy; spending our resources and savings on houses was unsound.  We felt it was sound policy socially and we determined to proceed with it.</P>
    <P>The same thing applied to schools. We pointed out that while we were convinced of the necessity for spending the savings of our people and investing the moneys available from State sources on housing above all things, the very fact that there was no immediate productive return, although there would be a very sound return in the years to come in a social way and in the stability of the country and the comfort of the people, imposed on us the liability to see that every investment of the moneys which were necessary and which we employed in our schemes of capital development projects should be employed in projects which would produce productive returns in the strict economic sense of the term.  We knew, as I have said, that there were dangers inherent in all this and we pointed them out and kept them in our minds all the time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that he joined issue with us on our capital development programme because we did not have sufficient regard to the speed at which we were spending our sterling assets.  Again and again, in speeches to which I will refer, I directed attention to what was happening.  I directed attention to the fact that we regarded as implicit in the capital development programme the repatriation of such part of the sterling or external assets as was necessary to carry out that programme.  We knew well that this increased investment would lead to sterling disinvestment, but we knew also and I stated it and it will be <Col N="2047" /> found on the records of this House, in my opening speech on the Taoiseach's Estimate last year that there were occasions when it was proper finance, sound economics and good social policy to create a deficit or that disinvestment in our sterling assets for the purpose of financing schemes for the provision of houses for our people and for the development of our resources in order to end emigration, to remove poverty and secure employment for all sections of our people.</P>
    <P>We knew also of and directed attention to the danger deriving from an unsatisfactory disequilibrium in our balance of payments.  We knew, and I pointed out last year, that the mere repatriation of our external assets was no panacea for all our ills.  We knew that the problem of the balance of payments was one which required to be carefully watched and measures taken to bring about a proper balance between them.  In the circumstances with which we are faced&mdash;I make no apology to the House or to the Fianna Fáil Government or Party for this&mdash;we knew well that the national interest then required that there should be a conscious creation of a deficit in the balance of payments for the purpose of financing our capital schemes.</P>
    <P>I shall deal before I finish with the suggestions made by the Minister for Finance last night, and repeated to-day by the Taoiseach, that we were going too fast, that we did not know where we were going, that we did not realise that there were not enough savings from our people's resources to finance these schemes.  I will demonstrate from the speeches I made either in this House or throughout the country the principles upon which we acted all the time, and I want to put these speeches upon the records of this House so that they will be available for people who are interested in the truth of this matter and so that it can be seen how unjust, how false, how unsound are the arguments, or the alleged arguments, produced by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues and that were stated last night in the House on this matter by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We knew the dangers.  We directed <Col N="2048" /> attention to the dangers and we took measures to obviate those dangers. Right through every speech that I made expounding Government policy on this there will be seen a consistent line of principle and of warning of the dangers of the application of these principles and of full advertence to the problems that we had to solve, the difficulties that faced us and the real, proper methods that should be taken and were taken to solve these problems and which brought us a very large measure of success in the short time in which we were in office.</P>
    <P>I spoke at the Chamber of Commerce on 26th May, 1948, within a very few months of assuming office as Taoiseach and Head of the Government.  On that occasion I made these observations. Firstly, I said&mdash;I quote from the speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The two main long-term economic problems confronting this country are the necessity for greatly increased agricultural and industrial output and the rectification of the unhealthy condition of our balance of international payments.  The first of these problems is the more important. If we can solve it we will have gone a long way towards improving the balance of payments position as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, I said in my speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Inflationary tendencies can, to some extent, be counteracted by direct Government measures but by far the most effective instrument is in the hands of every citizen in the State&mdash;increased voluntary savings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quoted last year on this Estimate a further passage from that speech&mdash;at column 1807.  It bears repetition, even at the risk of boring Deputies because, as I say, I wish to have it on the records of the House so that there may be an answer to these spurious arguments and unjust suggestions that have been made by members of the Government, particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.  This is what I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have stressed the necessity for saving but having done so it is necessary <Col N="2049" /> to give equal emphasis to the necessity for productive investment of savings.  It will be generally agreed that this country has for many decades been suffering from chronic under-investment...  It can scarcely be questioned that our national income per head is far too low for a country so rich as ours which has the potential to be very much richer.  Unless national capital is increased, there is no hope for any real increase in the national income....  There is no reason why this country, which is comparatively under-developed, should be satisfied with a normal rate of increase in national income.  We should aim at a rate of increase much above the normal, and the Government is determined to use every effort to secure the acceptance of that which must be regarded as a fundamental truth of Irish economics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I made an observation in that speech which I did not quote last year but which I want to quote here and put upon the records of the House because it is very important and very relevant in view of what we anticipate may be, and probably will be, the policy of the Government in reference to this so-called discreditable financial condition in which they find themselves now&mdash;a policy of greatly increased taxation.  In reference to this matter, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government realises what too many are inclined to forget, that taxation is a very important factor in the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to pause and contemplate that proposition which is forgotten, and which, if forgotten by the present Minister for Finance, will have very grave results upon the initiative and enterprise of our people and the cost of living of our people.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some passages from the speech that I made at the Institute of Bankers in Ireland on 19th November, 1949.  There I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Public finance in the past has been mainly preoccupied with the annual Budget, although this covered no more than a fifth or a quarter of a country's economic activity.  To-day, <Col N="2050" /> however, it is generally recognised that to discharge fully its economic responsibilities the Government must budget not primarily to allocate a certain part of the nation's finances to public purposes, but must also ensure that the resources of the nation are utilised in the way which can best advance the interests of the community.  The community has to be considered not merely as taxpayers but as producers and consumers as well, and the level of national income may be regarded as the best indicator of economic progress.  The Government can best influence the community's prosperity by a sound budgetary policy and by investment.  As long ago as 1936, the late Lord Keynes declared &lsquo;that the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I went on to say about the then Government's view:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present Government regard it as the responsibility of the State to create economic conditions within which it will be possible to provide a high level of employment and regard it as the duty of the State so to arrange our economic affairs that no resources of land or labour which can be usefully employed should be allowed avoidably to remain idle.</P>
    <P>I have said before and I say again that the root cause of the low level of Irish national wealth and the incapacity of the Irish economy to absorb workers into employment has been due to the inadequacy of capital investment, particularly in agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, I proceeded to develop that point by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Only by large-scale investment can we increase the national wealth of the country or absorb the resources of land and labour which are at present idle.  Some of our capital investment will be capable directly of earning revenue.  Other kinds, such as housing, will bring social and economic benefits which cannot be measured directly in terms of money, but which are, at present, just as indispensable to the national wellbeing <Col N="2051" /> as directly revenue earning assets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I proceeded further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would scarcely be possible to finance such capital expenditure entirely from the current resources of the community.  The Government are satisfied, however, that the need for this investment is so great and the social and economic advantages it will bring so obvious that they are fully justified in drawing, in part, on past national savings to finance it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I proceeded to deal with the balance of payments:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A temporary disequilibrium in the balance of payments is inevitable according as repatriation of capital takes place.  There are greater evils, however, than a temporary deficit in the balance of payments.  This Government believe that impoverished and unnecessarily infertile land, lack of housing and shortage of hospital accommodation are far worse evils, evils which we are determined to extirpate, and which would even justify short-term economic loss for the sake of social and long-term economic gain.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure, however, that the deficit in the balance of payments is a reflection of increased capital investment at home rather than increased consumption.  It is also necessary that the new State investment must be in addition to and not in substitution for private investment which would have taken place anyway.  Indeed, the Government would prefer if as much as possible of the new investment were undertaken by private persons because it would be more likely to be productive of a proper economic balance.</P>
    <P>Some of the proposed capital investment will be directly revenue earning, such as telephone development. The test of its soundness will be whether it yields a return in revenue at least sufficient to service the loan charges.  Other forms of capital investment will yield revenue <Col N="2052" /> indirectly.  They will improve the level of employment and living standards at home.  They will increase the productivity of the land and so ensure a higher national income and a higher exportable surplus of agricultural produce in years to come, to compensate for the reduced income resulting from repatriation of part of the sterling assets.  Capital investment in housing is in a special category.  It will not directly earn revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While recognising the defects in our economy and sparing no effort to remedy them, we must, of course, beware of making a fetish of capital investment.  There is both good domestic investment and bad domestic investment justifiable neither by its economic return nor by its social fruits.  We must turn our faces sharply against anything that savours of the mere visionary.  Even foreign investment is better than bad domestic investment and certainly better than anything remotely approaching dissipative expenditure.  The more our social necessities compel us into forms of capital investment showing a social return alone, the more carefully must we select schemes which can survive vigorous financial examination. If we build houses which are a necessity, we must so augment agricultural and industrial productivity that the people who live in those houses have real incomes to maintain them.  We must tilt the balance on outlay in a genuinely productive direction.</P>
    <P>The more we invest, the more we must save.  If the evil of inflation and all its consequent waste, on the one hand, is to be avoided and an unnecessary deficit in the balance of payments, on the other, it is essential that savings be increased.  The degree of expansion possible is limited by the availability for expenditure of current savings and accumulated resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking at Clonmel Chamber of Commerce on the 24th April, 1950, I again developed the principles underlying <Col N="2053" /> this policy and directed attention to its dangers.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unlike many other countries, Ireland's economy has never been marked by recurring cycles of employment and unemployment.  The inherent defect has not been extreme fluctuations in economic activity, but rather what is technically called a tendency towards economic equilibrium at an unduly low level.  The result has been that a large part of Ireland's natural resources has remained undeveloped and that there has been altogether insufficient economic activity to provide employment for all the population.  Ireland's economic ills have, accordingly, been chronic.  For generations before the recent war, lack of work has compelled some of the most active and energetic Irish workers to emigrate. Others who remained at home lived an unproductive existence by unemployment assistance or by casual periods of work on unproductive employment or relief schemes.  There was a shortage of work because the capital resources of the country were not being used to create work.  In addition, particularly in agriculture, under-capitalised projects in private hands were not giving rewards commensurate with the effort employed on them.  Many attempts were made to apply patchwork treatment for these unhealthy symptoms, but most of the money spent was wasted because it was spent unproductively. The fundamental trouble was the failure to recognise that the basic defect in the country's economy was the absence of sufficient capital investment to ensure that the maximum of national resources in labour and land would be productively employed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The capital expenditure which is now proposed may be divided generally into two kinds.  Some of the expenditure will lead to the creation of additional productive capital assets for the community, which will add directly to national wealth.  The remainder of the expenditure is to be spent on what <Col N="2054" /> might be described as human improvement projects, these being assets which are unproductive in so far as they increase national wealth only indirectly, but which, when selected with wisdom and foresight, directly advance national welfare. Such expenditure, when prudently undertaken, can yield a return in greater productive powers of the community and in greater health and happiness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The aim of the two-Budget system is to expand economic activity nationally.  Rigid tests must be applied to ensure that the items included in the capital Budget are genuine assets of either a revenue earning character or are human improvement projects.  In no sense must the capital Budget be regarded as a device to disguise with respectability a deficit in the current Budget.  Any projects which fail to pass strict tests, projects which are neither productive of direct revenue nor add to the real welfare of the nation must, if they are to be undertaken at all, be charged against the current Budget and so paid for from taxation.  The capital Budget must be examined constantly by the Government just as the revenue Budget must be examined constantly by the Department of Finance, but both Budgets must be examined on different principles.  Large-scale public investment has to be coordinated with private investment, and this presupposes careful planning.  It is necessary, accordingly, for the Government to establish social and economic priorities for its capital projects.  Many capital projects may be desirable, but all cannot be undertaken at the same time.  To maintain an even and smooth level of national investment must be an important feature of Government policy.  It is desirable that a programme of capital projects should be prepared as a long-term objective. Some of these projects can, so to speak, be kept on the shelf until the time is opportune for putting them into effect.  In this way capital exlis <Col N="2055" /> penditure on a national scale can be so directed as to avoid the extremes of inflation on the one hand and unemployment of men and other resources on the other.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to quote and put on the records a statement made by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, in an article which he wrote for the &ldquo;Economic Survey of the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; in the <i>Statist</i> in February of this year, where he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State investment programme rests on the principle that repatriation of sterling assets is desirable where it is clearly shown to be in the interests of domestic development. The underlying assumption is that the increased outlay of the State, in so far as room is not made for it by additional current savings, i.e., by private abstention from spending, will spill over into purchases from abroad, thus causing a realisation of sterling assets.  While a moderate deficit in the balance of payments attributable to genuine realisation of external assets for domestic development is acceptable, any heavy realisation due merely to a widening of the gap between export and import values or to excessive imports of consumer goods would be cause for serious concern.  The gross value of the holdings of external assets in Irish ownership was estimated some years ago at approximately £400,000,000, which is less than the present annual rate of use of goods and services.  External holdings in Ireland were estimated at £175,000,000, so that Ireland's creditor position was of the order of £225,000,000.  The economic advantages of possessing net external resources are too substantial to enable a light view to be taken of their use merely for consumption, as distinct from productive purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have quoted at some length from these speeches and statements for the purpose of putting on the records that the principles upon which the last Government operated were principles that cannot be attacked on any sound economic grounds or on any economic theory other than the outworn theories <Col N="2056" /> of the early Victorian era.  The Minister for Finance was injected last night, when speaking on his Estimates, with all the virus of conservative finance.  He was poisoned by his outlook on his political opponents on the opposite benches.  He wanted to try and get something out to show that there was something discreditable in the policy which we adopted and carried into effect.  I have placed at some length on the records of the House the principles which guided and directed both the formulation and the application of the policy of capital expenditure for productive purposes in this country in order to show those people who listened to the poisoned and venomous outpourings of the Minister for Finance and of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when they criticised, or purported to criticise, Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance, and make the serious charge against him that he was guilty of discreditable financial tactics, that those arguments are due merely to a poisonous hatred of political opponents, and have no justification in truth and no foundation whatever.</P>
    <P>I asked earlier in my observations what is the alternative policy of the Government.  The Taoiseach to-day mentioned capital expenditure.  He was unable to give an account in his opening statement of general Government policy, because apparently the Government have no general policy at the present moment, but are hoping to devise it in the months that lie ahead during the vacation they have fixed for themselves of three or four months, hoping to filch more of our policy, the policy we devised and which they did not think of in the 16 years they were in office, and hoping then to suggest to the people, through these poisonous outpourings of the Minister for Finance, that they have something new, something different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, in the quotations I have given, shown the principles upon which we acted.  Let any criticism of our policy therefore be directed to these principles, and let the Minister for Finance or any of his <Col N="2057" /> colleagues tell the people where any of these principles were wrong.  Let them test them upon any sound modern economic principle and show us where they are wrong.  Let them give some arguments or reasons for believing they are wrong and we can discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>I have demonstrated that we were alive to the dangers inherent in that policy and took steps to anticipate and to guard against these dangers.  What does the Government now propose to do in regard to these matters?  Do I gather from the Minister's speech last night that he proposes to stop or to curtail capital expenditure?  If so, let us know in what respect.  Let us know whether the Government propose to stop capital expenditure in respect of housing, schools, land rehabilitation, afforestation, harbour development or any of the other schemes of capital expenditure which we initiated and set on foot for the benefit of the people. Let them tell the people whether they propose to adopt Deputy James Dillon's Connemara scheme or what they propose to do about it.  Do they propose to filch, to steal it from him and then suggest to the people that it was really they and not James Dillon who first thought of the people of the Gaeltacht, and particularly of Connemara?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from the suggestion of the Minister last night that we were not alive to the dangers of inflation inherent in this policy of capital expenditure and the investment of State funds in the development of our capital resources.  I want to emphasise this fact, and to lay it down without fear of contradiction, except possibly by some of the most conservative financiers who apparently surround the present Government, that any inflation that exists here at present is in no way due&mdash;or, if due in some small way, it is only in the very smallest way&mdash;to the moneys expended in the development of our resources and on capital projects initiated and put into operation.  Any inflation that exists at present is due not to that expenditure on capital projects but almost entirely, if not entirely, in the first place, to the rise in import prices of the goods we have <Col N="2058" /> to import from abroad, and, in the second place, to the spilling over of inflationary tendencies from abroad into this country.</P>
    <P>We have no control over either of these factors which are the cause of any inflation existing at the moment. Our capital expenditure programme had nothing whatever to do with these inflationary tendencies.  On the contrary, I assert that, were it not for these capital projects, with the employment given by them and the hope which they give to the people, we would have far greater inflation than we have at present.  Let nobody assert, without giving proof, that we failed to take the measures necessary to avoid inflationary tendencies caused by the development of our capital projects. If the Government propose to abandon any of these projects, let them tell us which of them they propose to abandon.  If they assert that there is something wrong with any item of that programme, let us be told the item and we will examine it, and give the arguments against.  If it is wrong, we will agree that it is wrong and should be dropped; but there is no use in making these outrageous charges which were hurled some years ago when our schemes were initiated and our policy first made known to the public, when posters were put up on the hoardings of this country suggesting that the Irish Government and the Minister for Finance of the time had put the nation's finances into pawn.</P>
    <P>That is the headline which is being followed now by the present Government, and particularly by the Minister. That is the mental attitude he has. He wants to try to &ldquo;down&rdquo; his political opponents, even at the expense of doing damage to the financial and economic structure of the State.  Are they going to drop any of these items, and, if so, which of them?  Is any of them wrong and, if so, let us be told where it is wrong?</P>
    <P>If, as appears from their criticisms, unless they are more thoroughly dishonest than even we think they are, they propose to abandon some at least of these capital projects, are they going to be financed out of taxation, <Col N="2059" /> and, if so, what is the amount of taxation that will be imposed upon the taxpayers in each year in order to finance schemes of long-term investment, of capital development, such as land rehabilitation, afforestation, harbour development, houses, schools, rural electrification and the rest?</P>
    <P>We gather from the Minister's speech that the general financial policy of the Government is a policy of high taxation. I referred earlier to what Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance, said with reference to the necessity for savings and the avoidance, if at all possible, of the imposition of taxes.  That was our policy, and I suggest that the Government ought not to accept the shallow view that taxation takes away the surplus income of the community which would otherwise be spent on consumption goods, but ought to remember the danger that, in doing what apparently the Minister intends to do, to take away what is called the surplus purchasing power of the people and to spend it, they very frequently take away not the surplus income of people that would be spent on consumer or consumption goods but income that would be devoted to savings and productive investment in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not stand, nor did my colleague, Deputy McGilligan, stand, for that policy, the policy which was the Sir Stafford Cripps policy during many years in England and which brought austerity to the people of England, the policy of skimming off the excess purchasing power of the people and its expenditure by the Government.  The Government want to save and spend for the people.  I want to save my own money which I earn hard and spend it myself on productive projects or put it into savings.  I do not want this Government to skim off the excess purchasing power of the community, because God only knows what they will dissipate it on or what are the extravagant projects on which they will send it rapidly down the drain.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance last night, as reported in the newspapers, stated that external assets estimated at £225,000,000 in 1949 had been reduced <Col N="2060" /> to £90,000,000 in the past three of four years and there was a prospect of a further reduction of £60,000,000 this year.  Why did he say &ldquo;three or four years&rdquo;?  Did he not know very well that the figure of £90,000,000 was taken, not from three or four years, but from four years?  But he could not let it pass; he had to make the suggestion that in the three years we were in office £90,000,000 in external assets was realised and contributed to the discreditable state of affairs that he alleged was in existence when he took over the office of Minister for Finance. That £90,000,000 was contributed to very largely by the realisation of external assets that occurred in the last year of the run of the Fianna Fáil Government, before we took office. That £90,000,000 was arrived at by adding the following figures.  The realisation of sterling occurred in the year 1947 to the amount of £29.9 million. That was the year in which there was restocking after the war.  That year, it will be seen, is higher than the average of the four years to which I refer.  In 1948, £19.8 million was realised; in 1949, £9.7 million and in 1950, £30,000,000, giving, including the year 1947, a total of £89.4 million&mdash; presumably the £90,000,000 referred to by the Minister for Finance last night.</P>
    <P>In 1950-51 it is estimated there will be a further deficit of £60,000,000.  I do not believe that estimate is correct. I do not believe that you can, in the conditions in which disinvestment took place, make any sort of accurate estimate based on the first few months of this year.  I believe that the last six months will probably show that there will be less realisation than in the earlier periods of the year.  But even if that estimate is correct, it will be seen that those amounts added together, the £60,000,000 and the £89.4 million, give a total of £149.4 million, say £150,000,000, and that amount is less than the amount of money which was invested in sterling assets during the period of the war. During that period, from 1940 to 1946, our people were obliged to accumulate sterling assets because there were no goods on which they could spend them. They were forced to invest the money <Col N="2061" /> in those sterling assets and in 1940 the figure was £2.3 million.  I am referring to this as the accumulation of sterling during those years.  In 1941 it was £14.3; in 1942, it was £26.1; in 1943, it was £32.4; in 1944, it was £32.7; in 1945, it was £34.6; and in 1946, it was £19.7, making a total of £162.1.  Comparing the £162.1 million which was the accumulation of sterling assets, the forced saving of our people caused by the conditions of the world war, it will be seen that that figure is greater than the figure for the realisation of our sterling assets, due either to the repatriation policy or to the stockpiling that took place in last year and the early part of this year.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister for Finance would have Deputies and the people believe that all that realisation of sterling assets was &ldquo;the rake's progress&rdquo;, that it was something that was done not on principles of financial rectitude, but on irresponsible principles of finance.  The fact is that we balanced our Budget in every year and that the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement for this year indicated that he intended himself to balance the Budget this year also.  At column 1887 of the Dáil Reports for 2nd May, 1951, Volume 125, having indicated the possible claims that would be made upon the revenues for the following year, having indicated that there was then sitting an arbitration board which might make an award in favour of civil servants&mdash;which would have its repercussions upon other public servants if an increased remuneration were given to civil servants&mdash;having indicated the possible claim for Córas Iompair Éireann, he made certain provision of £1,500,000 to meet possible contingencies falling within those categories. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The £1,500,000 must be regarded as already fully committed and any additional expenditure must entail corresponding increases in taxes or other charges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, must needs pretend that the previous Minister was so irresponsible, so lacking in his duty, that <Col N="2062" /> he left it to his successor&mdash;and he might very well have been his own successor&mdash;to meet the bills that would fall due.  I suppose the Minister for Finance and his colleagues never adverted to the fact that, if provision had been made for the Civil Service, for the Gardaí and the Army, that would have been a headline to the arbitration board.  Had provision been made in the Budget by taxation or otherwise for possible losses of Córas Iompair Éireann, that would have been a headline and almost a direction to Córas Iompair Éireann to batter ahead, not bother about expenditure, and not to run their concern as they should run it as far as possible as an economic concern.  If they were to know that the purse of the taxpayer was available to them, what possible chance would there be of any economies, any increase in efficiency, any effort by the directorate or staff to run the company as an economic concern?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must needs cast mud at his predecessor.  It is a source of great satisfaction to us to know that the reputation of Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance stands high in the estimate of the people.  They know what his family budget meant to them this year and no amount of mud slinging by his successor will in any way detract from his knowledge, his experience and his reputation as an expert on finance and the reputation that he very deservedly earned for himself when he occupied the position of Minister for Finance of this State for a period of three years. We will see how his successor deals with the problem.  Is he going to have a financial deficit or is he going to balance the Budget, as we did for every one of the four Budgets for which we were in office?  Or is he going to follow what Deputy Lemass, as he then was, said some time ago; is he going to borrow for a deficit?  Are we going to have heavy taxation for projects of capital expenditure and other matters? Is the Minister for Finance going to overlook the fact that practically always every estimate of income of national revenue has been falsified and always understand by the Department of Finance.  This is what Deputy Lemass <Col N="2063" /> then said, as reported on May 8th of this year in the <i>Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil has learned much during its period in opposition.  It will be a better Government now than ever before.  The new Government would be faced with an unbalanced Budget and a pile of unpaid debts.  Fianna Fáil would not attempt to clear the Coalition's legacy of debt from current tax revenue.  However orthodox that course might be, it would be an impossible burden on national production. The level of Government spending was already as high as the country was capable of sustaining.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce stated a few months ago that, if brought into office as a result of the then pending election, he would budget not out of so-called deficits in current expenditure to clear the debts he alleges we left behind but he would budget for a deficit.  Last night, the Minister for Finance was adumbrating increased taxes.  Which is it going to be?  Is there going to be a policy of budgeting for a deficit or a policy of crushing taxation, spoiled initiative, crippling enterprise and preventing the people from doing what they have a right to do&mdash;make their own savings.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred last night to the £60,000,000 for the year 1951.  I have dealt in part with that.  He left the House and the people under the impression that it was the capital project policy of productive capital expenditure that was responsible for that deficit.  He did tell them of stockpiling that took place during that year.  If we had not done stockpiling for purposes of Government, hospitalisation and for having materials available for houses, we would have been severely criticised for lack of foresight in not taking those measures. There has not been so far, although the Government has been in office for a while, one single breath or word of complaint or criticism that we in any way failed in our duty, during the months after the international situation deteriorated and the supply position became so bad, to stockpile to the greatest possible advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> The Government knows, but I do not know whether the people or the country know, that we set up some months ago an inter-departmental committee to deal with this very matter of stockpiling and to advise the Government as to the steps they should take in the then existing serious condition of the deteriorated international situation and of the supply position. That expert inter-departmental committee sat frequently and made reports which are available to the present Government.  The results have been of great advantage.  They saved the people money and had the effect of putting at their disposal supplies of materials and commodities that otherwise they would either not be able to get or have to pay a very high price for them.</P>
    <P>I requested the Press to come to see me at a Press conference of a private character.  I asked for their co-operation. We did not spread this abroad as something that we wanted to get credit for.  In view of what the Minister for Finance has stated, I think I am bound to disclose that.  We set up this committee for the purpose of stockpiling.  I asked the co-operation of the Press whose representatives attended at my office.  I asked them for their co-operation and I told them what I was doing.  I said if the matter was publicised or in any way dramatised by the newspapers grave damage would be done to our people and to the problem we had to solve and the position we had to overcome.  I got the co-operation of the Press.  We were in a position, therefore, of not causing any panic to the people or pushing up prices.  We wanted quietly to secure pretty substantial quantities of essentials of life for the people.</P>
    <P>There is not a word about that in the Minister's statement.  He left it to be inferred by Deputies and by the people reading it that the £90,000,000 was evidence of financial lack of principle and that that was entirely due to mismanagement of our national investment programme.  It was largely due to stockpiling.  Stockpiling took place in Government, business and industrial circles and it is well that it did for the people of the country.  Nobody but a <Col N="2065" /> fool would have considered that it would be possible to finance schemes of capital expenditure without a deficit in the balance of payments.  We were alive to the danger of that and justified anything we did in our policy of repatriation of external assets.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated the fact, by reference to a speech that I made, that there should be a priorities of capital programme; that those priorities should be continually considered in the light of changed realities; that it might be good policy to change from one business to another, and that the policy should be a flexible one.  I pointed to the results we have achieved, results which cannot be denied.  If the financial policy which informed and guided the policy of capital investment was such as the Minister for Finance stated last night, how did we obtain the results that were obtained and which cannot be denied?  If those results are satisfactory, why criticise this policy, and if the policy is criticised why not give us the criticism?  Why not base it on facts and give us the arguments?  Until these arguments are given I assert here and now that all those criticisms, which were initiated during the period when the present Government was in opposition and when they were repudiated by every member of the various Parties and Independent Deputies who supported the then Government, and so-called repudiation of our policy are merely politics.  Playing at politics is a very dangerous game for the present Government to be playing&mdash;dangerous for themselves but still more dangerous for the economic safety of our people.</P>
    <P>I stated at the outset of my remarks that we were somewhat embarrassed by the position that existed in connection with Deputy MacBride's motions. I find it rather difficult to make any observations on those motions without having, as I think I have indicated, heard the reasons on which Deputy MacBride will commend these motions to the House.  I do not know what the Government is going to do other than they are going to vote as a body about something that is not disclosed, and that there is going to be no free vote.</P>
    <P>When these motions were put down <Col N="2066" /> in the time of the former Parliament, I indicated then, in answer to a question put, I think, by Deputy Con Lehane, that, so far as the then Government was concerned, they would leave it to a free vote of the House. So far as I am capable of influencing the policy on this or any other side of the House, I should wish to adopt that principle.  I should wish to leave this to the consideration of each Deputy for his own independent judgment and his own particular conscience. It is a serious and by no means an easy decision to take to vote for or against these motions.  We take pride in the fact that there is little if any difference between any sections of this House upon the problem of Partition. We differ on the question of methods or means to achieve the solution of that very difficult problem but whatever bitterness there may be or whatever antagonism may exist between sections of this House and between Deputies we are all at one on the necessity of doing everything possible for the solution of this difficult problem.  I think I stated in this House when the matter came first before the members that I would approach consideration of the question whether members of the Northern Parliament should be permitted to enter this House either as full Deputies or as persons being granted a right of audience, with one objective in view, and I applied one test and one test only.  The objective I had in mind was the ending of Partition.  The test I applied was: would those motions or the matter which they wished to bring about help in any way towards the solution of the problem of Partition?</P>
    <P>I approach the consideration of Deputy MacBride's motions in the same sense to-day, applying the same test and with as deep a sense of personal responsibility in me in making my personal decision as I had when I was the Head of the Government in this State having to determine policy and decide in reference to somewhat similar motions.</P>
    <P>I think that every Deputy in this House should be allowed, as I said, to have a free choice and exercise a free <Col N="2067" /> right without consideration even of the democratic principle of majority rule within the confines of his own Party. As far as my own Party, the Fine Gael Party, is concerned, that is the rule we have adopted.  Each Deputy must make up his own mind for himself having had full consideration of the matter as we did have in our own Party and individual discussions.</P>
    <P>Personally I am against the adoption of either of these two motions.  I approached consideration of the admission of Deputies into this House rather sympathetically when it was first proposed. I knew, of course, that it was utterly impossible constitutionally that they should take their place as ordinary Deputies in this House, but constitutions could be changed and laws could be enacted if the vital requirements of the problem so decided.  Then putting aside questions of constitutionality and legal difficulties, I considered whether it was desirable that they should sit as full Deputies or whether they should get a mere right of audience.  I did think it would be right to give them a right of audience, not in this House but in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I find it rather difficult to disclose here in public all of the views which have actuated me and influenced me in coming to the serious decision I have just announced.  I think it would probably not do any great deal of good to the cause we all have at heart if I were to go into very great detail but I have, as a result of my experience and my thought on the matter, come to the very clear conclusion that, far from advancing the interests of the cause we all wish to advance, the ending of Partition, it would very gravely jeopardize it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the consideration of constitutionalities or legalities or the fact that their sitting here with the right of audience would be not taxation without representation but representation without taxation.  I content myself with saying that there is no such clear view among the people as distinct from politicians as would coerce us to the belief or conviction that it is necessary for the ending of <Col N="2068" /> Partition that these steps should be taken.  I gravely fear that were these representatives given even the right of audience it would cause grave dissension among the people in the North and that it would certainly help to cause further friction among our people down here, particularly Deputies in this House.  I see no way by which they could be prevented from interfering in our domestic politics as practised in this House.</P>
    <P>I am convinced of that and my conviction leads me to say that personally I intend to vote against these motions. It would be a wrong thing in present circumstances to give them that right of audience, as their proper place is the House of Parliament of so-called Northern Ireland.  They can use that forum as the sounding board to disseminate our views and their views against the injustice of Partition and against the injustices daily inflicted upon them by that Parliament of which they are members.</P>
    <P>When these projects were suggested to me some time ago I told those people who came to me representing or purporting to represent at least a section of our politicians of the six north-eastern counties that I was against that project of giving the right of audience, but I suggested to them an alternative method.  I thought and I still think that that alternative method would be better and more productive of results.  I mention that for the purpose of showing that I did not adopt a negative attitude or approach to this problem.  If it were a fact that these people were isolated from us in the North, if it were a fact that they had not access to Ministers, Deputies and the people in general here, there might be something to be said for it, but there is nothing to be said for their coming down here and preaching to the converted.  The people we have to convert are the unconverted and the obstinate.  We can only do that by weighing in together, by co-operating together on common policy, and by agreeing upon common methods to achieve the end we all desire.  I suggested that they should form a unity council in the North, that people of all political Parties and associations and of different complexions should <Col N="2069" /> come together and form a council which would be a unity council and which would speak and act for all sections of our people in the six north-eastern counties.  I suggested that a liaison should be established down here between that unity council and the Government or a body consisting of a committee of Ministers.  That was how I envisaged that the problem should best be dealt with and the greatest possible beneficial results achieved: a unity council meeting and sitting with a Cabinet Committee of Irish Ministers to consider the problem, weigh the difficulties, formulate plans and agree on a common policy and on methods to carry out that common policy.</P>
    <P>I saw some useful purpose in that. I see none in giving those Deputies a right of audience so that they could come down here and preach to the converted possibly causing dissension among our people.  For these reasons I personally propose to vote against the motions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all heard of the hypocritical Minister long ago who did not practice what he preached.  I think that actions speak louder than words.  I notice that Deputy Costello was in quite a serious mood to-day.  I can recall a day a couple of years ago when he sneeringly likened Deputy Lemass to a fly hopping outside the window-pane, because he was so helpless. I hope that Deputy Costello realise that he himself is in that position now&mdash;hopping outside the window pane, as he sneeringly remarked to Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>I hope this country will never again experience anything like the past three years in our history.  We were left without leadership and without guidance. Our Departments were left in the hands of incompetent people who never seemed to have had any collective agreement in the matter of the government of this country.  I am sure Deputy Costello had many a headache when he opened the morning papers and read what Deputy James Dillon or Deputy Norton had said the night before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House of the period around last December when, in reply to Parliamentary Questions, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that there was no danger of a scarcity of coal during the winter months&mdash;and within a couple of weeks of that statement the fuel retailers in Cork who supplied the poor and the needy people in the outlying districts of the city had to close their stores and publish advertisements over their names to the effect that they had to close because they were unable to get coal supplies.  That happened within three weeks of the making of the statement that there was no danger of a coal scarcity.  The poor people in Cork&mdash;and in Dublin, too, judging by the questions which were put down on the Order Paper&mdash;who were depending on turf for their vouchers as old age pensioners, and <Col N="2071" /> recipients of home assistance and blind pensioners, were left in the position that they had nothing in the nature of burnable fuel.  The people in Cork had to be content with turf that had been cut four and a half years previously, when the Fianna Fáil Government were in power, and which had been left out in the open Cork park under hail, snow and sleet during all that period whilst Messrs.  Henry Ford, and other people, were drawing a high rent for the ground.  Not a sod of turf was put in there in those years that the last Government was in power and not until we could not get coal or anything else did they start drawing on what was left there.</P>
    <P>It is a scandalous state of affairs that no provision was made for the people of this country to live in comfort and to cook their food or anything else&mdash; and that position was brought about by people who actually did not know what was happening at all in the country, and there is no doubt about that judging by a reply which was given here.  I put down a question to the same Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, asking if the Minister was aware that certain tweed manufacturers had piled up their suitings and were stockpiling.  I asked if the stock which they were piling up would be put on the market at higher prices later on.  I was told by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he was not aware of anything of the kind. There are not so many manufacturers in the country that, when the Parliamentary Secretary got notice, he could not have made inquiries into the matter.  Every draper and tailor in the South of Ireland knew that these people withdrew their patterns and refused to sell until it suited them to do so.</P>
    <P>It is laughable for anybody who reads to-day's Order Paper and sees the questions which are down on it by Dublin Deputies in regard to the cement position. I think three Deputies have put down questions asking whether the Minister is aware of the shortage of cement and of the difficulty which is being experienced by the Dublin Corporation in procuring cement for their <Col N="2072" /> housing needs.  I think these Deputies should have been ashamed to put down these questions in the light of the way in which this particular industry was treated by the previous Government. In May of last year we were told in this House that consideration was being given to the question of extending existing factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to refer to the negligence of the last Government in connection with the handling of the cement position of this country. Were it not for the policy of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce during his previous term of office, we should now be in the position that we would practically not be able to build houses.  I want to make that point clear to the people on the opposite side of the House who are talking about housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello dealt with housing.  May I point out that the last <Col N="2073" /> Government was simply continuing the Fianna Fáil policy in relation to the building of houses?  That work was partly interrupted during the war and very seriously interrupted during the last three years.  At the time when Fianna Fáil came into power we were content to get all our flour and cement manufactured in England; we were content to get all our motor cars manufactured and assembled in England; we were content to get all our tyres manufactured in England.  We were content to get many things manufactured in England that are to-day being manufactured in this country.  A Minister of the last Government once said that it was not the duty of the Government to find employment for our people. When we know the progress that was made in the industrial field under the Fianna Fáil Government I think it is ridiculous that we should have to listen to all this criticism.</P>
    <P>In regard to our defence policy, I remember when the then Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, on the passage of the Ireland Bill through this House said we would hurt the British in their pride and in their prestige and in their pocket.  Some of us at that time hoped that we would have a certain firmness in Government.  Unfortunately, the people in Cork got a rude awakening very shortly after that when the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, said he thought it would be a good idea to appeal to that lionhearted statesman, Winston Churchill, to end Partition.  I think that was drifting a bit from hurting the British in their pride and in their prestige and in their pocket.</P>

      <P>I think that may not be altogether accurate because I believe there is another section who retired under Article X of the Treaty who did not get an increase.  I am not so sure about that, but the Old I.R.A. men who are drawing disability pensions did.  The people who have to be proved destitute and incapable of self-support before they get a special allowance, got no increase since 1946, since the Act was passed.  Every other body&mdash;teachers, civil servants and other sections&mdash;got increases in pensions apart from the people who helped to create the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government should also consider the question of the abatement in pensions.  We have people throughout the country in very menial positions <Col N="2079" /> and a certain percentage of their I.R.A. service pensions is deducted by way of abatement.  I would ask the Government seriously to consider that matter.  I would also ask the Government to consider the position of the people during the coming winter and not to leave them hungry and cold as they were last winter.</P>

      <P>With a very deep sense of regret, I listened to the Taoiseach this morning blundering and rambling through the disjointed, disconnected and ill-considered speech which purported to give some indication of Government policy and which, in fact, will go on record as stark evidence of the fact that no policy at all exists.  It is a very poor tribute to the Leader of the Government and a very poor compliment to this House that it was only the series of questions put to him that enabled the Leader of the Government to make a speech at all.  It is quite obvious that, bereft as Fianna Fáil were of a policy in 1948, they are completely naked now and they are rapidly trying to clothe themselves in the garment of the intelligent, constructive policy which was left to them, not by the will of the people but by the caprice and irresponsibility of certain elected representatives in this House.  We have to face in this debate very serious problems and I shall have to direct questions on Government policy which I feel will not be answered but, at least in the interests of the country, they must be asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders listening to Deputy McGrath whether lurking in the background of his mind was not a sinister hope of a revival of bitterness as between the Republic and England. One has the uneasy feeling&mdash;and we are entitled to demand that the unrest and unease that is felt in the country should be put at rest&mdash;that we may soon have the hardy warriors over there shouting again for another stupid, catastrophic and idiotic economic war.  We have the significant statement <Col N="2080" /> of the Taoiseach that England will get goods if she pays the price. We have some erstwhile Walshian theories now being operated by the new Minister for Agriculture.  We have a state of unease in the country that was typified by the question addressed by Deputy Flynn in this House yesterday to the Minister for Agriculture relative to small store cattle through the south-west of Ireland.  If any Fianna Fáil Deputy wants to ascertain what the situation in the country is to-day, he should visit the fairs of the country and see the gloom that has been created in the short period since the change of Government.  He will see people standing beside their cattle unable to dispose of them because of the uneasiness and the uncertainty that has arisen since the resumption of office by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to say something he had better get up and say it, as this is about the only time he will be heard.  We are entitled to expect from the Government, not the disconcerted disjointed mumblings of a man whose Party is in process of disintegration; we are entitled to ask the Government for a clear and unequivocal statement of policy. We do not mind if they have learned the lesson that their best policy is to endeavour to carry on the good policy which they have inherited, but let them have the courage to come into the House and tell us that they are going to complete the good job already started.  So far, we have had nothing like a lucid statement from anybody in the Fianna Fáil Party as to what their policy is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presented to this country as an alleged policy after the election and on the eve of the election of a Taoiseach was a 17-point programme, and, I declare to heavens, even the blindest, the most stupid and the thickest of the Fianna Fáil Deputies will realise at once that that is not even a redressing of the previous Government's policy.  It is an assimilation and a swallowing of it <i>in toto.</i>  That is a good lesson if the Government take it, properly to heart, because, in spite of <Col N="2081" /> themselves, with the co-operation and intelligent, constructive criticism they will receive from the Opposition here, we will make a good Government of them if they make the least effort.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask, and I intend to ask, the Taoiseach to inform the country as to what is the design and what is the plan for agriculture in this country.  Will there be a continuation of the long-term agreements already entered into or will we have to extract the information as it was extracted from Deputy Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture, yesterday when he told the House that the five-year guarantee for milk is not suspended?  We want to know, and the farmers of Ireland are entitled to know, whether there will be a continuation of the tremendous schemes of benefit designed and executed by the last Government, whether there will be a full continuation of land rehabilitation, whether there will be full development of the schemes for putting water into rural dwellings, whether there will be a proper use made of all the development works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>It was rather amazing to hear the naïve Lord Mayor of Cork, moryah, to-day talking about holding things up, when one reverts to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which was a fruitful source of employment, a fruitful source of national schemes that did lasting national good.  It was obstructed over and over again, and deliberately obstructed in this House by Fianna Fáil, the then Opposition, so that work would be denied the people in rural Ireland at a time when they badly needed it.  It does sound just a little bit too hypocritical to swallow when Deputy McGrath stands up to talk about thanking the Government for giving an increase in the old age pension.  That would never have been given but for the fact that the late Government had already designed and planned the Bill to give it, and that they had made Fianna Fáil, during the election campaign, give an assurance that that 2/6 would be given. We are entitled to know whether or not the record of a Party who denied <Col N="2082" /> increases in the old age pension can compare with the record of a Government who removed the iniquitous and unnecessary taxes and at the same time gave a substantial increase to the extent of 5/- in the old age pension. We are entitled to know and the country is entitled to judge, where the merit lies when you have the pontificating Deputy McGrath claiming credit for something that Fianna Fáil never conceived or never would have conceived but for the fact that it was left to them as a concrete proposal when the Government which I supported left office.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask, are we to accept the kind of vague, unreal, Victorian and archaic approach to Partition adumbrated by the Taoiseach to-day as being Government policy on this our major remaining political problem?  I am entitled to say, in reference to the motions to be moved by Deputy MacBride to-day, that, as the Taoiseach has indicated, the whip is on and the iron grip is on his own Party in relation to these motions.  He gave us no reason that would justify the denial of the liberty of their consciences to the Deputies of this House when voting on the issue. He did not even advert to the terms of the motions.  Not one suggestion has been made by him as to why the vote could not, in a deliberate, free non-Party spirit be an issue in this House.  He mumbled some vague remark about not liking free votes.  Too well, and too bitterly, does this country know the fact that the Taoiseach never liked free votes or never liked votes that might entail defeat.  I am entitled to ask, when we are dealing with this problem, if we cannot face the principle that is in issue quite apart from Party differences and Party cleavages.  The issue in the motions, which I intend to support and vote for, is that, as a gesture of our goodwill and our confidence in our brother Irishmen in the North, they will be given an audience in either the Seanad or in the Dáil.  We in this House are merely asking the Government to initiate proposals to that effect.  That motion includes, as I wish it to include, even the die-hard Unionist of the North should he want <Col N="2083" /> to come down here amongst us to be heard.</P>
    <P>We pay lip service, and too much lip service, in this country to the ideal of a unified Ireland and do nothing practical to achieve it.  There are myriads and myriads of bridges of goodwill that could be built between our brethren in the North and ourselves, and they are not going to be built until such day as the North can have confidence in us&mdash;a confidence that was bitterly lost in 1798.  Are we going to encourage or engender any goodwill with the North when one finds their ex-god, the present Taoiseach, whipping his boys up the stairs into the lobby to-night to vote in such a way as to deny them the smallest access to what we claim to be their rightful Parliament?  They seek no deliberative or voting powers in this House.  They seek but the right that they, believing sincerely in the union of Ireland and the unity of Ireland, should be allowed to come here to the Parliament that they consider their rightful Parliament to speak on issues that may be of consequence to them, not in any way to deal with our domestic problems, but to have a platform and a forum from which to continue to air the iniquitous situation of Partition externally imposed and externally maintained.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are approaching this problem in a completely wrong way and that, if we do not mend our hands, we can discourage an element that needs all the encouragement and co-operation that they can be given.  I have a particular liking for the first motion in Deputy MacBride's name because it is wide enough to embrace even our seemingly most bitter opponents of the moment, if they also want to come amongst us.  We know that the establishment of this State is due to the courage and the vision that men had to establish the first Dáil and probably, even more than the military successes, it was the fact that administration was crippled and the King's writ could not run in this country that brought about the happy situation which leaves us in the Republic of Ireland to-day with a free independent Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> This move may be the forerunner to the building up of an organisation supported by the Irish here in the Republic which will gradually tear away from the tentacles of despotism and vested interests those parts of our country which are predominantly republican in sympathy, those parts of the Six Counties which should, by all the tenets of politics and of feeling, be part of the Republic.  As each advance is made in that direction, as each acre and each field are filched from the vested interests that abound around Belfast, the impossibility and the impracticability of maintaining an isolated puppet unit will become more and more apparent to the world.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which is reaching a stage where, with the goodwill and conscientious effort of all Irishmen, whether they are North or South of the Border, a genuine advance can be made.  It may be that the motion to-day, or our action to-day, may only be a gesture, but at least it can be a manly gesture.  It may be that there are difficulties in the way of making it really big.  It may be that constitutional lawyers or people anxious to score points may raise insurmountable barriers, but at least there can be no barrier, legal or otherwise, to the genuine goodwill and spirit of this House if it wants to reach out its hands in real fraternal brotherhood towards its own people.  We will not do that if, on motions such as this, we have divisions in this House in which the individual conscience of Deputies on the Government side is to be stifled, because I can fully realise from the petulance and impatience of the interruption of Deputy Brennan to-day that he is as sore as blazes because the Whips are on, as he knows perfectly well, from his close proximity to those of our temporarily severed brothers, where his vote should go if his conscience was free.</P>
    <P>If we want to face the Partition issue in earnest, we must try to explore every possible avenue where goodwill and co-operation can be found, and if there is even the remote possibility that by accepting this motion we could build a bridge of goodwill, then we <Col N="2085" /> should have the courage to take that step in the genuine national interest. What is there against it?  It is not so long ago when in an early Dáil representatives from many of these areas were heard.  Why should we allow an act of any alien Government or any petty circumstances to stop us from holding out the hand of friendship, if it is sought?  Whatever good this might do, the fact that we will not do it can do irreparable harm.  I appeal to the House to consider that particular viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Whether a Northern representative be a partitionist, a nationalist or a unionist, under the terms of the first motion proposed by Deputy MacBride, if we have the courage to adopt it, he will have the right of audience in either the Dáil or Seanad, as we desire. My own leanings would be that if any right of audience were given, it should be given in the Seanad.  But under the terms of that motion we can say even to our seemingly blackest enemy in Northern Ireland: &ldquo;We are big enough to let you come down and air your views in our Oireachtas if you want to.&rdquo;  It would be a very big step in the right direction.  It would show the magnanimity there is in this Republic.  It would show willing eagerness on our part to have them not only Irish in name but Irish in reality as well.  We are entitled to ask, and we must ask in a deliberate way, what are the reasons activating the mind of the Taoiseach when he does not tell us whether he is going to vote for or against this, but avoids the subject by giving us a little homily on the danger of free votes.</P>
    <P>I listened this morning to a disjointed, ill-considered dissertation on the Gaeltacht and the congested areas. The problem in these areas is an infinitely deeper problem than the one so dear to the heart of the Taoiseach, the language.  Like the Taoiseach, I hope to see the drive to revive our own language spreading.  But the problem of the congested areas and of the Gaeltacht has become one of dire economics. One problem which I was surprised the Taoiseach never touched and which is one of the most serious blisters in these isolated areas is the extraordinary <Col N="2086" /> high valuation of poor and inferior lands.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>The particular positions occupied by members of the Government prior to their appointment are purely private matters.</P>
      <P>What concerns the Dáil and the public is that no member of the Government should engage in any activities whatsoever that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office&mdash;for example, acting in a position such as a company directorship carrying remuneration.</P>
      <P>Most of the members of the Government who, immediately before their recent entry upon office, held positions that would conflict with this principle have already complied with it, by resignation or by being given leave of absence without remuneration.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, there are a number of development works scheduled for Valentia Island.  The Office of Public Works have plans and specifications ready for the improvement of landing facilities at Knightstown, Valentia Island, at an estimated cost of £3,200, towards which a State grant of 75 per cent. of the cost has been sanctioned on condition that the Kerry County Council will contribute the balance.  Grants from the Vote for employment and emergency schemes will, as usual, be made available to give employment during the forthcoming winter months to men on the island in receipt of unemployment assistance, and approval has been given for a number of schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, for which grants have already been made available from the Vote for Local Government.  In addition, a number of applications for grants under the land rehabilitation project have been approved.</P>
      <P>I understand that the volume of unemployment at Valentia Island is slightly less than it was at this time last year.</P>
      <P>As regards the concluding portion of the Deputy's question, the position, as the Taoiseach indicated to the Dáil on the 21st of last month, is that the Government have assigned to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government the duties relating to the administration of the permanent organisation to direct and co-ordinate efforts towards the economic and social development of the Gaeltacht and congested areas.

Would the Parliamentary Secretary indicate that during the recess he will visit those areas, including Valentia Island, with a view to satisfying himself as to the requirements of the people there? Further, will he visit the whole Gaeltacht districts of South Kerry, including Ballinskelligs and all the other Irish-speaking districts, with a view to consultation with the people in the areas as to the schemes for improvement that could be put forward to the Government?</P>

With regard to the second part of his question and the supplementary question put by Deputy Palmer, I have arranged to visit Kerry during the next week and during the subsequent weeks to visit other Gaeltacht and congested areas.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, and 9 together.</P>
      <P>As a result of the strike of the employees of Cement Limited in April and May last there was for a short time afterwards some falling off in the supplies of cement.  In recent weeks, however, the company has taken exceptional measures to overcome this shortage, particularly in the case of large users, such as the Dublin Corporation. These measures included the running of special trains, by arrangement with the city engineer, on each of the last three Saturdays by which a substantial additional tonnage of cement was made available to the Dublin Corporation.  The suggestion that the corporation is not getting its appropriate share of available supplies from the distributors is being examined.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the suggestion that the Dublin Corporation should be allowed to purchase its supplies direct from Cement Limited, rather than through its recognised distributors, would improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister <Col N="2094" /> aware, particularly in the case of the direct supplies which have been furnished in recent weeks, as he has indicated in his reply, that these are charged not to the Dublin Corporation but to builders' providers who take a rake off the price for themselves without handling the cement?  Would the Minister be prepared to take steps to ensure that supplies are sold direct to the Dublin Corporation by the Irish Cement Company as is done in the case of Aer Lingus?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the question which he now raises has nothing to do with the volume of cement available to the Dublin Corporation.  There may be a case for reviewing the distribution methods employed by Cement Limited, but it does not directly relate to the subject-matter of the question which I have answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the main purpose of the cash allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948 and 1949, to persons suffering from certain infectious diseases is to induce persons in necessitous circumstances to undergo early and suitable treatment for the disease by relieving them of worry as to the maintenance of themselves and their dependents.  I am satisfied that, generally speaking, this object is being achieved and in the circumstances I do not at present propose to amend the regulations to provide for an increase in the rates of allowance, the expenditure on which has increased from £284,000 in the year 1948-49 to an estimated amount of £488,000 in the current year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, I am sure, also aware that health authorities have discretion to deal sympathetically with cases of hardship by waiving abatement of allowances in respect of other income of patients and, in the case of tuberculosis patients, by granting extra nourishment under the domiciliary welfare scheme.</P>

My reply was that I was not prepared to reconsider them at present, but I think they will have to be reconsidered in the near future.  I was not aware of the point raised by Deputy Dunne.

      <P>(1)  Until such time as sub-contracts are signed for the electrical and mechanical installations and a definite programme is drawn up for the remaining stages of the work, it is difficult to make any estimate as to the time required for the completion of the undertaking.  As the Deputy is aware, the building contractor has already been granted an extension of time of nine months for the execution of the work.</P>

    <P>(2)  Due to difficulties which have arisen about the form of the subcontract agreements, these agreements have not yet been signed in the case of the proposed sub-contractors for the <Col N="2106" /> electrical and the mechanical installations and, unfortunately, as a consequence, work on these installations has not yet commenced.

    <P>A figure purporting to represent the average amount per house paid from the Transition Development Fund in respect of the houses in the above table would be misleading, inasmuch as the grant is paid from time to time on the application of the local authority and is based on the value of work done, including that on unfinished houses, at the time of application.  It is not related to the number of houses built in any particular period.  The average amount per house paid or to be paid out of the Transition Development Fund in respect of any scheme can only be <Col N="2120" /> determined when the scheme has been completed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state whether the contractor to the Cork Corporation for the building of 198 houses at Baker's Lane, Cork, ordered the railings for these houses from England or some place outside the Republic of Ireland; and, if so, whether his Department sanctioned the order, the reason for its so doing and, further, whether he will now take steps to prevent the importing of these railings again.</P>

      <P>The approved specification for this housing scheme contained a clause designed to give effect to the general requirement that for local authority housing schemes all materials, appliances and fittings should, wherever possible, be of Irish manufacture. I understand from the Cork Corporation that the contractors imported a portion of the materials for the railings and gates, that the items so imported were not available in Ireland and that the remainder of the material for railings and gates, comprising 90 per cent. of the whole, is of Irish manufacture and fabrication. This matter did not come before my Department for sanction, since, under the contract, it rested within the discretion of the architect for the scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards future policy, in view of the high cost of iron railings and the need to conserve stocks of iron, I propose to have such railings excluded altogether from schemes now being planned and to have other forms of fencing substituted.</P>

I do know, however, that about 338 cwt. of Danish butter was rejected by butter traders, etc., as being unfit for table use; (c) 6th April, 1951; (d) 13th April, 1951, and 23rd May, 1951; (e) discussions with the Danish exporting authority on this matter are still proceeding, and I am not yet in a position to indicate what the result will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware (1) that serious unrest prevails among the milk suppliers to creameries in South Kerry as they are not receiving the increase awarded since the 1st of April last unless perhaps there was a test of 4 per cent. butter fat; (2) that such a result <Col N="2138" /> is rarely obtainable; (3) that farmers supplying milk to three different creameries, Dicksgrove, Castlemaine, Rathmore, with the same test, say 3.5 per cent., got different prices, and (4) that suppliers are told they are paid increased price on average test but are not told what the average test is; and, if so, if he will ensure that the same price is paid to suppliers in all groups under the Dairy Disposal Company and if he will fix his present price of 16 pence per gallon for milk of a certain standard, e.g., 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (1) the Deputy is under a misapprehension in stating that an increased price for creamery milk was approved as from 1st April last.  The increase approved by the previous Government was in respect of the period beginning 1st May last and the further increase recently announced by me relates to the period commencing on 1st July.  I am not aware that there is serious unrest among the milk suppliers to creameries in South Kerry as regards the prices obtained by them for their milk supplies.  In fact, I am informed by the Dairy Disposal Company that suppliers to creameries in this area are being paid on the basis of the increased prices.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the points mentioned at (2), (3) and (4) in the Deputy's question, but I am not prepared to act as he suggests.  I may say that it is not the practice for creameries generally to inform their milk suppliers of the average butter fat content of all the milk received by the creamery each month, nor is it practicable for economic reasons for different creameries to pay the same price for milk.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress I was about to suggest to the Government that there would be nothing detrimental in the effort to conserve the language in our making the Gaeltacht and congested areas economically sound.  I believe the Irish language is much more likely to flourish in a prosperous Gaeltacht rather than in a poverty-stricken one. No matter how desirous we may be for the rapid re-establishment and development of our language the Government will have to face the existing problem on the basis of grappling first of all with the economy of the areas concerned.  One factor that bears heavily on the people in the congested and Gaeltacht areas is the unreal values that are placed on their holdings.  I would have liked the <Col N="2145" /> Taoiseach to have given us a reasonable indication of what the functions of the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Government are.</P>
      <P>The House owes the country, and the Government owes the House, some explanation for the festooning of the House with five beautiful Parliamentary Secretaries.  If there is a Government policy for the Gaeltacht, surely there must have been some plan crystallised in their minds when they decided to appoint this new and special Parliamentary Secretary to the Government itself?  What is that policy?  Can the Government give us any indication of what scheme, if any, they propose to keep in employment people living at present in the Gaeltacht; what plan, if any, they have for the development of industries that the Taoiseach wants in harmony with the area and not tending to Anglicise it?  What are these industries?  What are their likely prospects of survival or of economic reality?  We are entitled to know that, instead of being treated, as we were this morning by the responsible Leader of the Government, to a shamming, circuitous hour and ten minutes of virtual codology. Never in my short experience have I heard a more inept effort at presenting a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to know what is Government policy on major issues.  Is it to be a continuation of intelligent capital investment?  Is the drive for housing to continue at its full impetus? Are the social improvements conceived and designed by the predecessors of this Government to be implemented in full?  Above all, we were entitled to a statement from the Taoiseach to-day as to whether that cemented unity and domestic peace which exist at home are to be preserved, as to whether or not he has departed from that extraordinary statement he had to make about the Republic of Ireland Bill&mdash; that he did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing.  We are entitled to inquire and to know whether the country can under this Government hope for a continuation of domestic peace.  We are entitled to get an assurance that the special courts and tribunals will not once again <Col N="2146" /> raise their ugly heads in the domestic affairs of this country.  We are entitled to have, and I am demanding from the Leader of the Government, an assurance to the country that the gun has gone out of politics, that he will strive to maintain the internal position that has been attained, and that he will ensure as Leader of the Government that the seeds of bitterness and disunity are finally laid to rest, and will remain so.</P>
    <P>One would have expected, and was entitled to expect from the Leader of the Government a statement as to what is the Government's approach to all the big issues.  We had lamentations and exhortations for many months on the issue of defence.  We were told that we should raise unlimited cohorts.  We were entitled to get an indication, which we did not get from the Taoiseach to-day, as to what is the Government's plan for defence and for the building up of the Army about which Deputy Major de Valera was so vocal for three years.  We were entitled to a statement from the Taoiseach to-day in the light of what had been said by Deputy Boland, the present Minister for Justice, when he was on this side of the House, as to the Government's attitude to their new brother in bondage, Deputy Cowan, and his erstwhile army of four and forty fighting men and a couple of stout gossoons.</P>
    <P>We were entitled to, but we did not get, a pronouncement on the particular heads of the Government's approach to these problems.  We were entitled to get an indication, where special Parliamentary Secretaries have been assigned duties, as to what the Government's intentions and policy on certain issues were.  We were entitled to hear, after the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the problem of fisheries, what the approach to the fishing industry is to be and whether or not the Government will face up to the problem of making the fishing industry, not a subsidiary industry but a major industry, self-supporting and of a truly national character.  We were entitled to know whether the Government will develop, and aim at maintaining or exceeding, the target set for afforestation. We were entitled to get information as to what the Government had <Col N="2147" /> planned for the future.  What did we get?  We got incoherence, indefiniteness and a complete lack of cohesion in a rambling speech indicating that the zest and the personal vitality of the Taoiseach were suffering with the passing of the years.</P>
    <P>I want the Taoiseach, when replying, to let the country know where exactly it stands under this new caretaker Government.  I want the Taoiseach to be careful and deliberate in reassuring the country as to where it stands. Does he intend to continue the effort to bring to full fruition the scheme that it took the courage and the vision of a James Dillon to initiate?  Does he intend to give to the workers throughout the length and breadth of this country the security they might have hoped for and would certainly have obtained, under the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Norton? Will he not come into the House now and indicate whether the Minister for Finance, adopting the role as he did last night of the doleful Johnny in the hair shirt, represents the Government view or whether, looking at his own Party organ this morning, he can see the divers tongues of two of his Ministers talking within an hour of each other in this House&mdash;one boasting that exports have reached pre-war level again and the other enunciating a tale of woe, misery and impending doom.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know whether the Leader of the present Government, the Taoiseach, has suddenly become wedded to the idea of a Coalition Government, and what has caused this change of heart in one who preached and prated from one end of the country to the other: &ldquo;We stand alone and we will touch nobody else.&rdquo;  What motives, other than those of seeking power and patronage, coalesced him with the &ldquo;Doubtful Five&rdquo;?  This country was entitled to get, but did not get, a responsible, considered statement from the Leader of a Government, resting as it does on foundations of that type. It is remarkable that, having jettisoned day after day during the election campaign all of its one-time policy, it now comes into the Fourteenth Dáil to assimilate, and grasp at, the policy of <Col N="2148" /> its predecessor.  It was a good policy and we know it.  At least the Taoiseach, as the responsible Leader of the Government, could have had the courage to come into this House to-day and say: &ldquo;We are in Government again now with responsibility, and we intend to discharge that responsibility by accepting the able and intelligent policy given to us by our predecessor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad the Taoiseach is back in the House because I want to ask him, as a member of a different generation, why has it become something of an abhorrence or something not to be touched that we should, in the year 1951, want to hold out our hands as a gesture to the North of Ireland and say to them: &ldquo;All of you, be you anti-Partitionists, Nationalists, or whatever creed or class you like, are welcome to have audience in our Oireachtas&rdquo;?  This view is extraordinary in one who can let his mind go back to the part that he himself played in the establishment of the First Dáil in this country, a Dáil that was ultimately to ensure that the King's writ no longer ran in the present territory of the Republic of Ireland.  It may well be that there are arguments against this method, but I am asking the Taoiseach to consider very well whether the crack of his whip to-night, driving his 69 heroes before him to vote against this motion, is not going to retard the progress that I genuinely believe he himself has sought to make in the Partition problem.  It does seem extraordinary, when one remembers the situation of an all-Party group in the Mansion House Committee striving for a unified Ireland, that we cannot have unanimity, or at least the exercise of free conscience and of a free vote on this problem.  I want the Taoiseach to tell us why.  It is common knowledge to us all that to many elements in the North of Ireland, the present Taoiseach is a symbol of greatness and of leadership. Let us see and consider carefully what might happen to whatever goodwill might be built up when this motion is dealt with to-night.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House but there is one further problem that I <Col N="2149" /> must deal with before I sit down.  It is one that is agitating this country and it is one on which the Taoiseach cannot avoid facing the issue much longer.  There has been controversy under the Health Bill; there has been a question of the constitutionality of parts of the 1947 Act; there has been a responsible and considered document served on the Government at the behest of the Irish Hierarchy objecting to certain portions and certain parts within that Act.  This House and this country are entitled to know from the Taoiseach whether the boast of Deputy Cowan that he would not be subject to or dominated by the Bishops is to be a reality or whether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government, in the light of the responsibility it has to the Irish people and in the light of the responsibility that the Irish Hierarchy has to the Irish people, will give a considered and worthy answer to the Bishops, and whether we will now have an opportunity of solving forever a problem that was deliberately put in a wrong perspective by people trying to exploit a situation for their own ends.  The country is entitled to know what the answer to that problem will be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan's last reference by way of interruption to me is typical of him.  If he might some time remember what he once could have been and might have been, he would be a better ornament to this House.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude on this note, earnestly to exhort the Taoiseach, in the situation, complex as it is, of Deputy MacBride's motion being taken with his own Estimate, at least to allow the issue on the first motion in the name of Deputy MacBride to be one for the free vote of this House, each Deputy exercising his responsibility in the full national consciousness of what his duty should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <P>I do not agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Collins that the attitude and the actions of the Taoiseach in this House to-day <Col N="2150" /> were in any way due to the fact that the Taoiseach is ageing.  In my view, the Taoiseach is one of the ablest and most experienced politicians we have in this country.  I am not saying that in derogation of the Taoiseach.  It is because of that, however, that I was puzzled and surprised this morning to see the Taoiseach, at the end of a few perfunctory remarks in which he said absolutely nothing in introducing his Estimate, resume his seat.</P>
      <P>It was because of that I was surprised, when he was successfully drawn by Deputy Corish, by other Deputies, and by myself, that he still said nothing though he spoke for one and a half hours.  I should like, if I may, in passing, to compliment him for being able to speak for one and a half hours and yet say nothing.  He gave this House no indication of Government policy in any respect.  I defy anybody who reads the Taoiseach's speech this morning to be able to know what the policy of this Government is at the moment, or what it is going to be.</P>
      <P>I was more surprised still to find that, until I asked the Taoiseach what the Government's policy was in regard to Partition, there had not been one single, solitary word uttered from the Government Benches or by any of the Ministers of the Government in relation to what is admittedly the paramount problem of this nation, what is admittedly the paramount objective of the Irish people, namely, the undoing of the unjust and unnatural partition of our country.  We were often told, and told rightly, when sitting on the benches opposite that it was part of the function of a Government to give a lead to the people.  What lead did the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers give the country in the course of these discussions? Naturally, I sought for a reason.  I pointed out that the Taoiseach is one of the ablest and most experienced politicians we have in this country.  He cannot have casually adopted the course he did in this House this morning.  It was not due to lack of experience or to lack of ability, There must have been a reason for it, and I have been puzzled ever since this morning trying to think what his reason might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2151" /> I could easily, I suppose, make a gibe and say it was because the Taoiseach had no policy, or because the Government had no policy.  I do not think that would be the answer.  If the Taoiseach had no policy or if his Government had no policy, he would be able to disguise that fact much more ably than he did this morning.  The only conclusion I could come to was that there must be a very serious difference of opinion within the ranks of his Cabinet.</P>
    <P>There must be a reason for it.  As I said before, the Taoiseach is experienced and he knows it is part of his duty as head of a new Government on the last day of this Session of the Dáil to give a lead, to give an indication of the Government's policy to the country.  There must be a compelling reason to prevent him from following that normal and desirable course.  I do not think that he can shelter himself behind the plea that he has not been long enough in office.  He has been in office since the beginning of June.  In any case, even if he were only a week in office, presumably he has given some thought to the different problems.  He is sufficiently fluent to be able to give expression to the remedies and the solutions which he proposes.</P>
    <P>I warned the Taoiseach on the night upon which he nominated his Government in this House that the most alarming feature of that Government was the appointment by him of Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance.  I did not say that in derogation of Deputy MacEntee personally, whom I believe would be quite a good Minister in some other Department.  To my mind, however, the appointment of Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance was a clear indication that progress in the policy of development and investment which had been pursued successfully during the last few years was going to be brought to a standstill. The speech that the Minister for Finance made yesterday is I think a clear indication of that in so far as the Minister for Finance is permitted to pursue that policy in the present Cabinet.  My only hope is that the Tánaiste and other Minister in that Cabinet will be sufficiently strong to be <Col N="2152" /> able to prevent the Minister for Finance's policy from being given effect to, to be able to prevent us from returning to a mid-Victorian form of economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about emigration this morning.  Incidentally, if I might digress for a moment, the Taoiseach said to-day that he had not had time to have the emigration figures made up.  He made a somewhat similar remark during the general election campaign when relying on figures which were two or three years old.  It might possibly be of assistance to the Taoiseach, on the assumption that his statement was a correct one, if I drew his attention to some of the figures which were given in this House and which were readily available to the Taoiseach at any time he desired at five minutes' notice.</P>

      <P>The figures which in no uncertain fashion indicate emigration in any given year are those which are obtainable from the issue of travel permits and passports to persons seeking employment abroad.  They are somewhat exaggerated because they do include migratory workers who come back, but no person can leave without such a travel permit.  For the information of the Taoiseach, in the year 1948 there were 40,075 such permits and passports issued.  In the year 1949 that had fallen to 25,491.  In the year 1950 the figure had fallen to 17,356.  I think these figures do show <Col N="2154" /> that there was a steady fall in emigration in the course of the last three years.  I merely draw the Taoiseach's attention to that.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach expressed regrets, which we all share, in regard to emigration.  He expressed regrets, which we all share, in regard to the dwindling population of the Gaeltacht.  But the very thing which promotes emigration, which results in the depopulation of the Western seaboard, is the thing which his Minister for Finance is going to promote, namely, the policy of restricting investment, of restricting development here and of building up sterling assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> There are two different approaches to our economic problems.  You may pursue the policy which has been pursued since this State was set up, that of building up sterling assets, of relying on the income from these sterling assets to make up for our adverse balance of trade, but that policy inevitably must result in underinvestment and under-development here.  That policy, too, must inevitably result in, and indeed depends for its success upon, the maintenance of a pool of unemployment and a stream of emigration; another concomitant feature of that policy is a policy of low wages.</P>
    <P>The alternative approach is that of development of our own resources by the utilisation of our capital for that purpose.  The last Government pursued the latter policy for a period of three years, with the results that have been pointed out by Deputy Costello this morning.  As a result of that policy, we have had a lower rate of unemployment in the course of the last three years, and particularly in the last year than at any other period in our history.  We have had more people in employment in this country than ever before.  These developments were rendered possible by the fact that we were prepared to engage in a policy of capital development here and to repatriate sterling assets for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We have been spoken to about the dangers of inflation.  For the last 30 years, the same old worn-out tags have been trotted out by economists, born and bred in the last century, who have talked to us about inflation.  We have no control over inflation in this country. We have not got control of our own currency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot influence inflation.  The inflation from which we suffer here, if inflation occurs, is inflation that occurs from outside, and over which we have no control whatsoever. Inasmuch as we cannot control either the value or volume of our currency, it is quite obvious that we cannot either prevent or promote inflation.  The only <Col N="2157" /> type of inflation that has been noticeable in recent years has been inflation in regard to house property.  Any inflation there has been in that regard was due to the fact that we had not got enough houses and that scarcity prices prevailed.  The remedy for that is to provide more houses.  You cannot increase production unless you are prepared to invest your capital here for that purpose.  Any policy which will involve either the abandonment or the slowing down of the capital development schemes that have been started by the Government can only result in unemployment and more emigration.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Taoiseach was not serious when he made a reference, a casual reference, this morning to our health plans and indicated that they might prove too expensive or too ambitious.  He qualified it immediately afterwards, but I doubt if the Taoiseach would have made the reference to our health plans being too ambitious or too expensive, even if he was qualifying it afterwards, unless he had some reason for doing so.  I hope it is not an indication that it is proposed to curtail the hospital building programme or the health plans.</P>

      <P>I had not intended, in the course of this discussion, to deal with matters other than Partition, but I felt that the attitude of the Taoiseach this morning, or rather his lack of attitude, needed some comment. Again, in regard to Partition, I think that the Taoiseach was particularly evasive.  He knew that the House was discussing, with his Estimate, the two motions that have been standing in my name for a considerable time on the Order Paper.  He knew that these two motions would form the centrepiece of much discussion in the House on his Estimate.  Yet, we got no indication from the Taoiseach as to his attitude in regard to these two motions.</P>
      <P>There is always the danger that, in dealing with long-standing problems and with long-standing difficulties, one's attitude of mind becomes set without very much reason, or very often it becomes set in the light of the circumstances that may have existed at the time that one's mind was set, but which have long ceased to operate.  I think that is what has happened not merely to the Taoiseach but to a great many people in this House in regard to Partition.  We have had no normal political thinking, no normal political development.  Our political life grew up, if you like, out of the divergencies which arose from the civil war.  We have had very little objective thinking in regard to Partition since.  Attitudes in regard to Partition became crystallised in the light of those circumstances rather than in the light of the circumstances as they exist to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be possible to get the members of this House, particularly the older members, to take an objective attitude towards the two motions which stand in Deputy Tully's name and mine.  I feel that if they did, these two motions would be accepted unanimously by the House.  I think that the young men on all sides of this House&mdash;Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil&mdash; agree with these motions.  I think that it is not a question of policy.  I think it has become largely a question of prejudice in the minds of some of the older men who took a set attitude <Col N="2159" /> a number of years ago and who have refused to look beyond that.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with these two motions in any detail, there are a few general observations I would like to make in relation to Partition.  Obviously, the best method of dealing with Partition would have been by the formation of a national Government, representative of all Parties in this House and certainly representative of the major Parties in this House.  That would have been the best way of showing our determination and our resolve to secure the unity of the country.</P>
    <P>That was not possible.  At least, so far as the Taoiseach is concerned, he was not prepared to adopt that course.  I think that the other Parties in the House would have agreed &mdash; not with enthusiasm but would have agreed &mdash; to that course.  I feel that the country would have welcomed it. There would have been a 90 per cent. support for it in the country.  That is really what the people of the country want, but old prejudices die hard!</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would be good enough to indicate in what manner the formation of what he calls a national Government was going to end Partition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  In the final analysis, the continuance of Partition depends on the determination and the ability of the British Government at any given time to maintain Partition.  Partition was created by the British Government and Partition can only continue by virtue of the political, economic and military support which the British Government extends to a minority of the people of the Province of Ulster.  Therefore, in the final analysis, the task of any Irish Government, if it is to undo Partition, depends upon its ability to make the British Government of the day realise that the Irish people are determined not to allow the continuance of Partition and are determined to use every means at their disposal to secure the unity of their nation.  I believe that a reasonable solution, based on the unity of will of the Irish people, on the common interest of the Irish people, North and South, can <Col N="2160" /> be arrived at rapidly, once Britain can be persuaded to cease interfering in our affairs in this island.</P>
      <P>I believe that, so long as Britain is prepared to lend her political, her economic and her military power to any section of our people, in order to maintain a minority Government, the problem remains insoluble.  The first point of attack must be devised to ensure that Britain will let go her hold on portion of our country.  When I say &ldquo;attack&rdquo;, let me clarify it immediately; I am not suggesting a physical attack or a military attack.  In that regard let me make it quite clear, too, that I think the Irish people, through this Parliament, through their Government, have a right to use force in order to secure the reintegration of our national territory, if the Parliament, if the Government, so decide.  It is not a course I advocate, and I do not think it would be a desirable or a necessary course, but it is well to make it quite clear that we, as a nation, are entitled to use every means at our disposal in order to secure control of our own affairs, in order to establish for ourselves the elementary democratic right of national self-determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem to attack, therefore, from a political point of view, is that caused by the claim of the British Government to exerise sovereignty over a portion of our island.  To my mind, that is the first and main obstacle to the ending of Partition.  A powerful State can always interfere successfully in the affairs of a small neighbouring State, if it is prepared to use its economic, political and military power to do so.  In effect, the history of the world could be described as an account of such attempts right through the ages, attempts by large nations to interfere in the affairs of their smaller neighbours. To us in Ireland, the power and prestige of Britain when interfering in our affairs, is as objectionable as was the German or the Russian interference in the affairs of Poland and Czechoslovakia objectionable to those nations.  I think that, in forcing Britain to alter her policy in regard to Ireland, our first task is to compel a realisation of the issues in Britain; to compel the British Government of the <Col N="2161" /> day to understand quite clearly that this nation is determined to end Partition and to secure the enforcement of democratic rule in this island and that all Parties in the State are united for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has asked me how the formation of a national Government would help to do that.  It is quite obvious that if the Taoiseach were able to speak on behalf of a national Government, he could to-morrow, next week or in a month's time, say to the British Government: &ldquo;On behalf of the Irish people, on behalf of a Government united for this purpose, I now ask you to declare that you relinquish your claim to sovereignty over any portion of the island of Ireland,&rdquo; and that he would be able to speak with much greater authority and to command a hearing which he could not command in his present position.  It is quite obvious that, so long as the Taoiseach is dependent for office on the votes of a couple of irresponsibles, such as our gallant captain and some of his friends&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have answered the Taoiseach, who asked me how and in what way a national Government would work in reaching a solution of Partition. I think that in dealing with the British Government a national Government would be infinitely stronger than a one-Party Government, particularly a one-Party Government which is not in a strong position numerically.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in the course of his speech this morning, suggested, I think, that I promised that Partition could be ended within a matter of months.  I have never promised that Partition could be ended.  I said that, in my view, conditions were such now that Partition could be ended within a reasonable space of time, within a short space of time.  That is still my view, if we are in a position to maintain a sufficient degree of unity among ourselves here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in dealing with Partition as far as Britain is concerned is that the British Government has a great many problems of one kind or another.  The first essential is to secure the direct attention of the British Government to the problem of Partition, to make the British Government realise that it is an urgent problem that can no longer be put aside.  I have talked so much on that aspect of the problem that it may be represented afterwards that I ignore the difficulties which we have here.  I am fully conscious of the difficulties we have here.  I realise that Partition has two aspects, the aspect to which I have just referred, namely, Britain's interference here, and the other aspect which concerns our own population in Ireland.  I think that Partition has become much more real in the course of the last ten or 20 years.  We have become detached from our people there, even from the nationalist population; we have drifted apart far more than we should ever have allowed ourselves to drift apart. That is one of the difficulties which I hoped that these motions would remedy.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the motions, I should like to say what the motions do not involve.  I have found, in discussing this matter, that all kinds of completely fictitious arguments are used, probably due to lack of appreciation of the factors involved.  These motions do not involve any amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> This House can, by amending its Standing Orders, admit anyone it likes, to speak or to sit in the Dáil, not to vote in the House.  Therefore, these motions involve no amendment of the Constitution, and we have been so advised by the last Attorney-General. I am not asking in these motions that the Six-County M.P.s should be given a right to vote in this House.  Therefore, when arguments are used to the effect that it would mean power to vote on legislation for the imposition of taxation which would be unfair to the people here, it is not a real argument.  I am not asking that Six-County M.P.s should be given the right to vote.  Personally, but this is a purely personal view, I would give them the right to vote in this House; but I know that if I ask for that in these motions I would be handing a weapon to those who see good reasons for not passing these motions.</P>
    <P>The House will also have noticed that I did not specify in the first motion whether they should be admitted to the Dáil or to the Seanad. I left that to be considered either by this House or by the Government.  I merely asked the Government to initiate proposals to enable them to sit either in the Dáil or in the Seanad, as might be determined.</P>
    <P>Now I would like to refer the House to the provisions of Article 2 of the Constitution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this Parliament is the Parliament established under that Constitution, how can we refuse to admit into it the elected representatives of any portion of Ireland?  What reason can we give? Let us try and have a perspective on this whole matter.  Can the Taoiseach visualise a position in the First Dáil where anybody would have suggested that a T.D. from the Province of Ulster should be excluded from the First Dáil?  Why should we, in the year 1951, come along and say: &ldquo;Oh, we will not allow you into this Chamber; we will not listen to, we will not hear any representatives from the six occupied counties.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="2165" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Imperialism of England is preventing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is even that.  I think it is sheer prejudice.  I think it is due to the factors I mentioned earlier.  I do not know whether I made myself clear, but people are inclined to set their minds in a given set of circumstances and find it difficult to change their minds later on when the circumstances have changed.  As I said before, I am quite satisfied that all the younger men, and a great many of the old men too, on all sides of this House are in favour of that proposal if they felt free to say so.  It is nothing, if you like, but prejudice and stubbornness that prevents this proposal going through.</P>
      <P>The next Article of the Constitution provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Pending the reintegration of the national territory, and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, the laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstát Éireann and the like extra-territorial effect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear from that Article of the Constitution that it is intended that the laws passed by this Parliament shall some time apply to the whole country and, pending the reintegration of the national territory, they shall apply only to a certain portion of the island.  If it is contemplated that the laws which we discuss and pass in this House are, at some stage, to apply to the whole country, would it not be only right that the representatives of the Six Counties, who are at present excluded, should, at least, have an opportunity of being heard in this House on these laws, of telling us their views on these laws, of telling us the effect these laws would have if applied to their portion of the island and of telling us the effect they might have on the ending of Partition?  Why are we afraid to hear what they have to say?  Why are we afraid to consult them?  Are we <Col N="2166" /> sincere when we say that we want an all-Ireland Parliament?  If we are sincere when we say we want an all-Ireland Parliament, why do not we now begin to build an all-Ireland Parliament?  We have not heard one good reason against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Or one good reason for it, yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an argument. That is a flat-footed statement. I have put forward a number of arguments in favour and I hope the Taoiseach will deal with each one of these arguments when replying and not merely try to dismiss the matter casually with the usual see-saw argument that it might be good and might be bad.  I think we are entitled to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make this offer now.  I am willing to stake my political reputation, whatever that may be worth, and retire from public life if I am wrong in saying that, if this matter is submitted to a referendum of the people, it will receive the support of the overwhelming majority of the people.  If there is any doubt, why not do it?  We have machinery for a referendum.  Will the Taoiseach agree to submit this matter to a referendum of the people?  Presumably, we have included in our Constitution provisions for a referendum so that it could be used, so that the people could be consulted and their views obtained on different issues. Would not this be an ideal issue upon which to obtain the views of the Irish people?  Why should we be afraid to ask the views of the Irish people? It is an ideal issue to do it on. We are not raising it as a Party issue.  It is not a Party issue in this House.  We have been told by Deputy Costello that, as far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, they will leave it to a free vote of their Party.  Why not do the same on the other side of the House?  Why not submit this question to the Irish people and let the people decide it by way of referendum? I will undertake to give any assurance the Taoiseach may like that there will not be any attempt to make political capital out of it.  He can submit the <Col N="2167" /> question himself.  We can decide not to have speeches on it if you like.</P>
    <P>As far as the nationalist population of the Six Counties is concerned and as far as their leaders are concerned, they complain, and complain constantly, that we have abandoned them.  Possibly, that complaint is not justified.  Possibly, it is exaggerated but, certainly, we do not act as if Partition was our primary concern.  We do not maintain that closeness of contact with the nationalist population of the Six Counties that we should maintain.</P>
    <P>I agree, possibly, that the leaders of the nationalist population of the Six Counties have not always provided the leadership they should have provided but I am not certain to what extent we are not to blame ourselves and to what extent we have not left them somewhat rudderless at times.  I am sure that a great many of these obstacles could be overcome if the Six-County representatives were sitting in our benches and if they had an opportunity, when the Dáil was sitting, of discussing their problems with us and of our discussing our problems with them.</P>
    <P>We know little of their problems. The Ulster T.D.s, possibly, are closer in touch than the rest.  I venture to say, with all due respect to our Cork T.D.s, that they know very little of the problems that exist in Belfast and of those of the nationalist population. We would get to know a lot about them if we mixed and mingled with them here.  Likewise, I think that the presence of Six-Counties' representatives here would enable us to discuss the future economic development of this nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>References were made in this House yesterday by Deputy Costello, junior, to the possibility of a customs union. If a customs union were a feasible possibility, I would agree with a customs union.  I do not think it is a possibility because in fact there is a customs union at the moment between that area and Britain.</P>
    <P>I do, however, believe in pursuing in economic matters the functional approach, namely, the seeking of individual solutions for joint economic <Col N="2168" /> problems and difficulties.  There are many problems which we will have to solve whenever we succeed in ending Partition, and I do not think that we have, either as a Parliament or through our Governments, ever faced up to the many problems that will be created by the ending of Partition.  I think that it is work which should be undertaken now.  We should begin to examine from now on the economic consequence of the ending of Partition; we should begin to plan from now on the economic development not merely of twenty-six counties but of thirty-two counties as one unit; this would make the task much easier when we get to the stage of ending the political division which exists.  For that reason I was very anxious that we should, if possible, secure agreement for the setting up of a central all-Ireland Transport Authority.  I think that that would have been a useful step forward.  It would have benefited the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six Counties, and I would have been prepared to go quite a long distance to achieve such an authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello made a valuable contribution this morning, and referred to the proposals which he had made for some form of liaison between a unity council in the Six Counties and the Government.  I think that is an excellent proposal; I have supported it and I think it is a constructive suggestion, but I do not think that it is exclusive. I think it is one of the necessary steps. There should be a unity council of all the different groups who are opposed to the continuance of Partition in the Six Counties, and that council should provide the leadership of the anti-Partition movement in the Six Counties. There should be a direct link between that council and the Government, preferably with one Minister charged with that special responsibility, but I do not think that it in any way impinges upon the proposal to admit to this House elected representatives of the people from the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I hope that whatever attitude the Taoiseach and the Government may take regarding these motions they will in any event pursue the suggestions made by Deputy Costello regarding the formation of a unity council and <Col N="2169" /> the establishment of some sort of direct contact between the Government and that unity council.  I hope that these proposals will be considered by this House objectively.  We should be in a position to discuss matters of that kind objectively without reference to past prejudice or to Party affiliations, so let us examine the proposal objectively and take a free decision on it.  I hope that those proposals will not be made the occasion by some of our more irresponsible Deputies of making utterances which will do more damage.  I think that a considerable amount of damage was done by Deputy Captain Cowan and his announcement that he intended to start a private army to march on the North, and also that a considerable amount of irreparable damage was done by Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>

      <P>I would appeal again to the Taoiseach to consider this matter very carefully. If he examines it really objectively himself he will realise that his resistance arises more from the fact that his mind was set against it a few years ago, but conditions have changed since and I would appeal to him to reconsider the position in the light of existing circumstances as I think it would be a help to the nation as a whole.</P>

      <P>A number of points were raised this morning on which I would like to say a few words before I go on to speak on the motions on the Order Paper.  Deputy Corish asked the Taoiseach this morning for some indication of the policy the present Government intend to pursue in matters of an economic social nature.  We had a lengthy rambling statement from the Taoiseach in which he gave us very little information on the lines sought by Deputy Corish, <Col N="2170" /> but in the course of that rambling statement the Taoiseach referred to what he would like to see done in the congested areas and what he would like to see done regarding the methods to revive the Irish language.  One statement that he made has stayed in my mind and will stay there for many a day.  He was dealing with the problem of keeping the Irish language alive and at the same time giving a living to those people in the areas where Irish is the spoken language at the moment.  The Taoiseach expressed the fear that, by providing industrial employment in those congested areas, we were in danger of doing damage to the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I questioned the Taoiseach when he was in the middle of his statement because I could hardly believe my ears that a man in his position would go so far as to say that in those areas where congestion exists the Irish language must come before the living of the people and that he would preserve the language and let the people starve in those areas rather than harm the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I proceeded to question the Taoiseach with regard to his policy of development in the Gaeltacht areas, he went on to say that we must be very careful how we move in these areas.  In other words, he realised that he had put his foot in it by his previous statement.  He said that we must be very careful, in regard to whatever development works that were undertaken in the West, that the language did not suffer.  He also expressed the view that wherever industrial development took place and wherever industrial employment was given, it tended to change the outlook of the people and that, naturally, as a result of that, the Irish language would suffer.  To my mind, that is not sound policy : it is one with which most Deputies do not agree&mdash;and that includes many members of his own Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs intervened to state that the present Opposition, which was formerly the inter-Party Government, had closed down industries in the West of Ireland. I am not going to throw any bouquets at the inter-Party Government for their work in regard to industrial development in the West but I will give them the credit that they attended to one of the things that was essential in order to improve the position of the people <Col N="2172" /> living on small uneconomic holdings in the West&mdash;drainage&mdash;and, undoubtedly, splendid work has been done in the past three years in the West of Ireland under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>Having listened to Deputy MacEntee last night and to the Taoiseach to-day, I am inclined to believe that Fianna Fáil or the present Government&mdash;I do not know how they should be described, perhaps as a &ldquo;platypus&rdquo;&mdash; do not intend to pursue an energetic programme with regard to drainage.  I believe that when the change of Government took place the people responsible for arterial drainage, and so forth, in the particular Department sat back with a sigh of relief and said to themselves: &ldquo;We will not have to work so hard in the future.&rdquo;  I had proof here to-day that the present Government is not really interested in drainage.  I do not want to go into details, but I had a question down about the proposals to drain a river in the West of Ireland.  That particular river had been very low on the priority list during the Fianna Fáil <i>régime</i> before 1948.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs is very annoyed to-day.  If he wants any information about drainage or arterial drainage, all he has to do is to look up the records of this House.  He will find that though the Arterial Drainage Act was passed in 1945 not one penny was spent on the purchase of machinery or on the employment of engineers between 1945 and 1948, when the inter-Party Government took office.  That was the attempt that Fianna Fáil made in regard to arterial drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything is untrue, according to the Minister, except what he himself says.  I am not satisfied that the inter-Party Government made good progress in connection with industrial development in the West.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing the hope that the promise made by the Tánaiste that all possible steps will be taken by this Government to increase industrial employment in the West and develop that area will be lived up to and carried out.  I am afraid that when we compare the statement made by the Tánaiste with the statement made by the Minister for Finance it is very difficult for an ordinary Deputy to convince himself that both statements agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, the statement of the Minister for Finance expressed the view that retrenchment was necessary and that it was his intention to curtail capital development works in the country.  If the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, is going to get a free rein in that regard, I cannot see how the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, can hope to carry out his policy with regard to industrial development in the West.  In the three years during which the inter-Party Government was in office I <Col N="2174" /> understand that approximately 150 to 200 people obtained employment in industry in the West of Ireland.  That is a very low figure.  From a question which I asked in this House I gather that only nine new factories were opened in the West out of a total of somewhere near 150 that were opened in the country as a whole.  That is a very small proportion for the West of Ireland, when you consider that over 17 per cent. of the population of the country lives in Connacht alone.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach has nominated a young Deputy whose responsibility it will be to co-ordinate the work of various Departments so that everything possible can be done for the Irish-speaking congested areas, especially in the West of Ireland.  When the Taoiseach was appointing a Parliamentary Secretary for this work, the least he might have done would have been to choose somebody from the West of Ireland who would be familiar with the problems of the congested areas, and familiar with life in general in the West.</P>
    <P>I am not casting any aspersions on the Deputy who was appointed.  As an individual I have a profound respect for him but, in justice to the Deputy himself, I think it was unfair to put him into that position in view of the fact that he comes from an area far removed from the western seaboard.  I am sure there are plenty of Deputies in Fianna Fáil who have a thorough knowledge of the western counties and the western seaboard and of the problems that have to be tackled there. However, it is a matter for the Taoiseach and I wish Deputy Lynch the best of luck in his appointment and I hope that the problems outstanding in the West for the past 30 years will receive very careful consideration from him.  I hope, too, that he will be successful in remedying even some of the grievances that exist.</P>
    <P>In connection with the two motions on the Order Paper I know of no sound reason why these two motions should not be accepted.  I am speaking now as a young Deputy who was not born in 1916.  In this House before one is allowed to speak it seems to be essential <Col N="2175" /> that one should have taken part either in the 1916 Rising or in the troubled years between 1919 and 1922. Repeatedly insults are hurled across the floor of the House and valuable time is wasted on this business of &ldquo;Where were you in 1916?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What side were you on in 1922?&rdquo; This is the first time I have ever mentioned this matter here and I am glad to have had this opportunity of doing so because this is a very important Estimate.</P>
    <P>To the older men here I offer nothing but the greatest respect.  They did a good job when it was needed.  They have the thanks of the present generation, but I would like them to remember that &ldquo;Time marches on&rdquo; and they alone cannot accomplish the unification of our country.  A new generation has grown up and that new generation feels it should have some say and some responsibility in this matter.  Up to the present that generation has not been listened to; up to the present very few young men have entered political life.  Up to the present the older generation have maintained that grasp on politics which to my mind is responsible for much of the bitterness throughout the years.</P>
    <P>I understand the Taoiseach is not in favour of either of these motions. He has not given us any reasons for his disapproval.  He has asked instead for sound reasons as to why the duly elected representatives of the six northern-eastern counties should be allowed in here.  Is it not a sound reason to invite them in here for the purpose of helping us to end Partition? What sounder reason could one want?  We all hope the Border will be removed.  I know, of course, that if people make up their minds along certain lines all the soundest reasons in the world will not change them; in other words, if they do not want to do something they can always find fairly good reasons to convince themselves that they are right.</P>
    <P>The view has been expressed by certain people on this side that Partition could be ended within a short space of time.  That is only a view and I do not accept that view.  When <Col N="2176" /> one looks back over the past 30 years and see how little has been accomtion, one can only conclude that we are no nearer its solution to-day than we were in 1925.  Talking about Partition will not solve Partition.  It is the duty of every Deputy to do whatever he can to help towards removing the Border.</P>
    <P>I think the idea contained in the first of these motions is a sound one. It would at any rate help to break down some of the prejudices that have grown up.  I do not care whether the people who come are Orangemen, Nationalists or Republicans.  I think they should all be welcomed here and in the Seanad.  That is the only way in which we can get to know their minds.  I think we have an excellent opportunity now of proving to the world that we are sincere in wanting to bring about an end of Partition, in offering the hand of friendship and equality to those people in the northeastern portion of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think that if we do not pass the first motion we would leave ourselves open to a great deal of criticism outside this country, and that we shall be giving a strong lever to Britain, which she can use against us in the world councils because anybody could get up at any of these councils in which we have functions and ask our delegates: &ldquo;How on earth do the people in the Twenty-Six Counties maintain that they want to end Partition when Dáil Éireann refused to admit elected representatives from the North to their Parliament?&rdquo; I think that weapon should never be put into the hands of the British Government.  At any rate, I shall do my utmost as one individual to secure the right of admittance for any elected representative from the North to this House or the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I say, with all sense of responsibility, that I shall do the utmost within my power, irrespective of the consequences, to see that elected representatives from the North are allowed into the Oireachtas, even for the right of audience alone, although I personally think that that is a very small right to grant them, and that they should be given fuller powers than are indicated in this motion.  At any rate, for a start <Col N="2177" /> I think that for the reasons that have been already covered by the mover of the motion, it is desirable that they should be given the right of audience.  I would urge on the Taoiseach not to divide the House on such an important motion as this. There are young men in all Parties.  I have talked this matter over with them and they agree that we should hold out the hand of friendship to the representatives from the Six Northern Counties. I think it is very unfair to prevent these Deputies from expressing their true belief, when it comes to a division. I would ask, even at this late stage, that the Taoiseach should take off the Party Whips and leave this matter to a free vote of the House.</P>

      <P>The handful of Deputies who were present this morning in the House when the Taoiseach introduced his Estimate must have been impressed by a certain element of tragedy in the Taoiseach's statement.  The formal introduction of the Estimate was made by the Taoiseach in a very perfunctory way.  The introduction consisted of a couple of hundred words which gave no indication whatsoever as to what the policy of the Government might be in relation to the future of this country. It was only when Deputy Corish and some other Deputies insisted on asking the Taoiseach to let us in on his plans that the Taoiseach made an effort to meet the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody here present will have been struck by the sad effort that was made and by the absolute bankruptcy of ideas displayed in the Taoiseach's speech which lasted an hour and ten minutes, but which added up to practically nothing.  The Taoiseach said that the policy of this Government was the same policy that Fianna Fáil had always followed and could be put under a number of headings.  He went on to talk in vague and general terms of what was desirable for this country under economic, cultural, social and political headings, in a somewhat different order. What he said could have been said by a school child of 12 years of age.  The first time that I ever remember those principles being laid down was, I think, when reading them as the <Col N="2179" /> principles which were dear to the United Irishmen in '98.  They have been repeated by every Irish organisation and Party since that time.  They were repeated here this morning by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a bad headline, if you want to talk in general terms of what is good for the country, but if you want to talk about what the Government proposes to do this year for this country, surely it is not sufficient that we should be treated to vague general expressions of what is desirable and what is not desirable.  Surely we should be given some concrete plans which are likely to affect the everyday lives of the people of the nation.  We did not get any such ideas whatsoever.  We got no intimation from the Taoiseach, good, bad or indifferent, as to what this Government intended to do, what its policy was in various matters, other than a policy of carrying on what the previous Government had done.</P>
      <P>There were many attacks in this House on every conceivable occasion on the previous Government, so that some sections of the people came to think that the inter-Party Government was made up of a collection of saboteurs whose only anxiety was to wreck the economy of this country. Now we are presented with the position that those who set out to create that impression among the people can do no better than just follow along and endeavour to measure up to the standard set by the previous Government.  We were not even told that this morning.  The present Government is so bankrupt of ideas that they propose to try to do that as best they can in their own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the short time the present Government has been in office, what evidence have we seen of what is in store for the people of this country? One of the first things we saw was the sop that was thrown out to Deputy Cogan for his vote, the increase in the price of farmers' milk. Before the election the official Government organ was talking about bargaining behind the scenes, about efforts to induce this or that Independent <Col N="2180" /> Deputy to vote one way or the other. It was obvious to everybody, when all that talk was over, that the bargaining which was done was not done on this side of the House.  The bargaining which was done on that score alone was done entirely as between the Fianna Fáil Party or agents of the Fianna Fáil Party and at least one of the Independent Deputies, Deputy Cogan, to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>What is the result of this increase in the price of creamery milk?  There are many farmers' representatives in this country and many farmers in the creamery areas who felt that, even before the increase of a penny per gallon was given earlier this year by the previous Government, the farmers were not doing too badly at all. Although we had Deputy Corry and other representatives coming in here and making the poor mouth on every possible occasion they could, there were honourable and honest people who thought the farmers were not doing too badly even before they got the first penny per gallon.  However, in order to meet the well-organised demand that sprang up from the country, the previous Government decided to give the farmers another penny per gallon in the price of creamery milk, and that, as we know, resulted in an increase of 2d. per lb. in the price of butter.</P>
    <P>I know very well there is in this House quite a representative group of people whose only concern is to see that every possible penny that can be taken from the urban population and from the working-class people in the rural areas should be taken from them and put into the pockets of those who have property, the farmers, particularly in the South of Ireland.  There are people who think that is the best thing that can be done for the nation, people who see no value whatsoever in having some kind of balanced economy where everybody will get a fair deal. There are people who advocate that policy unceasingly and probably believe it.  Now we have the position that one of the first acts of the present Government was a further infliction upon the working people of the country in the nature of a further increase in the price of butter in order to make it possible <Col N="2181" /> to give the farmers a further penny in the gallon for milk.</P>
    <P>What was the first reaction we had from Deputies like Deputy Corry, who urged the present Minister for Agriculture to do that act, which was a kindly act to the farmers but certainly was not a friendly act so far as the consuming public are concerned?  What was the first reaction of Deputy Corry and others: &ldquo;It is not enough,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;We want more.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And we will have to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We may anticipate that there are many things in store for the people of this country in so far as the present Government's agricultural policy is concerned.  The increased price of milk is one indication of the trends that may be coming in agriculture. Agricultural prices must be driven up, not by a policy of increasing production, or making the land more productive so that the farmers will gain more by reason of getting a greater volume of production from their land. That is not the policy; the policy being pursued now is to give the highest possible price for the least possible production.  The net result of that will be that, despite the fact that the people living in cities and towns are making it possible, in the long run, for the agricultural section of the community to live&mdash;because it is an inter-dependent economy we have in this country, one which is not made up entirely of farmers or agriculturists no more than it is made up entirely of factory workers or city workers&mdash; we will have scales of wages more decidedly in favour of certain interests of the agricultural community, against those who may live in the cities and towns, against the consuming public; that means in the last analysis against the workers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another indication of that fact seems to be the appointment to the position of Minister for Finance of no less a person than Deputy Seán MacEntee.  I have referred on previous occasions to Deputy MacEntee's reputation in so far as his attitude to the ordinary people of this country is <Col N="2182" /> concerned and in relation to matters such as the cost of living and wages. Everybody in Ireland knows, and it does not need me to say it, that Deputy MacEntee was a strong advocate, during Fianna Fáil's previous administration, of keeping a tight fist on wages.  His record as Minister for Local Government is ample proof, if proof were needed, that the workers of this country may expect very little sympathy from him in so far as wages are concerned, and, of course, wages are of supreme importance to the vast majority of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I was not present last night when he made his speech but, from what I can learn of it, there was evidence that he had not departed in any degree from his oft-displayed convictions in that regard.  The workers of Ireland know, then, what to expect from Deputy MacEntee, and he fits into the picture of the general governmental set-up.  On the one hand, there is the progression under agriculture which I have described, and on the other hand we have, as Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Finance should be the dominant figure in any Government, a Deputy who, to say the most charitable thing of him, does not hold the confidence of the people of this country and, in particular, of the workers of this country.  I am being very charitable in my remarks about him, far more charitable, I am sure, than he would be in his remarks were he referring to me.</P>
    <P>What does the future hold for the people of this country?  The Taoiseach did not tell us.  I am wondering how the Fianna Fáil policy of <i>laissez faire,</i> which was enunciated here to-day, in so far as it may be described as any policy at all, is going to be aligned with the oft-expressed, progressive socialism of Deputy Peadar Cowan. Deputy Cowan forsook the inter-Party set-up in the belief that he would find a more progressive policy with Fianna Fáil, or so he stated.  He took occasion here more than once to take us to task in so far as our Labour principles are concerned.</P>
    <P>No effort has been made to explain how Fianna Fáil are going to meet the Socialist principles which Deputy Cowan enunciated here as being his.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2183" /> In what manner are they going to pay him for his support?  Will it be as substantial as the manner in which they have repaid Deputy Cogan, who at least secured for a small section of people an increase in the price of milk?  What is going to be done for Deputy Cowan?  Can we take it that part of the bargain will be a cessation of the hostilities we used to witness here when the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, used to describe Deputy Cowan as a sawdust Cæsar and a red cardinal from the Kremlin and in endearing terms of that character?  Perhaps we will hear no more of that.  It may be part of the bargain that that sort of attack should cease.  Will we have anything more substantial?  Are we going to hear more about Deputy Cowan's social principles, which he stated made him vote for Fianna Fáil, and are they to be put into effect?  That is a question I would be interested in.</P>
    <P>There are other alignments which give us reason to ask the question: what do they mean?  What are we going to get in the way of a motherand-child scheme as to which no indication was given?  Will it be a scheme that will meet the wishes of Deputy Dr. Browne, or a scheme that could easily meet the wishes of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello? We should like to know these things; these are things which the public would like to know, because all these things fit into the weft and woof of the intrigue which brought about the existence of this Government.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was one of the chief weavers in that little conspiracy. Prior to the establishment of this Government the cost of living was the subject of very much comment in this House.  We have not heard a great deal of it since the Government was established, but the people outside this House have felt its effects considerably. We had an increase in the price of butter within a matter of days. We had an increase in the price of <Col N="2184" /> electricity.  These and other matters are of tremendous importance to the ordinary people.  Shortly after the establishment of this Government, the Tánaiste stated in this House that he had no hope of stopping the cost of living from rising, that the best he could do was to try to restrain it.  We set out at least to endeavour to prevent it from rising and very successfully held the cost of living for a long time.  If Deputy Corry and others had their way, the cost of living would have been driven sky-high.  It will be next to impossible now to prevent it. I dare say the Tánaiste was being realistic in what he said.  Realising the nature of some of the gentlemen behind him and the demands made upon him and his Government, in order to keep them quiet he must do something to meet these demands.  He must do something to keep Deputy Cogan and even Deputy Corry and others walking in the right direction through the Division Lobby.  That means that the cost of living must go up; he admitted that much.  The people know what to expect and it has been a matter for very considerable comment throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters which were not referred to by the Taoiseach to any extent.  He talked about emigration. He said he was in England recently and had an opportunity of talking with Irish exiles and he was astounded and appalled at some of the conditions of Irish workers there which were described to him.  I personally do not like to be uncharitable to the Taoiseach, nor would I like to be uncharitable to anybody, particularly those whom Deputy McQuillan referred to as being more or less the elder statesmen in this House.  But surely the Taoiseach heard of the Irish workers' conditions in England before this year? For 16 years he was Taoiseach and this will be his 17th year.  He has been living more than twice as long as I have.  Irish workers suffered intolerable conditions in England and in Scotland in the bothies and other places. The conditions of the long-distance men, the navvies and others were described 20 or 30 years ago as being intolerable.  There has not been very <Col N="2185" /> much change; in fact, the only change was for the worst.</P>
    <P>When our people went to Britain in thousands during the war, as well as having to endure verminous lodgings and low wages, they had to endure German bombs and the terrors of war. Yet the Taoiseach this morning said, &ldquo;I was in England recently and was appalled to hear of these conditions.&rdquo; That makes me wonder that such a statement should be made by any responsible person in this country.  As I say, these conditions have existed for many years.  The only steps to alter them were taken by the men themselves and their trade union organisations.  I do not recall any Irish Government having made any attempt, beyond a cursory inspection at intervals of years, to see that these conditions were brought to any kind of a decent level. I do recall during the last 15 years several tragedies such as the Kirkin-tulloch tragedy and the hooker sinking with Irish migratory workers after leaving the port of Galway.  These conditions were known then when Fianna Fáil had more strength as a Government than they have now, but nothing was done about them and it is late in the day now to talk about the conditions of Irish workers in England.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated that he was not satisfied in regard to certain figures so far as emigration is concerned. These figures, which were quoted by Deputy MacBride, showed very clearly that there has been a reduction in the number of people emigrating during the last few years. The Taoiseach disputed the accuracy of those figures.  He is well known to be a pretty good manipulator of figures. Mathematicians, I suppose will never agree as to what figures are accurate and what figures are not.  To a nonmathematical mind such as my own it seems that there has been a reduction in emigration, particularly in the period during which the inter-Party Government was in office.</P>
    <P>No matter what may be said, one thing is evident to everybody, that from 1948 to the end of 1950 there was a greater degree of employment in this country and, consequently, a lesser <Col N="2186" /> degree of emigration than ever before. Although many people will say that most emigrants are people who want to travel, I think the root cause of emigration is the inability of the individual to get a satisfactory job in his own country, one on which he can live.  Some attempt was made in the last three years to meet that problem. Workers have been given employment near their homes, or as near as possible, at wages which have been progressively raised.  That represented a big change from the previous 16 years, and brought about a reduction in emigration.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak at very great length on this Estimate because, having listened to some very long speeches, I can understand the feeling of those who are waiting to speak.  I do want to say, however, that if any proof were needed of the absolute ineptitude of the Fianna Fáil Government in the present circumstances, it has been provided by the speech of the Taoiseach. I hope I am not being too unkind to him when I say that it would have been of tremendous political good to every Party in the entire Opposition if the Irish people had been able to listen to the Taoiseach this morning in the House, because definitely it was a speech that was empty of anything, of any coherent proposals that would benefit the people.  It was simply a reiteration of what every Irish leader, from Wolfe Tone to the present day, no matter what his politics, whether he was reactionary or progressive, whether he was on the Left or the Right or in the middle, whether he was constitutional or a physical force man, has said.  Every one of them could have subscribed to what the Taoiseach said here this morning, and it would still not mean a snap of the fingers.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the motions which appear on the Order Paper with regard to those who are elected representatives of the people of the six occupied counties and the according to them of right of audience in Oireachtas Éireann.  I believe that that is a step which should be supported.  I do not think that any more effective step could be taken to bring to the attention of the entire <Col N="2187" /> world the injustice of Partition.  I understand that the Taoiseach proposes to oppose this and to lead his troops into the Lobby against this motion.</P>
    <P>It is interesting in this context for us to recall what happened on a previous occasion when something similar occurred in the history of this country.  In September, 1922, when this Assembly was first convened, it was then described by its opponents as the Southern Parliament.  The entire question as to whether or not it was to be regarded as a Partitionist Assembly hung upon the question of whether a certain Seán O'Mahony, who represented the division of Fermanagh, as it then was, and a Mr. Ginnell would be invited to sit in the House.  Some Deputies here will remember that.</P>
    <P>We have a somewhat analogous situation at the present time.  These two gentlemen did not take their seats, as far as I can discover, but the Leader of the Government, the present Taoiseach, made it plain at that time that he would regard their reception here as a determining factor in deciding whether this Assembly was Partitionist or not, particularly in the case of Mr. O'Mahony.</P>
    <P>We now have the situation that a man has been elected to a constituency across the Border.  The constituents in that area were told that, if elected, he would seek the right of audience in this Assembly, the sovereign Parliament of the nation.  He was elected. I may say, incidentally, that the Labour Party had a candidate in the same election, on a different programme, but Mr. McGlennan was elected on that strict understanding that he would seek a right of audience here.</P>
    <P>I am astounded that the Leader of the Government, the man who, 30 years ago, made it a test as to whether this Parliament was Partitionist or not &mdash;a similar test to what is being made now&mdash;would vote against the motions which are in the names of Deputies MacBride and Tully.</P>
    <P>I feel that every justice attends upon the case which the Northern people <Col N="2188" /> who are claiming to sit in this Parliament have.  Like others, I do not think that this right can be claimed only for nationalists.  I think that every elected representative across the Border, in our lost province, should have the right to come to Dáil Éireann and to speak his mind and should get a céad míle fáilte here, even Sir Basil Brooke himself.  It would be a great thing if that could be brought to pass. Some day, please God, it will be brought to pass.  There is nothing surer than that.  Perhaps not in the lifetime of some people here, perhaps not in my lifetime, but there is nothing surer than that one day there will be an Assembly in this country wherein representatives of all the sections of the people will meet.  Let us hasten that day as much as we can.  Whatever little thing we can do now to bring that day nearer should be done.</P>
    <P>There are many of us who do not agree, possibly, with the social or economic policies that may be enunciated from time to time by our brother nationalists in the North. Some of us would take issue with at least some of the North very easily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are already doing that.  Practically everybody in this House is a nationalist or, if you like, a republican, and believes in the integrity of the 32 Counties and in the sovereignty of the Republic of the 32 Counties.</P>
      <P>There are differences in regard to social and economic policies in so far as the internal administration of the country is concerned.  I do not deny that there are differences between individuals here and individuals who make up part of the nationalist minority in the North of Ireland, but upon the general question of the integrity of the nation and of the right of the nation to unity and to one Parliament there is no difference, there cannot be any difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that we would be doing a constructive thing in extending to the elected representatives of the people of the six occupied counties the right to speak here on subjects in which they <Col N="2189" /> are interested and which affect the entire country.  We have been talking about Partition for a long time.  Some people would be inclined to the view that the time for talk is long past.  The fact that within very recent years men lost their patience in waiting resulted in their finding themselves in jails throughout the Twenty-Six Counties as well as the Six Counties and in British jails.  Some of them whom I recall very well as my own friends eventually met the death of a soldier or the hangman's rope.  All these men were good Irishmen.  Some of them loved this country, like many before them, not wisely but too well.</P>
    <P>If we are to carry on the tradition that has been handed to us by brave men who had varying policies and varying beliefs as to the internal administration of this country, but who all held fast and firm a strong belief in the divine right of the people of this country to unity and independence, if we are to honour those men who have gone before, not alone those who went in 1916, 1920 and 1922, on both sides, but those who went within the last ten or 12 years, if we are to honour them all&mdash; God rest the souls of all of them&mdash;I believe we should support these two motions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his observations earlier to-day, Deputy Costello was challenging the Minister for Finance to make clear what the policy of the Government was going to be in regard to such matters as investment and the dissipation of external assets.  I think we should be very clear on this side of the House as to our future plans, and as to what we really mean in that regard.  The Minister for Finance, in the course of his speech on his Estimate, indicated that there were seven points on which there should be some agreement among us all.  He referred, in particular, to what he described as &ldquo;the unwieldy programme of capital expenditure, the trading position which we had with the rest of the world, and the dissipation of our external assets.&rdquo;  He also referred to the very considerable items for which no provision had been made in the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> The thing that I wish particularly to emphasise this evening is the fact that the seven point policy stressed by the present Minister for Finance was, in fact, virtually composed and prepared by Deputy McGilligan, the former Minister for Finance, the only difference being that he was compelled, for political reasons, to refrain from stating in detail how he proposed to put that policy into operation.  He was compelled to leave the electorate, at the time of the general election, ignorant of the not perhaps very serious dangers, but the dangers that confronted the country from the financial point of view.  I think it just as well to remind the House that Deputy McGilligan realised himself, at that time, that there would have to be a certain re-examination of the Government's financial policy, and that that re-examination was overdue.  Therefore, when the present Minister for Finance suggested the necessity for a re-examination, he was really only following out in greater detail, with greater realism, greater truth and with more facts at his command the rather vague warnings given by the previous Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose there is any need for me to quote at great length from the Budget statement of Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance.  He made it perfectly clear in a number of paragraphs in that statement that the position could not continue as it was.  The Budget speech is to be found in Volume 125 of the Dáil Debates.  Under the heading: &ldquo;Investment and Stockpiling,&rdquo; at column 1882, the then Minister for Finance had this to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been estimated by the Central Statistics Office that the increase in external disinvestment of £20,000,000 in 1950 as compared with 1949 has been accompanied by a net addition of £6,500,000 to physical capital at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He added that he was glad to say that not all the balance of £13,500,000 was dissipated in consumption.  He indicated quite clearly there that the principle upon which money should be spent&mdash;money that was invested abroad &mdash;on capital services here, was not <Col N="2191" /> being followed, that the whole principle, in fact, had been abandoned, and that we were selling our external investments not only for necessary stockpiling, stockpiling of a desirable character, but also for what are, relatively, luxuries.</P>
    <P>We, in Fianna Fáil, have always realised that it is very easy to talk blandly and glibly about the investment of money at home&mdash;money that is now invested abroad.  If you change the policy in regard to that, you have to make sure of what you believe the results will be.  One would think from listening to Deputy MacBride that we, on this side of the House, know nothing whatever about the investment of capital at home in this country, or of encouraging private individuals to start industries by using their capital or using their savings.  I do not see why one should have to indulge in elementary economics in this House, but, from hearing discussions on this matter, it would appear necessary for me once more to state the Fianna Fáil view in regard to a return of external assets.  The Fianna Fáil view is this, that if I, or anybody else, have £100 invested in British War Loan and I receive an income of £3 a year from it for which I buy a pair of shoes, that it would be very much better if I sold out the £100 of war loan and helped somebody to invest it in boot-making machinery here and, on the interest which I received from the boot factory, to buy my pair of shoes or anything else that I needed.</P>
    <P>That is the right definition of economic policy in reference to a return of external assets, but that is not what the last Government has been doing.  Money has been brought back home for non-essential purposes and it was that which Deputy McGilligan was warning the House against at the time of the Budget. Speaking, again, at column 1883, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The rise in import prices should, in due course, expend itself.  It would, however, be optimistic to expect an early reduction in the trade deficit.  The outlook for 1951 <Col N="2192" /> is, I fear, that the deficit may be even greater than in 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present position on external accounts is by no means satisfactory, and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even since that date, there has been a continuation of the adverse position, and it was not only the present Minister for Finance, but the last Minister for Finance who, driven at last to the truth in some fundamentals, was calling for corrective measures and was warning the public that they would come.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the materials are still available it is right that the State and private individuals should proceed with productive capital development to the utmost extent possible.  It is, however, also desirable that the public should transfer to the State for the purposes of its capital development programme a greater share of the purchasing power now being expended on the less essential consumer goods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, Deputy McGilligan was going further, almost, in detail than the present Minister for Finance in warning the public that he was printing money against no known production, that the printing of money could not continue, and that you could not either raid the Post Office Fund or make use of the Counterpart Fund without, in effect, printing notes for which there was not in advance any evidence of increased production to justify it.  He was warning the public that there was a limitation to that kind of thing; that you could, for a time, perfectly easily make use of the Post Office savings to balance the Budget, that you could make use of the Counterpart Fund, and that you could ask the banks to invest their own deposits instead of inviting the public to invest them in a national loan&mdash;that you could do all these things, but that the time would come when the whole question would have to be revised.</P>
    <P>Neither the then Minister for <Col N="2193" /> Finance, nor his Party, had the courage, before the election, to take any definite steps in that direction. They did not even promise a modification of their programme, and they took no definite steps to provide for all the items in the Budget.  They left it to the present Government to deal with these problems.  That was not opposed in any way by any of the members of the Coalition Parties.  They evidently reserved their criticism, knowing that an election was inevitable.  The then Minister for Finance, speaking at column 1884, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious. We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.</P>
    <P>Additional saving would ease the congestion that now exists and causes consumer demand to seek an outlet in imports.  It would relieve the pressure on the balance of payments and help to confine external disinvestment&mdash;or surplus imports&mdash;to what is needed for home development...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;by which, I suppose, he referred to capital development, the import of machinery&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... or for stockpiling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a very definite warning by the Minister for Finance.  He made it perfectly clear to the House at that time that, although he was unable or unwilling to make any definite proposals, there would have to be changes and that he was only hanging on, so to speak, with his bare teeth to the edge of the rock in the hope that he would not fall, in the hope that something would turn up before there would have to be, not necessarily a very drastic modification, but some modification of the general financial policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in talking about financial matters is that, in order to emphasise a point, it is very easy to exaggerate, and it is my duty to-night to make it perfectly clear that the Government could not possibly contemplate any violent change in policy, but <Col N="2194" /> will simply have to study the situation from month to month during the current financial year.  Any violent change made would almost certainly bring about unemployment and any violent change made might have just as adverse an effect on the economy of the country as some of the foolish policy of the previous Government in regard to financial matters.  We have to warn the public that the cost of living is going to rise considerably in the future, due partly to this policy which we inherited of increasing the note issue inevitably through borrowing moneys for which there have not been corresponding savings.  Practically every country in Europe in the past ten years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am dealing with that matter.  Practically every country in Europe has had to go through the third phase in its economic life in which they have had to face the difficulties that arise from a series of situations parallel with those which took place here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies know the order of events: that there was a great scarcity of goods during the war; that plans were made for new capital development after the war; that money is generally released and put into circulation through various political or economic influences before the goods or the machinery are available; that there is generally a sharp rise in the cost of living almost immediately after the war; that that can be checked in various ways; and that then a country desiring to go full speed ahead with new development starts investing and expending large sums in capital development and, sooner or later, finds that it has gone a little too far in certain respects and <Col N="2195" /> that certain retrenchments of a minor or major character, according to the conditions obtaining, have to be made. The Swedish Government have been through the process; the Danish Government have been through the process; and so have the New Zealanders. Practically every Government has, so to speak, to take a jerk on itself sooner or later in what might be described as the third or fourth period of post-war economy.</P>
      <P>One of the things that has arisen in the case of this country is that we faced one situation which we had hoped we would not have to face, a reopening of an emergency state, increases in prices resulting from what might be termed a semi-war inflation economy.  That was the circumstance that arose in July of last year.  The previous Government saw it inevitably coming, and, so far as we can ascertain, they took no very noticeable steps to overcome the difficulties that would arise.  As I have said, the great thing to do on these occasions is to foresee the difficulty as far as one can and to have the political honesty and courage to put before the people the machinery necessary to restore the balance, to restore what might be called the economic balance, and prevent an increase in the cost of living, through the unwise issue of notes because the people are not saving as much as is being borrowed in any one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, for a considerable part of his administration, went far beyond what would be considered wise, in both his borrowing programme and his inflationary programme, by the most Socialist left-wing administrations in Europe.  Socialists, because they have always desired to spend the largest possible proportion of the national income in taxation for their own reasons, have learned perhaps more quickly than others&mdash;certainly more quickly than Deputy McGilligan &mdash;just how far one can go, and, as I have said, Deputy McGilligan and his Government in general, at the end of their three years' régime, were going beyond what were considered to <Col N="2196" /> be the most advanced principles enunciated by such people as Lord Keynes and others in regard to the capital investment of the State, borrowing money, expenditure on the Budget and so forth.  I want to make it perfectly clear that we, in Fianna Fáil, have no intention of doing anything rapid or violent, and no intention of preventing the natural course of capital development schemes which we hope to continue and in many cases to stimulate far beyond what they are at present.</P>

      <P>The cost of Government administration rose by a very large amount in three years.  The State debt was doubled and one of the difficulties we have to face is that, in every speech the former Minister for Finance made, he kept on warning the people that, although the increase in industrial production was very satisfactory, unless the volume of agricultural production increased&mdash;not the value of it but the volume&mdash;and unless the tourist industry expanded, or at least remained where it was, he could not recommend to this country that the borrowing programme should be continued. He kept on giving these vague, rather quiet warnings to the people of this country and to the members of this House, but he was unable to be emphatic enough in what he said because he would have burst up the Coalition Government.  He kept on warning them the whole time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know from statements made by the Minister for Finance that the volume of agricultural production only just reached pre-war level in 1949 and went down by 4 per cent. in 1950.  We know from figures published recently that there has been a very slight decline in cattle exports and the beginning of what appears to be a partial collapse of egg and poultry production <Col N="2197" /> and unsatisfactory conditions in regard to milk, butter and pigs, indicating that the 1950 position, which was 4 per cent. worse than in 1939, is likely to become still more serious, unless corrective measures are applied.  That is the difficulty which this House faces.  We, all of us, want to expand development schemes in every direction.  We cannot expect the volume of agricultural production to expand immediately, but, as I have said, there must be some expansion in due time, some visible expansion, if the policy of borrowing more and more&mdash;doubling the State debt, for example, in three years&mdash; continues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later.  Certain assets were created undoubtedly by the increase in the State debt both in the previous Government's time and our time.  One of the promises made by the Minister for Agriculture in the last Government was that he would increase the volume of agricultural exports by 100 per cent. in five years.  It was a colossal boast to make, a colossal prediction, knowing the fact that one of the difficulties affecting the whole of this country since 1912 has been that the actual level of agricultural production has changed very little.  It is one of the deepest and most long-term problems affecting this country.  The change has been extraordinarily small.  It scarcely altered even after five years of economic war. There were changes in certain respects from one period of five years to another period of five years, and then it seemed to fall back to its original level, in spite of many efforts made by Governments of all kinds in the past to stimulate it.  He made that very lurid boast and his boast was not justified. There was nothing like a 100 per cent. increase in the volume of agricultural exports during the past three years, and, in respect of most of the important items, that value would not have been reached, even if the Government had remained in office for five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give just one example of the kind of promise that was made, in reference <Col N="2198" /> to this prediction of Deputy Dillon's about increasing the volume of agricultural exports by 100 per cent. in five years, the number of cattle exported in 1939 was 482,000 and, by 1950, it had reached the dizzy figure of 494,000&mdash; very far off a 100 per cent. increase.  I might add, examining again eggs, butter, bacon and pigs, that one can see very easily that that prediction was not made good, but it was upon that prediction that much of the policy of the then Minister for Finance was based.</P>
    <P>He hoped that all these things would happen.  He hoped that in some mysterious way a miracle would be performed overnight.  Another example was Deputy Dillon's lurid boast that he would restore the pig population in 12 months, given the opportunity.  The pig population was something just under 1,000,000 at the end of the economic war, and by the end of the three-year régime of Deputy Dillon it had reached just over 600,000.  It began to reduce rapidly in the last half of 1950, and showed a very serious reduction in the first quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>The last Government has tried to take credit and has tried to justify its borrowing programme by giving the impression to the public that one of its successes was the very great increase in cattle prices that took place, as if there was something new in that, as if no one ever increased cattle prices before.  They seek to justify their programme&mdash;shall we say, the uncontrolled borrowing, the unorganised, co-ordinate capital development&mdash;by the increases in cattle prices that took place. As I have already pointed out, there was not very much increase in the volume of cattle exports, there was some increase in the value; but it is interesting to note that in spite of the rumours sedulously spread through the country that Deputy Dillon was responsible for cattle prices, according to his own figures the prices of most of the principal classes of cattle went up more in the last three years of our office than they went up in the three years of their office.  It is a thing so cleverly put in their programme that some people, even on our own side, are <Col N="2199" /> almost dizzied by the statement.  In fact, according to Deputy Dillon's official statements on cattle prices, issued by him during his term of office, the price of cattle one to two years old and two to three years old and fully fattened cattle, in every single case went up higher in the last three years of our office than in the first three of the Government's office.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants me to give the figures, I will.  I have given them once already.  He seems to be annoyed at being told the facts. People do not realise the actual facts, as given by Deputy Dillon.  That is a very important point.  One of the few justifications for the existence of Deputy Dillon would be if he could claim some very extraordinary increase in the price of cattle, that he was able to effect and which had not been effected by the previous Government, in the three years from the ending of hostilities, from 1945, when shipping became available and circumstances become more normal. If any Deputy would like me to give the figures I will.  They are Deputy Dillon's and show the truth of what I have just said.  I would mention just one figure.  For fat cattle two to three years old, the price in February, 1945, three years before the end of our period of office, was £25; the price went up until in the month we left office it was £36; and in February, 1951, three years later, it was £43.  If any Deputy works out the percentage, he will find that it went up proportionately more in our time than in Deputy Dillon's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Another statement of Deputy Dillon's was that he would work miracles during his period of office regarding restoring various classes of the cattle population.  We were told by him, as given in column 2589 of Volume III of the Dáil Debates, that the number of cattle of under one year old had reached the lowest level in history in the year 1947.  That, of course, was the <Col N="2200" /> year after two seasons of appallingly bad weather.  He said he was going to do something to restore it.  The number of cattle under one year old in 1939 was 978,000; and by 1950 it was 983,000&mdash;a remarkable increase of some 5,000 from the period at the end of five years' economic war, when farmers were working under very many difficulties.  The total number of cattle in this country in 1950 increased by 296,000.  The figure is there for all to see, until you suddenly realise that virtually all of them were two to three-year-old cattle and their coming into existence in this world in 1950 could hardly be said to be the responsibility or the work of Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon was speaking about the number of heifers in calf during a great deal of his period of office and saying they would prove the correctness of his policy and of all he was doing.  He ceased to talk about it in the last 12 months or so and there were very few references about it at agricultural committee meetings.  We discovered that in January, 1947, there were 142,000 heifers in calf and although they increased for a time, in 1950 the number was 140,000.  It is just as well to mention these things.</P>
      <P>Again, dealing with our difficulty in facing this enormous budgetary position, one of the things we would like to have seen, if the then Minister for Agriculture had been able to perform the miracles which he promised, would have been a great increase in crop yields.  Deputy Dillon stated in 1948 that the fertility of the soil had reached its lowest level since the famine.  We all can remember the flowery phrase, in 1948, after he took office, and he made it perfectly clear that Fianna Fáil was responsible for that.  I suppose Fianna Fáil was responsible for the Great War when no artificial fertilisers were available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon was opposed to us during the economic war, too, when farmers faced great difficulties.  During the economic war, in fact, the crop yields did not suffer any deterioration.  There were also the bad winters of 1946 and 1947, as <Col N="2201" /> Deputies well know.  Deputy Dillon did get an extraordinary answer from Providence in 1948 and 1949, when there were too good cereal harvests and when, in spite of the soil exhausted by Fianna Fáil, in spite of all Fianna Fáil had done to the soil, the yield of crops bounded until it reached almost pre-war proportions, and Mr. Dillon attempted to take credit for the Act of Providence in bringing about that situation.  I myself was surprised at the time.  I knew there was great fertility in Irish soil. I knew that farmers were conservative and husbanded their soil, but I did not realise that there could be such a rebound in crop yields after only two years' full supply of artificial fertilisers.  It was a proof that we did not do so badly after all.</P>
      <P>Agricultural production in Europe increased in volume by 10 per cent. during the period when it fell by 4 per cent. in this country, showing that the main problem is that of increasing the actual volume of production per acre.  Until there can be some substantial increase there will always come a time when a wise Government carefully and methodically, without necessarily taking any drastic or unpleasant action, changes their borrowing policy, their capital development policy, their budgetary policy and their policy in regard to the utilisation of external assets and the future balance of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have other unpleasant facts to face.  We know that, as already stressed by Deputy McGilligan, personal savings have been insufficient to allow for the borrowing programme to continue.  He said it over and over again in his quiet way.  He was very quiet about it.  He kept on hinting that it worried him.  Presumably, he has a knowledge of what real State finance is.  He kept pointing out the necessity for increased savings and announced a scheme at the time of the Budget for advertising the value of increased savings which, I think, is now going ahead.  As we all know, in an inflationary situation and when there is no actual war and when people are not asked to save for some vital immediate purpose such as war, it is very difficult for a mere appeal for <Col N="2202" /> savings to succeed.  I hope it will succeed.  I hope that the people of this country will adopt the attitude that turf production, electrical production, rural electrification, land reclamation, housing and hospitalisation are far more vital but less spectacular matters than the more dreadful business of defending oneself in war.  From the point of view of civilisation it is more fundamental and far more positive in character that they should follow the advice given to them by Deputy McGilligan in quiet tones but given very seriously.  They must save more, for not even the previous Government's programme could continue nor our programme of expansion that we anticipate.  The warning has been reiterated by the present Minister for Finance, who sees the position even more clearly and who has the courage to make far more definite statements; to speak with greater insistence and to speak with the whole of the Fianna Fáil Party behind him.  All of us hope that the people will consider the savings facilities in this country just as they would if we were fighting a mortal war against an enemy, otherwise it will be impossible to continue with the present programme.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty we face is that, although the cost of administration went up by £25,000,000 during the course of the last Government's office, for some reason or another some of their most important capital projects appear to have misfired.  Less was spent than they contemplated. A very large Civil Service organisation was expanded.  Whatever directions were given, the money for very urgent schemes which were claimed to encourage agricultural production and justify their cost seemed to misfire.  Only half of all the money to be provided for the Department of Agriculture in 1950 was finally spent in that year in connection with the land project&mdash;one of the projects which should result, in practice, in increasing the volume of agriculture, the number of blades of grass per acre and the number of cattle to be fattened.  Only one-sixth of the money provided in 1950-51 was spent and of that half went in expenditure for administrative costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2203" /> Only one-fourth of the sum allowed for certain expenditure in health development was spent that year.  Only twothirds of the amount provided for turf development was spent and, of course, there were some delays in developing turf to the maximum degree.</P>
    <P>Not even all the housing expenditure was fully absorbed.  The amount was £14,000,000, but it turned out at the end of the year to be £11,000,000. I am not saying that a great many houses were not built.  I am merely showing that some of these more important projects were misfiring in 1950, three years after the Government came into office when the level of capital expenditure could surely have been predicted properly.  I might also add that the rural electrification scheme, a scheme which should have had a definnite effect in spiriting agricultural production, was behindhand compared with the maximum desired.</P>
    <P>We learned also, during the period of the late Government's office, that a very large number of people left the land.  The figure given by the Minister for Agriculture for a recent period was 28,000.  A great many more had left before that.  The signifiance of that is rather hard to analyse because the Government boasted that workers' wages had gone up markedly, and that they were doing everything they possibly could from the point of view of social services.  The fact remains that the flight from the land to the towns continued at a vastly accelerated rate during the office of the late Government.</P>
    <P>There were delays in production schemes, all of which have had their effect, and which leave us with the problem of trying to carry on the capital development, in order that production may increase and at the same time provide finance from the savings of the people.  At the same time we notice this external disinvestment, not for capital machinery goods, but for goods of far less importance to the community.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies on the Labour side of the House were warning the public that we might be in for a hair-shirt <Col N="2204" /> existence.  It is well to remind the House of the circumstances under which that phrase was used.  We could not run this country normally during the war.  The phrase was invented by certain members of the Labour Party to describe, generally speaking, the difficulties we faced at that period, as though everything should have been absolutely normal all through the war, with sometimes only 25 per cent. of normal raw materials coming in, and with very difficult circumstances to face. We, on this side of the House, know that there was never such a thing as a hair-shirt policy on the part of Fianna Fáil.  We increased social services continuously during our first period of office.  The wages of all classes of workers rose steadily and continuously during that period.  I want to repeat again some figures that I discovered, I think, perhaps a little late for the election, and which could have been used in every direction to counteract the &ldquo;standstill Lemass&rdquo; campaign that went on&mdash;the suggestion that if Mr. Lemass was made Minister there would be a standstill of wages or anything else.</P>
    <P>It is just as well to remind workers and members of the House through the official record of the House of the fact that even during the war when there were certain restrictions on wages, salaries and the earnings of companies, wages did in fact increase, and that they increased more from the end of the Standstill Order up to the end of 1948 than they increased in the period after that.  I received the final figure the other day taking the wages of men and women in transportable industries. The figures given for these two periods are difficult to relate to an individual wage because they include both men and women in their different proportions. It is well to remind the House that we have no such hair-shirt policy. Wages increased from 43/- in 1939 for women and men to 66/- in 1946, an increase of 40 per cent.  The theory behind the increase was that it was possible for the housewife to buy essential commodities at the rationed prices then available in rationed quantities.  Most other goods were extremely scarce and dear.  If the wage levels were allowed to mount by the percentage reflecting <Col N="2205" /> the increased costs the only result would be that more people would seek those goods and the prices would be higher still.  The Standstill Order was removed in 1946 and between then and 1948 the figure rose from 66/- to 80/7 and the figure had risen since to 87/7 in three years.  That is sufficient to show that this Government was not a government believing in restricting wages.  As long as conditions remain relatively normal we believe in free negotiation of wages between workers and employers.</P>
    <P>The same thing is true of agricultural workers.  Wages went up very considerably during the period we were in office from 1939 to 1947 and they have increased since.  The suggestion is being given that there was no increase in the wages of agricultural workers but of course that is ridiculous on the face of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne referred to various matters of interest in connection with this debate.  He suggested that we had bribed a certain Deputy of this House by increasing the price of butter through increasing the price of milk. Of course it is convenient for the Deputy to mention that and not to mention the fact that there were three other members who supported the Government who would be hopeful that the price of butter would not increase. One cancels the other but Deputy Dunne gave the impression that it was meant to offer a special bribe to one particular Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne referred to increases that had taken place in the cost of living. We do not ourselves know I think entirely how much the cost of living has increased.  It depends on whether or not Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has had time to examine all the draft Orders for increases in price that lay on his desk when he arrived.  I do not know whether he has gone through the list. Announcements have been made of increases but there may still be a considerable number which he has to examine, which were placed before the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce before the election and upon which no final decision was made although in many cases increases had <Col N="2206" /> actually been recommended by the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>I wish to say, too, that we intend to have a realistic attitude towards prices. We have courage with regard to this. When we left office in 1948 an enormous number of promises had been made by the then Opposition that they would overhaul the price control machinery and that drastic reductions would be made.  The implication was that the officers of that Department working under the Minister for Industry and Commerce of that day were either not working efficiently or were being directed to work slowly or were disregarding profits in many companies. The Government of 1948 found after a short time that those statements were not justified.  There were no remarkable decreases in the cost of living. There were no prosecutions of any kind worth noting against any important firms or groups of firms for overcharging. We at least know that we are going back in the first instance to a fundamental price control system which the former Government was unable to break or to prove ineffective.</P>
    <P>Whatever steps we may take by specific measures in view of the present inflationary situation to control the state of the cost of living, we at least have an administration that was proved to have been so effective that no substantial decreases could be effected and no notable prosecutions undertaken by the last Government when it took office in 1948.  No doubt any machine can be improved but at least we know that that machine was not half so bad as it was supposed to be.  We all of course remember hearing the tremendous accusations which were made against us by Clann na Poblachta and the Labour Party during the course of the 1948 election.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise once again that we in Fianna Fáil believe in capital development services.  We always have believed in them and we always carried out capital development schemes.  We left the last Government enough capital development schemes either operating 100 per cent. or operating at half-speed and ready to go into full operation as soon as materials became available or planned <Col N="2207" /> and ready for immediate development to last them for the next 50 years.</P>

      <P>Many have gone on for years.  More was actually being given to farmers for farm improvement services during the last three years of the previous Government's office than was given to them by Deputy Dillon under the land project. That is one example.  If we had had American Marshall Aid no doubt we would have expanded the land improvement scheme; we would have left certain features as they were and expanded others.  Those were services which we carried out on behalf of the people and offered to the people and which were designed to increase agricultural production.  All the plans for turf electric power stations were in operation when we left office.  I think that the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Morrissey, was very honest in his speech at the opening and said that he must pay a tribute to Deputy Lemass for that scheme.  All of the immense long-term plans for Bord na Móna were devised by our Government before 1948 and the Government which has immediately left office had no responsibility for them.  There were projects costing millions to drain bogs which take five years to drain before machines can be put on them to cut turf.  That policy of far-seeing vision was entirely Fianna Fáil in concept.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of new industries and of extensions to industries started since the last Government came into office was due ultimately to the stimulus given by Deputy Lemass during the previous 16 years. A great many of these new factories were factories moving out of Dublin <Col N="2208" /> City and being constructed anew and expanded or were the extension of industries partially developed under the Fianna Fáil Government.  A number of brand-new industries have been started for which the last Government may take full credit, but the great panoply of industrial production increases since the war has been due to our encouragement of private capital development with enormous success during the previous 16 years.  New ships were bought by Irish Shipping, Limited, as a result of stimulation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. One of the plans we have in mind, if we can get the ships, is to expand Irish Shipping, Limited.  There are immense difficulties in that regard. The price of all shipping materials has gone up owing to inflationary conditions. So far as we know, no ships were ordered during the last three years.</P>

With regard to electric power, nobody can deny that the preparation of the plans for the Erne scheme began before the last Government came into office.  There, again, there will have to be a great stimulation.  Whatever our capital difficulties may be, we shall have to continue the encouragement of more power schemes of every type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have to examine the position in regard to mineral exploitation.  A great deal more will have to be done in the way of stimulating industrial exports.  I think that the establishment of some <Col N="2209" /> sort of export organisation on a larger scale will have to be planned by the present Government.  Certainly we shall have to go ahead with tourist development on a much larger scale.  In the past three years we have lost certain chances which we had in regard to tourist development.  A great deal requires to be done in the way of improving amenities in every class of hotel not only for Americans but for the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>I should like to correct a criticism that was made of the Taoiseach when he referred to the question of the preservation of the Irish language in the immediate Gaeltacht so far as the establishment of new industries is concerned. It is quite obvious that you can establish a number of small factories giving employment in various classes of industry in the Gaeltacht without interfering with the language. I imagine that what the Taoiseach had in mind was that if an enormously large-scale factory, involving foreign technical assistants and foreign keymen, were planted in the middle of an area in which the local people speak the Irish language, it might be a less desirable development than the establishment of industries of a smaller pattern manned by our own people who speak the language.  There was no suggestion that economic development would be slowed down in order to maintain the Irish language.  It was simply a matter of balance and it is ridiculous to make any suggestion to the contrary. It is just that it might be better if we could avoid placing an enormous industry of that type in the heart of the Gaeltacht and substitute instead the other types of industries which I have mentioned.  To suggest that the Taoiseach is going to starve the people of the Gaeltacht rather than to give them an industry is ludicrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many allegations have been made in regard to the 17-point plan announced by the Government after the election.  Wide publicity is being given to the suggestion that there was something new about the plan, that it contained only new material and that it was a kind of afterthought of Fianna Fáil.  I think that perhaps one of the mistakes we made during the <Col N="2210" /> election was that we did not go through sufficiently often what seemed to us to be a wearisome repetition of the permament part of the Fianna Fáil 1948 plan.  I do not propose to read it all this evening.  It would take about an hour to read the plans we had in mind, the plans we had in being, the plans we had in operation and the plans that were about to go into operation.  It all occupies pages and pages of print in pamphlets which were distributed during the 1948 election.  These plans were bequeathed to the last Government and were of great assistance to them in carrying on for as long as they did.  They included every sort of item in regard to every aspect of national life&mdash;the poultry and egg production plan, the expansion of land reclamation, farm buildings grants, the expansion of the production of lime and fertilisers through grants and subsidies&mdash;a plan which was delayed being put into operation by the last Government for a considerable time and the main part of which was put into operation only within the last eight months of their being in office: a special subsidy, using American aid, for limestone.  We had plans for improved veterinary services, for educational facilities and research, for developing good seed strains, for grassland improvement, for guaranteed prices for cash crops.  All these were mentioned in 1948 and there was no need for us to stress them particularly during the election because we imagined most of the people of the country would know about them.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have constructive ideas in regard to the national economy.  I have already mentioned the plans in relation to turf and power production, land and air transport, the expansion of the Factories Acts, a new export trade organisation, and so forth. Of course, there were plans for more schools and more hospitals.  There was also mention during the time of the election of a complete social security scheme and of the development of a mother and child service scheme. Naturally, we also had plans for developing arterial drainage.  So far as I know, the plans for surveying quite a <Col N="2211" /> proportion of the rivers that are now either being drained or about to be drained were commenced in our time. The then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, was honest enough in admitting, when he blew the whistle to start the Brosna scheme, that the scheme was due in great measure to the work of the previous Government in planning arterial drainage schemes.  He made that admission at the time the Brosna drainage scheme commenced.  The same applies to certain other arterial drainage schemes now either in operation or still being planned.</P>
    <P>It is just as well to stress the only essential differences between the 17-point plan and the 1948 Fianna Fáil programme.  It is as well to record them here.  We have not been in office very long and, with the Recess about to begin, it is just as well to record these differences in the House.  With one exception, only minor changes have been made between the 17-point plan and the 1948 published programme. That programme included a measure of compulsory tillage, which has been abandoned.</P>

Every sane Government changes its policy in the light of existing events.</P>

      <P>Moreover, we have done what the Government that took office in 1948 did not do.  We have not immediately smashed up every scheme in relation to which we had some very definite prejudice.  We have left the great majority of the schemes in operation in order that we can review them at some future date, which is more than the last Government did when it came into office.</P>

      <P>The last Government would dearly have liked to have had those Constellations in the third year of their office.  Every single plan that has been enunciated by the recent Government will be tried and tested, because it is always possible that any Government may do many excellent new things for the people and these things should be judged by their results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We mentioned certain points in the 17-points programme in regard to borrowing and raising national credit.  We wanted to make it quite clear to the people that we believed in capital development, had indeed indulged in capital development and increased capital resources by millions of pounds <Col N="2213" /> during our 16 years in office and we would have continued to do that, working on certain priciples, neither going too far nor adopting a petty attitude in which we would try&mdash;shall we say&mdash; to contract any policy for reasons which might appear selfish or unwise.</P>
    <P>We also said we would conduct negotiations with agricultural organisations when desired, because the impression was given by the former Minister for Agriculture that he was unwilling to meet certain agricultural groups. That was not really a change in policy. We said we would maintain subsidies as far as we could.  We mentioned that because we had to do something to persuade the people that we would not reduce subsidies in a major way while the cost of living was rising.</P>
    <P>We also said we would make such defence preparations as we considered advisable.  I think the only major change in the policy enunciated in the 17-point programme as compared with that enunciated in 1948 was the abandonment of compulsory tillage.  Otherwise, the whole of the statement was merely a retiteration of what we had been doing for 16 years, with one difference; during our 16 years we had five years of economic war and world depression followed by a world war.</P>

      <P>If we had had the same advantages as were available to the last Government we would have been able to do a great deal more.  Two elections have been fought in the last three years.  They have been fought with the Parties opposite trying to give the impression to the people that the absence of constructional work and the slowing down of nation-building during the war period were due entirely to the weak character of the Fianna Fáil Administration, to our lack of ambition, our lack of vision and our lack of enthusiasm.  The vast majority of the people saw through that argument in 1948.  They saw the beginning of the foundations of turf and power stations being laid.  They knew plans were going ahead.  They knew it was only the war that had prevented plans going <Col N="2214" /> ahead for capital development.  They trusted us, believing we would go with the plans when the time came.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, was unable for two years to put into operation the correctives which he said were essential.  Whatever corrective principles we are compelled to adopt, the House can be quite certain that so long as conditions abroad remain relatively stable and raw materials can be secured and prices do not go absolutely crazy we will continue the capital programme we always had; we will expand and speed up the work that was being done too slowly by the previous Government and we will continue with the work of nation-building so long as the Irish people give us their confidence.</P>

The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has made a brave effort to show that things are bright and cheerful and we are not as near the cemetery of economic debt as the Minister for Finance gasped out last night.</P>
      <P>I have just come into possession this evening of a document described as <i>The Irish Statistical Survey,</i> published by the Stationery Office, which is in the Library but which for some reason or other has not been circulated to Deputies as, indeed, it might have been for the purpose of a debate of this kind.  I have not had time to go through it in detail, but I have looked at it sufficiently to enable me to put certain figures before the House and I want to put these in juxtaposition with the figures quoted by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at these figures and see <Col N="2215" /> what the past three years show where statistics for the three years are available, or for two years where only two years' figures are available, taking note at the same time that if the figures for 1951 were available they would show the continued improvement which is manifested in 1949 and 1950.  What do we find?  In 1947 the national income in respect of income arising from agriculture, forestry and fishing was £95,000,000.  In 1950 it had risen to £104,000,000, clearly showing that there was an increase in the national income during that period when we were in office and clearly showing that there was no stagnation from the point of view of industrial and agricultural output taken collectively.</P>

We find, in 1947, personal expenditure in goods and services at market prices was £289,000,000 and in 1950 that had jumped to £342,000,000. Does anybody want to take exception to the fact that our people have more to spend, that they are now getting more food, more clothes and enjoying some of the things which were long denied to them and that generally they are enjoying a better standard of living?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come to imports, During the war years it was impossible for our people to import goods with the result that our imports were down as low as £26,000,000 in 1943.  We all remember 1943 and the scarcities during that period.  We all remember that it was impossible to get many things which our people wanted to buy.  When the war ended in 1945, and when goods began to become available again, our imports increased and by 1947 our imports were value for £131,000,000. Can anybody question that as a normal development in the circumstances? People were unable to get consumer goods or capital goods.  It was the most natural thing in the world that after a war which lasted from 1939 to 1946 or 1947, from the point of view of availability of goods, there should inevitably <Col N="2218" /> be an increase in purchases of goods of a capital and consumer character in order to satisfy the requirements of our people and to fill the pipeline.  The result was that the value of our imports reached £131,000,000 in 1947, £136,000,000 in 1948, £130,000,000 in 1949 and £159,000,000 in 1950, with the Korean war on the horizon and the possibility of embroilment in another global war.  These are all natural features in a situation of a deteriorating international situation and a buildup of imports, in consequence of a decline in these imports of necessary capital and consumer goods during the years of the last war.</P>
      <P>Let us turn now to the table dealing with the production of industrial transportable goods.  Taking 1938 as the base, the index being 100, we find that the production of industrial transportable goods reached 120 in 1947 but by December, 1950, the index had jumped to 171, showing clearly that between 1947 and 1950 the production of transportable goods had risen very substantially and was 70 per cent. more than in 1938.  The spurt which was manifest in the production of transportable goods was in the main related to the three years in which the last Government was in office.  Is there any evidence of stagnation there?  So far as industrial production is concerned, the period from 1948 to 1950 and even into 1951, has been the brightest and best period from the standpoint of increased industrial production in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the employment figures.  In 1938 the number of people engaged in industry was 166,000; in 1947, 183,000; and in 1950, 250,000&mdash;the highest figure that has ever been recorded since we commenced to take statistics on this subject.  Again let us look at the National Health Insurance Act.  The number of people insured under the Act is to-day an all-time record and has never been previously beaten since the Act was introduced. If you look at the figures for unemployment insurance, you get the same picture.  If you turn from that to the question of unemployment and the unemployment problem generally, you find that the percentage of people unemployed <Col N="2219" /> in 1938, the year before the war, was 15 per cent., in 1947, 9.3 per cent. and in 1950, 7.5 per cent.&mdash;the lowest figure ever previously recorded.</P>

      <P>Now, let us look at wages.  Industrial earnings in 1947, taking 1939 with the base 100, were 166. By December, 1950, that figure had risen to a figure of 202, and it had done so in spite of the Fianna Fáil threat in October, 1947, to reimpose wage freezing and to make strikes illegal if the workers asked for more wages than they were getting in October, 1947.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the cost of living and the industrial earnings between 1939 and 1940.  I say this to the House: this top figure represents the soaring cost of living.  This figure here shows wages.  You see the gap between one and the other.  The lower line represents industrial earnings. This represents the cost of living.  While the two figures started at the one point in 1939, by 1944 there was a gap of 50 points between them, the cost of living being 50 points higher than the wage line.  That gap represents the sufferings which the workers endured under the Fianna <Col N="2222" /> Fáil wage-freeze policy all during the emergency.</P>
      <P>What is the position now?  Look at the figures.  In 1948 they had just begun to meet and now the earnings have gone up above the cost of living index figure, but that balloon would have remained there if Fianna Fáil had remained over there.  That position has been changed now. Anybody who wants the facts can get them in this Official Report, and they will see that anybody who depended on wages had no reason to regret the advent to office of the last Government.</P>
      <P>Those are the facts, so far as I have time to recount them, published in this official survey.  Not only does the survey provide a full justification of the progress made by the last Government, but when the survey for 1951 is available, provided our plans are not interfered with by this Government, the result will be still more heartening so far as most of our people are concerned.  If that annoys the Minister for External Affairs I cannot help it.  I have, however, to offer him the solace of joining with everybody else on this side of the House in feeling the satisfaction that the nation at last is going ahead, and I am willing to share with him any part of the pride which may justifiably belong to him in that achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend, Sir, to talk on those lines at all were it not for the thesis which was read for us this evening by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I intended only to intervene on one matter which I think is of considerable importance to the nation, especially in the cultural and educational field. During the past 48 hours the cultural activities and the cultural life of the nation has sustained a blow heavier than that which it has sustained for many and many a year.  I refer to the unfortunate happening which has deprived Ireland of the Abbey Theatre and of the crushing loss which the fire at the Abbey Theatre will mean to art, to drama, and to the cultural activities of the Irish nation.  So far as this country is concerned, the Abbey has been the cradle of literature, of art, of drama and of the cultural activities <Col N="2223" /> which correctly interpreted the feelings and the patriotism of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Abbey was to us the cultural cradle of the revolutionary renaissance in Ireland.  That modest building kept alive through our darkest periods the flame of freedom, the flame of nationality and the flame of independence when that flame was almost extinguished on the military field.  The men and women who graced the Abbey stage made the Abbey famous, not only at home but abroad, and won for our people in the field of art and culture generally an international recognition altogether disproportionate to the smallness of our nation in a territorial sense.  These men and women shed lustre on themselves and they brought honour to the nation.  It is probably true to say that never before did such a small institution do so much to exalt the name of Ireland throughout the world in a cultural sense.</P>
    <P>The Abbey is now no more.  It now lies in ashes and its financial position is so parlous that it will be probably impossible and indeed unwise to attempt to rebuild it, cramped as it necessarily is in its present location. But the Abbey in ruins leaves a vacancy in the cultural life of the nation which cannot be filled unless by the recreation of the Abbey in another and bigger sense.</P>
    <P>The last Government had under consideration the question of establishing here a national theatre which would truly interpret the cultural activities of our people.  It was contemplated that that national theatre could be utilised as a monument to all those who died for Ireland.  At the same time, there was under consideration the question of erecting a traditional monument to those who fell in the national struggle in one of our principal streets so that visitors and our own people might, from time to time, be reminded of the struggles of the past and of the sacrifices made to achieve the freedom which has now been won for our people.</P>
    <P>There was never, in fact, any issue as between whether the monument should take the form of a national theatre or one of the traditional monuments of stone or bronze.  But <Col N="2224" /> it was felt that something should be done quickly, and I think the committee appointed to deal with the matter was told at the outset to get on with the task of endeavouring to devise a suitable monument in a suitable place which would, in a traditional way commemorate the struggle of our people for freedom and liberty.  That did not mean that the idea of a national theatre was being disregarded or that it was not intended subsequently or concurrently to proceed with the idea of a national theatre.</P>
    <P>However, at the time this matter was considered at least we had the Abbey and the tradition and feeling which the living, vibrant Abbey always radiated amongst our people.  But to-day the Abbey is no more, and we now stand in great danger of losing the fount which was the inspiration behind the really great cultural talents manifested by our people for the past 50 years.  I fear that unless the Abbey is rehoused and rehoused quickly, selfless though the men and women who graced its stage are, the inclination will be for them to disperse into other activities.</P>
    <P>That is not unnatural.  We can understand the factors which would operate to accelerate that dispersal.  I feel sure, however, that patriotism of the men and women who are the life-blood of the Abbey is such that we could steady the position to-day if there could be some assurance given by this Parliament or by this Government that we would accept the principle of erecting here a national theatre to replace the Abbey which is in ashes and that that new national theatre would be regarded as a monument to all those who served Ireland and gave their lives for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know of no more fitting monument which could be erected to commemorate the magnificent sacrifices and the imperturbable bravery of our people than the erection of a national theatre of that character and especially a national theatre which would carry on the tradition which made the Abbey nationally and internationally famous. However much we may disagree on the economic interpretation of the last three years or the last 30 years, one <Col N="2225" /> thing we can all agree upon is that the Abbey must be saved for our people, that the tradition of the Abbey must be saved, and that the magnificent people who gathered round the Abbey and were ambassadors in their own special way of Irish art and Irish culture throughout the world must not be dispersed by temptations from other quarters.</P>
    <P>Now that the Abbey has been destroyed and we have no real fitting monument of remembrance to all those who fought and fell in the national struggle, I should like to appeal to the Government to announce as speedily as possible that they are accepting the principle of erecting a national theatre to carry on the traditions of the Abbey and to give those who accept the Abbey philosophy a wider and ever-expanding opportunity of advertising Irish culture and art for the benefit of the world and the edification of our own people at home.  I think that this is a matter about which there will be a widespread measure of agreement among all Parties in the House and I hope the Government will find an early opportunity of indicating that in the situation which now confronts us, the Abbey being in ashes, they will accept the principle of erecting a new national theatre to replace it and to commemorate our illustrious dead.</P>
    <P>Something perhaps may be necessary as an interim measure.  It is quite clear that the Abbey with its present financial resources will be unable to carry on for any length of time unless it is assisted by the only reliable donor in a matter of this kind, namely, the State.  I hope also that as part of the policy of maintaining and promoting cultural activities among our people and maintaining our reputation in the international field the Government will give such temporary financial assistance as may be necessary to keep the Abbey going until such time as temporary premises are found and until such time as a decent national home is found to perpetuate the memory and the culture of the Abbey and to commemorate suitably the struggle of our people for freedom and liberty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the two motions that are before the House and that are being discussed jointly with this Estimate.  Frankly, I think it was unwise to propose these motions for discussion with the Estimate, but the time-table probably necessitated that they be considered together.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy agrees with the aim of having the elected representatives of this country in a single Parliament, but because every Deputy subscribes to that view it does not necessarily follow that every Deputy assents to the proposal enshrined in these motions.  I do not think that the proposal which these motions involve of admitting to the deliberations of the Oireachtas some representatives who have been returned in the Six North-Eastern Counties is any practical step towards solving the problem of Partition.  Undoubtedly, sentimentally a great deal can be said and a strong case can be made for having these persons who are anxious to take their place in a united Ireland amongst us and taking their place in our deliberations.  But the proposal that is involved here, however desirable and however we may all subscribe to the aim of a united Ireland under a single Parliament, does not commend itself to me, because I regard it as merely desirable in theory, but impracticable in implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2227" /> For some time, I believe, the whole approach to Partition has been based too much on showmanship and not enough on statesmanship, and that a great deal of reckless talk on both sides of the Border has prevented practical steps or, on some occasions, has hindered certain practical steps, that might be taken towards achieving a united Ireland.  I suppose that it is hardly likely, when reckless statements are made on one side or another, that rejoinders will not follow.  It is inevitable, human nature being what it is, when an extravagant statement is made either by public representatives or others, that statements in answer will be made from the other side.  From that point of view, the example in both parts of the country leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I think that the proper approach to this problem lies along the lines that have been adopted in relation to the Erne hydro-electric scheme and the Foyle fisheries agreement, and, although there may be some temporary divergence of view, the discussions that took place in connection with the Great Northern Railway.  These three instances demonstrate the absurdity of Partition and the necessity for ending it as quickly as possible.  They demonstrate, not merely the absurdity of the situation but the inescapable facts that if the maximum benefit is to be derived from the resources on either side of the Border, joint action in a number of cases is necessary and that that joint action is only possible when representatives from the Government here and the Government in Belfast join together to implement a common scheme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the privilege of piloting the legislation through this House to develop the Erne hydro-electric scheme.  It is quite obvious that that scheme could not have been worked unless the drainage work that was carried out on the other side of the Border was allowed, and the drainage work would not have been possible unless other work was carried out on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>I was interested this evening in listening to the Minister for Posts and <Col N="2228" /> Telegraphs claiming credit for a number of schemes initiated by the previous Fianna Fáil Administration and he referred to the Erne scheme as one. Nobody has ever attempted to diminish the credit which is due to the former Administration for their work on that scheme, but the whole electricity development programme in this country would have been far more rapid and done at much less cost if the same attitude had been taken up by the Fianna Fáil Party when in opposition and when the Shannon scheme was initiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, Sir.  The Shannon scheme was initiated in 1924 and the Fianna Fáil Party came in in 1927.  The legislation was completed in June, 1927.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>I am not giving way to Deputy Briscoe.  Deputy Briscoe will be aware of the fact that the present Minister for Finance, who was then Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government, in 1932 and 1933, described in the Seanad the Shannon scheme and the sugar beet factory as as precious a collection of white elephants as ever drove their unfortunate owners to the state of bankruptcy.</P>

      <P>If the Shannon scheme had been developed as fully and as rapidly as was possible before the war, when raw materials were cheap and supplies plentiful, a far greater supply of electricity would <Col N="2229" /> have been available here.  We progressed with the Erne scheme.  We implemented the work that was already started and I am glad to say that part of the Erne scheme is already in operation and it is hoped that the remainder of this scheme will be completed very shortly.  However, that digression has nothing to do with the remarks that I was making.</P>
      <P>The argument in favour of admitting the representatives from the six north-eastern counties, I believe, would have some merit if there was any divergence of view in the Dáil or in the Seanad but, however other problems may cause dissension or divergence of viewpoint, on the reunification of the country there is unanimity and on that problem there is no divergence of viewpoint on the aims, whatever about the methods.  As I said earlier, the whole problem of Partition has not been approached in a statesmanlike way and there has been far too much talk and far too little action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>My view of action and Deputy Cowan's are not the same. I know that Deputy Cowan favours the módh díreach but its recruits have diminished.</P>
      <P>If we approach this problem by seeking agreement where agreement is possible, by eliminating the differences where it is possible to do so, by recognising that this problem cannot be solved easily or cannot be solved merely by talk, I believe we will go a long way towards speeding the day when a solution of the problem can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that however desirable or attractive the proposal enshrined in these motions may appear, it would achieve any practical result towards securing the early ending of Partition.  I must say that, from my contacts with Ministers in Belfast over a period relating to one specific problem, I definitely got the view that they recognised that ultimately Partition will end, that they recognised that a solution of the problem of Partition must inevitably be found some time; but they also appreciated that there are practical difficulties in the way. <Col N="2230" /> We here on this side of the Border recognise that a solution will be found, and that the sooner it is found the better, but a campaign designed to heap criticism and abuse on those on the other side of the Border cannot have desirable results, or cannot prepare the ground for a satisfactory solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I do not think that these motions should be pressed to a division.  It should not be left to others to criticise the action of the Dáil, as I believe the Dáil will reject these motions.  It may be misrepresented and misconstrued outside if these motions are not pressed to a division. After a free and full discussion here, no misrepresentation and no misconception of our position can result. If, on the other hand, they are pressed to a division, I must say that I will be obliged to vote against them because I do not think that the motions offer any practical solution to or improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view which Deputy Costello expressed here to-day, that it would be representation without taxation. While something may be said for having expressed here the viewpoint of persons representing some of our people in the six north-eastern counties, nothing is less likely to achieve a solution of the problem of Partition than a make-believe policy or a policy based on wishful thinking.  Wishful thinking, however attractive in theory, can achieve little in practice.  I do not believe that the suggestions enshrined in these motions can achieve any practical step towards solving Partition.</P>
    <P>The only other matter that I would like to refer to is the one that was mentioned by Deputy Norton.  I agree with the view that steps should be taken to rebuild the Abbey Theatre.  I think there is widespread regret at the devastation which the fire caused.  It is obvious to anyone who has a knowledge of the site that it is not large enough to provide the country with a suitable building to replace the Abbey.  I believe that, if the Government indicated their willingness to the directors of the Abbey, there would be unanimity here after the Recess to vote a Supplementary <Col N="2231" /> Estimate to meet the financial requirements.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may say that there were proposals in the past to build a national theatre.  That may be so although I do not think the proposals were ever developed to any considerable extent.</P>

      <P>At that time, the Abbey was available.  The position is different now.  The Abbey no longer exists, and it is obvious that the facilities which were available then are no longer available and that steps should be taken to provide a national theatre to continue the work that was carried on in the Abbey for so many years, with such honour to those concerned and to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine, listening to Deputy Norton and Deputy Dunne this evening, that wonders had been done during the past three years. Deputy Dunne in particular, representing, I believe, the rural workers&mdash;God save the mark&mdash;caused a terrible uproar here when the increase of 1d. a gallon on milk was given.  When the previous 1d. a gallon on milk was given we had the same uproar from Deputy Dunne and others, but in that very same week margarine was increased by 4d. per lb. and we did not hear any word at all about that.  That was put on one side as a natural thing to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies realise that the increased cost, caused by the week's holidays with pay, the weekly half-holiday and the recent increase of 7/6 a week in agricultural wages, amounts exactly to an increased cost of production of 1.37d. per gallon of milk.  The actual increase in the cost of production since the price had been previously fixed by Deputy Paddy Smith is 3.63d. per gallon&mdash;that is since March, 1947, to date.  Deputy Dunne can be counting that up because I intend to force it until we get it, and I make no apology to anybody for doing so.  Due to that policy, of which Deputy Norton and Deputy Dunne are prominent exponents here, we have had the position that, during the past three years. <Col N="2232" /> some 28,000 people have left the land of this country.  Whether they went coal-mining in Britain or came into the towns and cities here is a matter for themselves, but the solid fact remains that 28,000 left and did not come back.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Norton quote extracts from the famous book which he produced here, but Deputy Norton forgot all about page 17, which gives the volume of agricultural output. Taking the net output in 1938-39 as 100, in 1950 it was only 95.7, so that we had a reduction in agricultural output as between 1939 and 1950, the last year accounted for here.  I have preached in this House for many a year that the agricultural labourer working on the land is entitled to the same wage as the man working in industry, or any other class of employment, and until that condition is brought about, you are going to have that flight from the land.  It is all very well to have Muintir na Tíre meetings, at which learned gentlemen with big salaries talk about the flight from the land, but when we get down to bedrock and find a wage of £3 10s. 0d. or £3 13s. 0d. a week for an agricultural labourer and a wage of anything from £5 upwards for that man if he turns his hand to anything else, away from the land, we must realise that we are going to have that continual drain from the land.  There is no use talking about increased productivity while that situation exists.  That drain is not confined to agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>It is largely a drain of farmers' sons and daughters who see no future to-day in agriculture but who can see that, if they turn their hands to anything else, they will have a better opportunity and a better chance of going ahead and earning a decent livelihood for themselves.  There is no use in this Government or the previous Government digging their heads into the sand and ignoring that state of affairs.  The previous Government ignored it for three years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke about price freeze Orders in relation to labour. We had a price freeze Order in relation to the agricultural community for the past three years.  It was only <Col N="2233" /> three months before the previous Government left office that we had any increase in the price of milk since March, 1947.  We all know that the dairy cow is the foundation of agriculture in this country&mdash;the foundation of live stock, anyway&mdash;because if you have not got the cow, you will not have the bullock.</P>

I gave a description some time ago of something I saw in County Limerick from a carriage window as I was coming up here.  It was the picture of 14 decent milch cows in a field and 28 calves sucking them.  There was no bother about milking or anything else &mdash;merely buy calves and drive them out to the cows.  Then you wonder why you have not got butter.  That is the reason you have not got butter and that is not confined to one or two farms.  It is prevalent, I understand, right through County Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I guarantee to the Deputy that they are most reliable. However, that does not change the picture.  These are the facts of what is happening.  It is either that or Roscrea for the cow, and a gradual dropping out of milk production by the farmer, and that is the one thing it is impossible to bring farmers back to. That is one item which accounts for the reduction and one could place a whole series of items side by side with it.  The price freeze Order in relation to agriculture imposed by the inter-Party Government, as we will call them&mdash;I do not know whether we call them a platypus Government or not&mdash;undoubtedly left this country in such a condition that we had to go, and will be compelled to go, to the foreigner for a lot of what could be and should have been produced here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne complained that the Taoiseach had not been wide enough in his statement to-day.  What was the Taoiseach's statement?  He emphasised one thing, the production in this country of food for our people and our animals.  He laid that down as a headline for our agricultural policy.  I wonder has any Deputy opposite gone to the trouble of going through the imports of agricultural produce into this country during the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have they studied them?  Have they realised that those imports had to be paid for, not in sterling but largely in dollars?  I made a statement here last night, which I have since verified, and which was denied by Deputies over there then, that under the wheat agreement we are expected to produce 50 per cent. of our requirements here, and every ton of wheat we are short of that 50 per cent. must be purchased, not under the wheat agreement, <Col N="2235" /> but outside the wheat agreement.</P>

One can count up the acreage of wheat this year and count up whether they will get out of that acreage 250,000 tons&mdash;and every ton they are short of that will have to be purchased at £45.  I do not know what lunacy induced Deputies over there, particularly Labour Deputies, to agree with Deputy Dillon's figure of £25 a ton for wheat at home, knowing that every ton he is going to be short will have to be purchased in the foreign market at £45.</P>

      <P>I will hold it and bring in something that will be in order. Those facts cannot be denied, one after the other.  The Taoiseach covered the whole lot here to-day, when he said that it is the intention of this Government <Col N="2237" /> to see that sufficient food is produced here for our own people and for our animals as well.</P>
      <P>It will be paid for at decent prices and will still be cheaper than what the previous Government bought from the nigger.  I do not wish to go beyond that.  I heard a statement read out to-day by Deputy Costello in a speech which reminded me of one thing&mdash;the old saying that hell is paved with good intentions.  Regarding every statement read out, as being given by Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance and by the others, the fulfilment was conspicuous by its absence.  We were told about the employment that was going to be given and about Irishmen leaving for want of employment.  Down in my own local town, in Cobh, I have seen for the past three years not a new industry brought in there but the extension of an industry, in which three-fourths of the machinery is lying on the side and for which guarantees had been given by the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce here, Deputy Seán Lemass, of the money to purchase the balance of that machinery.</P>

I was told the matter was under consideration&mdash;and that was answer No. 1.  I gave them three months to consider it and put down another question.  I was told that it was a very grave and serious matter and needed further consideration.  I waited for six months more and I put down the third question and was then informed that the matter had been referred to the Industrial Development <Col N="2238" /> Authority&mdash;the Lord between me and all harm.</P>

      <P>And that is what I am endeavouring to do, Sir.  We have heard a lot of talk about increased employment.  I am wondering how much of that increased employment is due to the crazy manner in which goods are distributed in this country. You have a position where you have brought in through Leinster via the port of Dublin three-fourths of our <Col N="2240" /> imports.  Is that done in order to give increased employment to the boys carting from Dublin to Cork and Waterford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Another thing is that the goods should be delivered as soon as possible to the purchasers' place of export.  This matter in concentrating all in the port of Dublin and then dishing it out is something that should be stopped.  It is one of the matters which, I suggest, should occupy the immediate attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government generally.  In view of the rising cost of living, increased freightage will also be added to the cost of goods sent from Dublin to Cork or to towns where the goods ultimately find their way.  The bulk of the butter is produced in Munster, but the butter exported by the previous Minister for Agriculture was exported from Dublin. I want to know the cost of bringing that butter from Mitchelstown Creamery up to Dublin for export. One would think that the butter would be exported from the nearest port at any rate, the port of Cork.  That ridiculous situation militates against the ordinary country ports.  It also militates against the principal port in this country&mdash;the port of Cobh.</P>
      <P>I hope to see carried out now the findings of the inter-departmental commission that was set up in 1947 in connection with the deep water quay at Cobh.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;pressing this matter of getting back to the port of Cork the shipping trade which has been transferred to Dublin.  That can only be done by implementing the recommendations of that inter-departmental commission and putting them into force as quickly as possible.  These recommendations were left in abeyance for three years and are lying in the office, I take it, of the late Minister for Industry and Commerce since May, 1948.  I knew it was useless to beg to have it put into force. I knew that if I called attention to it even here in this House we would have an evasive reply.  There was only one way to do it: to keep your mouth shut until you got a chance of getting away with it.  Those are the facts.</P>
      <P>When I hear talk about industry there are matters to which I would like the Government to give immediate attention.  One is the concentration here in Dublin of shipping repairs.</P>

      <P>I will not; I have said all I wanted to say.  Those are the things that interest me.</P>
      <P>I heard a lot to-day about industry in the Gaeltacht.  I put up certain suggestions away back in 1940 to the then Minister for Agriculture which would have meant intensified agricultural production in the smaller holdings whether they be in West Cork, Kerry or Connemara. My suggestion was the production there of small seeds which has a large labour content on the land and which brings in a gross income of from £100 to £130 per acre.  The production of those seeds in the Gaeltacht areas would undoubtedly help to stem the tide of emigration and would give the man with the small holding who undoubtedly, under ordinary agricultural conditions, would not have a means of livelihood, an opportunity of finding full employment on his own farm in the first instance and of producing seeds which are essential. Unfortunately, instead we see them produced in Meath, Westmeath, Kildare, Cork and other counties where farmers have 100 to 150 and sometimes 300 acres.  These farmers do the work which should in common sense be done on the uneconomic holdings of the West.  It would be far better and a far more common sense project than to bring any big industry into those areas. That is only my viewpoint but I am putting it.  What a benefit it would be can be seen by any Deputy who takes the trouble of going into the quantity of small seeds, turnip, mangold, beet, cabbage and all the rest, that must be imported every year or purchased here. He will see the income that would give to the smallholder.</P>
      <P>I am more than anxious to see industries placed in thickly populated areas where you have uneconomic holdings. What I had in mind is only one instance and there are other things which I am sure could be got going in those areas which would give employment to our people.  I am sure that the Government would welcome any proposals from any Deputy in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more worried, as one must be in this little world of ours, about my <Col N="2243" /> own constituency and my own constituents and I want the Government to give immediate and specific attention to the unemployment position in the town of Fermoy.</P>

      <P>It has been as was pointed out to-day by Deputy Costello the established practice that the Taoiseach on a Vote such as this should make a general objective survey of the economic condition of the country and I regret that the Taoiseach has seen fit to avoid that policy because he must be in a position to say whether he found conditions as he and his colleagues painted them during the past three years and he should have told us in an objective fashion whether there was any merit whatever in the previous Administration or whether they were guilty of all the offences with which they were charged.  However, in what has been properly described as a wide-open, childish <Col N="2244" /> declaration he avoided all the principal parts of the duty he should perform.</P>
      <P>The country is disturbed and the people are anxious to know what Government policy is in relation to the Health Act of 1947.</P>
      <P>They want to know if it is the intention of the Government to amend that Act, as requested in October, 1947, by the spiritual advisers of the majority of the people of this country.  They want to know the Government's intentions relating to matters that agitated the minds of the people and of the members of this House over the past few months.  These were two very important items.  One would expect that the Taoiseach would take the Dáil into his confidence at this particular stage and let us know the Government's intentions on these subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past two years I have been listening to an attack upon the previous Government's policy of capital expenditure.  I heard the charge made and attempts made to substantiate it, such as the attempt of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to-day, that the expenditure was extravagant. My memory goes back to the same type of criticism that was levelled in respect of the expenditure on the Shannon scheme and the beet scheme that was established by a previous Administration.  I heard the matter of that capital expenditure bandied all over the country, as if it were a madman's scheme to build the hydroelectric Shannon scheme or the Carlow Beet Factory.  A person who is now a Minister described these things as a precious lot of white elephants bestowed by an Administration.  One would expect that after a period of office such as that which Fianna Fáil enjoyed, at least some of the Leaders and the Ministers of that Party would get some bit of sense&mdash;but it seems that the older they get the worse they become.  It is a well-known fact that if the Banking Commission had known that a war was going to come in 1938, 1939 or 1940, their report would have been considerably different because it would have been tempered by that knowledge.  If the Government of the day, when they saw that war was imminent in 1938 or 1939, had had the <Col N="2245" /> foresight to spend some of the capital assets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When I advocated these two matters the present brilliant Minister for Finance asked me how they would keep them on the high seas if they had them.  Yet they bought old tubs.  They were right subsequently&mdash;but they bought the old tubs at an increased cost.</P>

Is that not a change from the time when they cut the throats of the calves?  That is the sort of thing to which we are treated.  However, let me come back to the suggestion of capital expenditure. I disagree with certain things which the Clann na Poblachta Party preach but I am in thorough agreement with them that the country that exports men and money is mad&mdash;and we have been doing that consistently and persistently since this State was established.</P>
      <P>With regard to the sterling assets that Fianna Fáil feel so tenderly about and are so anxious to preserve, dear knows, at one time they would almost have burned them.  That is the only indication that some attempt has been made to increase their knowledge.  The fact remains that we have not purchased half enough capital goods over the past 15 years.</P>

There is only one safe place to have them and that is in the land, in buildings, in factories and in machinery in this country, and thus give our people employment at home.  The capital expenditure of the previous Government was housing, afforestation, drainage and land reclamation.  What is wrong with that?

      <P>Let me proceed with the attack that was made on the previous Administration.  I should like to remind the Deputies that, after the election, 17 points of policy were announced by the Taoiseach, the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Opposition &mdash;but he did not say one word about them except in a general way.  That policy was announced after the election, which was the wrong time for doing so.  If the present Taoiseach had published these 17 points before the election we would then have been able to see how far they coincided with our own programme.  I have in my hand a document which they published before the election and they said that the political and social principles of Fianna Fáil are those which were announced in 1948, namely, to freeze wages and to have everything that we had then&mdash; the Military Courts, the Special Courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That was the Fianna Fáil programme, believe it or not&mdash;and Deputy Cowan condemned it and stated that he did not agree with it, when he was seeking the suffrage of the people of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital expenditure policy of the last Government was based on a sound financial foundation.  If this country does not continue that policy, no matter what Government is in office, the country will find itself faced with some of the difficulties and dangers that Deputy Lemass, now Minister for <Col N="2248" /> Industry and Commerce, foresaw before the last election.  Our Government believed that the best way to defend this country was to establish in it a sound economic condition both for agriculture and industry, owners and workers alike.  I am a firm believer in that.  Believe it or not, the best defence this country ever put up politically or nationally was when our people were able to keep their heads above the water.  Whatever success we had in 1920 and 1921 was due to the Irish farmer and the Irish people generally who were in a sound financial position and could, therefore, keep us in the field.  They were in a position to keep us in their homes and make us all welcome. The Irish people are a proud people and when there is full and plenty in the house you are always welcome, but if they have not full and plenty you are not welcome.</P>
    <P>The land rehabilitation project, the development of agriculture generally and afforestation are things which will build up the financial wealth of the nation.  Already there has been a decided and positive improvement in the standard of living.  Let us hope that will continue.  In so far as the present Government continues that programme, as far as I am concerned I will do all I can to help.  The only opposition I will offer is when I believe the Government is doing something which will damage the country and the livelihood of our people.  I know the present Government will not do that intentionally but, being the blunderers they are, God only knows what they will do.  They have done many wild things in the past for which the Irish people apparently have forgiven them. Why I do not know.  The people have the right to do that if they want to, but a day of reckoning will come.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the policy of the present Government is in relation to the defence of our country.  The Government to which I had the honour to belong took the view that the best defensive measure this country could adopt was to raise the country itself to a high economic level thereby putting ourselves in the position that we could put our manpower into the rehabilitation of our land, housing, afforestation and drainage.  That is a <Col N="2249" /> sound policy of defence.  The more that is done along those lines the stronger we will be and every farmer who joins the F.C.A. will be able to do a very fine piece of work if proper use is made of that force.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to attack the Government or even the Minister for Finance for their failure to put up a munition factory.  When I was Minister for Defence the present Minister for Finance was repeatedly asking was I going to wait until the Ford factory in Cork ran some of the munitions we needed off the lines.  The Ford factory in Cork does run some stuff off the lines which is essential for defence. There is one thing certain and that is that the Ford factory in Cork, or any other factory, will do more for the defence of our country than the 30-years planned munition factory that never came to fruition about which we heard so much from the present Minister for External Affairs when he was Minister for Defence.  If some of the younger Deputies will read reports they will see how far that munition factory was planned and how far it got.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I throw my mind back to the First Dáil.  The Clerk of the House at that time called the roll at every Dáil meeting. He called Sir Edward Carson and Michael Collins.  He called Sir James Craig and Alfie Byrne.  He called John Redmond and everyone else.  The fact that we were all called to an Irish Parliament left no doubt as to what the then Dáil was seeking to govern.  All the elected representatives of the Irish people were being called to take their place in the sovereign Parliament of the nation.  When I look at the Order Paper, motion No. 6 certainly appeals to me.  I should like Deputies to consider it because I think, from the way in which it has been discussed, a number of Deputies just simply approach it as one of the means by which representatives from Northern Ireland can be given a right of audience here.  It is however much more than that and, before the House comes to a decision on it, I think it should be examined in some greater detail.  I do not know whether or not the mover explained it fully&mdash;I was not here, I regret to say&mdash;but in case he did not, I <Col N="2251" /> should like to stress a few points in regard to it.  The motion reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Believing that, in order to achieve the unity of Ireland, a greater degree of contact and co-operation between the elected representatives of the people of the six occupied counties and members of the Oireachtas is required, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to initiate proposals for legislation in the Dáil or in the Seanad whereby all the elected parliamentary representatives of the people of the six occupied counties of Ireland will be given a right of audience in the Dáil or in the Seanad, as may be determined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion appeals very much to me, as I say, and I think it should appeal to every one of us.  Why?  If it is passed, I believe that it is an invitation to all the elected representatives in Northern Ireland to come here.  In passing it, we shall have taken the first step in showing our good will towards these people.</P>
    <P>I am stressing the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; but, as I say, I wish this motion was not discussed in this particular way and that it was not mixed up with the Vote for the Taoiseach because, believe it or not, the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department is at present our own domestic affair in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Let us hope that at a later stage it will become the affair of the whole 32 Counties but we are not, at present, owing to our political and other affiliations, just capable of approaching the motion in the objective way in which we should approach it.  As, however, the House has decided that it should be discussed in this way, I commend it to Deputies in order that the invitation may be sent out and that the Dáil may ask the Government to take the steps suggested in the motion.</P>
    <P>I support the motion in the firm belief that it will lead to a restoration of some of my pristine courage inasmuch as it is taking a step which will show to our fellow countrymen in the Six Counties, be they Nationalist or Unionist, Orange or Green, that we do regard them as forming an integral part of this nation, that we do regard them as Irishmen possessing equal rights and subject to equal obligations <Col N="2252" /> but that we do not intend to give, and will not give, them any privilege over other citizens.</P>
    <P>As I say, this Vote is one on which the Taoiseach should have given us much more information.  He should have told us, and settled once and for all, his views on the difficult question that brought about, in no small way, the defeat of the previous Government. He should have told us what reply the Government are going to make to the Hierarchy, and what reply they will now make to the letter of October, 1947, which was acknowledged only in February, 1948. He should have told us whether a positive reply will now be sent so that the people of this country can know exactly where we stand.  He should have indicated that this House condemns in the strongest possible manner the action of any Deputy or Deputies who attack in an unmannerly way either the bishops of the Catholic Church or the leaders of any other Church in this country.  I want to stress in conclusion that this Dáil has no intention of legislating against any religious denomination.  It is true that we are forbidden to legislate for them by the Constitution, but it is equally true that we are not to legislate against them.  Remember that the Catholic Church is still a very powerful force in this country.  Let the Government realise that; and let them realise, too, that any tin can that may be tied to their tail can bring them grave disaster.</P>

In the course of this debate, I have been subjected to a considerable amount of abuse, simply and solely because I exercised a constitutional and democratic right in this House not so long ago.  Having looked up the records, I find that the strange thing is that most of the criticism I got came from individuals who were themselves in their time subjected to the same type of abuse for doing exactly the same thing as I did.  Go back and read the records of the House; read Deputy Morrissey on Deputy McGilligan, Deputy McGilligan on Deputy Morrissey, Deputy McGilligan on Deputy Norton, and what they said about one another.

      <P>The extraordinary <Col N="2254" /> thing about it is that they can say these things.  They can swivel and twist, but nobody else can change a view if that change does not accord with their ideas.  I have heard General MacEoin and other Deputies talking about our concepts of Christianity: Love your neighbour.  Since the vote that brought about the change of Government took place, these exponents of &ldquo;love your neighbour&rdquo; walk around this House and these corridors refusing to speak to Deputies who voted against them.  Love your neighbour!  Uphold Christianity! Do not look the side of the road that your neighbour is walking on! That is very relevant to the discussion that has been initiated here to-day by Deputy MacBride and I hope to deal with it in a few moments.</P>
      <P>I think it is important from the country's point of view that we should have stable government.  It is an important thing for the administration of the country and for the credit of the country that we should have a Government in office that has a reasonable expectation of a period of three, four or five years of life.  Some Deputies who desscribe themselves as concerned with the interests and the future of the country refer to the Government as &ldquo;a caretaker&rdquo; Government.  Deputy MacBride to-day referred to it as depending on &ldquo;five irresponsibles&rdquo; and I was the most irresponsible of the five.</P>

      <P>I asked a simple parliamentary question to-day about an individual who is one of my constituents. I do not happen to know him, but I thought it was necessary, having been requested, to put down a parliamentary question.  I am aware that this individual is known to members of the Clann na Poblachta Party and to members of the Labour Party, but the privileges of this House were used by a Fine Gael Deputy to do harm to this person whom he never met and does not know, no more than I know him.  Nevertheless, he used his bitter malice to do damage to that individual who could not defend himself and who was not here.  I do not mind what the Deputies round about me say, or what anybody says, about me, but I do think it is wrong that they should have that attitude or that we should have these references where a man's employment is at stake.  I sincerely hope that that Deputy will understand that there are great privileges in this House, but they should not be used to injure a person who cannot defend himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Hickey will agree with the observations I am about to make.  The Government must take a decision to increase employment.  They must take a decision to establish new industries. They must continue and accelerate the house-building programme.  They must continue and accelerate the building of hospitals and public buildings. The fishing industry has to be modernised and developed.  Afforestation has to be pressed ahead, and it must be gone ahead with on a larger <Col N="2258" /> scale than we have had up to the present, although I appreciate and understand the difficulties and why that scale could not have been bigger. But those steps must be taken and, inevitably, the problem arises in egard to the provision of money.  I think any economist or any person who knows anything about economics must know that some of the things which are being said about the repatriation of our external assets are all poppycock and nonsense and are being said by people who know nothing whatever about the subject.</P>
      <P>What we want, and I recommend it to the Minister, is a policy that I learned when I was in the Labour Party, a policy about which I wrote for Clann na Poblachta and for which we did more propaganda work in Clann na Poblachta than the Labour Party did, and that is breaking the link with sterling and taking over our monetary control.  We want credit to do all this nationally desirable work, and that credit must be provided by our Central Bank freed from the shackles of control by sterling.</P>

I think Deputy MacBride was very unwise in getting these motions interlocked with an important debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate involving as it does all those problems of finance and economics and the general policy of the State and the Government, because the result of that ill-timed action has been that very little of the 12 hours' debate has been available for serious consideration of these motions.  I suggest to Deputy MacBride and Deputy MacEoin, who have spoken on this matter, that there was a certain illogicality about their attitude.  They want Sir Basil Brooke down here&mdash;at least they say they want him.  When I addressed an observation to Deputy MacBride to-day, he made a slightly bitter attack on me because I disagreed with some actions of our Hierarchy. If Sir Basil Brooke comes in here, he cannot be tied down to accept everything that is said by the Hierarchy, and the sooner that is accepted the <Col N="2260" /> better.

      <P>I want Deputy MacBride to realise this, that as far as the North of Ireland is concerned, there is a very big and a very serious problem there.  He appreciates what that problem is and he understands it, but he will not help to end that problem by using certain situations down here against individuals that he does not like.  It may be all right, it may be a passport to political oblivion, to use the Hierarchy against an individual who endeavours to express his own point of view, but look at what damage that can do to the national interest.

      <P>We have had a lot of talk in this House about Partition, how to end it, how to approach it.  The attitude of the last Government in regard to the matter that I was just discussing was certainly not the right attitude.  It was not the right way to deal with it.  It was not helpful.  I have indicated that very clearly and I want to indicate it again, because of what has been stated by Deputy MacBride here to-day&mdash;it has been stated by Deputy MacEoin&mdash;that force is not the means to end Partition.  We were told that 30 years ago.  Deputy Dillon's father, respected man, told us that force was not the way to gain freedom in this country.</P>

      <P>That was 30 years ago.  We were told that.  We did not believe it.  We knew it was wrong and it was wrong.  I say that those people who have grown old, experienced, and tell us now that force is not the method for ending Partition are just as wrong as these elderly gentlemen were 30 or 40 years ago.  We want to end Partition and I have considered it from all its angles and all its aspects and, if Partition is to be ended in our time, it can only be ended by the enforcement of our will on the will of our fellow citizens in the Six Counties.</P>

Will any Deputy, Deputy MacBride or anybody else, say it would be wrong for the Nationalists of the Six Counties to rise and by force put an end to the present régime up there?

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon. That is not so.  I asked for Government time in which to discuss this motion. The Tánaiste then decided that Government time would be available in the <Col N="2266" /> course of this discussion.  It was not at my suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that is complete misrepresentation of the facts.  The facts are these, that these motions were far down on the Order Paper, that Deputy MacBride asked that they should be taken out of their order and given precedence, apparently because of the fact that, he having put them down, he attaches overriding importance to them and wants to be at the head of the queue.  When this plea was made by Deputy MacBride a compromise was reached.  We had not the time in this session to give him the particular period which he wanted, and he agreed that they would be debated on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I drew the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that an assurance had been given by his predecessor that Government time would be made available, in the course of this session, for the discussion of these two motions.  The Taoiseach then asked me to repeat the questions next day, and on the next day I was informed that they would be taken in the course of this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, I think the facts in regard to it are perfectly clear. There were 12 hours available for the discussion of the Taoiseach's Estimate. If Deputy MacBride had not his motion discussed to-day, it would have been left over, and public time would have been made available for it, I have no doubt, at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>We have had an example of this inaction.  Deputy MacBride has suggested that what we should do is to invite the Deputies to come down here, and sit in, with no right to vote, but probably the right to intervene in discussions.  Now, <Col N="2267" /> during the period of office of the last Government, we had one Senator appointed from the Six Counties.

      <P>Anyway, that particular Senator has been in the Seanad.  The idea was that he would represent Six County interests.  He was suggested by the Clann na Poblachta Party, and that was a Clann na Poblachta idea.  Now, he is actually a member of the Seanad, entitled to participate in everything relating to the whole of the 32 Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not criticising the Seanad or the Senator for whom I have respect.  What we have to consider is that the Clann na Poblachta Party had the idea that that would be a step in the right direction &mdash;to invite such public representatives of the Six Counties as would come in here to come either into the Dáil or into the Seanad, where they could participate in discussions on matters affecting all Ireland.  Now, undoubtedly there are practical difficulties in the way.  I look on it, as I did at the time it was first advocated, as an <Col N="2268" /> excellent gesture to our people in the Six Counties, and as an evidence of our determination to do all that we can to bring an end to Partition.</P>

      <P>I want to say in conclusion, as far as these two motions are concerned, that the intention behind them originally, when they were first considered, was a genuine effort to do something practical in the way of ending Partition.  As one of the persons who advocated that idea through the country I, naturally, support both resolutions, but the danger I see in this form of resolution is that it might take people away from the fundamental problem that is there, the problem of ending Partition.  We can invite people down for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, but that will not end Partition.  There is only one way in which Partition can <Col N="2270" /> be ended.  It is the way in which the measure of freedom we have in this part of the country was achieved.  It was achieved against all types of enemies, both foreign and domestic. When we were engaged in the struggle with the British we were not just fighting the British only.  We had to fight on other fronts, and we fought on those other fronts.</P>

      <P>Leave that element out of it.  I admit that the service which I gave to this country was very small.  It was service given, because it could only be given, when I was less than 17 years of age.  Perhaps if I were a little older, I might have been able to give more service, but, as little as it was, I am not ashamed of that service.  What I do say is that, just as we had to fight these foreign and domestic enemies, we still have to fight foreign and domestic enemies, and until the youth of this country make up their minds that they want to put an end to Partition, it will not be put an end to, but will be the plaything of politicians who will use it for their own personal interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Cowan along the lines of the speech which he made.  Although there is much difference between <Col N="2271" /> members of the present Government Front Bench and myself, they will agree with me that it was one of the most nationally damaging speeches made in this House for a long time and one which, I am afraid, might be responsible for bloodshed.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about the economic position and the Government's policy in that regard.  When I came in here this evening, I heard Deputy Corry declaiming about the policy of the previous Government in regard to the production of wheat and I remembered looking not so very long ago at a plan and scheme submitted by Fianna Fáil in July, 1947, to the Committee on European Economic Co-operation.  I remembered what they had set out in their scheme, what was sent under the signature of Deputy Smith, as Minister for Agriculture, and later, of Deputy de Valera, as Minister for External Affairs, to Paris to the Committee on European Economic Co-operation as their programme for the production of native wheat in 1950-51, the year which has just passed, the programme of what they intended to do if they had remained as a Government until 1950-51.  It was that there would be 100,000 hectares of wheat to yield 144 metric tons last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That went under their signatures as their plan and scheme.  One hundred thousand hectares are equivalent to 247,000 acres and 144 metric tons to 129,000 tons, as we speak of them.  That was their plan and scheme and we heard Deputy Corry to-night chastising Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture for having failed to reach the Fianna Fáil standard. What is the truth?  The truth is that, whereas they said they were going to produce 247,000 acres of wheat we had 345,000 acres and where they spoke of 129,000 tons, we had approximately double that amount, 260,000 tons.  These figures are vouched for in the statistical survey issued by the Taoiseach's Department to-day.  If Deputy Corry is to come in here and purport to discuss the details of agricultural administration on this Estimate, he might at least find out that his details were correct and might be careful to make <Col N="2272" /> certain that his own leaders had not let him down and had not furnished facts and figures of which he and the rest of the rank and file were never made aware, because they were to be sent out, as they have been sent out during the past three years, on a campaign of scurrility and abuse on that very subject.</P>
    <P>Last night, we heard a pitiable wail from the Minister for Finance, and the Taoiseach to-day, in introducing this Estimate, omitted to make any reference to or to give any review of the economic position as it is and as he found it.  Some of us were at considerable loss to understand why that was so, but, quite by accident, some of us discovered the reason.  To-day is the 19th of July and yesterday was the 18th, and on yesterday the statistical survey was tabled as well as the report of the Land Commission.  The report of the Land Commission was furnished to every Deputy, but the statistical survey was not so furnished.  When Deputies went to look for it about 5 o'clock, they could not get copies, but eventually one copy was got in the Library, and afterwards further copies were obtained.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy does <Col N="2273" /> not think, when I have dealt with them, that I have covered them all, I will willingly go back to them.  It starts off, as any statistical survey must start off, and shows that the national income had increased to a sum of £363,000,000 in 1950, compared with £318,000,000 in 1947 and £158,000,000 in 1938.  Undoubtedly, some of that increase is due to increases in prices or a decrease in the value of money whichever way you like to put it, and this survey deals with that very point.  It shows quite clearly that the view of the statistical department is that, even allowing for the decrease in the value of money or the increase in prices&mdash;it does not matter much how you describe it&mdash;there has been an increase of 24 per cent. since 1938.  That is the view of the Director of Statistics apparently as shown by this survey&mdash;an increase of 24 per cent. over the last year pre-war, allowing for changes in price levels.  If Deputy Briscoe considers that that is something which it is desirable for me to bring out, I entirely agree that it is eminently desirable.</P>
      <P>One of the next items the survey deals with is the question of personal expenditure.  It shows in a table on page 7 a steady increase in personal expenditure, an increase which Deputy Norton mentioned in his speech.  He was interrupted by Deputy Colley who adverted&mdash;and he was quite right in doing so&mdash;to the fact that part of the increase mentioned by Deputy Norton was due again to increases in price levels or a decrease in the value of money.  Deputy Colley was perfectly right in that regard.  Deputy Norton had only just got the survey in his hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he had had the opportunity I have had since then to study it, he would have seen that the Director of Statistics, who published this brochure &mdash;again taking into account the very keen point made by Deputy Colley&mdash; has shown in his survey that, taking the price level of 1938, that is, a figure of 146, the figure in 1950 at the 1938 price level was 185, showing a welcome increase in the standard of living of our people.  The significant thing about it is that that increase has come cumulatively, progressively and <Col N="2274" /> steadily during the three years of the inter-Party Government, for which these figures have been compiled.</P>
    <P>We pass on from that&mdash;I do not want to exceed the limit of time allowed&mdash; to the volume of physical capital formation and we find there that whereas, again taking the 1938 price level, the 1938 figure was £14.2 million, the figure in 1950 was £22.7 million, or very nearly double what it was in 1938 at the then 1938 price level.  Of course, if you take into account the existing change in prices, it comes up from £14.2 million to £54,000,000.</P>
    <P>We pass to the return made in regard to the production of industrial transportable goods.  We find that, taking the 1938 prices as the level and taking the figure there as 100, in 1947 that 100 had only increased to 120&mdash;and I am not blaming Fianna Fáil altogether for that&mdash;but from 1947 to 1950, in those three years it increased not merely 20 points but 46.4 points up to 166.  Therefore, there has been onethird as much again industrial transportable goods produced at the end of the three years of the inter-Party Government as there was at the time when we took over the reins of government in 1948.</P>
    <P>We can follow on from that to the figure for gross agricultural output and, incidentally, on that aspect I have not yet seen the Dáil Report naturally of the Minister for Finance's speech last night, and therefore can only go by the newspapers, but it would seem to me from comparing the newspaper report of what Deputy Aiken, the Minister for External Affairs, said, and what I heard Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, say last night, that they seem to be in two different minds on the figures of agricultural output.  Anyway, the facts in regard to that output are set out, and we find that in this table issued by the Taoiseach's Department, we can compare the figures from 1938 up to the present time and we can see exactly what the position is in regard to gross output and net output.  In considering the figures for net output we must remember that, during the years of the war&mdash;<Col N="2275" /> certainly it was not the fault of the people opposite&mdash;the war made it impossible to get fertilisers and during those years the land had to be mined. But when you compare, in the table on page 17, the gross output, and deduct from the gross output the allowance, for example, that there is in the year 1942-43 of 18.1, which is all that the farmer could buy, you will see naturally that it was possible to get a net figure of 108, because in fact what was happening was that during those years the farmer was not able to get artificials.</P>

      <P>I am making my speech according to the understanding made and will not break the bargain as the Deputy broke it shamelessly yesterday and then more shamelessly tried to stand over the breach.  What is clear from the figures is that you have 108 as net output in 1942-43 and that net output is arrived at when taking only the figure 18.1 in respect of the purchases of the farmers, because during those years fertilisers were not available, there was no proper agricultural machinery or anything else available for them and, of course, there was bound to be a huge drop because at the time the machinery was going out of date and the land was being mined. What has happened?  We find now that we have gone successively up the scale of farmers' purchases.  From 18.1, which was the depth to which we sank during the war years&mdash;through no fault of Fianna Fáil&mdash;we have gone successively up 30, 35, 36, 51, 55, 70, 86 to 97.  When one takes into account that these purchases, properly weighted, are able to produce properly a figure that is comparable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister for Finance permits me, I would point out the answer to that question.  It shows quite clearly that what has been happening during those years is that the farmer has been going back to the position in which he realises, and is able to realise, that the best bank that the farmer can possibly have is the bank of land in which to sink fertilisers and other weapons of the capital of husbandry.  It is perfectly clear from that what the position is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that I have not heard any arguments from the Government Benches against my two motions.  I have not heard one single Minister give any reason against these motions.  I am sorry that the motions had to be discussed in this <Col N="2278" /> somewhat hurried atmosphere.  I would have liked that we should have had a much longer time to discuss them.  As I indicated when I proposed the motions, it was my desire that this matter should be considered objectively by both sides of the House. Frankly, the views I expressed this morning are confirmed by the discussion that has taken place in the House.  I do not think that there is any valid reason against these motions.  I think it is largely a question of prejudice&mdash;possibly prejudice is a strong word&mdash;but largely a question of minds having been set against a proposal of this nature for a certain length of time.  That objection, if you like, was reached in different circumstances. I hope that it will be possible, in the course of a discussion in this House, to review the matter objectively.</P>
      <P>I am prepared, at this stage, not to press these motions to a division if I get any indication from the Taoiseach that he is prepared to review the position objectively and afford this House an opportunity of discussing the matter at an early date next Session, giving us full time and opportunity to consider them fully.  These are motions which I would like to see passed unanimously by the House.</P>
      <P>Another course that I would suggest to the Taoiseach&mdash;and it would enable me not to ask the House to divide on these motions, if he is prepared to tell me or tell the House whether he is willing to consider it&mdash;is that we should have a referendum on this question.  It seems to me an ideal question upon which to seek the views of the Irish people.  It would be an easy matter upon which to have a referendum.  If the Taoiseach gives me any indication, in the course of his reply, that he is prepared to consider either of these propositions, then I will not press these motions to a division.  If he does not, I am afraid I will have to ask the House to divide on them.</P>

      <P>On the question of Partition, which is, as everybody admits, the most serious problem, from a national point of view, that we have to deal with, no Government that is <Col N="2279" /> representative of the Irish people would fail to give the fullest possible consideration to any proposal that holds out any promise of putting an end to that situation.  Naturally, when motions of this sort come up&mdash;and I have, in regard to that particular one, considered it time out of mind&mdash;one has to ask oneself the serious question: &ldquo;Will it or will it not help towards solving Partition?&rdquo; The decision that I have come to is precisely the decision that was reached by the Head of the recent Government, and that is, that it will not.  I came to that conclusion many years ago.  It is not that my mind is set on the matter.  If conditions change or a new situation arises in which it is clear that this would be a step forward, then I would be all in favour of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride says that no argument has been put forward against it. It was the duty of the mover of the motions, I suggest, to put arguments in favour of it and show clearly that it was going to be a step in the right direction.  He has not done that.  I thought, in answer to a remark by Deputy O'Donnell, that a great deal of to-day's discussion would have ranged round that question.  From what I have heard myself and from information as to what transpired afterwards it did not range around that question. Why?  Because there was not made by the mover of it any positive suggestion or positive argument that was going to help towards solving our problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. One of the arguments was that in 1919 the First Dáil was open to all the elected representatives of the Irish nation.  That was quite right in the circumstances of that particular time, but a lot of things have happened since, either fortunately or unfortunately, according to the way you look at it, and we have a situation to-day in which this part of the country is completely free, with a functioning Parliament, with a representative democracy in which every member here represents a particular area in our <Col N="2280" /> country.  That is a fact and it is that which has made it quite impracticable from the point of view of dealing with the representatives of the North here as we would have dealt with them in that particular area because we did try to function and to exercise our <i>de jure</i> jurisdiction not in this part of the country alone but over the country as a whole.  The position now is that we are not in a position in which we can exercise jurisdiction over that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>De facto</i>.  We are not in a position to do so and as far as the Constitution goes, we are limited in jurisdiction pending the reintegration of the country with the area of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>But we claim jurisdiction over the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If claiming was going to solve it, then there was not any difficulty.  The fact is to make good our claim.  How are we, by a gesture of this sort, to make good our claim?  If we were able, for instance, when we had representatives of the majority of the people of Tyrone, Fermanagh, South Down and Armagh here to say: &ldquo;The people whom you represent will be effectively under our jurisdiction&rdquo;, there would be a great deal to be said for the introduction of these motions.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that with a heart and a half we who represent the people of the Twenty-Six Counties would welcome the people from the North in here in a united Parliament.  There is no question of any division of opinion between Parties or in the nation as a whole.  I am perfectly certain that to-morrow, without any arguments of any kind, at least 90 per cent. or nearer 99 per cent. of the people in this part of the country would vote for the unity of our country if it were put to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the introduction here of members from the North help that?  At first the proposal was that they be allowed to vote here but that was ruled out because of constitutional difficulty. As the Leader of the Opposition, however, quite rightly says, if that was all that was in the way we could easily get rid of it because the Constitution could <Col N="2281" /> be amended and any laws which follow it could also be amended so the constitutional difficulty would not be a difficulty.</P>
    <P>The difficulty would be that we would have people here able to cast their votes on the matters that come up for decision with a feeling very different from that of the other members. They would be in a specially privileged position because the results of their action would not appear in the form of taxation or burdens on the people of the area they represented. They would be able to get neither advantages nor disadvantages for those people seeing that our jurisdiction does not extend over that area.  For that reason, we could not ask them to come in here.  If they did, they would be a very short time here when they would probably take sides and that would mean that certain antagonisms would be created.</P>
    <P>At the present time we are all unanimous in desiring to bring about the end of Partition, and if any way of doing it was shown you would not need a national Government to do it. If anybody on any of these benches were able to show to-morrow a pactical way by which Partition could be ended he would be the Leader of the Government without any delay because that would be a sufficiently important political matter to give the leadership to him and to those who supported him.  It is because nobody has been able to point out a definite practical way by which one would ensure that Partition would be ended that the difficulty arises, and that difficulty arises with the people in the North.  That is why they are very often at sixes and sevens themselves regarding what policy they should pursue.  If they were represented here they would create antagonisms and difficulties between themselves too.</P>
    <P>I remember that after the Treaty I suggested to the people in the North not to enter the Northern Parliament because I thought at that particular time that the national attitude towards it could be so expressed.  In a very short time the people up there showed <Col N="2282" /> that they did not agree with that. They wanted a different policy.  There had been waverings to and fro over a period of years and arguments on different sides as to whether or not they should be represented in the Northern Parliament.  Their coming down here would raise that question again and again because here we have a republican position while in the North they have quite a different one so they would create antagonisms amongst themselves.  This proposal if it were carried out would create antagonisms and would also in a very short time prove its own futility.  People would ask themselves the question: what is the use of sending down members to Dublin if those members are not able to affect our daily lives or bring about the end of Partition?  So in the full sense of full membership we can see at once that it does not lead us to the goal at which we are aiming.</P>
    <P>It would be almost as bad if they were to come here simply with the right of audience.  When will that right be exercised?  People can by arguments and speeches create antagonism almost as effectively as by their votes. Again, antagonisms would be created. We have nothing to gain.  The only argument I saw put forward was that there would be a closer relationship between the people here and the people of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I think that the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition was one with which I would be willing to agree.  If you could get up there a body representative of the attitude of those who are against the partition of the country and if they appointed a small executive group it would be quite easy for a Government group to meet them and consult with them regularly.  I would be agreeable to that and support that proposition if I were on the opposite benches and the former Taoiseach were speaking from these.  I think it a more practical way of bringing about consultation, co-operation and understanding than the other, though I do say that I have not any great hopes of what would be secured by it, because what would be very likely to happen in circumstances of that kind would be that <Col N="2283" /> more danger of misunderstanding than good would be derived.  The problem being so difficult to solve, the people in the North suffering as they are suffering, our being unable to bring them the practical aid, they would hold that we are not doing what they think we should do and what we believe it is not possible for us to do.</P>
    <P>Long before this matter arose, before I was in the Government at all, I suggested to the people in the North that the first thing to do was that they themselves should decide on a policy up there and get a body which would be fairly representative of their views and co-operate with such bodies as there were down here.  I was asked to establish the Fianna Fáil Party in that part of the country but I refrained from doing it because again I believed that it would lead to antagonisms. Instead of co-operating, our political difficulties would be reflected up there and their political difficulties would be reflected down here.  Instead of getting closer together we would get further apart and more divided.  We are at present as unanimous on the question as it is possible for a body of representatives to be.  I have not the slightest doubt that if I or somebody on the opposite benches came in to-morrow with any practical proposition to put an end to Partition, I or he would get the wholehearted support of everybody in the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can go any further with the question or with the argument in connection with it to show my view.  All I can say is that having deliberately considered it in the same way as the Leader of the Opposition apparently did when he was in office, I see no progress to be made by adopting the proposals in the resolution, and therefore if it were put to a vote we would have to vote against it.  I say at the same time that at no time will we close our minds to any suggestion whatsoever, no matter from whom it comes, that would help us on our way to end that evil.  If I may come on to the other part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  There are only two cases, as far as I know, under the Constitution in which you can have a referendum.  The first is on a constitutional amendment and the second is when a Bill is going through the Dáil and there is objection by a majority of the Seanad, and one-third of the representatives of the Dáil sign a petition to the President to have the Bill referred to the people.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman's point was that you were provided with the survey and why did you not quote from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I had another survey, which was made independently, to deal with it.  My attitude was that when we had previous debates here, one of the rules had been that the Opposition would put up certain questions to be considered and that generally led to a very unsatisfactory debate.  I was quite pleased when the former Taoiseach introduced a different system and I was <Col N="2286" /> between two minds as to whether I would deal with the survey or not. Because we had two motions to-day which I thought were going to be the main substance of the debate, I felt that there was no use in mixing all these things up.  With regard to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that I did not do so because it would seem to help the claims that are being made by the previous Administration, I do not think it bears that out at all.  It is very easy to take certain dates and use them as reference dates.  The year 1938 is a very nice date to take for a number of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What about later dates&mdash;1947 and 1948?  When it suited Deputy Dillon, he was very fond of taking these dates.  When we talk about increasing the national income, I think it is interesting to trace it up a bit and not suddenly start at 1938 and leave a gap and forget the changes that took place from the end of the war on.  Anybody who studies these statistics carefully and draws a graph will realise at once that the rate of progress which was evident from 1947 to 1948 was not continued.  That is what emerges from these statistics, but it will not emerge from them if you conveniently skip from 1938 to 1950.</P>

But if you continue it and see what it was when we left office you will see that it was 318&mdash;so that <Col N="2287" /> part of the difference between 158 and 318 has to be accounted for in our time.  I am not going to take away from the fact that the increase has been continued.  I only say that the statistics prove that the rate of increase has not been continued.</P>

I have figures here showing the index of industrial employment in all industries and services. Take 1926, which was the period of the first industrial survey, as 100. The employment in the year 1926 was 100.  It became 108 in 1931.  By 1938 it was 162.  Then, during the war period, there was a change.  However, it was back in 1946, slightly above what it was in 1938.  It went up in 1947 from 163 to 179, that is, it went up 16 points. The next year it went from 179 to 193 and that represents only 14 points up. In 1949 it went up to 201 and in 1950 to 214.  These figures bear out the fact that the rate of increase was greatest from the end of the war until we left office.</P>

      <P>But I am giving you figures with which I had nothing to do and in relation to which I made no suggestion or gave no orders.  They were given to me and I am simply reading them.  The year 1926 was chosen because it was the first year in which there was an industrial production survey.  As far as the volume of production is concerned, if one takes 1926 again as 100, because it is very easy to relate one to the other once you have a base and it requires very little arithmetic to change from that to another base in order to check whether I am right or wrong, one finds somewhat remarkably that 1938 is 162, or very nearly the same, so that employment and production went up step by step almost equally.  But in 1946 it was 165; in 1947 it was 184; in 1948 it was 208; in 1949 it was 237 and in 1950 it was 258.  Those are the figures and they prove, I think, my contention. The interesting thing about the two figures taken together is the fact that the volume of production increased more rapidly than employment; in other words productivity, possibly through the use of machinery or something else&mdash;I am not quite sure of what the actual reason is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Productivity, using the word to show the relation between <Col N="2290" /> production and employment&mdash;that is the amount of power per man so to speak&mdash;has increased.

Let it not try to grab all and pretend that all this happened overnight by some miracle. It was a continuous progress as a result of the deliberate policy we initiated.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that I have to raise this question on the Adjournment to-night.  However, in view of the fact that I have questioned the various people in charge for the past three years in connection with drainage and have met with failure on all occasions, I think it is essential that, in the interests of my constituents, I should raise this matter to-night.</P>
      <P>The question which I raised with the Minister for Finance was one in connection with the drainage of the River Suck.  I asked the Minister if he would state when the survey for the arterial drainage scheme for that sub-catchment area was likely to commence. The reply I got from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister was that he is not in a position to say when the survey of the River Suck catchment area is likely to commence.  I live in close proximity to this river, and it borders my constituency for practically the entire length of the county.  I might say also that the Parliamentary Secretary himself has an interest in the drainage of this river.  Apart from his duty altogether as a Parliamentary Secretary, he has duties as an elected T.D. for a constituency which is in close proximity to this river also.  He is just as familiar as myself with the problem that arises there each year in connection with the dreadful flooding that occurs.  I was absolutely dumbfounded to-day at the answer I received from the Parliamentary Secretary, because I was under the impression, and so were many of my constituents and Deputy Beegan's constituents as well, that this particular catchment area was going to receive priority treatment in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the answer given to-day has made me, for one, realise that the problem of drainage will not evidently be tackled in a serious manner by the present Administration.  This particular river drains a large area of land. Apart from the type of land that it drains, the question must be taken into consideration of the number of people who make their living on that land.  I understand&mdash;and in this I may be open <Col N="2296" /> to correction&mdash;that the old priority list of drainage schemes that existed before the inter-Party Government came into office in 1948 was made out on the basis that good land must be drained first and that was the only thing taken into consideration.  When the inter-Party Government came in that priority list was changed and other factors were taken into consideration such as the number of families which had to depend for a living on land that was subject to flooding.  I want to put it to this House that on the land attached to the River Suck catchment area there are more people living to the square mile than are living on land adjoining any other catchment area in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That, of course, raises, straight away, the question of the human element.  I, for one, believe that, when there is a large number of families living on land in close proximity to a river that is liable to overflow at certain times of the year, that area should get priority and that particular river should receive first consideration.  It is all very fine for us to say that good land needs drainage but if there are very few people owning that good land or very few families making their living on it, I think that the catchment area adjoining that land should remain lower down on the priority list than a catchment area adjoining land where a large number of families have to make their living.</P>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage Act was passed in 1945.  I seriously believe that, from 1945 on, when that Act was passed&mdash;I can only go by the references made in this House and by the speeches made by men who were Ministers at that time&mdash;Fianna Fáil were not keen on going ahead with the drainage works at a fast rate.  That can be borne out by the fact that it was decided by Fianna Fáil that they would spend no more than the sum of £250,000 per year on arterial drainage.  If the Fianna Fáil attitude with regard to arterial drainage is that they are not prepared to spend any more than £250,000 per year, then I can quite understand why the survey of the River Suck will not be carried out in the near future.  A further proof that Fianna Fáil do not take drainage problems seriously is the <Col N="2297" /> fact that they opposed the Local Authorities (Works) Act under which a tremendous amount of drainage could be done.</P>

    <P>We hear a lot of talk from both sides of the House about the necessity for development and for improving the conditions of the people in the congested areas, but since we got native Government here little or nothing was done in the West of Ireland with regard to the drainage problem until <Col N="2298" /> the inter-Party Government came into office.  As I said at Question Time, a good deal of work was done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act in the West, and a scheme was put up under that Act for drainage work on the River Suck.  I do not know whether that scheme has been sanctioned by the Office of Public Works, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give me some information with regard to that.</P>
    <P>The point is that one of the good things which the inter-Party Government did for the West was the carrying out of drainage and now, when the term of office of that Government is over, we are back to where we started. One of the most essential things in the West of Ireland is the improvement of the holdings.  If the holdings, small as they are, are water-logged and subject to flooding for six months of the year, how can we expect to get the increased agricultural production which is talked about by the present Government? The Arterial Drainage Act was passed in 1945.  Between 1945 and 1948 not one single scheme was put into operation under that Act.  The first scheme was started by the present Government on the Brosna river.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  I have not much experience of raising matters on the Adjournment. The position with regard to the River Suck is that the drainage is not going to be tackled in the near future as we can see from the reply given to-day by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not want to attribute to the Fianna Fáil Party a desire to sabotage the work of <Col N="2299" /> the previous Administration with regard to drainage.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me in connection with the drainage of the River Suck whether it is because of the shortage of trained engineers that he is not in a position to commence this survey work or because there would not be sufficient machinery available afterwards to carry out the drainage work.  Is that the reason the survey is being delayed?</P>
      <P>I understand that a number of engineers were recruited into the service recently and that a good number of engineers were brought into the service since 1948.  I realise that engineers cannot be trained overnight for drainage work, that it takes a long period to make them experts at this type of work.  The position was that, in 1948, there were no engineers available to carry out drainage work and that there were no dredgers or drainage equipment available.  In spite of the fact that a number of engineers were recruited into the service since and that a good deal of equipment was purchased, we still find that the River Suck cannot be put high on the priority list.  I do not believe the shortage of engineers or of drainage equipment is the real reason why this particular scheme is not to be tackled in the near future.  In a supplementary question to-day I referred to the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor stated publicly that it was his intention to put a survey party on the River Suck in April or May this year, if that were possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us when the survey party will be finished on the River Corrib.  I should also like to know if he is prepared to carry out the promise given by his predecessor, who said he would put the survey party on the River Suck as soon as the work on the Corrib was finished.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give a guarantee to the people whose lands are affected by the flooding of the River Suck that as soon as the survey party is finished with the Corrib he will put them on the River Suck. The position is that the Corrib is the biggest catchment area there and when the drainage work on the Corrib is finished the people along the River Suck expected that the machinery and equipment would be put on the River Suck because it adjoins the Corrib.  To my mind, it would be a very senseless proposition to take the engineers and the machinery from the Corrib and bring them down to the South of Ireland or somewhere else and then have to bring them back again to the West.  When the survey party has finished this work on the Corrib the Parliamentary Secretary should put them straightaway on the Suck and, later on, when the drainage scheme on the Corrib is under way, if possible, the Suck should be done at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take into consideration the fact that there are more people to the square mile along the Suck and in the catchment area than there are along the banks of any other river in Ireland. As he knows perfectly well, tremendous hardship is suffered each year by the unfortunate people in villages and areas along the Suck due to the severe flooding.  I remember seeing one village <Col N="2301" /> where 18 families had holdings of approximately five to six acres each on which they depended for their livelihood and for three or four months in the year that village and that small amount of land was practically surrounded by water.  A person died in the particular village and there was no way of getting the remains out except a path across the bog.  That was the way that body had to be taken to the chapel before burial.  That is a shocking state of affairs.  The Parliamentary Secretary is as well aware as I am of the conditions along the Suck and the hardships that are imposed on the people.  The loss of hay each year is enormous.  I do not want to delay the House any longer, but I do want to get a promise from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will put the survey party at present on the Corrib on the Suck as soon as work on the Corrib is finished.</P>

      <P>A question was put to me to-day by Deputy McQuillan in regard to the drainage of the River Suck and I gave him a short, simple reply.  That reply was based on fact and stern reality.  I would be much better pleased if I could give him a much more favourable reply because, as the Deputy mentioned here to-night, the Suck is of some concern to me as well as to him.  I said that I was not in a position to say when a survey of the River Suck catchment area is likely to commence.  Deputy McQuillan then asked by way of supplementary question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that his predecessor stated that a first survey party would be on the River Suck in April or May of this year and will he state if he is prepared to carry out the promises made by his predecessor to this effect?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot carry out the various promises that were made by my predecessor and I am very sorry and the last thing I like to resort to doing is to take any skeletons out of the cupboard in regard <Col N="2302" /> to promises made, even by a member of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is easy to make a promise.  It is easy to have a fertile imagination that would lead one to make a promise but when I was faced with a position and a problem and knew that it was not possible to do that particular thing in the immediate future or after another particular river has been surveyed, there was no other course open to me than to give the reply I gave.  I am told of course that my predecessor made this promise.  If he did make the promise, let us take the promises in strict order.  I have here a copy of the <i>Ballina Herald</i> of Saturday, December 2nd, 1950&mdash;mark the date.</P>
