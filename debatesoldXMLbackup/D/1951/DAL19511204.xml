In view of the fact that everybody is agreed that these charges do represent a grave hardship on the tenants concerned, particularly those living in rural and suburban areas, would the Minister make representations to the board and ask them to reconsider the whole position, particularly with regard to areas near the city in the south of the county?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The regulations governing the payment of allowances provide for slightly higher rates of allowance in the case of beneficiaries resident in the four county boroughs in recognition of the fact that the cost-of-living generally is somewhat higher in these areas than elsewhere in the country.  The disparity, however, between the rates of allowances payable in county boroughs and those payable elsewhere does not necessarily involve payment of allowances at lower rates to persons resident immediately outside the county borough, as health authorities have discretion as to the extent to which maintenance allowances may be abated in respect of income from other sources.  I understand that in the case of residents in Ballyfermot area, County Dublin, who are in receipt of allowances, the Dublin County Council exercises this discretion in the abatement of allowances and, where necessary, supplements the allowances with food vouchers under the Domiciliary Welfare Scheme, so as to remove or <Col N="130" /> reduce the disparity between the county and city rates.</P>

As regards Deputy MacBride's question, I think that when our Social Welfare Bill comes along we will be considering this question of allowances for chronic diseases on a bigger scale.</P>

      <P>I understand that hand-embroidery workers in Donegal, who are normally employed by Northern Ireland linen houses, are not receiving their usual supply of embroidery work because of a falling off in the demand for linen-embroidered goods.  The Gaeltacht Services division is also feeling the effects of the present trade situation and it is only with difficulty that it has maintained its workers in employment.  Until the trade position improves, it would not be feasible for the Gaeltacht Services division to increase production by an extension of this branch of its activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that no facilities at the Garda Barrack, Cloghan, County Offaly, are available for persons desiring to make an urgent telephone call after 9 o'clock at night; and, if so, whether he will ensure that the telephone in the barracks will be made available in the event of necessity after that hour.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will permit the people of Cloghan, County Offaly, to use the telephone in the local Garda Barracks for urgent calls in cases of illness, death, or accidents which occur when the local telephone exchange is not operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig (for the Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to answer Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána at all stations have instructions to permit members of the public to use the station telephone for urgent calls, such as for a priest, doctor or veterinary surgeon, when the local telephone office is closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of this facility for the public gave rise to no difficulties so long as a station orderly was continuously on duty at all stations.  On account of the reduction of Garda strength caused by the stoppage of recruiting in April, 1948, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána found it necessary in November, 1950, to issue a circular, with the approval of the Minister for Justice, authorising the <Col N="136" /> closing of small stations at 9 p.m. when the strength of the station party fell below a sergeant and three men.  Owing to the absence of a guard on protracted sick leave, the strength of the Cloghan station party is only a sergeant and two men.  The station is, accordingly, closed at 9 p.m.  With the reduced over-all strength, it is not possible to increase the strength of Cloghan station.</P>
    <P>I may add that the local Garda officers report that they have not received any complaints that the public have been inconvenienced by the closing of the station at 9 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that there are still numbers of people who, for various reasons, failed to avail of the recent extension of the period for making application for service medals and I.R.A. pensions; and, if so, if he will introduce proposals for legislation allowing a further extension in an endeavour to satisfy all requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Further applications for medals will be accepted provided the applicants furnish satisfactory explanations as to their failure to apply before the 30th January, 1950, but medals granted under such circumstances do not render applicants eligible to apply for special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>The time limit for the acceptance of applications under the Military Service Pensions Acts has been extended to the 7th June, 1952, in the cases of persons who have not previously applied under these Acts, provided they furnish satisfactory explanations as to their failure to apply before the 1st January, 1926, in the case of applicants under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, and before the 1st January, 1946, in the case of applicants under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that very many potential applicants both for service medals and for military pensions, who are in foreign lands or who live even in remote areas in this country, did not realise that there was a final date for application?  Because of these circumstances, would he not extend the period so that everybody may be satisfied in connection with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be surely aware that the 1924 Act is 27 years in existence and the 1934 Act 17 years in existence.  During the intervening period, numerous extensions of <Col N="138" /> time were made in order to facilitate people who for one reason or another had not applied earlier.  I think it would be bringing the Acts into ridicule to continue extending the final dates for application and I do not intend to do so.</P>

The period of attendance must commence not later than 10.30 a.m.  Subject to these conditions, the time table arrangements for national schools are made by or with the approval of the local manager.</P>
      <P>The normal time for the conclusion of school work is 3 p.m.  This arrangement should enable children, even those residing at a distance from the school, to reach their homes before nightfall.</P>

      <P>In replying on the 17th July last to a somewhat similar question from the Deputy, I detailed the measures taken and the arrangements made by my Department in order to impress on the conductors of the schools the importance attached to the planting and care of trees and to the desirability of arranging to have their pupils fully instructed and directed in these matters. In view of what has already been done along these lines I am of opinion that no further recommendations or instructions need be issued to the schools in connection with Arbor Week.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider that a general circular would be useful and act as a reminder to the school authorities at this stage? It would not involve a great deal of difficulty and I think it would be useful for the purpose of drawing the attention of school authorities to Arbor Week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the undermentioned Order made under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Control of Imports (Quota No. 37) (Amendment) Order, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quota Order referred to in this resolution is that which applied to ladies' felt hats.  The amendment of the Order altered the price level of hats to which the quota applied.  The House may be aware of the fact that the quota Order for ladies' felt hats, originally applied before the war, contained no limitation as to the price of hats to which it applied.  Under the Trade Agreement of 1938, the British trade interests were entitled to secure a review of the quota and applied for such a review, but before it was effected agreement was made between the trade interests there and the trade interests here to restrict the hats quota to hats costing less than 12/9 each.  Subsequently, a further agreement between the trade interests was made and implemented last year to raise the price limit to 15/11.  That as Deputies will appreciate, in view of the altered value of money, meant that the protection given to the hat-manufacturing industry here was substantially less than it was before the war and it proved ineffective in checking the decline in the industry.  The amendment Order which the Dáil is now asked to confirm raises the limit <Col N="157" /> to 21/-, which, while still less relatively than the limit before the war, is, it is hoped, adequate to ensure that the decline in the industry will be checked.</P>
    <P>The House understands, of course, that, because of a change in fashion, there has been a very substantial decline in the sale of ladies felt hats. The number sold has in fact fallen by more than half.  Because of the effect of the quota Order, the effect of the decline was felt almost entirely by the Irish industry, as the quota allowed the same number of hats to be imported each year.  While I do not hope that, as a result of this Order or anything I can do, the fashion will change again to get ladies to wear felt hats, I hope that the effect of the Order will be to maintain the present output and maintain employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £20,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1952, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative <Col N="158" /> Expenses in connection therewith; for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, etc.; for Expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide an additional Grant-in-Aid of £20,000 during the current financial year for the Irish Red Cross Society, the intention being that this grant should be paid at once and should be expended by the society in the provision of relief for the victims of the recent disastrous floods in Northern Italy.  I hardly think that it is necessary for me to say a great deal in justification of the proposal.  Nobody can fail to have been moved by the harrowing accounts of these appalling floods, which have inundated hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile land and left more than 250,000 people homeless. The extent to which the disaster has touched the hearts of the Irish people is evidenced by their response to the appeal of His Holiness the Pope and also to those of the Irish Red Cross Society.  It has seemed to the Government that it is only right and that it would be in accordance with the wishes of the Dáil and of the country that, in addition to what has been done by the people themselves, a State grant should also be made available for relief purposes.</P>
    <P>The sum now proposed, will.  I am sure, be gladly voted.  Taken in conjunction with what has already been subscribed in response to the appeals I have mentioned, it will, we hope, be-accepted by the Italian Government and people as an indication of Ireland's great sympathy with them in the affliction to which they have been subjected. It is proposed that the grant should be made to the Irish Red Cross Society for the reason that, by the Red Cross Act, 1938, the society was established for purposes which include the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and the mitigation of suffering <Col N="159" /> throughout the world.  By custom, grants to the society are borne on my Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>Before any question of a grant had arisen, and indeed before any appeal to the people had been made, the society had already sent relief to the full extent of its limited resources.  As a result of the extensive subscriptions and last Sunday's national collection, together with this grant-in-aid, it will now be able to send much larger quantities of urgently needed clothing, blankets, foodstuffs and medical supplies. I am assured by the society that administrative expenses are being kept at the lowest possible figure and that all money received is being utilised to the fullest extent for the purchase of supplies.</P>
    <P>I think it is only right that I should take this opportunity, on behalf of the Government, of thanking the society for its efforts and also of thanking all who, in response to the various appeals, subscribed money, clothing and other supplies; and all who assisted in the collections and in the transport of relief supplies.</P>
    <P>I accordingly ask the Dáil to vote this sum of £20,000.  In doing so, may I express this country's hope for Italy's speedy recovery from the effects of this very great disaster?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the present we have been dealing mainly through the headquarters in Geneva, because we were given to understand that practically the entire personnel of the Red Cross organisation in Italy was in the flooded area, doing whatever is possible to alleviate distress there.  Our supplies, however, are going from here to Rome.  Rome is the terminus at the moment.  I think it will eventually be the Italian Red Cross Society itself which will be dealing with the supplies as they are received in Rome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this very important office is being established for the purpose of furthering the interests of the Gaeltacht areas.  Before proceeding further, I want to say that we in North Mayo feel very grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for having paid a visit to that area, and, on behalf of my constituents and on my own behalf, I want to express my deepest thanks to him for that visit and for the very thorough way in which he did his work while down there.  I was with him in the Mulrany and Achill districts and I heard some people suggesting that politics were being brought into it.  I am proud to say that I did not see any politics being brought in anywhere.  I also want to say that I feel I owe a debt to the Parliamentary Secretary for communicating with me personally and advising me as to the hour of his visit.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the visit by the Parliamentary Secretary, as he will recall, many matters were brought to his notice and he listened carefully to them.  He paid the greatest possible attention and I sincerely hope that he will keep the various matters brought to his notice on that occasion in mind when this sum of money is being spent. We have emigration on a large scale in North Mayo.  Thousands of our boys and girls are unfortunately obliged to migrate to England to earn a livelihood. That has gone on down through the years and is still going on.  If one goes to the bus terminus in Dublin or down to Westland Row station, one will see thousands of people going to and coming from England, the lifeblood of the nation.  It is indeed regrettable that that should be the case, and I sincerely hope that this new office will help to reduce the number of people who are obliged to migrate through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture speaking here last week and he said there was no flight from the land. If there is no flight from the land in his constituency, I can assure him that there is a flight from the land in mine. In many instances, whole villages have <Col N="161" /> left and not one person remains in one house in some of these villages.  That is the case in many instances in my constituency and it is due to a number of reasons.  The holdings are uneconomic. Many of them are 50/-, £3, £4 and £5 valuation and any sensible person must realise that it is impossible for the father of a family to keep his wife and family in comfort on such a holding.</P>
    <P>We have also the problem of drainage.  Reference has been made in recent times to the drainage of the Moy and this is by far one of the most important drainage problems we have. I very much regret that it seems to be the Government's intention to delay this work for a long period.  It is a very serious matter for the people who live along the banks of the Moy, people whose holdings are already very small and uneconomic, that four or five acres of their arable land should be flooded, and, as is the case in many instances&mdash;in the Shraheen area, in the vicinity of Foxford&mdash;the whole holding flooded and everything lost&mdash;potatoes, oats, hay and so on&mdash;and, of course, live stock endangered as well.  It is a pity that that problem would not be tackled and tackled at an early date. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take it up with the Minister for Local Government.  If he could visit North Mayo at an early date and see for himself the conditions prevailing there, I am sure he would come back and impress on the Minister the importance of doing that work.</P>
    <P>There are also schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and it seems to me that the Government has cut down very drastically on that work. Consequently, we have, for the time being, widespread unemployment. There are people who were looking forward to getting their lands drained under that scheme and now the whole thing seems to be shelved.  A lot of the work intended to be done is not being done.  I would like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the importance of starting off again on those minor drainage works.  By that means thousands of acres of land that are now flooded would be made available. <Col N="162" /> It is a very beneficial scheme and it should be continued.</P>
    <P>I consider that the North Mayo area is ideal for afforestation.  A start was made there in recent times and the people were looking forward to the spread of that scheme of afforestation which held out such great prospects for the uneconomic holders.  The great advantage in regard to afforestation is that land which is otherwise unsuitable for tillage purposes can be utilised for forestry.  Not alone would the scheme give employment to the present generation but it would give employment to generations to follow. As I have said, much of the land of North Mayo is suitable for that purpose, particularly in the Erris and Achill areas, where the land is unsuitable for tillage.  I think that a big scheme of afforestation should be started in those areas because it is from those areas principally that you have migration.</P>
    <P>There are also schemes of turf development.  We have vast areas of turf in the Erris and Ballycroy areas. I mentioned these to the Parliamentary Secretary when he was down there.  He said he would consider those matters.  I believe that a turf-powered electric station in that area would absorb a lot of the turf.  There seems to be a never-ending supply of turf in areas of Erris, Achill, Ballycroy and many other places throughout North Mayo.  If the poor people in these areas have not the land on which to make a living these bogs should be developed.  I think there is no better way of developing them than by erecting a turf-powered electric station.  We know that all these things would cost money, but it seems to me&mdash;this scheme is intended for Gaeltacht areas and the areas to which I refer are truly Irish-speaking&mdash;that preferential treatment should be given to these areas and an opportunity given to the people to live at home and make use of the industries that are available to them if only the Government would consider sinking the money in these schemes.</P>
    <P>We have in the county machine-won turf schemes and we have also turf <Col N="163" /> produced by private methods.  Lots of people think that if turf was produced on a large scale by private methods and stored in a central store in our local towns early in the year it would bring good quality fuel within the reach of the people in towns like Ballina.  This would prevent overcharging by turf vendors when the weather becomes bad and when frost and snow are on the ground.</P>
    <P>We at no time have received any consideration in the matter of industries in any part of North Mayo.  It is true that we have got an alcohol factory but it is like the other alcohol factories&mdash;it is what you might describe as &ldquo;a white elephant.&rdquo;  It is not giving much employment and the product that is being turned out there is being criticised and condemned by everybody. In the very important town of Ballina you have no industries whatsoever except what were started by private enterprise.  It is true that these give a certain amount of employment but there is still in the neighbourhood of Ballina a lot of unemployment.  I would like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary, that, when he is considering the establishment of any industries, special consideration be given to Ballina which is in the heart of the migratory area.  There is also Belmullet. I think that area should also get consideration for an industry.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does not consider Belmullet he might consider Achill.  These areas, as I have already said, are migratory areas and if such industries of which I have spoken were started it would help to reduce the number of people who are emigrating.</P>
    <P>Our piers and harbours have been sadly neglected over a long number of years.  It is no lie to say that it was a foreign Government who established them in the first instance.  Under a native Government, these piers and harbours have been sadly neglected. It is really a shame that that should be the case.  There is quite a good harbour in Ballina and, while Westport is not in my constituency, there is quite a good harbour there and also at Newport. I can remember when very big cargoes went to and from these ports. <Col N="164" /> In Dublin you have congestion of traffic at the North Wall and one can hardly load or unload in the vicinity.  Yet you have lots of storage facilities at the places I have mentioned and the harbours are quite good.  It is a shame that all this traffic should be centralised in Dublin and no consideration whatsoever given to the harbours in Mayo.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the importance of developing those harbours and also the importance of developing our fishing industry.  It is a terrible thing to think that in an island country such as ours there are scores of towns and villages where you cannot buy a bit of fresh fish.  That was not the case some years ago.  I have often heard that in the town of Ballina, where the streets used to be lined with cart loads of different classes of fish, you can hardly get fresh fish for sale in any shop to-day. In the rural areas there is no fish at all available.  If that side of our industry was put on a proper basis, I believe it would absorb a very considerable number of our unemployed people.  The harvest that can be reaped from the sea is really very valuable.  It is a shame that you cannot procure even a little fresh fish in country areas despite the fact that we are surrounded by water.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of fishing gear.  Apart from the question of improving the harbours generally, there is no use in expecting fishermen to put out to sea in outdated types of boats and with unsuitable fishing gear.  The Parliamentary Secretary I think would be well advised to take some steps and drastic steps to remedy this whole situation.</P>
    <P>If we are to get anywhere with our fishing industry I believe that it would in fact be advisable to have a separate Department of Fisheries and a separate Minister to deal with nothing else except fisheries.  Until that is done and the thing is tackled in a serious way we will never bring that industry to the state it should enjoy in this country.</P>
    <P>There is the question of storing the fish.  You cannot land fish, place it along the side of the pier or quay and <Col N="165" /> leave it there.  There is the question of cold storage equipment and the proper storage of fish because, as anybody who is conversant with fishing will understand, there may be big hauls on some occasions and the surplus fish may be unsaleable.</P>

      <P>I should like to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that the people of my constituency are looking forward to big things.  They live in a very mountainous area on quite uneconomic holdings and quite a big percentage of the population is Irish-speaking. If we want to foster the language and are really sincere about fostering it there is no better way of doing it than keeping our people at home.  There is another important aspect of emigration; while most of our boys and girls who emigrate are a real credit to their native country, the danger is always present when they go to big cities and towns across the water that they may go wrong.  Thank God the vast majority of them have kept right, but certainly if the Parliamentary Secretary can bring about an improvement in these matters by providing industries and by considering the various points I have put forward he will have the prayers of many an Irish mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> I would thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the way in which he dealt with these matters when he visited us and for the way he listened to everybody's point of view, but unless we see some benefits accruing in the near future we will be inclined to think again that it was just a matter of somebody coming down to investigate with nothing as a result.  I sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the few points I have made and give them the greatest possible consideration.</P>

      <P>It was gratifying, I think, for us to hear Deputy O'Hara's speech to-day and to hear him expressing the view, and not only expressing the view but stating the fact, that the Parliamentary Secretary in his investigations in Mayo in connection with this scheme avoided all trace of Party political advancement or partisanship. That is the first fundamental fact that must be established if this money which is being voted by the Dáil is to be used to the best advantage.  We expect that the young man who has been given this important position will concentrate upon the vital questions with which he is called upon to deal and will not, as Deputy O'Hara said, use his position for the advancement of any political Party.  It is well to have the tribute paid to him by Deputy O'Hara as it shows that the Parliamentary Secretary is starting out on the right lines.</P>
      <P>It was also gratifying to hear the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;and I think it is right to emphasise that Deputy Mulcahy is the Leader of the chief Opposition Party in this House because I think that a general effort is being made to eclipse or submerge him.  At any rate in starting off this debate he took a reasonable and constructive line and wished the Parliamentary Secretary well in the efforts which he is making to co-ordinate the various schemes which are already in operation for the advancement of the undeveloped areas and to initiate new schemes to solve the problems of those areas.</P>

    <P>I would not have intervened at all in this debate but for the fact that after this debate opened on Thursday <Col N="167" /> morning I read the scare headings in a number of papers.  In one evening paper in the city the report of the debate on this important Estimate was headed &ldquo;Deputy Dillon discovers a dirty fraud.&rdquo;  There is a striking contrast between that scare heading in the <i>Evening Mail</i> and the speeches made by Deputy O'Hara to-day and by Deputy General Mulcahy last week.  Those two Deputies who have a sense of responsibility and fair play did not talk of the discovery of a dirty fraud; they spoke with hope of the future of these congested and distressed areas.  Not alone the Dublin <i>Evening Mail</i> but the <i>Evening Herald</i> also carried a large scare heading.  &ldquo;A racket&rdquo; was the heading to Deputy Dillon's contribution to this debate.  The <i>Independent</i> had a heading over Deputy Dillon's speech&mdash;A Political Racket.  The <i>Irish Times</i> had a heading&mdash;A Political Stunt.</P>
    <P>It is about time that fair-minded Deputies should cease to be as easygoing and as tolerant towards Deputy Dillon as we have been inclined to be in the past.  Do we not realise that this man is dragging the public life of this country down into the gutter?  Do we not realise that this man is making politics in this country seem so corrupt and so indecent that no young man or woman with a decent outlook will be inclined to enter public life or take a part in the public affairs of this country?  I think it is a terrible thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we find that most of the Deputies who contributed to this debate did so in a very constructive way.  There are very important problems to be solved in regard to the west.  The most important, of course, and the most obvious to the eyes of all people inside and outside this country is the export from the West of Ireland of the finest young men and young women in the world.  The first task of the Parliamentary Secretary should be to emphasise the value of those young people from an industrial and productive <Col N="169" /> point of view.  It should be brought home to industrialists, manufacturers and everybody who wants to establish a productive enterprise that in the areas to which the Estimate refers there is available the finest labour in the world.  If that fact were emphasised, there might be a tendency on the part of manufacturers to go away from the City of Dublin, to go out to the areas where this exceptionally fine type of young people are available and to establish industries there.  One of the first tasks of the Parliamentary Secretary should be to direct industry to the place where industry is required and where labour is in plentiful supply.</P>
      <P>I think I have mentioned to the House before that there is an urgent need for what I would describe as immediate productive effort.  There is urgent need to secure some immediate return from Government efforts to increase production.  In that connection, turf should have first priority. As other Deputies have pointed out, the peat supplies in the West of Ireland are of first-class quality.  For that reason, an effort should be made to develop them to the fullest extent. It would be desirable to ensure that the whole industry of turf production, from the moment the turf is cut until it is delivered to the consumer, should be organised on the most efficient lines. First, the bogs should be properly drained and made accessible.  When the turf is produced, whether by mechanical means or by hand, it should be stored where it is required under conditions which will prevent it from deteriorating.  It may be difficult but I think it should be possible to provide covered storage for turf, so that this Irish-produced fuel may be delivered to the consumer in the best possible condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somewhat similar considerations arise in connection with the fishing industry.  This island, situated in the Atlantic, should have the most up-to-date fishing industry in Western Europe.  We should not rely on small crafts in reaping the harvest of the ocean.  There should be put into operation sufficiently large and up-to-date boats that will be able to travel far out <Col N="170" /> into the ocean.  The whole system of marketing should be properly organised. I do not think there is any sense in trying to develop the fishing industry with small boats that are at the mercy of every gale.  That industry should have most serious consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the land, everything possible should be done to ensure that it is reclaimed, drained and improved and that maximum production is obtained.  One thing that has always struck me, in regard to western counties particularly, is the lack of shelter.  Wherever there is land which is not suitable for agricultural purposes but which will grow a shrub or a tree of any kind, even though it may not be first-class commercial timber, it should be planted.  No matter how small the area may be, it should be planted. Where possible, shelter belts should be planted for the protection of agriculture in those areas that are unprotected by timber of any kind.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the Parliamentary Secretary in his dealings with the Forestry Department will come up against this particular difficulty, that the Forestry Department do not wish to have anything to do with small areas of plantation.  They seek all the time to concentrate on large areas.  It is sometimes very difficult, as a matter of fact it is frequently very difficult, to secure the large plantable areas which the Forestry Department seek. For that reason, the Parliamentary Secretary should direct his attention to this question with a view to ensuring that wherever a small area, even if it be only an acre or two, can be obtained it will be planted by some means, whether under the auspices of the Forestry Department or by giving help to a local landowner or the local parish council or committee or cooperative society or anybody else so long as you get the timber planted.</P>
    <P>It is now necessary to consider this question of afforestation from angles other than the angle of providing first-class commercial timber for housing and other essential purposes.  Timber is now the raw material for the manufacture of many products.  We have at present in Athy an industry using up <Col N="171" /> vast quantities of scrub timber of all kinds for manufacture into wallboard or other products of that kind.  Looking at the question from this angle, there are various types of timber which will grow on marsh land and wet land which are not suitable for housing, furniture and purposes of that kind but which could be the raw material of an industry such as that in Athy. We have large areas of such land in the country.  Would it not be desirable to avail of these areas to plant trees producing soft timber, poplar, elder and trees of that kind, which would grow in a satisfactory way on that land and in that way not only make a contribution to the wealth of the particular area but also provide the raw material for valuable Irish industries in future?  That is only one small point, but I think it is important.</P>
    <P>I notice that in reply to a question to-day it was stated that £65,000 worth of toys was imported into this country during the past year.  In toy-making and similar industries there is room for the employment of many people in areas where heavier and larger industries could not be profitably established. It should be possible in the congested areas to establish industries which would provide perhaps a certain amount of spare-time work or even piece work for people living in small holdings which they could do in their homes.  On the continent of Europe many of the best industries are run in that way, industries which add to the wealth of these countries.  A certain amount of work is given to the people to do in their own homes which they can do in addition to the running of their small holdings and which adds to the prosperity of these families, the prosperity of the different districts and the prosperity of the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is a good thing that the Parliamentary Secretary is a young man and a good thing that he has set out, as Deputy O'Hara pointed out, in an unpolitical way to do the work entrusted to him.  Let him continue along those lines.  Let him not be deterred by the abuse hurled against him in the course of this <Col N="172" /> debate by Deputy Dillon.  Let him ignore that completely and go straight ahead, keeping before him all the time the questions: what can I do to add to the wealth of the areas entrusted to me; what can I do to add to the measure of employment available to the people in those areas; what can I do to make the people of those areas happier, more contented and more prosperous?  If he follows along these lines, he will ensure that the money we are voting will not be wasted but that it will return an immense dividend, not only to the areas concerned, but to the nation as a whole.</P>

Before a different forum, he accused the Tánaiste of being unwise.  On other occasions, he accused the Fianna Fáil Government of being autocratic and of having a lust for power.  At least, we now know that the Deputy has never made up his mind whether the Tánaiste is corrupt or merely unwise, whether the Fianna Fáil Government or Party are autocratic or servile.</P>

      <P>For too long the people of the West have been forgotten. Let them not now be used as the instrument of anybody's lust for power. However, I am happy to say that this debate represents a failure for Deputy Dillon because it did not continue on the level on which he started it.  I am grateful to Deputy O'Hara and the other Deputies who treated this debate as it ought to be treated and that is with some proper appreciation of the difficulties of the people in the congested areas and in the Gaeltacht, difficulties that they have laboured under so long and that some real effort is now being made to alleviate.</P>
      <P>We can assure Deputy O'Hara, I think, that the Parliamentary Secretary did not make a journey round the West and South and North of Ireland merely for the purpose of making a show.  I think it is obvious that the Government did not create his particular office merely for the purpose of making a show.  If that were so, the Undeveloped Areas Bill which will be debated here next week would hardly appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may possibly be able to help Deputy O'Hara, too, in connection with the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Bartley, that there is not any flight from the land.  Deputy O'Hara <Col N="174" /> joins issue on that.  I know of many areas where there has been a flight from the land in the sense that the people have left their holdings and their homes leaving their lands either untenanted or sublet.  I think Deputy Bartley was trying to make a distinction. I think he was trying to point out that there are people who do not want to leave the land and that there is not in the heart of the people in the West of Ireland generally a desire to leave.  That is perfectly true.  It is only when economic conditions force them to leave that they lock up and go to England or elsewhere.  But these people are not flying from the land because of a deliberate prejudice for living elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What we complain about is the enforced emigration of our people and the fact that they are compelled to leave the West of Ireland.  Surely that is the point Deputy Bartley was making. It is, indeed, true that vast areas and whole villages are standing pretty well untenanted at the present time.  I know that because the question as to whether one can or cannot sell land depends largely upon which side one's client lives on: if he lives on one side one can say to him: &ldquo;Go home again&rdquo;; but if he lives on the other side one can say: &ldquo;You may get a price for that.&rdquo; There are areas where whole villages have been left without a single person.</P>
    <P>The problems of the congested districts have been dealt with in previous Estimates.  One of the biggest problems of the people in these districts is the eradication of a certain inferiority complex with regard to Government institutions. It is a fact that history has left a certain inferiority complex in the people of the West of Ireland.  Possibly it all began with Cromwell when he offered them the choice of Hell or Connaught.</P>
    <P>There is still a certain inferiority complex towards authority and I am afraid the State institutions are not going the right way about curing that. It is difficult to explain to a gathering of farmers that the division of a particular holding or estate was justly and fairly carried out when it is as plain as a pikestaff that it was not.  I made <Col N="175" /> an appeal in this connection before.  I make it again now.  Is there any way in which one can bring home to the people the rules and principles which guide the Land Commission in the division of land?  Is it possible to demonstrate clearly to the people that these rules and regulations are carried out in practice?</P>
    <P>On one farm division will be carried out on the basis of valuation and proximity.  Why is the division not carried out on the same basis on a farm within two miles of the first farm?  It is difficult to convince people that these things are done out of regard for their interests or their well-being.  Is there any way in which the workings of the democratic institutions of our State can be brought home to the units of our democracy, that is our people?  Is there any way by which they can be made to shed this inferiority complex and become what we want them to be, politically mature?</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has often given out certain bogs and marked out certain boundaries but made no real efforts to drain them or to build roads. In the development of the turf areas a good deal still remains to be done.  I think undeveloped areas of bog should be taken and drained and properly divided with roads cut through them even if that work will take three or four years.  In that way it should be possible to have one specified tenant on each portion of bog.</P>
    <P>There are cases in which people have been forced to redeem the annuity on a piece of bog when a holding was being subdivided though that particular piece of bog had always been inaccessible.  It is hardly just or fair that that should be done and I might point out that these people never question the fact that the Land Commission made the advance in the first instance.  They merely question the advisability of their being given a piece of bog at which they can never get and their being given money on interest and asked to repay that money and interest when they have to part subsequently with this piece of notional property.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> If my suggestion were adopted, I believe the draining, development and subsequent utilisation of our bogs would be effected in a scientific manner and not in the haphazard way to which we have become accustomed.</P>
    <P>There is one practical suggestion which I should like to make to the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the rural improvement scheme.  I am not too certain of my figures, but I think that at present 95 per cent. is contributed by the State where the valuations are under £6, 90 per cent. where the valuations are between £6 and £7, and 85 per cent. where they are between £7 and £8.  There is then a category between £8 and £12 under which the State contributes 80 per cent. of the total cost.  I would suggest, even though it would involve greater expenditure by the State, that these categories should be dropped, and that, instead, the scheme should be divided into three categories, under one of which 95 per cent.  Would be contributed where the valuations on agricultural land, over the average of the six or seven holdings involved, would be £12 or under, 90 per cent. where such valuations were £20, and 85 per cent. where the valuation was £25 and over £20.  In this way, the contributions from the people, which so often are a stumbling block as between getting a necessary piece of work done and not getting it done, would be greatly reduced, particularly in my area where the valuations would almost certainly be under £6 in pretty well every case.</P>
    <P>I hope, while on that subject, that the Deputies who represent the Clann na Talmhan Party will possibly see their way to stopping this propaganda that Fianna Fáil are clamping down on the minor employment schemes.  It is not true that Fianna Fáil are clamping down on the minor employment schemes, and it is not true that they introduced, or prepared, the Estimate introduced this year which admittedly was reduced as compared with last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I thought it did.  I will conclude with another reference to the River Moy which I hope does arise.  In fact, I know that it does because the drainage of the River Moy is a daily topic of conversation among my constituents.  I find it very hard to believe that the drainage of this river cannot be done in stages.  It would take a number of engineers to convince me that you cannot drain it as far, possibly, as Ballina. It should be possible to start the work immediately to that point.  You could then bring in the machinery which I and my constituents appreciate must be brought in if you are to continue the drainage further up.</P>
      <P>I must confess that, when people inquire why the drainage of a particular river cannot be done, you have repeatedly to say &ldquo;well, that cannot be tackled until the Moy is done,&rdquo; while at the same time much of the work which is being done under the minor employment and rural improvement schemes is not really beneficial at all. The reason is that the water is going into the larger undrained rivers and is causing still greater floods instead of effecting the purpose for which such drainage is intended, namely, to relieve flooding.  I hope, however, that the Government will consider starting immediately the drainage of the River Moy to Ballina, or as far as ever it can be done, and, in the meantime, will obtain the machinery which will be necessary to complete the drainage which is so ardently desired by the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little or no doubt that the introduction of this Estimate was based on political reasons or was inspired by political motives. I think that the smallness of the Estimate for the establishment of the post contemplated is an indication of that in itself.  But, while that was undoubtedly the reason, the motive, for the establishment of this new post, I think it is a good thing that it has been done.  I think, too, that it is a very good thing that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lynch, should have been appointed to this post because he is a young man who, in many respects, has escaped the taint of the bitterness <Col N="178" /> of political life in the course of the last 30 years.  I am prepared to give these proposals an absolutely fair trial.</P>
      <P>I want, however, to point to certain difficulties which I think will meet the Parliamentary Secretary in the carrying out of the task which has been assigned to him.  As I understand his position, he has no direct powers himself, he has no Vote and he has not money.  He is a kind of fifth wheel without any direct power and with very ill-defined functions.  I fear that he will find himself hemmed in by administrative difficulties of all kinds. Probably one of the most difficult problems of Government is that which arises from internal departmental conflicts, not led by the political heads of Departments but led, very often, by the respective civil servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>And, sometimes, engineers&mdash;who all have achieved a certain degree of peace and quietude in their respective little niches in the Civil Service, and who merely have to wait for somebody else to be promoted or to die, so that they themselves may get promotion and eventually reach retirement.</P>
      <P>The whole system, the organisation, of our Civil Service does not, I think, lend itself to a tremendous degree of initiative or efficiency.  While I say that, I cannot say that I have any particular remedy to put forward in order to deal with that general difficulty. Inevitably, I think, you have to have a Civil Service.  You have to have a Civil Service which is more or less permanent, and it is very hard to instil the degree of competition and initiative that you would have in outside undertakings.  This is a defect from which civil services the world over suffer.  I do not think our Civil Service suffers from that defect to a much greater extent than the civil services in other countries.  Possibly it does because I think we are probably as a nation slightly more conservative than most nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will have all these difficulties in his way. <Col N="179" /> He will find that the Departments, instead of straining the leash to help, will strain the leash in order to point out difficulties and very often to create difficulties when they consider he is about to do something which may disturb the peace that reigns in the particular sections of the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>In addition to that difficulty, there is a certain amount of inter-departmental jealousy.  Departments are jealous of their own powers.  For instance, there is always a certain degree of jealousy between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture&mdash;it does not matter who the Minister is, that conflict is there the whole time.  A Department always resents any proposal which may result in a transfer of power from that particular Department to another Department. I merely mention these things so that the Parliamentary Secretary will have them in mind in dealing with the situation and will feel that there is a certain amount of understanding of the difficulties with which he has to contend.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary's post is to have any reality in the final analysis, he will have to be given very well-defined functions and <Col N="180" /> powers.  I asked a number of questions concerning his functions during the course of the last few weeks.  I must say I did not get any very clear answers in regard to them.  I gathered from the statements made by the Tánaiste in his replies that he had no direct access to the Government, that his proposals had to be submitted, in the first place, to an inter-departmental committee of civil servants.  An inter-departmental committee of civil servants can be one of the best means of killing a proposal. I understand that on that committee there are representatives from the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Local Government, Industry and Commerce and Lands.  Inevitably it will be found that any proposals that come forward will be opposed by one or more of these Departments and that many very plausible reasons will be put forward to prevent a proposal from being implemented or to delay or retard the implementation of a proposal.</P>
      <P>One other warning I would like to give to the Parliamentary Secretary, if I may, is to resist any action that might possibly be construed as political propaganda in the discharge of his functions.  I know there has been a good deal of criticism concerning his visits to the different parts of the country. I do not know whether the criticism was well-founded or not but in the discharge of functions of this kind it is essential that the Parliamentary Secretary should be in a position to command the support and co-operation of all Parties in the House and of all people throughout the country.  I think he will get that co-operation, provided he ensures that his actions are above suspicion in the discharge of his functions.  As we say in the law world, it is necessary that justice should not merely be fair but should appear to be fair as well.  I think that in the discharge of his functions it is essential that the Parliamentary Secretary should not merely act non-politically but that he should also appear to act non-politically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly, in replying, the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to tell us exactly how he proposes to implement any proposals he intends to make, how he can secure the necessary funds, <Col N="181" /> the necessary power, to put into operation any sound proposal which is decided upon by him.  In the first instance, it will be necessary that he should have direct access to the Cabinet so as to be able to put these proposals before the Cabinet and, having secured Cabinet sanction, have full authority to implement the proposals without having to refer back to any inter-departmental committee or without having to go to the Department of Finance in order to obtain their leave and sanction.</P>
    <P>There have been, over the course of the last 30 years, numerous efforts made by successive Governments to deal with the congested areas and with the Gaeltacht areas.  There have been Gaeltacht Commissions appointed.  I think at one stage there was a Parliamentary Secretary, if not a Minister without portfolio, appointed for this purpose in the early days of the first Fianna Fáil Government.  But little or nothing resulted from all these efforts.  It would be just too bad if this new effort was also to disappear into thin air after a short time, and I rely on the Parliamentary Secretary to be sufficiently energetic and strong in his approach to these problems to ensure that he will obtain some results from them.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the depopulation of the West, of the Gaeltacht areas, arises from economic reasons, largely due to a lack of investment in our own resources.  I do not propose to discuss this now.  As far as I understand, the new Bill which is being introduced will probably give us an opportunity of discussing certain aspects of this problem.</P>
    <P>Apart from lack of capital investment in the West, we also suffer from a lack of technical advice and the technical know-how.  Deputy S. Flanagan spoke of the inferiority complex from which he considers portion of our people suffer.  That is probably a slight overstatement of the difficulty.  We lack technical experience and a technical tradition; therefore, we do not feel very confident in ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are now in the position where it is possible to buy technical assistance and technical experience in the <Col N="182" /> same way as one buys a commodity. In that connection, I would like to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary the possibility of utilising the industrial survey which is being organised in conjunction with E.C.A. and also the possibility of securing technical assistance for given projects in the West.  This is a matter which I discussed on numerous occasions, both here and in America, with representatives of E.C.A.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, I think that the most lasting benefits which the Marshall Plan will have conferred on European countries will be the ones which result, not so much from financial assistance, as from technical assistance, which America, with her great fund of experience of technical development, is able to impart to less-developed countries.  I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary would have little or no difficulty in obtaining the services of technicians and experts for the creation of new industries in the West, either from America, or indirectly, with the help of E.C.A. funds, from other countries.  This is a matter which is well worth bearing in mind.  There are a number of technical assistance projects which were put forward to E.C.A. and which have been accepted in principle.  In my view, the Parliamentary Secretary would do well to examine them and to study to what extent some of these could be utilised in the discharge of his functions, with special reference to Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the vital importance of forestry as far as the whole of the western seaboard area is concerned. There are vast tracts of land in this portion of our country which can undoubtedly be utilised for forestry purposes.  There again, I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary will be met by opposition, even from the Forestry Division.  The opposition of this division will probably be caused by the belief, and possibly the well-founded belief, that better timber can be grown, and grown more rapidly, on good lands along the east coast than can be grown on the west coast.  That argument may be partially sound, but that is not an argument for the non-utilisation <Col N="183" /> of land which is available in large tracts right through the congested areas and which is suitable for forestry.</P>
    <P>We were told not so very long ago, some ten or 12 years ago, that it was impossible to grow timber west of the Shannon.  I think that that argument has now been proved to be incorrect and that it has been established that it is quite possible to grow good timber on the west side of the Shannon and even in some of the most exposed positions of Donegal.  In my view, the Parliamentary Secretary will need to be very firm in his dealings with the Forestry Division in order to ensure that a certain percentage of the annual planting programme will be devoted for social purposes to areas west of the Shannon, more or less on the lines indicated by the F.A.O. forestry expert who recently made a report on forestry in this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the House will remember that Mr. Cameron suggested in his report that the forestry programme should be divided into two different sections, one for the growing of economic, commercial timber and the other for, what he termed, social afforestation in order to provide employment as well as timber.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I would like to mention.  It may be a small detail but it is one which the Parliamentary Secretary should keep in mind.  It is the development which is taking place at the moment for the construction of turf-burning railway engines.  Some of the difficulties in regard to the utilisation of turf in many of the western seaboard areas is the distance of bogs from large centres and the location of the bogs.  If the development of these turf-burning engines is successful, and at the moment everything points to its being completely successful, it should be possible to utilise a lot of the bogs that are at the moment largely left derelict because of their location.  This is a matter which Córas Iompair Éireann might well undertake, and which would be of particular value in both Kerry and Donegal.  However, it would mean a certain amount of advance planning.  I <Col N="184" /> understand that final tests with the turf-burning engine are being carried out early in the New Year.  If these tests are successful, it will mean the construction of a number of locomotives designed to burn turf.  If these locomotives are to be put into service, it is already time to start planning as to the sources of the turf which they will burn.</P>
    <P>The drainage and preparation of the necessary bogs will occupy a considerable period of time and, accordingly, I think that any time in the New Year it would be well worth the Parliamentary Secretary's while to have consultations with the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann on the whole question of turf utilisation by the railways.</P>
    <P>As I said before, while I have no doubt that these proposals were originally conceived for a political purpose, I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that, as far as I am concerned, he will receive all my co-operation in the discharge of his duties, and I am glad that he was appointed to the post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to speak on this debate this evening, I believe that the Deputies on the opposite side of the House are convinced that I am rising to speak for the purpose of opposing the project which they have put in hands.  However, that is not so.  My attitude since I came into this House this evening has been what it always will be, to defend the name of Deputy Dillon when it is being dragged across the floor of the House while he is not here to defend it.  The reason for my attitude is simply this: when I was a very young lad, I knew that the name &ldquo;Dillon&rdquo; was a name which was dreaded, and not only dreaded but respected, in the British Houses of Parliament.  Surely to God, it should at least be respected in the Irish Parliament.  So much for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, may I assure the House that I welcome this scheme, irrespective of the motives behind it? I welcome it because of the objectives which it is intended to achieve.  I welcome it because it is at least something to show the people of the West that they can be awake to a bright future, a future which holds out something definite for them, that they need <Col N="185" /> no longer emigrate, that they have something now to live for, something which will enable them to rear their families in the cultural environment and under the influence of the customs and traditions which they inherited.  I welcome it also for another reason, a reason which applies not only to the West but to every single county in the whole Republic, namely, that this is one step to do away with the accursed &ldquo;dole&rdquo; and the system of unemployment which has played no small part in bringing about the situation which exists in the country to-day and which is one of the greatest problems facing us&mdash;less employment at greater cost. I can throw my mind back to the time when that system was introduced not so very many years ago, when men were paid to remain idle and inspectors paid to see that they remained idle, and, worse still, inspectors paid to go into the butchers' shops to see that the free meat which men would get to feed them whilst they were idle would be of the very best.  That is a state of affairs at which the scheme now before the House is hitting.  I am proud to be able to state in this House that even the labourers in Clare are disgusted with that condition of affairs at last.</P>
    <P>Clare is partly linked with this scheme and I feel proud to be able to say that workers in Clare at present will accept the dole only when the needs of their wives and families compel them to do so.  As a matter of fact, for some years past they have been leaving their homes and going to England to try to earn money to provide the home comforts for their wives and families which a native Government has time and again denied them. I realise that the Parliamentary Secretary in bringing this scheme into operation will have a big problem on his hands.  Every county, of course, will require different treatment if the scheme is to be carried out as it should be carried out.  I, as one of the representatives of Clare, would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to include not part of Clare, but the whole of the county, in the scheme.  My reason for making that request is that, as is well known in this House and throughout <Col N="186" /> the country, Clare has always been a cattle-raising county.  To use a common expression, it is a cog, and a very big cog, in the wheel of the agricultural industry in this country.  The land in Clare is divided into two different categories.</P>
    <P>In the northern portion of the county, we have good land, the best of land, but unfortunately it is growing into &ldquo;scrub&rdquo;.  The land in the western, southern and eastern portion of the county always has been, and always will be, until something is done to remedy the situation, inundated, due to intermittent flooding.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is to work this scheme to the fullest advantage, and to see that the land in Clare is brought to the greatest productivity as quickly as possible, he must ensure that drainage schemes in County Clare are pushed ahead.  Under the inter-Party régime, due to the activity of Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, we had a drainage scheme there, but I would say to-night that until the main streams in the county are cleared, there is absolutely no use in a farmer thinking of draining his land.  Until the main streams are cleared, there is no means of taking the water from the land.</P>
    <P>I have another reason also for asking that County Clare as a whole should be dealt with under this scheme.  In the eastern portion of Clare, in the neighbourhood of Killaloe, there was at one time a flourishing industry known as the Broadford slate quarry.  If that quarry were developed, the slates would be very helpful and very useful in the housing drive about which we hear so much at the present day.  These slates were of the highest quality.  Since I came to Dublin, I have seen slates that were quarried there 100 or 150 years ago on houses in Dublin and they are as sound to-day as the first day they were nailed to the rafters.  A number of other little industries might well be started under this scheme. When the scheme is put into operation, I intend, with the co-operation of other Deputies and Senators from Clare, to help the Minister in every way to make it a success.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> I would ask the House and the Parliamentary Secretary also to remember that this scheme is something which no side of the House can claim specially as theirs.  To my mind, every scheme taken up by a new Government is more or less inherited from the outgoing Government.  I should also like to remind the House that the money spent under the scheme is not our money.  It belongs to no one in this House; it is the taxpayers' money and, as such, it should be handled very cautiously.  We should make perfectly sure that it will be spent on something which will be remunerative and from which we shall derive profit, not alone to-day or to-morrow, but 20 years hence.  I would ask the Government to bear these considerations in mind and so far as I am concerned they will have my help at all times in their efforts to achieve the aims which they have set before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that this scheme is the greatest advance that has taken place in the history of this country.  It goes much further than the work envisaged by the old Congested Districts Board and I am confident that the Parliamentary Secretary will be successful in his work.</P>
      <P>Whilst I do not wish to refer to the industrial aspect of the question so far as the Gaeltacht and the congested districts are concerned, I should like to refer to two points that could be dealt with immediately by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>Great play has been made in regard to the matter of co-ordination and to the difficulty of obtaining assistance from other Departments and other Ministers.  From what I know of Deputy Lynch, I believe he has that personality and that tact which is necessary to handle the problem successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points which I wish to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  At the moment, we have a scheme of free meals for school children in the Gaeltacht.  As a result of some misunderstanding or some bad management, these schools are segregated and some school children who should come within that scheme are <Col N="188" /> excluded.  Certain boundaries have been drawn up and certain zones have been formed and the free school meals are not available to children outside these boundaries or zones.  I suggest that that is a matter that the Parliamentary Secretary should discuss immediately with the Minister for Education.  I cannot see why all schools in the Gaeltacht and in the congested districts should not qualify in respect of that scheme.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to deal with concerns Gaeltacht housing.  At the moment, the position is that in congested districts the county council can supplement the Government grant by giving a sum of £150 or upwards. That applies only to Local Government Department grants.  At the moment, the county council are debarred from making these grants available to people erecting houses under the Gaeltacht scheme.  The Kerry County Council have made representations in regard to this matter on several occasions.  They have asked the Government to introduce amending legislation whereby these grants can be made available. They desire that the county council should be empowered to give a grant to a man who is erecting a house in the Gaeltacht just as they are empowered to give a grant to a man who applies for a grant in respect of a house built under a public utility scheme, and so forth.  I suggest that that is another item in respect of which we can have complete co-ordination between the Parliamentary Secretary's Office and that of the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate several speakers have mentioned afforestation.  For the past three years we have been agitating for afforestation in certain rural districts. The stock answer which we have received is that there is not enough land available.  Recently 200 acres were available in one group and, simply because the Department suggest that the minimum acreage for any plot should be 300 acres, such afforestation scheme could not be considered there.  I submit that that policy must be changed if the Parliamentary Secretary's programme is to be put through for the benefit of the people <Col N="189" /> in the Gaeltacht and in the congested districts.  It has always been my argument that the standard policy for the whole country does not apply to the Gaeltacht and to the congested districts because, in these districts, the economic outlook is different and the local conditions are different.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has stated that the setting up of this Department is a political manoeuvre.  I disagree with him in that statement and I can prove that it is not true.  It is about 13 years now since I myself first proposed that a separate Ministry should be set up for the Gaeltacht and congested districts. I stated that until that was done and until these districts were treated as a separate entity, the congested districts and the Gaeltacht areas would never get what they were entitled to get.  During the years which followed, certain efforts were made to try and meet our wishes but nothing concrete was done.  This is a real effort.  The matter must be tackled in a very determined way, with the full co-operation of all Departments and all Ministers.  I should like this new post to which the Parliamentary Secretary has been appointed to be regarded as something tantamount to a ministerial post.  I believe it can be made so.</P>
    <P>Time and again, we have made comparisons between the Gaeltacht, the congested districts and the rest of the country.  Take, for instance, the matter of the ground limestone scheme, which is an ideal scheme for certain parts of the country.  How does that scheme work out for the smallholders in Ballinskelligs and Portmagee?  These smallholders live over 100 miles from Buttevant, where the bulk of the limestone comes from.  Just consider the cost of the transport of the limestone from Buttevant to where they live.  I have made the case that there is an alternative solution to the problem. If there is a scheme that will prove more suitable to the smallholders in these mountainous districts, it is the duty of the Parliamentary Secretary now to go to the Department of Agriculture and say: &ldquo;The ground limestone scheme is an ideal scheme up to a certain point but, from that on, it is uneconomic.  It is difficult to cater <Col N="190" /> for the people living on small mountainy slopes and, in these circumstances, would it not be advisable to provide them with an alternative scheme?&rdquo;  What about sea-sand which, in certain parts of our coast, contains a very high percentage of lime?  Surely that could be substituted in the congested districts and in the mountainous areas for ground limestone.  The Parliamentary Secretary should give serious consideration to that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the sea-sand being used in West Kerry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Only to a very limited extent.  I am just giving these as points where the Parliamentary Secretary could immediately adjust these schemes and make it possible for us right away to assist the Gaeltacht and the congested districts.  I am leaving over the question of industrial development, as the Bill itself will be introduced in a very short time.  I am making the case about the Gaeltacht district itself.  There is no inducement there in regard to the export of shell fish or some industry in connection with that product.  At one time in these Gaeltacht districts, there was an export trade but slowly and surely it was allowed to dwindle and now it has almost disappeared.  Take the periwinkles and mussels.  The Government of the day established a mussel plant in Cromane, County Kerry. There was an export trade to France for periwinkles and so on, but this shell fish trade has almost disappeared. From discussions I have had with the Parliamentary Secretary, I feel that this whole thing can be revived and a real effort can be made.  I know there is an outlet and there is a possibility that, no matter how small the industry, if these products were dealt with locally and boys and girls employed, this work could be started in the Gaeltacht districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big point I am making at the moment is that a number of schemes that otherwise would or should be available to us are not available.  The general policy is not acceptable to our people.  For instance, the Land Commission have a different policy in regard <Col N="191" /> to the division and sub-division of land in Meath, Kildare, Limerick, Tipperary and all the other counties, to that policy which they have in the Gaeltacht districts.  In the last Government's period of office, Deputy Blowick, who was Minister for Lands, increased the acreage from 25 to 35 acres in regard to an economic holding.  In the other areas it was a question of valuation. The Land Commission have no conception at all of conditions in County Kerry.  To the Land Commission, 40 acres mean nothing&mdash;but it is a substantial holding in the Gaeltacht.  They have refused in many cases to allow these people to sub-divide holdings and allow their children to settle down there.  That is an indirect way of forcing them out of the country.  It is an imperial policy so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  They have done very little for County Kerry, practically nothing. I will go into that another day and I will prove that in 27 years we in Kerry received only a fraction of what we should have got.  I have got the figures, but I will not go into them right now. There was well over £1,500,000 spent in Galway and Kerry in 27 years and we received approximately £250,000.  That is the total in estate improvements in these counties.  That is the 27 years' record and all Governments are to blame for it.  I am just quoting those figures now and I will go into it when that Estimate is available.  I know very well that what the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to do is the right thing.  It is very unfair to report it as a political business, as it is not political business.  Deputy Lynch went to Kerry, where he met everyone, including the T.D.s concerned and everybody else; and they were anxious to give their assistance irrespective of Party politics. He had a proper approach to the problem and I am confident, from the impression he made in our county, that he has done the same all over.  If there is one man to make a success of it, he will make it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Estimate coming before the House, though at the present time I cannot make myself optimistic enough to believe that this scheme will be the unrivalled success <Col N="192" /> it hopes to be.  As it is in the charge of Parliamentary Secretary Lynch, who is a willing and able man&mdash;a man free from the taint of political bias, I presume, not being very long in political life&mdash;I am sure he will give it all the thought and consideration he can and will put all the effort he possibly can into the administration of this scheme.</P>
      <P>He has visited various counties during his tour of the western seaboard but, unfortunately, we had not the pleasure of seeing him in Roscommon. However, I welcome the scheme so far as it includes my constituency.  I see there is much to be done in my constituency, just as in other areas, in the application of these schemes.  The first thing we must ask ourselves is: &ldquo;Is there a need for it; where does the need arise, and how does the need arise?&rdquo;  I think we are all convinced that there is a need.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary convinced himself during his tour that there is such a need.  We must ask ourselves what has given rise to the necessity, why does it arise in the Gaeltacht areas and not amongst others.  We can all answer that.  Can we all answer about the remedies, what remedies should be employed to eliminate or eradicate from the Gaeltacht areas the difficulties that exist there?</P>
      <P>We must examine the causes and then apply the preventive or bring the case to the curative stage if possible. One of the causes which brought about these things was, perhaps, a matter of technical advice to the people of the Gaeltacht.  I do not believe that they are suffering from anything like an inferiority complex.  I think that is a kind of slur on them and I wish to repudiate it.  In all airts and parts and spheres of life, the people of the Gaeltacht areas and west of the Shannon have acquitted themselves admirably. Perhaps they have been neglected over a number of years.  Their holdings were small and the attention they got from various Governments has been very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, even though I am not, as I said at the start, over-optimistic about the things which should be achieved under this measure, I hope and pray it will succeed and I wish the Parliamentary Secretary all <Col N="193" /> the luck in the world in putting the scheme into operation.  I can assure him that all the support I can give and can get from my constituency will be at his service and available to him at all times.  I welcome the scheme. What are we going to do with it?</P>
    <P>What is the intention of the Government? What difficulties or evils are we going to eradicate from the different areas?  First of all, I believe the intention is to stop emigration and, secondly, to increase employment and do away with unemployment in those areas.  If that is the case, if those are the ideals, I think we must examine the causes of emigration and the causes of unemployment in the western areas.  What are they?  I can summarise them in a few words.  Works of development of a certain nature have not been carried out sufficiently in western areas.  Drainage works, land rehabilitation, housing, rural electrification and the repair of certain roads have been sadly neglected.  To make a success of this scheme, we must start at the foundation, at rock-bottom, and pay attention to the things I have mentioned before embarking on this big £2,000,000 scheme.</P>
    <P>To make the people west of the Shannon contented and happy, to make life worth living for them, we must first provide for them certain essentials. We must provide employment and happy homes and give them a bit of good land which will be arable and produce good crops.  This proposed scheme is a scheme which will not bear fruit in a very short time.  It is a long-term scheme which will extend over many years before its good effects&mdash;if good effects come&mdash;are seen.  I am still pessimistic in that regard, but I shall be very happy if the Parliamentary Secretary can induce me to become an optimist and show me that he can do these things in a very short time.  I cannot see the scheme producing the good results I hope for&mdash;if I do not anticipate them&mdash;and which I presume the Parliamentary Secretary hopes for, for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I am more or less at sea with regard to the form which this scheme of industrialisation in western areas will <Col N="194" /> take, what the industries contemplated are and what we intend to do; but before embarking on this major scheme of industrialisation&mdash;I presume that is the object&mdash;we should try to remedy some of the other evils from which we in the western areas suffer. If we are to make the people happy and contented and induce even the one member of the family to remain on the small homestead, something must be done with regard to the repair and maintenance of cul-de-sac roads.  This may not have a direct bearing on the Vote, but there will have to be some co-ordination of the various schemes designed to alleviate distress there, and, unless something is done with these inpassable and impossible roads, you cannot make any other scheme a success.</P>
    <P>I further suggest that, although we have received increased grants under the rural improvements scheme&mdash;these increased grants came during the lifetime of the inter-Party Government&mdash; in these days, these grants require to be stepped up still further, because they are not at all sufficient.  Housing grants also are insufficient in these times and the amounts made available for reconstruction and for the erection of new houses should be considerably increased.  All these things will tend to make the people happy and contented and these facilities can be provided in a shorter time than is envisaged in relation to this great industrial programme.  By making a start there, we will be starting on a good foundation and providing something which will encourage the people to stay at home.</P>
    <P>I want to see no curtailment of money, so far as drainage is concerned. The Local Authorities (Works) Act had a rather hectic passage through this House, being voted against on eight different occasions by Fianna Fáil.</P>

That Act was voted against by the Fianna <Col N="195" /> Fáil Party on eight different occasions, but I want that Act extended and expanded and in no circumstances do I want to see the money to be made available being curtailed.  For the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, I may say that, in the first year of the operation of that Act, a grant of £50,000 was given to County Roscommon; in the second year, the amount given to County Roscommon was £51,000; but this year our grant is down to £33,000.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can tell me that the present Government have improved the Local Authorities (Works) Act in face of those figures, I shall be delighted.</P>

      <P>The sum of £1,500,000 was voted last year for the implementation of that Act.  Perhaps it would have been just as well if the Parliamentary Secretary had not mentioned that point.  I do not desire to raise controversial matters in dealing with this Vote, because I feel that these schemes which the Parliamentary Secretary envisages will get the unanimous support of every member. I do not think there will be any opposition from any side or any Party.  For my part, I said when opening my remarks that I would give him all the co-operation and help I could in carrying out his proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told that someone during the debate made reference to Roscommon and said that it should not have been included within the scope of the proposals, that it is a big ranchers' county and should perhaps not have been included.  I say it should, and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on having included it, because there is in North, West and East Roscommon acute congestion, people living on farms of £2, £3 and £5 valuation.  Further, I have never seen the unemployment situation in that county worse.  During the week-end, I had deputations from no less than <Col N="196" /> four or five different areas of people seeking work.  The employment situation is bad in parts of County Roscommon. That is no exaggeration and, that being the case, there is need in that county for something in the nature of development work, so as to provide employment.</P>
    <P>There is also a good deal of emigration from Roscommon.  From the north, west and east of the county, there are people going every day to England and the exodus in the past couple of months has been really alarming.  I am not seeking to gain any political advantage from saying these things and I do not think that anybody can call me a very bigoted politician.  I am here to do the best I can for the country, irrespective of Party or politics, and I believe that, on the opposite side, there are members who do not wish to gain political kudos out of these problems.  They are honest men who wish to see every man prosperous, as I wish to see every man prosperous, irrespective of his politics or his position.  There is, however, unemployment in Roscommon at present and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should pay special attention to those areas in that county which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to our favourable position with regard to raw materials in the County Roscommon.  We have one of the best raw materials we could have in the north of the county&mdash;the Arigna coal mines.  Up to the present, these mines have not been utilised to the fullest.  Tradition has it that there is an abundance of iron and other minerals in that area.  For that reason, I would have liked had the Parliamentary Secretary come down to Roscommon during his visit to those other areas.  He could have gone down to see those mines and discussed the possibilities of having them fully developed as well as exploring the possibility of securing more minerals in that area.  It would be a visit that would have been well worth while.</P>
    <P>If this scheme produces the results which it is hoped it will produce&mdash;and I am pessimistic about that at the present time&mdash;I shall be one of the happiest Deputies in this House.  My desire&mdash;and as far as I know it is the <Col N="197" /> earnest desire of the other Parties in this House&mdash;is to wish the Parliamentary Secretary all the luck in the world in regard to the big scheme he has undertaken. I believe he will have the co-operation of every sensible Deputy and of every Party in this House.  I wish him the best of luck in his venture.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few suggestions as to what, in my opinion, should be done.  They are suggestions which I made in regard to those congested areas away back in 1940 and 1941.  That is a long time ago.  One of the suggestions was in connection with the growing of small seeds.  I suggested at that time that the growing of those seeds should be completely confined to holdings around the £10 valuation.  I think it is ridiculous to see the whole of the seed for the beet industry grown in a portion of Limerick.  The return from growing an acre of beet seed would be from £100 to £150.  That would be essentially an industry for a small holding.  The same thing applies in regard to mangold seed, turnip seed, Swede seed, onion and parsnip seeds.  There is a very big return for all these and they entail a good deal of intensive labour.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be very well advised if he were to include those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main complaint is in connection with areas like Ballymacoda, Knockadoon, <Col N="198" /> Ballycotton, Goilin, Whitegate and Kilworth.  In my opinion these are congested areas.  You have a condition of affairs prevailing around that sea coast which is unfair and unjust.  It was only last Friday, on my return from the Dáil, that we were presented with a bill for something in the region of £1,500 to £2,000 in respect of a pier about which I have been appealing in this House for the past five or six years.  The pier is now gone.  It was taken away by the tide.  In that area you have a condition of affairs in which the unfortunate people engaged in the fishing industry have had to cease purchasing any more boats because there was no protection for them in Ballycotton.  There is no protection there at all, not even for the lifeboat. Appeals have been made for the past three and a half years, but the ex-Minister for Agriculture turned a deaf ear to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also suggest the extension of the tomato industry there. In my constituency, people who started the tomato industry were able to employ from 80 to 120 men.  If that can be done in one district, which you might call a pretty rich area, I cannot see why that particular industry could not be extended enormously to the poorer areas of the county and thus give employment.  It is rather strange that all those industries in which there is intensive employment, having regard to the area of land concerned, are shoved out to the individual with from 200 to 250 acres of land and that you have no initiative or drive in the 20 to 25 acre holdings for that kind of work.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, I can see no reason why a proposal of the kind introduced should not provide for areas other than those mentioned.</P>
      <P>That is my main objection.  You have the Gaeltacht area of Ballymacoda and Knockadoon, where the average poor law valuation of the holdings is £8.  Why is that area to get no benefit under these proposals? You have the whole line of country along the seaside, stretching from Knockadoon on the one hand to Whitegate on the other.  I welcome the Bill but I am making suggestions that, in my opinion, will help to make it a success.  I must insist that proposals of this description will embrace areas in my constituency which are congested and which deserve as much as any other portion of the country.  You have the position with regard to fishing in the Ballymacoda-Knockadoon area.  Endeavours were made to start small industries in the Gaeltacht there from time to time but now, apparently, the whole of that stretch of sea coast is to be left on one side.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider those areas and see that they will get at least a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>We have had Deputy Beirne on the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It is not the first occasion in this House that an endeavour was made to state that the Fianna Fáil Party opposed that Act, which is untrue.  Endeavours were made here to make the Bill at least workable.</P>

      <P>To hear new Deputies praising this Estimate does not surprise me in the least because they probably think that something will be done.  My opinion is that nothing will be done.  My opinion is that this is a certain amount of eyewash, again to shunt something over on the people of the West of Ireland and the Gaeltacht as other Acts attempted to do when Fianna Fáil was in power on previous occasions.  You generally expect the Taoiseach to speak as head of the Government for the Government and to state exactly what the policy is. Speaking in the Dáil on November 21st on the Supplies and Services Act the Taoiseach mentioned the land rehabilitation project.  In Volume 127 column 1102 he is reported as making the following statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You have the land rehabilitation project and so on.  My view is that if money were put into agricultural development, at the present time, it should at first be put into those lines which can give you almost immediate results&mdash;that is, to get lands that are short of fertilisers, lands that have not been brought up to their full productivity, and bring them as quickly as you can into full production.  The first care then should be the lands which are capable of giving an immediate response to the efforts put into them.  You will find, in the main, that these are the good lands.  The next step would be to get the marginal lands, lands that are not so good.  If these are properly utilised, they will give you a fairly immediate return.  Let us next put any capital we have to spare into the less or worser lands so to speak.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can estimate something that is going to improve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A week after that statement the Parliamentary Secretary comes into the House with this Estimate. He intends to develop certain lands, I presume.  I wonder where he will get this good land in the West.  The Parliamentary Secretary has travelled the area, I understand, but I did not see him in North Galway.  He went into the Gaeltacht areas fact-finding, as they call it.  A few facts were found, I am quite sure.  I believe that something which happened recently was responsible for this fact-finding, that is the fact that in Galway Fianna Fáil had lost two seats, in Mayo they lost a seat, in Roscommon they lost a seat, and in Sligo-Leitrim you may say that they lost another.</P>

      <P>For three years and three months I happened to hold office in Government. What did I find?  The Arterial Drainage Act which had been passed in 1945 and which was acclaimed as a great Act, which it certainly was, was just one of the plans which were presented to the people and then left aside until I came along.  I had to implement that Act of 1945 in the year 1948.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands, Mr. Derrig, said that the land rehabilitation project was only a big man's scheme, that most of the money was spent on the big farms, for farmers with hundreds of acres.  I do not agree with him at all.  The small man had the same chance under that scheme if he wished to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that there should not be any delay about passing this Estimate, that it should be allowed to go through the House without a word of objection or criticism.  When I was in office, I had the interest of the West of Ireland at heart as much as any Deputy.  I remember trying to do something in this House to help the poorer sections who had not a road into their villages or houses.  I was trying to make a change in the rural improvements scheme.  Under that scheme as operated by the Fianna Fáil Government the people had to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost.  I tried to introduce an amendment to that scheme whereby a smaller contribution would be accepted from people with low valuations.  The people who are now so worried about the West and the Gaeltacht areas are the very people who went into the Lobby and voted against me when I was trying to do my best to help those people.  I think the present Parliamentary Secretary was one of those who went into the Lobby against me.  Deputy Beegan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, also went into the Lobby against it.  To-day they are swallowing that very scheme and are <Col N="204" /> carrying it out.  We hear a great deal of ballyhoo from some of these people at the present time about the Gaeltacht and the West of Ireland.  As far as I am concerned, I know that in any attempt I made to try to be helpful in the way I have referred to, I got very little assistance from the Fianna Fáil Party in this House.</P>
    <P>It is a sad thing that there are still parts of the West of Ireland where people find it difficult to get into their houses and have not got roads into their bogs.  If a few hundred thousand pounds were spent in that direction it would be of more value to the people of the West than the class of thing that is being talked of at the present time.</P>
    <P>I happened to be in Galway City last night.  I understand that at the county council meeting on Saturday there was a discussion as to when factories would be set up in certain places, and it was suggested that the people of Galway City would be smothered with the smoke, that it would be Birmingham the second, so to speak.  When the Taoiseach was speaking in Galway he referred to the conditions under which Irish people live in Birmingham and other such places.  I do hope that the people are right in their estimate of the smoke from the factories, but I am afraid they will be disappointed.</P>
    <P>I regret that when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Bartley, a man for whom I have a certain amount of respect, was speaking here on last Thursday, he was, for the first time in my experience, very bitter.</P>

I believe that Deputy Dillon made an honest attempt to do something. It was not mere talk.  Some work was carried out there.  When the Bill is passed, I hope some work will be carried out, that at least some attempt will be made to improve the congested areas.</P>
      <P>So far as the land of the Gaeltacht area is concerned, there is not much to be hoped from it.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Bartley, when he said that something should be done in the industrial line for the Gaeltacht.  As far as West Galway is concerned, at any rate, it is the only hope.  If something cannot be done in the line of industry of some description there is not much hope as far as the land is concerned.  Very little land there is of any use.  Nothing can ever be done with quite a lot of it which would put it into a condition that people can live on it.  I hope that this scheme will be a success, that it will not, like the Arterial Drainage Act, be left until some people come along to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great confidence in the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch.  I know that he means well.  When he gets the Bill through I hope that the Civil Service will not hold him hard and fast.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary, I found when I had the best intentions in the world about doing something, that some rules or regulations held me up.  I was tied up with a certain amount of red tape.  I was honest enough to refer to it in the Dáil.  If the Parliamentary Secretary finds himself tied up by any of this red tape <Col N="206" /> which prevents him from carrying out what he intends to do, I hope he will come to this House and try to get that red tape removed.  Above all, I ask him to see that the work will be started soon.  The people are losing faith as they hear such a lot of talk and very seldom see any work started. I hope that this is not one of the plans which will be shelved and left aside; that we will not be told later on that it was one of the plans for which they were responsible.  We are sick and tired of all this planning that is going on.  There will be no opposition to this scheme by the group to which I belong.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to get on with the work as quickly as he possibly can.  Any assistance I can give him he certainly will get.</P>

      <P>Is iomaí iarracht a rinneadh ó cuireadh Rialtas ar bun in Éirinn le cabhair a thabhairt ar an nGaeltacht agus ar cheantracha iarthair na hÉireann.  Tháinig buntáistí as cuid de na hiarrachtaí sin, ach sílim gur gá iarracht mhór eile, agus sé mó thuairim go mbeidh rath ar an iarracht atá a dhéanamh anois, má leantar go dian léithí.  Tá fear óg i gcionn na Roinne anois, Mac Ui Loingsigh, agus tá na cáilíochta aige atá fóirstineach don phost.  Tá Gaeilge aige agus guím rath ar a chuid oibre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During a number of years many projects were envisaged and some carried out in order to aid the Gaeltacht areas and the western areas generally. Some of these were successful in part, some not successful.  On the whole, the feeling is that over the last 30 years the success which has been achieved is not anything like what is desired. There have been and possibly will be problems to be solved in the western counties.  The method envisaged for tackling them is the proper method.  In the last three years stress was laid on the development of the land.  I know a great deal about the land in a number of western counties.  It cannot be made to maintain a small farmer and his family.  No matter what money is spent on it, it will not give full-time employment all the year round to a man and his family.  The average period of employment given to a farmer on one <Col N="207" /> of these small farms is about three months per year.  For the other nine months he is compelled to migrate, to work on the roads, to engage in fishing or to draw the dole.  By improving that man's farm you may give him work for four months of the year, but no amount of money spent on that land will improve it to such an extent that he can obtain full and profitable employment for himself and his family.</P>
    <P>We are then faced with the fact that we must provide work that will give continuous and profitable employment, not work for the sake of giving some earnings to the people, like some minor relief schemes.  They provide employment for a time but give no profitable return.  Therefore, to put this matter on a proper footing you must provide continuous work which will give a return for the money spent.  Industries must be set up in the Gaeltacht, in the congested districts and in the West generally, as they alone will provide that type of work.  It is lack of continuous employment that causes emigration. It is only by having industries that continuous employment will be given.  Therefore, factories must be established and grants must be given for their establishment.</P>
    <P>The West, of course, has certain natural resources which can be profitably developed.  One of these resources has been very much neglected hitherto. I hope that under the Bill which is to be introduced, and for which this Estimate is intended, the sea will be harnessed to produce the great wealth it is capable of producing.  Other nations are cashing in on our sea wealth.  I think it is very important that that free, natural source of wealth should be tapped to the limit.</P>
    <P>Along our western seaboard and in our western counties there is bad land but in the main it is land suitable for afforestation.  An all-out effort should be made to turn these wastes into forest land.  That will not give an immediate return in production but it will give an immediate return in employment.  Ultimately, when the full return comes, it will be a very profitable one on any money that is spent now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> Apart from the development of industries, the provision of employment and a reduction in emigration we should bear in mind also the question of cultural development.  It would be wrong for us to develop the West fully from an industrial point of view and forget the cultural angle.  Last week one of the Deputies on the Opposition Benches mentioned the question of parish halls.  I think it was Deputy Palmer.  It is important that there should be parish halls, be they erected by the G.A.A., the F.C.A., the Young Farmers' Clubs or some such body, or by the parish itself.  In relation to such halls, I find that in the heart of the Gaeltacht the craze at the present time is for English and foreign dances.  Not alone should these halls be used for dancing, but they should also be used for the production of plays, irrespective of whether they be Irish plays or English plays, for card-playing and other games which will afford the young people facilities for spending their leisure.  Technical classes should be held in these halls and cultural development should go hand in hand with industrial development.</P>
    <P>There are points I would like to mention, but I shall have an opportunity of making them when the Bill is under discussion.  Last, but not least, is the question of the Irish language.  I do not propose to deal with it now.  A suggestion has been made by the Opposition that this development is purely political.  We have been told that because two seats were lost in Galway, one in Mayo, one in Roscommon, and so on, this body has been set up.  That is not so.  It is a pity that people should impute ulterior motives to the Government in connection with this scheme.  I was very forcibly struck by two points when reading the report of the Land Commission and the report on the land project.  I have not studied them very minutely, but I looked down the column showing the amounts of grants made in the majority of the counties where the land project is in operation; they were a matter of hundreds.  I saw in that column a number of figures running into thousands.  On looking across the column I saw that those <Col N="209" /> thousands related to Mayo, Galway and Roscommon.  The same thing applied in the division of holdings under the Land Commission.  These are the people then, who, because this scheme is a good one and will give good results if properly carried out, impute ulterior motives to our project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMannion" hpid="Mr. Mannion Mr. Mannion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mannion</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in welcoming this scheme but, taking a broad view of it, I think a good many people will be disappointed.  If one takes all the problems requiring solution from Kerry to Donegal, the amount of money to be spent under this scheme appears very small indeed. I am principally concerned with Connemara. I believe that if all the work that should be done in Connemara was done it would take at least half the amount of money sought under this Estimate.</P>
      <P>We have a very old grievance.  I intend to make only a passing reference to it.  Deputy Beirne referred to the cul-de-sac roads.  Those roads must be a nightmare to every Deputy from the West.  Since I came to Dublin I have at least three or four letters waiting for me every day asking if I can get something done about this road, that road and some other road.</P>
      <P>I know that in the past a lot of this work was left over until an election was coming off.  Then, of course, whatever Government was in power would put a few thousand pounds into the work for election purposes.  I can assure whatever Government is in power that that is a dead horse, as far as getting votes in the future is concerned, because the people have become too wise to it.  Secondly, we have a housing problem.  Again, I am only concerned with my own area.  I would like the Minister concerned to take this advice&mdash;he may not have the chance of taking it again&mdash;that he should make the Gaeltacht grant available for everybody in the Gaeltacht areas and allow them the benefit of Section 7 of the Housing (Amendment) Act.  If he does that, it will go a long way towards solving the housing problem in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies on this side of the House, I am a little suspicious about this Estimate.  Nevertheless, I <Col N="210" /> think it should have been introduced long ago.  If, however, it is intended to offset the effect of the land rehabilitation scheme, then it is doomed to failure.  Whatever effects or whatever fruits flow from this Estimate, must flow side by side with the Dillon plan, because I am convinced that the Dillon scheme was the first major contribution ever made to raise the standard of living of the people in Connemara.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputy O'Hara speak about the Parliamentary Secretary's visit to his area.  I have heard Deputy Cogan praise the Parliamentary Secretary for the way he visited and had conversations with everybody, but when the Parliamentary Secretary came to my area he had a Comhairle Ceanntair meeting in it.</P>

      <P>I will get away from that.  Under the Bill which is to come before the House, we in Connemara expect&mdash;I have already referred to roads and houses&mdash;to have some factories erected there.  We have an abundance of raw material in Connemara. We have peat, we have Connemara marble, and we have fine and coarse wool, but we cannot have factories without finance.  Under the terms of this scheme we expect to get the finance and the power we require. You cannot have industries without power.  Last week I asked the Minister responsible when the Electricity Supply Board would be giving a supply of electricity to my town. I was told that it had been shelved until next summer, and that the matter would be considered then.  There are few areas which can boast of the same amount of raw materials as we have.  I would respectfully suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if he is interested in Clifden, he should go down there and meet the people of the district, and also the Clifden Town Improvements Committee.  They would probably put schemes before him.  If he is coming again let him come as a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Secretary on a fact-finding tour for the purpose of meeting everybody in my area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that Deputy Mannion has missed the real purpose behind the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary to his present responsible position, and particularly the purpose of the Vote that is before the House at the moment and of the Bill which is scheduled to come up for discussion in an hour's time.  I look on this whole development as entirely desirable.  I think it is the feeling of every person who has been concerned with our seaboard areas, particularly with the western seaboard areas, that some such co-ordination of effort should have taken place quite a long time ago.  I look on all this as a genuine desire to make money and machinery available for the purpose of increasing the standard of life of the people in Connemara and along the western sea coast generally.  While such matters of roads, mentioned by Deputy Mannion, will undoubtedly arise, they are really minor matters in comparison to the tremendous work that can be done by the Parliamentary Secretary if he has the full support of this House behind him.  I feel, when a measure of this kind comes before the House, that it is much better that it should be discussed on its merits rather than that it should be criticised from a purely political point of view.  I am glad that very few Deputies are following the line set in this debate by Deputy Dillon, who, at least as far as I am concerned, was most disappointing and who lowered himself to what I might term the Deputy Oliver Flanagan standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are quite right. Deputy Dillon's criticism had nothing to do with it.  The allegation of corruption is, I feel, most undesirable.  I am perfectly certain that when this machinery is put into operation there will be no person more keen, and rightly so, than Deputy Mannion, and the other Deputies representing those <Col N="214" /> areas, in getting from this new authority everything that they possibly can for the people they represent.  The sum of £2,000,000 is not a very substantial sum, but it is only the beginning. It is the initial sum to be spent on a process of development that is going to do for the Gaeltacht areas what undoubtedly should have been done for them during the past 25 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>I think we should approach this scheme on the basis of its being a sound idea, that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government will have unanimous support in putting it into operation and that, if they fall down or fail on the job, they will be criticised from every side of the House. This is pioneering work of the greatest importance.  It must be carried through with pioneering zeal and with enthusiasm. I, for one, am certainly satisfied that, as far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, he will carry this scheme through, so far as lies within his power, with zeal and with enthusiasm.  The more support he can have from all sides of the House the better it will be for him in overcoming the many obstacles that are placed in the way of a new Department such as this which will have to handle many problems of tremendous magnitude in the interests of the people.  I have some personal connection with Connemara.  I spend as much time as possible down there.</P>

      <P>Carraroe, and I have a love for the people of that area. I certainly welcome any measure which is brought forward in this House to improve the standard of living of people who are undoubtedly some of the finest in the country.  The people of Connemara are not afraid of the hardest of hard work.  They toil for existence against every conceivable danger.  They are keen, independent people who see in this new idea the things for which they have been crying out for many years.  I think we would gravely disappoint those people if we were to wreck or endanger this new idea just because of political differences. Deputy J. Lynch, as Parliamentary Secretary, has the responsibility <Col N="215" /> of initiating this scheme.  If he does this work, and I believe he will, his name will be remembered for all time in the areas scheduled for development. I, and I am sure every other Deputy in the House, would like, in the years to come, to be associated with him in the success of this particular scheme.  If I can make an appeal to Deputies, it is this: Give all the support and the help that can be given to the Parliamentary Secretary because to him has been given a most onerous and a most responsible task.</P>
      <P>It is a task which any Deputy should be proud to be asked to carry out, a task which will provide well-paid employment for the people living in the particular areas referred to in the Bill, one which will help to increase their standard of livelihood, one which will reduce the necessity for emigration and one which will leave families in those areas together for a much longer period than it has been possible to leave them together during the past century or so.  It is a tremendous task and one that should meet with the full support and enthusiasm of every Deputy, irrespective of his political affiliation or line-up in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cawley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to detain this House very long.  I welcome the Bill for the reasons that were stated by other members of the House, including the last speaker, Deputy Cowan, because it is for the better development of the homes of the people of the country.  There has been a lot of talk here about industrial development.  You must take industrial development side by side with agriculture.  I come from a congested area, the area of the congest farmer who is a mixed farmer, and in order to help him the type of industry which should be established in this country is an industry that would be a help to agriculture and also an industry that the farmer would be able to help.  I do not believe that the amount of money that is being spent on this scheme would be adequate or sufficient for these areas because if you develop industry in the West as it was enjoyed in the past under an alien Government there is one industry which should be <Col N="216" /> established there and that is a distilling industry that Galway once enjoyed and enjoyed side by side with the coast of the South Galway constituency to Kinvara, the best barley-growing district in Ireland.  If you had an industry of that type it would be a benefit to the farmers in that area and it would win back for them what they enjoyed once&mdash;tons of prosperity even under alien government.</P>
      <P>Another thing which was referred to by Deputy S. Flanagan across the floor of the House which, in my opinion, it is important to discuss, is the question of drainage.  You cannot have success on your land if it is waterlogged and in the West we suffer more to-day from waterlogged land than ever before.  To start with, some of this money will have to be devoted to the drainage of the land of the West.  In my own locality, after heavy rains, it is nothing to see a rising flood of 12 feet.  Anybody in the House might say: &ldquo;How is it that did not occur 20 years ago?&rdquo; My answer to that is this.  The scheme for the drainage of the West of Ireland started at the source and not at the outlet.  Just beyond my own place there is a big commonage of about 800 acres of land and there is a river bed in that. When the water comes down that commonage becomes flooded.  That creates a backwater and it floods thousands of acres of land all over my constituency.  This is one of the things that should be dealt with under this project and it should be started at the shore because the Dunkellin is a very important river which runs into the sea at Galway.  It drains the land from Kilcolgan, the outlet and, as Deputy Beegan can assure the House, over to his own district.  It drains the bogs in Karneykelly; the bogs there last year had a very good job done on them.  It will be all wasted if you are going to develop one area and destroy another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister concerned that when these things come before him he will consider drainage. It is my view that it is the first consideration for the development of the soil.  There are other schemes for the development of the soil&mdash;soil-testing schemes, fertilising schemes, and all the rest&mdash;but they are useless if the <Col N="217" /> land is not drained.  If this question comes before the House at any other time I will always pursue the course that drainage in this country could be better accomplished if started at the outlet.  I will give every co-operation in the development of that scheme provided it is for the benefit of the people.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the Parliamentary Secretary very long.  I would state that when the Bill was introduced last week the Leader of the Opposition, General Mulcahy, welcomed it on behalf of the Opposition.  Before it had gone very far&mdash;and the Government Benches are not free from blame&mdash;the discussion became acrimonious.  We looked to the Minister for Lands, as head of the Department closely concerned with this, to give a lead to the ensuing discussion.  Instead of that we had an hysterical outburst which certainly did not augur very well for the following stages of this measure.</P>

    <P>I believe that the natural reaction in the country to the introduction of this measure is that it is something that is long overdue, but we may be forgiven for associating its introduction now with the political reversal suffered by the Fianna Fáil Party in the areas which it is intended to cover under the scheme.  I was amazed a few minutes ago to hear Deputy Cunningham make such a case for what has been achieved by the land project in parts of the West.  Naturally, it ran into four figure expenses in these counties because it is there that you have so much self-employed labour.  It is there that the scheme is particularly desirable and it is there that the most benefits can accrue to the people as a result of the carrying out of the land project.  Consequently, the people availed of it; the labour was there to be put to work on it.  It was only a few months back that it came into operation even in County Dublin. Therefore, why should any wrong inference be taken from the fact that so much more money was spent in these western counties?  I hope that in the implementation of this scheme continued attention will be given to cattle diseases and the drainage of the land because I know that where you <Col N="218" /> have stagnant water you have the breeding-grounds for all the ills, such as fluke and hook, that affect the cattle industry.</P>
    <P>An oft-repeated untruth was resurrected in the course of the early stages of the discussion by one Parliamentary Secretary when he stated something which has been refuted time and again, and that is, that the inter-Party Government were responsible for the stoppage of the hand-won turf industry. That is not so.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Sweetman: If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to start a row, he can take that line.  It is there on record that it was the Minister for Local Government, then Deputy MacEntee, who stopped the hand-won turf scheme.</P>
      <P>Mr. Bartley: As Deputy Sweetman has intervened, will he answer one question?  Were the staff, who were to carry on this hand-won scheme in Connemara, appointed by the Fianna Fáil Government before they went out in 1948, and were they dismissed three weeks after the Coalition Government came in?</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: I do not know how Comhairle Ceanntair carries on its business, but the circular was sent out by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
      <P>Mr. Bartley: Let the Deputy go down and stand outside any church in Connemara and state that it was Fianna Fáil who stopped the hand-won turf industry and he will see what will happen.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Tá mé buioch des na Teachtaí a chuir fáilte roimh an meastachan seo.  Os rud é gur labhair mé as Gaoluinn ar dtus, agus go bhfachtas dom nár thuig a lán Teachtaí an méid a bhí raite agam, sílim go mba fhearr dom labhairt as Bearla anois.  The debate on this Estimate has inevitably wandered over a very wide field and, in the circumstances, I cannot blame Deputies to any degree for references, that were irrelevant, to the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  That Bill will be before the House at 8 o'clock; therefore I shall not detain the House by making any further references to it at this stage. The debate varied from the good, sound and welcome advice offered by some Deputies to the tirade undertaken by Deputy Dillon to which I do not intend to refer.  I do not want to follow Deputy Dillon along the lines he set for me.  I do not believe they were helpful to a solution of the problem of the Gaeltacht.  They certainly were not helpful in securing an intelligent debate on this Estimate.  There are some points in his remarks to which I shall have to allude, but beyond that, I do not intend to follow him in the particular line which he adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I want to make it clear to the Dáil that the sum which the Dáil has been asked to vote has reference only to the salaries and expenses of the office which has been created.  There is no provision for any development undertakings at the moment.  The office, as everybody knows, was set up only recently, and the salaries of the small number of officials concerned have to be provided in this Estimate for the rest of the financial year.  There is no suggestion of any amount of money, either adequate or inadequate, being devoted to any particular part of the Gaeltacht or congested districts.  The function of the office, as most Deputies are aware but which some Deputies do not seem to understand, is a co-ordinating one. Its function also is to initiate schemes for the better development of the Gaeltacht, and to assist any other Departments set up for that purpose.  Both aspects of these functions are being pursued actively, not only within Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng <Col N="222" /> itself, but by the inter-departmental committee which has been set up, and the function and the purpose of which is to advise and to assist me in examining many of the proposals that are placed before me and many of the proposals that I myself will place before that inter-departmental committee.  I have stated that it will be my function to initiate proposals through other Departments of State.  Deputy MacBride put down a question recently which the Tánaiste answered, and the answer to which Deputy MacBride apparently misconstrued, because he asked in a supplementary question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;May the Parliamentary Secretary put forward a proposal to the Government without its first passing through this inter-departmental committee?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think he would be wise to seek the advice of the committee on the proposal, but there is no obligation on him to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to point out that it was never intended that any body of civil servants should be in a position to make suggestions that I should carry out.  Many of the proposals that are under examination in my office did not come before the inter-departmental committee.  One of the proposals which recently has been examined, and is still to a certain extent under consideration, was brought by me direct to the Government and I am happy at this stage to say that I have got approval for this particular project from the Government. It refers to the growing of grass for the production of grass meal on the Bangor Erris bog in Mayo.  I think that Bord na Móna have already acquired that bog.  They are about to undertake the drainage of it and, in conjunction with the drainage of that bog, it is proposed to acquire temporarily portion of that bog from Bord na Móna for the purpose of growing grass for the production of grass meal.  Grass meal is a feeding-stuff which has a very high nutritive content for animals.  It is a sound marketable product.  I believe that when this scheme is put through <Col N="223" /> it will prove beneficial not only to the country in general but to that particular district from the point of view of the amount of employment it will give. At the same time it will depend to a large extent on experiments that are being carried out elsewhere.  In the meantime, legislation will have to be prepared, the drainage of the bog will have to be completed and heavy machinery and plant will have to be procured&mdash;so it is a scheme that will not start very soon, though we hope to start it in the course of time.  That was one particular scheme in respect of which I was in a position to go directly to the Government for approval.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the manner in which Deputy Mulcahy approached the debate on this Estimate.  He believes that a certain amount of co-ordination is necessary.  During his term of office as Minister for Education, Deputy Mulcahy made efforts to co-ordinate certain functions within his Department so far as they referred to Gaeltacht areas.  He made two suggestions which I appreciate, even though I had already taken steps on similar lines. The first was in regard to the selection of focal points for development and the second was in regard to reports by the three special Department of Education inspectors who operate solely in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the selection of focal points for development, I referred in my opening remarks to a sub-committee of the inter-departmental committee which was set up specifically for that purpose.  It is representative of different Departments and different sections of administration in which activities are undertaken for the development of Gaeltacht and congested districts.  I might refer in particular to marine works where the responsibility for undertaking them and carrying them out is not very well defined; also, to drainage and roadmaking where responsibility as between the local authority and the central authority is not well defined&mdash;and even where the Government Departments have a responsibility it is not certain which particular Department has that particular responsibility in that particular case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> These matters are being actively pursued by this sub-committee.  Every Deputy will appreciate that unless the responsibility is placed somewhere it will be very difficult to undertake or pursue any development works in these areas.  I am obliged to Deputy Mulcahy for the suggestion but he will appreciate, having regard to these remarks, that steps have already been taken in that direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to reports from inspectors from the Gaeltacht areas, to which Deputy Mulcahy also referred, it was brought to my knowledge some weeks ago that these reports would be available in the near future.  I have asked the Department of Education to make sufficient copies of the reports available so that they may be examined and considered in detail by the inter-departmental committee.  I have had a cursory glance over them.  I believe they will be of immense benefit to me and to the inter-departmental committee in connection with any matters they examine arising out of these reports.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have laid particular stress on the necessity for afforestation. Deputy Blowick, in particular, has suggested that the proper utilisation of the lands in these areas is afforestation.  I can assure him and Deputy Cogan and Deputy MacBride, and the other Deputies who referred to it, that forestry is receiving a very high priority in the deliberations in my office and by the inter-departmental committee.  I can endorse what Deputy Blowick said with regard to the help which is forthcoming from the officials of the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to deal with every speech that has been made but I should like to refer to some remarks made by Deputy Dillon.  First of all, as almost everybody in the country must have read, he said that the setting-up of this office was &ldquo;a political stunt,&rdquo;&ldquo;a dirty racket&rdquo;&mdash;and he used various other adjectives, too.  I have no intention of following Deputy Dillon along these lines.  I have a certain amount of pity for him that his hatred of the Taoiseach, and of the political Party of which he is the head, should so obsess him as to make him descend to such a degree of degradation <Col N="225" /> inside this House or outside this House.  I believe that that hatred is born of a certain amount of jealousy of the status which the Taoiseach has achieved in this country and of the importance of the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the country.  Although at the beginning Deputy Dillon gratuitously tried to dissociate me from his remarks, inevitably he brought me in. I am in charge of this office and I have no intention of dispensing any patronage whatsoever.  Deputy Dillon suggested that the office was set up solely for the purpose of organising the districts in the West of Ireland where Fianna Fáil had lost a seat and to dispense patronage in order to ensure that, wherever a seat was lost or might be shaky, the position would be retrieved.</P>
    <P>At this stage I might refer also to remarks made by several other Deputies during the course of the debate.  They made insinuations or direct allegations that I, in the course of my tour of the western districts, used the occasion for purely political purposes.  The reverse was, in fact, the case.  I took every precaution to ensure that no political tinge whatsoever would be given to any visit I paid to any part of the country.  I notified every Deputy in advance&mdash; irrespective of what Party he belonged to&mdash;of my intention to visit his part of the country.  I told him exactly where I was going and the times I would be holding meetings.</P>

I replied to every one of them that if they had any proposals to put before me they should come to the meeting where I expected that every shade of political thought and every representative body would be in attendance.</P>
      <P>I made no special provisions whatever for the holding of any Fianna Fáil meetings, good or bad.

I took the utmost precautions to ensure I would get the goodwill of everyone in carrying out these visits and in trying to get what benefit I could out of them.</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks, Deputy Dillon said that the activities of this office would be related to the nine counties in which Fianna Fáil lost seats in the last election.  I am not aware that there are any such nine counties, but I might remind Deputy Dillon and the House generally that in the two biggest Gaeltacht areas in the country, Connemara and West Donegal, Fianna Fáil have maintained their representation and have succeeded in increasing their poll in the last election and before ever this office was established.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be informed well in advance.  Deputy Dillon suggested that the areas defined in the Undeveloped Areas Bill&mdash;I do not intend to refer to the Bill beyond this&mdash;were deliberately selected in order to retrieve the political situation which he alleged Fianna Fáil had lost. The areas as defined in Section 3 (2) of the Bill are exactly as defined in Section 46 (1) of the Irish Land Act, 1909.  It was extraordinary foresight on the part of the framers of that Act that they should envisage that Fianna Fáil&mdash;an organisation which was not in existence then&mdash;would be putting through this Act for political purposes, because, as Deputy Dillon alleges, Fianna Fáil is supposed to have lost ground in those areas.  It is worth while putting on record the terms of Section 46 (1) of the Land Act, 1909:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of the Congested Districts Board (Ireland) Acts, as amended by this Act, each of the following administrative counties, <Col N="228" /> that is to say, the Counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Kerry shall be a congested districts county, the six rural districts of Ballyvaughan, Ennistymon, Kilrush, Scariff, Tulla and Killadysert in the County of Clare, shall together form one congested districts county, and the four rural districts of Bantry, Castletown, Schull and Skibbereen, in the County of Cork, shall together form one congested districts county.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If anybody cares to compare that section with Section 3 (2) of the Undeveloped Areas Bill, he will find that those areas are exactly as set out in this Land Act of 1909.</P>

      <P>Irish Land Act, 1909, Ninth of Edward VII, Chapter 42. Deputy Dillon made particular reference to the County Roscommon and suggested that there was not a congested area for something like 30 miles from Strokestown west.  As the reports of the House show, Deputy Dillon spoke on the 29th November.  I have here a letter dated 22nd November from the secretary of the Ballaghaderreen and District I.R.A. Veterans' Cumann&mdash;a man I do not know, who wrote me voluntarily.  This is what he had to tell me with regard to the condition of Roscommon.  I leave Deputy Dillon himself to judge whether this is a true picture or not:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This district from which is drawn our 60 members, representing every vocation and calling, covers a radius within six miles roughly of this town and takes in part of the Counties Sligo and Mayo as well as Roscommon. It has suffered more than any other from the ravages of emigration, as is borne out by the following. There are upwards of 500 homes in which there is hardly left a boy or girl between the ages of 17 and 25.  In addition, there are over 250 homesteads closed down, the families having left altogether.  The holdings are mostly uneconomic and with no wages to supplement the small incomes from the land.  Emigration <Col N="229" /> has usually to be resorted to and, curious though it may seem, more so during the past two or three years than ever before within memory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a letter which I received from a resident of Ballaghaderreen, a town which Deputy Dillon should know well is in Roscommon; but coming as it does from a man in his capacity as secretary of the I.R.A.  Veterans' Cumann, no doubt Deputy Dillon would not seek him out to inquire whether in his opinion it is truly as he suggests a congested district requiring some measure of help under this Undeveloped Areas Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I leave Deputy Dillon, may I say that, even though he tried to dissociate me from any remarks he had to make on the Estimate, he suggested during the course of the debate that I was cavorting around the strand with Deputy Breslin, now in the Chair, at Magheraroarty, the suggestion being that I selected only the Fianna Fáil representative in that district as well. In that case also, I wrote to Deputy O'Donnell, the Fine Gael representative, and was told by the Deputy that he was engaged elsewhere.  In fact, I knew he was engaged elsewhere, as I met him some days afterwards.  The suggestion that I selected only a member of my own Party to examine work that was considered necessary is fantastic and completely at variance with the facts.</P>
    <P>He also suggested that I, as Parliamentary Secretary, would not have recourse to any one of the Ministers of the Cabinet.  I would like to say this and place it on record, that I have found nothing but the utmost co-operation from each and every one of the Ministers.  I am in a position to approach any one of them at any time and not, as Deputy Dillon suggests, to be told by the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste that I must wait three days, if I see them at all.  I can go direct to the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste to seek advice and put my views before them and hear theirs in return.  I am also in a position with regard to my particular functions to go to the Government&mdash;as I said before, but I do not think Deputy MacBride was in <Col N="230" /> the House at the time&mdash;through any Minister or, if not through any Minister, to go direct myself, without recourse to the inter-departmental committee, in regard to any scheme which it is proposed to put before the Government.  I do not necessarily have to have the opinions one way or the other of the inter-departmental committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride also suggested that I should avail of the technical assistance offered under E.C.A.  I do not know whether Deputy MacBride is aware that there is a danger that that technical assistance will cease at the end of this year, but in any case I am in contact with the representatives of E.C.A. in Dublin and will be meeting them again shortly.</P>
    <P>Frequent references were made to the work being carried out throughout the western districts under the Local Authorities (Works) Act having been cut down by the Fianna Fáil Government. It should scarcely be necessary at this stage to repeat that in the Book of Estimates for the current year the sum provided for was £1,220,000 as against £1,750,000 last year, a reduction of £530,000.  It was the previous Government and not the Fianna Fáil Government which effected any reduction in the moneys voted for this scheme.  In that connection, I should like to quote from the Official Report of the debate on the Local Government Estimate of 27th June last.  As reported in Volume 126, No. 4, at column 543, the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Smith, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am standing here over an Estimate for £1,200,000, an Estimate inserted in the Book of Estimates by my predecessor.  I am drawing attention to the fact that there is a certain sum of money available to me. I am giving an undertaking that, so far as I can, I will ensure that this money is wisely spent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the suggestions being bandied about here, there and everywhere&mdash;even during the course of my tour it was put to me on a number of occasions that the present Government was responsible for a reduction of the moneys voted for this purpose&mdash;should cease when everybody making them <Col N="231" /> knows well that the facts are as I have stated.</P>
    <P>Most of the Deputies who spoke on the opposite side, while welcoming the introduction of this Estimate and the setting up of this office, suggested that it was, more or less, eyewash.  In so far as I can ensure it, there will be no eyewash whatever attached to the office, and I will do my best to carry out the trust imposed on me by the Government.</P>
    <P>I did not seek this office and I was not aware that the office was earmarked for me when it was originally established, but, in so far as I am entrusted with it, I will do my best to carry out the duties of that office. Several Deputies, and Deputy Cowan in particular, said that it is an onerous task, that the problems are many and varied and will need the best efforts and co-operation of every side of the House.  Having had some experience of it, I can agree to a large extent with what Deputy Cowan said.  It is a tough assignment, but I hope, without any political tinge whatever, to do my best on behalf of these areas, and, in my own small way and through the system of co-ordination and the initiation of schemes which may not have been thought of before, to better the lives of the people in Gaeltacht and congested districts.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, that &ldquo;Gaeltacht and congested districts&rdquo; for the purposes of my office are not defined at all.  There is no suggestion of omitting any pocket in County Clare or any other part of the western seaboard. &ldquo;Gaeltacht and congested districts&rdquo;, so far as I am concerned, will be a loose term and where I see that standards of living are poor and economic conditions low, I hope to be able to better these conditions in so far as any means will be placed at my disposal, or in so far as I can formulate any schemes for that purpose.  Again, I want to thank the majority of Deputies for the manner in which they approached this Estimate and the goodwill that has been promised me in carrying out this work.</P>

      <P>I am not going to pretend to the Deputy that I know all about these things.  It is only recently that Gaeltacht Services were placed in my care, and I want to say in that regard that it was due to no laziness on the part of the Minister for Lands, as Deputy Dillon suggested, but at my express wish that Gaeltacht Services were placed under my care, because I felt that there was no affinity whatever between them and the work with which the Department of Lands is primarily concerned.  There was a certain amount of confusion in the minds of the people generally as to my functions in regard to Gaeltacht Services, and I felt that it was one line along which I could, by direct action, co-ordinate work which I found desirable and necessary.  On going to the Government with the request that these services should be given in my charge, the Government immediately decided to do so.  As to the point <Col N="233" /> raised by the Deputy, I have not yet had time to examine all the activities of that section, but I hope to do so within the next couple of weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is perhaps appropriate enough that I should move the Second Reading of this Bill after the debate which has just concluded. I do not think it is necessary, in doing so, to argue the need for industrial development in the areas to which the Bill primarily relates, that is to say, the counties west of the Shannon and Donegal, Kerry and West Cork.  If it was thought necessary to put upon record the case for special measures for industrial development in those areas, it would, I think, not be difficult to find statistical material to support that case.  But Deputies do not need statistics to convince them that the position in these counties in relation to the expansion of industrial activities requires immediate attention. The proportion of the total population of these counties which is engaged in industrial work, that is to say, in the production of saleable and transportable goods, is very much less than it is in the rest of the country.  Since the industrial drive began here in 1932, the proportion of our population engaged in industry has more than doubled but in these counties named in the Bill it is still less than it was in the whole country in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is, I think, aware of the fact that it is from that area that the heaviest emigration is taking place.  It is my view&mdash;and I think the considered view of everybody familiar with conditions there&mdash;that emigration will not be checked unless and until a wider variety of employments is introduced in these counties, particularly industrial employment.  In fact, I think it could be argued that there is a greater need for industrial development in these <Col N="234" /> counties on the western seaboard than in midland and eastern counties.</P>
    <P>A case could be made for the contention that, in the eastern counties, industrial development could possibly involve attracting labour from agriculture and that in terms of long-term policy that is undesirable because it is very probable that during the next ten or 20 years the terms of trade are going to go heavily in favour of agricultural and other primary producers and against manufacturing industries, particularly the secondary industries which we have, up to the present, been able to establish here.  If that is so, then on a long-term basis there is a case against encouraging manufacturing industry in circumstances in which necessary labour might be taken from agriculture.</P>
    <P>But that position certainly does not arise in the West of Ireland, because there is a real surplus of labour in relation to productive possibilities.  Any increase in productivity which might be secured there through industrial development would be a real gain.  It need not detract from the agricultural potentialities of the area and will represent&mdash;we hope completely&mdash;a retention at home of workers who might otherwise emigrate.  If there is no need to argue the case for industrial development in the congested areas, there is no need to argue either that it will not take place there through private enterprise unless very special inducements are offered.</P>
    <P>For historical reasons, which it is not necessary to review, this country has suffered from underdevelopment of industries. For these same historical reasons such industries as did develop tended to gravitate towards the East and the South.  There we have the greater concentration of purchasing power and the main markets of the country.  There are the ports through which the bulk of our exports pass and our imports arrive.  They are the centres of financial and commercial activity.  It is obvious, therefore, that factories which are located away from these centres of activity, from these markets, will suffer a competitive disadvantage as against factories close to them.  Furthermore, it can, I think, be <Col N="235" /> demonstrated that, unless something effective is done to remedy that maladministration of industries, not merely will it continue but it is liable to become more pronounced because the whole trend is for industrial activity to concentrate where it already exists.  Unless that trend is arrested, the remedying of the position will be made more difficult and much more costly.</P>
    <P>That position is, I think, aggravated by the fact that with the lack of industrial activity and the absence of commercial activity in these congested areas on the scale that exists in the East costs tend to be higher, and particularly the cost of providing and operating the public services such as railways, roads, harbours and electricity.</P>
    <P>This special problem of ours, resulting from the historical causes to which I have referred has, of course, always been recognised to exist.  For my own part, I am prepared to confess that I originally underestimated what was needed to rectify it.  When we commenced the industrial policy in 1932, I thought that the power which the Government would have to attach conditions to the provision of protection by tariff or otherwise would be ample to secure that a reasonable share of the new industrial activity we aimed to promote would be sent west of the Shannon or to Donegal, Kerry or Cork. That did not prove to be the case.  It is now obvious, in retrospect, why our hopes were disappointed.</P>
    <P>Any person engaging in new industrial activity and risking his private money on its success, will naturally think ahead and, thinking ahead, will realise that the granting of protection and the restricting of imports will not merely enable him to get started on the particular line he has chosen, but will also induce others into the same line.  A person proposing to engage in any particular industrial development, responding to Government exhortation to locate his factory in a rural area or western county, would have to recognise that the Government would have no power&mdash;once the protection had come into force&mdash;to prevent another <Col N="236" /> Irish company getting into the same business in a more advantageous location and that, with the curtailment or disappearance of external competition, a far more dangerous internal competition might develop.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to say that the utilisation of that power of the Government to induce newcomers in industry or persons promoting new industrial activities to go to the smaller towns or even to the west of the country was completely ineffective. A number did, but as I have pointed out, not nearly to the same extent as was desired and certainly not in the same degree as new industries were started in the eastern counties and in the larger towns.</P>
    <P>We recognised quite early in the industrial drive that that power on which we were relying, the power to make the granting of protection conditional upon people accepting the Government's view on where their factories were to be located, was inadequate and in 1936 we thought we found a means of doing something more.  I have mentioned that the main problem which arose for those who were prepared to embark on new industrial undertakings and to finance them on the promise of protection from the Government was their fear that subsequently they would be subjected to competition from other newcomers into the same industry located in Dublin or in some other more advantageous position.  We thought then of the device of the reserved commodity licence which was provided for in the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934. That was a system under which we were in a position to guarantee to anybody who started a new industry in the western area that nobody else would be allowed to start the same industry anywhere else, but that device also proved in the main ineffective, firstly because it aroused, as some Deputies will remember, considerable opposition in the House and that political controversy naturally created doubts in the minds of intending industrialists whether the protection granted by the reserved commodity licence would prove to be permanent. Secondly, it was a device that could only be adopted in the case of a proposition <Col N="237" /> for a new industry, that is an industry of a type that did not already exist in the country and that was unlikely to be established here except on the basis of one unit.  Thirdly&mdash;and this was the aspect of it that was developed in the course of the political controversy&mdash;it necessarily involved or seemed to involve the granting of a monopoly to an individual concern which, it was argued, might be exploited.  The device of the reserved commodity licence therefore also proved to be largely ineffective.</P>
    <P>Coming to consider this matter anew it seems to me that we have to try to devise a different approach.  We cannot really guarantee people engaged in new industries in any of these counties named in the Bill against the development of competition from some other part of the country.  We can guarantee them against competition from outside, but the possibility of internal competition developing will always be in their minds and may deter people from taking the financial risks involved in establishing new industries in those counties.  Our aim should, therefore, be, if possible, to give to the industrial firms which undertake the establishment of factories in these undeveloped areas such advantages that they will be able to meet competition from other firms in the same business located in the East on more or less equal terms, advantages which will secure for them a reasonable prospect of success.</P>
    <P>That is what we tried to do in framing this Bill, and I do not mind confessing to the Dáil that, in determining its provisions, the Government encountered quite a number of difficulties, difficulties which I will place frankly before the Dáil, because it is, I think, desirable that we should all address our minds to the nature of these difficulties and see if it is possible to find some more effective way around them than is now proposed.</P>
    <P>May I say that this Bill has a title similar to that of an Act passed some years ago in Great Britain and is not dissimilar in its general provisions to that Act and to certain legislation passed in other countries?  We found, in framing the Bill, that the legislation <Col N="238" /> enacted elsewhere was not of much help.  The aim of the British Government and of some other Governments that promoted similar legislation was either to secure the diversification of employment in areas in which unemployment had developed, or was threatened because of over-dependence upon a particular industry, or else because there was a desire to provide supplementary employments for persons who were normally engaged in fishing or in farming, or in some other part-time occupation.  Our problem, as I have explained, is one of chronic under-development over a fairly wide area of this country.  In devising means by which the State might help private firms engaging in industrial activities in these underdeveloped areas it was necessary to keep certain essentials in mind.  First of all the help had to be of such a character that it could be varied in accordance with the circumstances and merits of individual cases.  Secondly, it had to be permanent in its effect.</P>
    <P>We ruled out quite early an idea of a continuing subsidy.  I think that there would be very strong objection to reliance upon the idea of annual subsidy to private industrial firms establishing factories in these western counties.  It would probably be ineffective anyway because the private individual or group of individuals proposing to finance the particular development would have a lack of confidence in the continuity of the subsidy arrangement, and that, in itself, would be sufficient to deter them from beginning at all; and, secondly, I think that there is no doubt that any subsidy arrangement of that kind would encourage inefficiency.  A subsidy is always demoralising in its effect.</P>
    <P>It may be that, in individual cases, there is sufficient strength of character or other circumstances which will ward off the demoralisation, but in regard to the particular matter that we are dealing with now, which may involve a large number of separate concerns of varying size, any general subsidy arrangement covering them all would be bound to produce undesirable results in a few cases and, of course, the development of inefficiency would not be checked by any limitation <Col N="239" /> placed upon the subsidy because there would always be the belief that political pressure or other influence would be capable of securing its revision if the need for it arose.</P>
    <P>The general view, anyway, that we worked on was this, that whatever assistance was to be given was to be given right at the start and given irrevocably.  The private individual or the group of individuals concerned, before risking their own money, should know precisely what help they were going to get from the Government. They should know that that was all the help they were going to get and that, once they had accepted the obligation of proceeding upon the basis of that help, thereafter they were on their own and would get no more help.</P>
    <P>The scheme in the Bill, therefore, is based upon the prior assessment of the disadvantages attached to any particular location.  The board, An Foras Tionscal, which is to be established under the Bill, will have imposed upon it the obligation of making that assessment, of deciding within the provisions of the Bill what help is to be given in individual cases and then, having so decided and communicated their decisions to the parties concerned, it will be for each party to decide whether, in view of it, they are prepared to proceed or to drop their plans.</P>
    <P>There will be cases, of course, where an industry located in any of these congested counties or any of the undeveloped areas to which the Bill may apply will be at no competitive disadvantage at all.  The best illustration I could give of that would be: If somebody were to discover in one of these counties a valuable mineral deposit and was to propose to develop that deposit and process the ore, obviously, except perhaps in some unusual circumstances, that is an industrial activity which would have to be undertaken on the site of the deposit and there would be no commercial reason why it should be undertaken elsewhere.  I will admit that even in that category there may be some exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Also, there are established in many <Col N="240" /> towns in the West small bakeries and mineral water factories and undertakings of that kind, small furniture factories, which are quite capable of economic operation and which maintain themselves by reason of the protection afforded to them by the transport cost which their competitors elsewhere have to incur, industries which are designed merely to meet the needs of a limited area.</P>
    <P>It is only where there is clearly shown that there exists a competitive disadvantage attached to a location in one of these undeveloped counties, that the question of help would arise and where an application for help would be considered.</P>
    <P>There will be cases, no doubt, where the competitive disadvantages will be so great that not even the maximum help that could be given under the Bill would be sufficient to offset them, and in such cases it is possible only to decide that the industries are completely unsuitable for location in these districts.</P>
    <P>The major disadvantage which any firm undertaking industrial activities in these undeveloped areas has to encounter is higher transport costs on their products when distributing them, and on raw materials if they have to be imported.  I spent a lot of time considering whether there was any form of help that could be given initially, permanently and adequately, at the commencement of such an undertaking which could be directly related to that disadvantage.  I do not think there is.  I think we must aim at overcoming that permanent disadvantage of higher transport costs by the help given in other directions initially. Against that disadvantage we have to give some compensating advantages.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, An Foras Tionscal can give that help in all the forms set out there.  They can build factory premises and lease them at low rents to those who are prepared to carry on industrial activities in them.  That, as many Deputies know, was a device adopted by the British Government for their depressed areas.  They developed industrial estates, built factory premises on those estates, and then induced private firms to begin activities <Col N="241" /> in them or to remove their activities to them.  Alternatively, it can give a grant covering the whole or part of the cost of constructing factory premises, the difference between the two cases being that, in the first instance, the factory premises would remain the property of An Foras Tionscal, leased to the industrial firm operating in it and, in the other case, the factory premises would become the property and remain the property of the industrial firm.  It can provide all the incidental services required for industrial operation, the bringing in of water, the laying on of sewerage, and similar services of that kind.  It can give grants up to 50 per cent. of the cost of machinery and other capital equipment, and it can give grants for the training of workers.  The grants for the training of workers can be utilised either to secure their training in this country or abroad.  It can provide, after consultation with the local authority concerned, funds for the construction of any necessary roads or bridges, harbour works or railway sidings, and it can also give grants for the provision of houses for the accommodation of workers, or hostels or canteens.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that these forms of help are in a sense related to the competitive disadvantages associated with industrial activities in the undeveloped areas.  A private firm proposing to risk its own money in some industrial project and considering how much it could recover if the project failed to develop would ask itself a number of questions.  First of all, if it built premises to house the activities, they would ask themselves what were the prospects of selling these premises if they decided to vacate them, and they would realise that in some towns in any of these seven named counties or any other undeveloped district the saleability of a factory premises would be a great deal less than that of a similar premises in Dublin, Cork or on the east coast.  Secondly, they would realise that a lot of the development expenditure associated with the establishment of the new factory, the bringing in of water, the construction of roads and, in so far as they would require it, the building of railway sidings, and other work of that kind, would represent <Col N="242" /> completely lost money in the event of their being unable to continue with their project.  That would apply also to houses built by them for the accommodation of their workers although perhaps in a less degree in that case. It would certainly apply to hostels and canteens.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in so far as there is not in the undeveloped areas any industrial tradition, a private industrialist would realise that in order to carry on there he would need to make special provision for the training of workers in the skilled processes of the industry in which he was proposing to engage. That fact has been a difficulty in a number of cases and it is not unusual for new industrial firms here to find it necessary to send workers to factories in Great Britain or on the Continent for a period of weeks or months so that they can become familiar with the process involved and undertake the training of other workers.</P>
    <P>In the Six-County area the legislation in force for the encouragement of industrial development provides for similar training grants for workers. The Six-County legislation goes quite far in determining the help that can be given to private industrial firms. But, of course, the circumstances there are different from ours in so far as they have no power to protect the local market and they will have to rely entirely on these inducements, while over and above all the help we can give directly under the Bill, the big advantage of being able to restrict external competition, still remains.  It is proposed that local authorities may grant remission of rates, and it is contemplated that an arrangement will be made with the Electricity Supply Board to ensure that power for industrial purposes in these areas will be provided to those concerns at rates as low as are provided for similar concerns anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Now, as to the form of the Bill, there is also something which must be said. First of all, I should perhaps emphasise that I am conscious of the fact that the introduction of the Bill will, for the time being, keep at a standstill any projects which may now be in train for the development of industrial <Col N="243" /> activities in the West, because the Bill provides for the establishment of a board, An Foras Tionscal, and the help to be given under the Bill will be determined by that board, which is not yet in existence.  Naturally, anybody who is interested in industrial development in the West or has in mind industrial development anywhere will wait until he can get a decision from that board as to the help which might be given to him.</P>
    <P>In the case of other legislation of a different kind, it is sometimes possible for a Government Department to give directions to its staff before a Bill has been passed as to bringing to completion the consideration of proposals that might be submitted under the legislation, and thus permit of prompt action when the legislation is passed. In this case that is not possible because, even though the Department of Industry and Commerce can receive and examine proposals by private groups for industrial projects in those areas, it cannot assume what the decision of An Foras Tionscal on them will be, and it can only get them into the form which will facilitate An Foras Tionscal in arriving at prompt decisions. That is why I think I should say now that I have instructed the officers of the Trade and Industry Branch of the Department to assume for the time being that this Bill will pass into law in a form much like that in which it was introduced, and to encourage people not to hold back any projects or any proposals which they may have in mind, and particularly to encourage local development committees and organisations to work up any projects they have in contemplation and bring them for consideration to the Department.  Even though it is clear that the Department will not be able to tell them what help they can get under the Bill, they can at least get these propositions to a stage which will facilitate, as I said, a prompt decision by An Foras Tionscal when established.</P>

      <P>Or any undertaking in course of construction.  It is a point to which we gave very considerable study, because it could be argued that the extension of some existing concern is just as important from the point of view of the development of these areas or employment in these areas as the establishment of new ones.  But the Deputy will appreciate that if you step beyond the clear line of a new project and begin to consider the possibility of helping the extension of existing projects, there is a very considerable danger that you will be driven much further than would be justified and that, ultimately, you will reach the stage where some existing concern, which has been badly managed and is losing money, will be pleading for help under the Bill to keep it going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided it is clearly a new development, a completely new process on which the concern is going to embark.  If a shoe factory decided to make lawnmowers, there would be no doubt about the newness of the process, but if it decided to make a different type of shoe, you would be getting into considerable difficulty.  It seems to me that it is impossible to do anything in this matter except to rely very largely on the judgment of the board to be appointed.  I think we have to do that in any event.  Under the administration of this scheme, the assessment of the competitive disadvantages of any location is not susceptible to general regulations. Certainly, I would not undertake the task of drafting regulations by which anybody would proceed to make that assessment.  I think we need a more flexible type of administration and that is why the Bill proposes the establishment of an independent board financed by a grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> I should say in this connection also that the board, as the House will have appreciated from the Bill, will be an administrative body, and on that account I think that it will be necessary to confine its members to people already close in to the administrative machine, and who have got considerable experience in these administrative problems or people who have gained experience of the problems involved in some of our statutory organisations. I should make it clear that the board has not got the responsibility of initiating propositions.  Its task will be to consider propositions that will come to it, and decide in accordance with the provisions of the Bill the extent to which help is required and should be given.  The initiative must come from private persons or companies or local development committees.  It seems to me, anyway, that it would be impracticable to attempt to constitute this board upon the basis on which some statutory boards have been composed by including in it on a part-time basis persons with general industrial experience.  As its task will be mainly the administration of public funds, it must be composed of persons who have special qualifications for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Bill is limited to seven years. The Government gave a great deal of thought as to the wisdom of that provision. There was an argument that to limit the operation of the Bill to a shorter period would secure greater anxiety to proceed quickly under it, more expeditious development in those areas, and a more rapid response to the inducements which are being held out.</P>
    <P>On the whole, however, I think all the arguments favour maintaining these inducements for about seven years.  It is impossible to forecast the extent to which the inducements held out here will attract private industrial firms to the establishment of new industries in these areas.  I think that if there is any success in the initial stages it will induce others to come along in greater number later and it would be unwise to limit this experiment, if I may so call it, to a shorter period than seven years.  On the other hand, some limit must be put, because <Col N="246" /> if we are to achieve a speedy rectification of the position that exists in the undeveloped areas we must make it clear that that is our desire and that the aid contemplated by this Bill will not be available indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The hope would be that there would come as a result of these inducements a sufficient development in these areas to redress the balance of commercial activity within the country and to minimise, if not wipe out, the disadvantages which industrialists in the western counties at present experience.</P>
    <P>A figure of £2,000,000 has been put in the Bill as the limit to which Foras Tionscal can make grants.  That is a very tentative figure and almost any figure could have been put in there. The view is that if the Bill produces developments which will involve a call upon the resources of the board to an extent greater than £2,000,000, then the Dáil should have an opportunity of considering the position and amending legislation would be required to raise the limit.  It would be a great pleasure to me personally to have the task of proposing such amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that it is not unusual in Bills of this kind to fix a limit and then periodically revise the limit as circumstances appear to justify.  But any estimate one may make now as to the extent to which the funds provided for the board would be called upon would be completely tentative. It would depend on factors which are unforeseeable and particularly on a number of decisions which private people may make who have not yet even begun to think what these decisions may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but administration, of course, will be very, very slight.  It is intended that the board will do nothing except administer that fund. Another problem to which the Government gave a good deal of thought was the area of operation of the Bill.  At <Col N="247" /> one time we contemplated not defining undeveloped areas in the Bill and leaving that entirely to be settled by a ministerial decision later or even leaving it to the discretion of the board.  But, on consideration, it was thought that that was undesirable.  It was considered necessary, anyway, to emphasise, by a provision in the Bill, that it was intended, in the main, to apply to these congested areas, to the seven named counties and the other congested areas, even though it was desired to avoid establishing something akin to another Border in the country and to make it clear also that the help which could be given under the Bill would be available for industrial projects in other undeveloped areas.  That is how the Bill now stands.</P>
      <P>It must apply to the congested areas and it may apply to other undeveloped areas in accordance with ministerial Orders.  The congested areas were taken because they have already been defined in previous Statutes for somewhat analogous purposes.  They include the most widespread area of under-development within our territory.  It is true that in these congested areas there are some large prosperous urban centres and, while it is recognised that industrial development in these counties is more likely to proceed within these larger centres of population than in smaller villages, it is thought that their location in the area does not complicate the scheme because, as I have said, the board will have discretionary power.</P>
      <P>There is no set measure of assistance for any particular industrial project. The board will measure the competitive disadvantage, if any, of the location and aim to offset it.  I should, therefore, make it clear that, while the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no discretion at all under the Bill concerning its application to the congested areas, he has discretion in relation to its extension to other areas. But it is intended that the powers of the Bill will, in fact, be extended to other areas which are also underdeveloped without attempting any legal definition of that term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, perhaps, say in that <Col N="248" /> connection, however, that the aim of the measure is to induce industrial development in that area west of the Shannon, Donegal, Kerry and West Cork and, of course, any pressure in the Dáil to give equal assistance to industrial proposals or projects in other areas will weaken the pressure to achieve the development which is desired of these congested counties. Therefore, I would ask the Dáil not to press for the amendment of the definition of the congested areas by the inclusion of other areas.  If there are, in fact, areas of the same kind which can honestly be described as under-developed, where the economic conditions are much the same, then the Bill will be extended to them; but the wider the area to which the Bill automatically applies, the less effective will be its force in getting in these seven counties and adjacent areas the development that is desired.</P>
    <P>I again want to emphasise that Foras Tionscal will have no power of initiation.  This Bill will not function at all unless private industrial enterprise inside or outside these areas responds to the inducements which it holds out.  I am hopeful that there will exist in every town of these counties some businessman or group of businessmen or a local committee which will become active now in considering the industrial possibilities of their district, and in making contact with the people who have got the necessary skill, and undertake the preparation of proposals for consideration by Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>I saw in a Clare paper a query: How much of the £2,000,000 is allocated to County Clare?  None of it is allocated to County Clare or any other county. There is no idea that this sum will be divided up into parcels and retained for particular districts.  The £2,000,000 will be there to be used to help industrial projects in any part of the area as they come along, and there is no limitation either as to the centres from which they come or as to the size of the project.  In fact, if there are two sound projects from the same town, both will be supported, even though some adjacent town has not yet submitted a project at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> The Government itself is not going under this Bill to operate industries anywhere.  The Bill is intended to provide a measure of help for private industry.  In that connection, however, I should say that the Department of Industry and Commerce will continue its normal function of stimulating industrial activity.  Already there are signs that a number of groups who were examining the possibility of undertaking new industrial activities have been persuaded by reason of the help which the Bill contemplates, to transfer them from the areas they had originally in mind to locations in the undeveloped areas.  The prospect of getting help under this Bill will be a lever which the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce can use when discussing proposals brought forward by private people to get them to move into districts in which development is most urgently required.</P>
    <P>In order to prevent any misunderstanding in that regard, I should make it clear that this Bill contains, as I have said, proposals to stimulate and encourage industrial development in these undeveloped areas by private enterprise.  There are other projects in progress, or under examination, by statutory organisations which will contribute to the prosperity of the western counties, but I want to make it quite clear that these existing statutory organisations will not be beneficiaries under the Bill.  The help afforded by this Bill will be confined to private industrial firms where groups of people are prepared to risk their own money on their belief in their capacity to make a success of some undertaking, to groups of people who, having started, are prepared to undertake the responsibility of managing that undertaking. I want, however, to make it clear that once they have started, and have got help, then they are on their own just the same as an industrial concern anywhere else.  If their plans prove to be unsound, or their management weak, or their estimates wrong and they fail&mdash;well, they fail just as any other concern might.  It is for private individuals who put up propositions and undertake, in part at least, the financing of the undertakings to come to a decision as to whether <Col N="250" /> their ideas are sound or not.  The function of An Foras Tionscal is to contact groups of that kind, commanding a proportion of the finances required, and to decide, as I have said, the measure of the disadvantage they may suffer by reason of their location in any of those areas, and offset that disadvantage by giving help in any of the forms which the Bill stipulates.</P>
    <P>For the reasons which I have mentioned, I would be glad if the Dáil facilitated me in getting the Bill passed through the Dáil before Christmas. It will, presumably, be January before we can get it through the Seanad.  If we could not get it passed through the Dáil before Christmas it would, necessarily, have to be delayed here until February.  It might, therefore, be well into March before An Foras Tionscal could function.  I think there are many reasons why it is undesirable that progress in regard to a number of propositions which are in train should be delayed.  The shorter the period of the passage of the Bill by the Oireachtas the better it will be for getting results under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally a Bill of this nature would be considered in a non-controversial spirit.  It is obvious, however, from the manner in which this Bill was framed and presented to the House, and from the general preparatory steps that were taken, that this is a political Bill.  That was emphasised and underlined by the concluding remarks of the Minister, in which he said it was necessary to get the Bill through before Christmas so that it could go to the Seanad and be passed there in January.  If the Government contemplate an early dissolution the Bill would, therefore, be law before February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House welcome, and are anxious to see, any steps taken which will develop the congested areas.  The mere fact that this Bill is introduced now does not in any way increase the problems that the congested areas have been affected by for a long number of years.  The congested areas have been a problem for successive Governments since 1922. They were a problem for British Governments before that.  Listening <Col N="251" /> to the remarks of the Minister, it was somewhat strange to hear him say that the problems which he mentioned were greater than he had originally estimated.</P>
    <P>It is significant that none of these problems received any attention before the last election from the present Government.  Deputies will recollect that it was only after that election that the 17-point programme was announced, and that a specific reference was made to the Gaeltacht or congested areas.  I know that a case can be made on the basis of the 1909 Land Act, which referred to certain counties and included other districts named in Section 3 of the Bill.  But it is equally significant that in the last general election the Fianna Fáil Party lost five seats in a number of the named counties, with a satellite in another county, a Deputy who had formerly been expelled but who, of course, like another Deputy, might have been welcomed back in other circumstances.</P>
    <P>Now, nobody is going to be misled by this Bill.  We do not propose to oppose it.  We welcome any constructive measures that may be forthcoming under the Bill.  We welcome any development that may be possible as a result of the provisions contained in the Bill. The Bill, in so far as it indicates any scheme or policy, appears to lack any thought-out or planned approach.  The Bill, in effect proposes the establishment of a small board and the handing over to it of a large sum of money for development purposes in certain areas. It is not possible to get from reading the Bill, or from having listened to the Minister, any idea of what the policy of the board is going to be, or what definite plans there are for development in those areas.  Through a number of sections in the Bill, beginning with Section 5 sub-section (1) and paragraph (c) we get phrases like this: The board are satisfied that &ldquo;it is of a reasonably permanent nature and will be carried on efficiently.&rdquo;  Of course, the board cannot be satisfied as to whether a new industry is going to be carried on efficiently or whether it is going to be permanent.  Some industries start well and get into difficulties; <Col N="252" /> other industries begin badly and become efficient.  Therefore, I submit that, to include a sub-section of that sort, and to expect that it will promote efficiency, is just window-dressing.  If this Bill is going to lead to the establishment or the promotion of sound industries in the congested areas, then it will be welcomed and supported, not merely by Deputies on this side of the House, but by the people generally. But for any Deputy to imagine that this problem suddenly developed overnight is to refuse to face facts.  The facts are that for generations there has been a problem in these areas, and that there have been a variety of measures adopted at different times to suit different circumstances to assist development in those areas.  The strange fact is that until the results of the last election became known, there was no proposal to establish An Foras Tionscail or to provide a sum of £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>I would have been more interested in hearing what actual plans the Government had for development in those areas.  It is obvious from the Minister's speech and from reading the Bill that there is not available to the Government a single proposal of a worthwhile nature.  In the, course of his speech the Minister stated that it was hoped that private enterprise or local committees would, as a result of the inducement which this Bill offered, decide to establish industries either under the direction of these local committees or by inducing individual businessmen or groups of businessmen to establish and run industries in these localities.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have had the benefits of technical assistance projects under E.C.A., and certain surveys have been made, or some of them were in the course of being carried out by officers of that administration, and technical missions sent here.  I think that is one of the uses to which technical assistance projects could be profitably applied.  I would like to know from the Minister, when he is concluding, if there are any results from the industrial surveys which were made by those technical missions and <Col N="253" /> what recommendations or suggestions, if any, were made.</P>
    <P>Some of the developments that have already taken place in the Western areas should be extended.  Some of them have been started and, I think, reached quite a pitch of efficiency. Others, if properly surveyed and exploited, might offer possibilities.  But reading the Bill and listening to the Minister's speech, the House has got no indication of the policy that will guide the new board or of the technical skill, ability or qualifications of the persons who will be employed by the board&mdash;because power is taken to employ staff&mdash;and who will guide the various industries that may be established.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to recognise the difficulties that have confronted not merely successive Governments but difficulties that have confronted private enterprise when efforts were made to start industries in a number of these localities.  The Minister referred to a number of these difficulties, increased transport charges, lack of port facilities, housing shortages, inability to get skilled personnel.  A number of these difficulties and shortcomings in any undeveloped area probably have destroyed industrial development in the past.  Some of them can be overcome, but in the case of lack of trained and skilled personnel, these have only been overcome by the temporary importation either from other parts of the country or the importation from abroad of skilled personnel to train and guide the unskilled people who are available locally.</P>
    <P>It is provided under Section 7 of the Bill that staff training courses will be paid for, and persons sent either to other parts of the country or sent abroad would have their expenses and their salaries defrayed while undergoing these courses.  In that connection again it should be possible to use the assistance provided already under E.C.A.  Some technical missions left this country during the past couple of years and toured various parts of the United States.  It has been generally recognised that the experience gained from these trips was valuable. Probably it would have been more <Col N="254" /> valuable if the tours could have been of longer duration and if more advantageous facilities were available to provide for payment, and so forth, of the personnel that went abroad on those trips.  In this Bill that problem is provided for under Section 7.  From the point of view of training personnel some attempt will be made to assist whatever promoters are prepared to start a new industry or develop an existing one.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, in the course of his speech, that a new industry only would be assisted, that it was difficult to decide in some cases whether assistance should be provided if the industry was already established.  I think that this Bill should be extended to cover any existing industry that is in difficulties; otherwise, the conclusion that most Deputies on this side of the House have already come to will be more than justified, that it is a political Bill and that the Government will not be able to claim credit for any developments in respect of industries or commercial concerns already established.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of industries, not only in those areas but in other parts of the country, require technical and financial assistance, guidance as to markets and as to the type of product which should be produced.  In that connection special care should be taken to ensure that new industries, or industries in particular areas new to that area, are not established if the industry or the product that it is proposed to manufacture is already adequately catered for.  If there is one thing worse than a lack of industrial development and a lack of employment in a particular area, it is the establishment of an industry already amply catered for in other parts of the country.  It may thrive for a time, or it may succeed because of some temporary publicity, and so forth, in selling its goods, but in a short time it is faced with the problem of over-production for a market already filled to saturation point.  The particular industry that comes most readily to mind is the boot and shoe industry.  That industry was probably not developed to the maximum extent a few years ago but it was in the position to supply the greater <Col N="255" /> part of the needs of the country.  For some extraordinary reason a number of new factories were established and the result has been that ever since very few of the existing factories work for any protracted period full time.  It is on matters of that kind that proper and efficient guidance, not only from the Department of Industry and Commerce but from whatever technical staff are available under the board that it is proposed to establish, should be at all times available to assist any enterprise that it is proposed to establish, or any individual who is anxious to establish an industry in the locality.</P>
    <P>That applies not only to congested areas but it applies to industries all over the country because, whatever about the need for providing employment, which is urgent in many parts of the country, the need to maintain employment in existing industries is even more urgent.  The further important matter to consider in connection with this Bill is how it fits into the measures already taken to develop congested areas.  I feel that anybody listening to the recent debate on the Estimate for the Parliamentary Secretary's Office and that anybody reading this Bill must come to the conclusion that there is a great deal of overlapping and a great deal of confusion between all the various sections and offices of Government Departments who are responsible for these areas.  The latest change was the transfer of Gaeltacht Services to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government.  That, again, is evidence of the lack of any defined plan and of the lack of any cohesive programme.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the point which I made at the beginning, that the Undeveloped Areas Bill and the establishment of the new office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government are political devices with worthy objects in view, namely, the alleviation of distress in certain parts of the country&mdash;the economic development of these underdeveloped areas, an economic development which was neglected although it was obvious that it existed for years, if not for generations, and which was unnoticed by the Fianna Fáil Government until they lost those <Col N="256" /> five vital seats.  There is very little else that can be said with regard to this Bill, because there is nothing in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no plan behind it except part of the political approach of the Fianna Fáil Government to this problem.  If they get away with it, more power to them, but it is our responsibility and our duty to point out that it is a political approach.  As I have already said, it aims at desirable ends for Party purposes.  It is essential to make sure that any measures taken under this Bill or taken by the newly-appointed Office of the Parliamentary Secretary will not aggravate the problem already existing for statutory bodies such as the Electricity Supply Board or Bord na Móna.  During the previous Government's administration plans were provided for hydro-electric schemes on the Clady River in Donegal, for Clifden, in County Galway, and for Ballisodare, in Sligo.</P>

      <P>I hope that these plans will not be affected adversely by any appreciation in the value of land or of water rights in these areas due to the operations of this new board. There is a lot of concentration of effort on these congested areas at the moment.  So far, it is only verbal effort, but, if words can achieve anything, it is obvious that the present Government hope to avail of the fact that this Bill will have become an Act before any higher taxes are imposed by next year's Budget.  An estimate has been passed for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government's Office for the purpose of retrieving the five lost seats.  I do not want any Deputy on any side of the House to be under any illusion about the motives behind this Bill.  I observed with interest the serious countenances of the Fianna Fáil Deputies when the Tánaiste was introducing this Bill.  They all trooped into the House and said to themselves: &ldquo;This is a very important Bill, a Bill designed to help areas badly in need of economic assistance.&rdquo;  They all looked on with wonder and admiration at the Tánaiste's exposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>You have reminded me of something.  I noticed that the Minister said in introducing the Bill that the Government are not going to run industries anywhere.  Of course, they are not, because it would be a political disadvantage for the Government to step in and establish an industry, any industry; there would be a clamour from other districts and the Government has, therefore, entrusted this job to the new board&mdash;An Foras Tionscal.  Everybody knows that this Bill is a political Bill.  In so far as it is designed to do good, we will support it. We do not want anyone, least of all the Fianna Fáil Deputies, to think that they are getting away with some proposal that is going to build up the western part of the country, or these congested areas.  It is interesting to read Section 3, sub-section (1) (a) and (b).  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) This Act applies to each of the following areas:</P>
      <P>(a)  the congested areas,</P>
      <P>(b)  any other area to which, by Order of the Minister, the Act is for the time being declared to apply.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is obvious, therefore, that if political fortunes are going badly in any district they can just call it an undeveloped area and apply the Bill to it and all the pressure of the £2,000,000&mdash;the great scheme that was thought out after the general election&mdash;will apply to that area.  As far as we are concerned, we welcome the Bill.  We had taken some modest steps to help these congested areas.</P>

The verdict of the people on the measures which we took was reasonably satisfactory.  I only wish we could get the same concerted approach to assist those in other areas who have <Col N="258" /> not been relieved from the mounting cost of living by the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Opposition welcome any steps which may help these areas.  We are prepared to support this Bill and to amend it in any way which we think might be beneficial. In listening to the Tánaiste saying: &ldquo;This Act shall continue in operation until the 31st day of December, 1958,&rdquo; I felt that it should have been amended to read &ldquo;this Act shall continue in operation until after the next general election.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse the reception which Deputy Cosgrave has given to this Bill.  It is a Bill which I am sure every section of the House will welcome.  While probably most of us on this side of the House&mdash;indeed I think I might include all Deputies&mdash;realise that the motives for the introduction of the Bill are political, nevertheless, in so far as the Bill may be utilised for good purposes, we welcome it.  I am disappointed, frankly, that it did not go further, a good deal further.  I had hoped, when I heard that the promotion of this Bill had been handed over to the Department of Industry and Commerce, that it would have gone a good deal further than the proposal outlined seems to indicate.  Even at this stage, I should like to urge on the Government the advisability of extending the scope of the Bill somewhat.</P>
      <P>The main difficulty&mdash;it is a difficulty which the Tánaiste has outlined in his introduction of the Bill&mdash;with industrial development here is largely lack of self-confidence, lack of tradition, lack of experience in industrial development, coupled, of course, with under-investment in the country itself.  That lack of industrial initiative and industrial tradition is probably more pronounced in the western regions than in the eastern regions and much more pronounced in country districts than in the cities.  Frankly, I think, if we are to promote industrial development on any large scale in areas west of the Shannon and in Kerry, that we shall have to take the actual direct initiative in the promotion of industrial development to a greater extent than is contemplated by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> It appears to me that there are a number of steps that arise in the creation of new industries in the country.  First of all, it is necessary to determine what are the industries which can, and should, be developed. The first step would be a thorough survey to ascertain the exact industries upon which we should concentrate our energies.  In some cases, it is a question of developing or extending existing industries in order to fulfil the requirements of the home market.  In other cases it is the creation of a brand new industry, but the first requirement is to determine exactly what is the industrial development at which we should aim.  I think that should not be left to be done in a haphazard way or left to local initiative on its own.  I am sure many Deputies have had the experience for the last ten years or so of efforts which have been made in different towns throughout the country, usually through local development associations, to create industries. My experience has been that these local bodies were inspired by very good motives but usually they travelled along the same track in each town in the country.  One had the experience, for instance, of proposals coming forward from many of these associations for the manufacture of concrete drain pipes.  I am sure every Deputy has had the experience of being approached by some of his constituents who thought that now was the time to erect a factory for the manufacture of drain pipes.</P>
    <P>I think we should, first of all, face up to the problem of determining exactly the type of new industries which could and should be created, and secondly, of determining the industries which should be expanded.  Having determined your over-all industrial development, the next problem that arises is the question of the location of the industries.  In determining the question of the location of industries, I think that we should look at the social problem as well as the economic one, in the way in which the Government, apparently, and the Tánaiste consider it necessary.  I think we are all agreed that we must aim at decentralisation, and we must concentrate <Col N="260" /> our efforts particularly on the underdeveloped areas of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the board set up under this Bill will either have the power or the equipment necessary to enable it to determine these two first basic issues, namely, the industries which should be created and the location of the industries, having regard to the economic requirements on the one hand and the social requirements on the other.  That is a task which can be performed only by the Government with the help of teams of experts on various industrial questions.</P>
    <P>As I understand the proposal outlined by the Tánaiste, it will not be the function of this board to initiate the creation of any new industry.  The initiative will have to be taken by local people or industrialists from outside areas.  The proposals will have to be initiated entirely by private people, without regard to the over-all economic position of the country.  In that way we may arrive at somewhat the same position at which we arrived in the case of some other industries; we shall have too many industries of the same type, while in other industries we shall fall very far short of supplying the demand for our home market.</P>
    <P>Having determined the industries which should be created, and the location of the industries, the next step, in my view, is the creation of the industry itself.  There again we lack the degree of industrial experience and industrial &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; necessary to leave it entirely to private enterprise. I think that again the Government and the board&mdash;it is a task which the board may well discharge&mdash;should undertake the actual erection and equipment of factories and provide the necessary technical advisers for the launching of the industry.  Having done that, the fourth stage is reached where the industry, once created, can be sold, leased, or sold on hire-purchase terms, to local interests in some cases, or to local co-operatives formed for the purpose of acquiring the industry.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Tánaiste the possibility of extending the scope of the Bill to enable this to be done.  I do not know how far the industrial survey undertaken <Col N="261" /> by E.C.A. in conjunction with the Government may serve as a general background for the more detailed industrial survey which I think is necessary before undertaking the creation of new industries in the country.  Certainly, it is a matter that could be examined.</P>
    <P>I also urge the Tánaiste to consider the widening of the scope of the Bill to include assistance for the expansion of existing industries.  Otherwise, you may have a very anomalous position if financial assistance is made available only for the creation of a new industry and not for the expansion of an existing industry.  You may have a position where an existing concern may find it more profitable to close down completely and then go to the Government and say: &ldquo;Now we want to start a new industry,&rdquo; and apply for money.  A very slight amendment of the Bill would enable the Bill to apply to applications for assistance in the expansion of an existing industry.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste emphasised the difficulties which attend the industrial development of the West on account of freight difficulties and transport charges.  I had hoped that he would have taken the bold step of embodying proposals in the Bill which would provide for a flat rate of transport in respect of all goods manufactured in Ireland, irrespective of where they were manufactured.  The Bill, in effect, adopts that principle to a certain degree of relation to the supply of electric current for power. It might be well to consider the application of that principle to the question of transport charges.  I think we can make up our minds to the fact that transport has become a public service and is hardly ever likely to be completely self-supporting.  It is as much a public service as the supply of water, gas or electricity and it is a social service as well as a public service.  If we mean to develop the West we must, undoubtedly, try to provide cheap transport charges which will at least put the West on the same footing as the rest of the country in regard to development.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the determining factor in deciding the areas of <Col N="262" /> application of the Bill is a political one or not.  Be that as it may, it occurs to me that this Bill should have included County Cavan&mdash;certainly the west half of County Cavan, where economic conditions are worse than in many of the areas that are specifically included in the Bill.  I know that, once you start discussing particular areas, certain political difficulties arise in the House.  However, if the Tánaiste looks into it he will find that the economic conditions of County Cavan are, in many respects, worse than the economic conditions in many of the areas which are included in the Bill.  The decline in the population of County Cavan is 8.2 per cent. as against, for instance, the 1.8 per cent. in County Galway or 4.2 per cent. in Donegal or 6.5 per cent. in Roscommon.  The percentage of persons in receipt of home assistance in County Cavan is 2.35 as again 1.11 in County Leitrim.  If the Tánaiste examines the economic indices in respect of County Cavan he will find that, generally speaking, they compare unfavourably with those in many of the areas included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another county that I think should be included in the Bill&mdash;and I hope this suggestion will be objectively received by the Government.  So far, in this House, we have studiously avoided considering legislation in the light of the partition of the country. One of the serious problems in relation to Partition is that in certain areas of the Six Counties the Nationalist population has been dwindling through the pressure of economic circumstances. That economic pressure has been, I think, fairly deliberately induced by the central and local authorities there and also, in many cases, by the employers. One of the counties which has suffered most from this political and religious discrimination is County Fermanagh. There, the Catholic and Nationalist population has been dwindling steadily as a result of deliberate economic discrimination on the part of employers and on the part of local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is reckoned that in another period of years the Nationalist majority in County Fermanagh will have disappeared as a result of emigration. <Col N="263" /> Indeed, recently, in a statement which was published in the Press, which was made by the Registrar General in the Six County area, it was pointed out that, though the over-all Catholic population had increased, the increase was much lower than the real increase, because of emigration from the area. The Nationalist population in County Fermanagh has been falling year after year.  It is seldom that any piece of legislation passed by this House is capable of application without much difficulty to the rest of Ireland.  This Bill is capable of application to County Fermanagh, and I think that if this were done this Bill would give tremendous heart to the Nationalist population of the Six Counties.  We would be doing something constructive by enabling this Bill to apply to County Fermanagh, by enabling the development of industries in County Fermanagh, particularly in those areas where there is acute discrimination; thus the Nationalist population of Fermanagh would be able to secure employment instead of being driven out systematically as they have been over the last thirty years.</P>
    <P>I am not making this proposal in any Party sense.  I hope that the Tánaiste will consider this matter, and bring it before the Government, and that the Government may of its own initiative include County Fermanagh in the section of the Bill which defines the area of application, Section 3.  It is a simple matter.  There are no difficulties, no concrete difficulties, that prevent the application of this Bill to County Fermanagh.  It is possible that there are other areas, say in County Tyrone, which are also in the same position, but I think that as a first step the application of this Bill to County Fermanagh would be of real value to the Nationalist population there.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I want to refer, in very general terms at this stage.  We will have an opportunity of discussing it in more detail during the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It is the provision contained in the Bill in regard to the presentation of accounts and reports from this new body to the Dáil.  Two million <Col N="264" /> pounds is a vast amount of money to entrust to the absolute discretion of a board consisting of three people. We have had many complaints in the past as to the utilisation of Government power for political purposes.  I think it is very essential that any expenditure under this Bill should be above suspicion and that, therefore, the Bill should include provisions for a full disclosure to this House of the moneys expended by the new board. There may be some good arguments against doing that, but this House and the country generally is entitled to know how this £2,000,000 has been spent or is being spent, year after year. At least, the list of the payments made to firms in receipt of grants under the Bill should be published, either quarterly, half-yearly or yearly&mdash; preferably quarterly&mdash;so that there would be a feeling that the whole administration of the Bill was above suspicion.  If these very substantial sums of money are spent and there is no indication as to how the money is spent, there is bound to be a certain amount of suspicion.</P>
    <P>I know that, under the provisions in the Bill, the Minister for Finance may direct the type of account which should be produced by the board.  I do not think that is quite enough.  The Bill itself should provide for the return that should be made of the expenditure under it.  I say this in the light of recent experiences I have had in this House as regards the accounts of the Central Bank.  The same provisions are contained, I think, in the Central Bank Act, which enable the Minister for Finance to prescribe the form of accounts which should be presented. Under the orders made by the Minister, all the expenditure of the Central Bank is lumped under the heading &ldquo;Other Expenditure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, if the Bill as it stands at the moment is passed, we may be told in one, two or five years' time by a Minister for Finance&mdash;not necessarily the present one&mdash;that it is quite sufficient for the board to present an account showing they spent £1,000,000 under the heading of &ldquo;Other Expenditure.&rdquo;  Therefore, the Minister would be wise to take steps to ensure that the actual grants of <Col N="265" /> moneys should be published or laid on the Table of this House at quarterly intervals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I am restricting myself unduly in the contribution, short as it is going to be, that I am about to make in regard to this particular Bill.  I am going to display a certain amount of will power. Deputy Cosgrave has referred to this Bill as having some political implications. Obviously, it has&mdash;every Bill has&mdash;and I think that is an indication of the success that is expected to attend the particular Bill, that it will have considerable ramifications and success in the particular areas referred to in it.  The very fact that it has a political motive does not detract in any way from the good of the Bill. Very few Governments nowadays introduce a measure&mdash;consciously, at any rate&mdash;that is going to do them harm.  They look at a Bill to see if it is good for a part of the country and say: &ldquo;Obviously, if it is, it is going to be good for us.&rdquo;  Every Government looks at it in that way.  I am quite sure the last Government did not overlook those considerations.</P>
      <P>What is important is that, within a period of six months of taking office, the Tánaiste has produced a Bill which obviously will do much good in these particular undeveloped areas.  I think the extent of the contemplated success of the Bill may be gauged from the reference which has been made to the Bill's application to Fermanagh, because if the Bill would have these very desirable advantages mentioned in that county, it should also have them in Leitrim and Donegal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>And Roscommon. That is an important aspect to consider. I know that Deputy Cosgrave has criticised the Bill in what I might term a gentlemanly way.  He knows that he would have wished to have been in a position to introduce a measure such as this at any time during the past three years, and, from his experience in the Department, he knows the amount of work that must have gone into the preparation of the <Col N="266" /> Bill so that we are enabled to discuss the Second Reading within a period of six months from the change of Government. I thoroughly agree with Deputy Cosgrave that there has been overlapping and confusion, a lack of a defined plan and of a cohesive programme for the Gaeltacht in the past 29 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>Since Cromwell sent a big number of the people of this country to hell or to Connaught, there has been a problem and the old Congested Districts Board did good work for these areas.  I had no practical experience of their work, but from reading about it and from speaking to people interested in the work, I know that there has been a general feeling that a serious and grievous mistake was made in abolishing in 1923 or 1924&mdash;I do not know which year&mdash;the Congested Districts Board.  The new idea is to bring about a co-ordination of effort under the Parliamentary Secretary, so that the Congested Districts Board will be recreated, with this difference, that the pressure will come from the people of Ireland through their representatives to ensure that everything that can be done will be done for those areas.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that a starting sum of £2,000,000 is available. Everybody knows that that is a figure in the Bill which may from time to time, and, I hope, frequently, be increased. It does provide for the construction of factory premises, for the provision of power, for the training of staffs, and for the remission of local rates.  Obviously, these facilities will encourage Irish industrialists, whether people living in this part of the country or people living in the particular areas referred to, who desire to establish industries to get industries going within the congested or undeveloped areas.  If those industries are started there and brought to success there, it will lead to considerable employment, not only directly but indirectly, in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to criticise a Bill and to say it does not go far enough.  That is a typical form of criticism by people who would never think of bringing in such a Bill&mdash;&ldquo;You brought this in but you do not go far enough.  You do not include enough counties.  You <Col N="267" /> should not start new industries alone, but should help industries that are not in such a good condition at the moment.&rdquo;  It is always very easy to say: &ldquo;You do not go far enough,&rdquo; but when what is in the Bill is put into practice, it may be that, with the experience we shall have, we may be disposed and anxious to go somewhat further.  The Bill does provide for private enterprise, for voluntary effort, and at this stage of our development, it is better to endeavour to do it that way for a start.</P>
    <P>I think that is the better way.  It certainly will not be subject to the same political criticism as the other system of deciding to found an industry and to plant it in a particular place.  If you do that, all kinds of political suggestions as to your motives will be made, but if under this Bill local people take the initiative in contacting experienced people in the eastern, southern or northern part of the country, and invite them to come in and get an industry going, that is a form of local effort which, at the present juncture, is to be commended, and I certainly would be anxious to see it getting a start.</P>
    <P>I have often thought that there was a particular industry which perhaps could be started down in the Gaeltacht.  We have the tomato industry.  It is not developed as far as it might be, but what I think is necessary in that connection is a further industry whereby these tomatoes will be canned or bottled, whereby they will be converted into sauces and chutneys.  I think we could supply the whole home market and have a substantial export in these commodities from the Gaeltacht areas alone.  Similarly, in regard to fish, kelp and seaweed&mdash;industries based on these commodities could be started.</P>
    <P>There is another industry for which the people in the Gaeltacht areas have training over generations.  I have seen it condemned.  I have seen it being obliterated.  I refer to the poteen industry.</P>

      <P>This is only a suggestion of mine.  It is one which will not be acted upon for quite a long <Col N="269" /> while, I am sure.  Where the people in these areas have a talent or a particular capacity, that talent or particular capacity ought to be encouraged.</P>
      <P>In addition to the board that is to be set up under this Bill, it would be a good idea if the Minister's Department would consider the question of the industries that might be started and give such encouragement as it could to industrialists and to local people to get some particular industry going.  I gathered from what the Minister said that, while this board is an administrative board concerned mainly with the proper application of the funds placed at its disposal by this House, the services and expert knowledge of the Department will be available to all persons willing and anxious to start industries anywhere, whether it be within these particular areas or not.  In that way, if this £2,000,000 is spent within a reasonably quick time &mdash;I would like to see it spent well before the end of seven years&mdash;it will mean the creation of new effort and new work over that particular area.  We have always felt it an obligation upon us to do everything possible to raise the standard of life in the undeveloped areas.  I am anxious to see that done. I believe this Bill is a very important step in that direction.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the Bill my wholehearted support, and to congratulate the Tánaiste for bringing it to this stage in such a short time after his election to his present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how anxious we may be to give the fullest possible co-operation in regard to this Bill, there are points in it which, to say the very least, require clarification. Deputy Cowan said that there was great credit due to the Tánaiste and to the Government for having introduced the Bill in such a short period.  In that respect, I should like to say that it was too hurriedly prepared, because in it we can see so many contradictory points of view expressed.  No matter how we may wish to see such an important measure as this introduced&mdash;a measure which promises help for industries in the West of Ireland and in what are termed the &ldquo;congested areas&rdquo;&mdash;we <Col N="270" /> cannot overlook those facts.  If we are to approach this matter in a true sense of genuine active co-operation, then we will have to be honest and say&mdash;leaving aside all political aspects &mdash;this Bill is not in any sense really satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste made one interesting statement during his introductory speech on the Second Stage.  He stated&mdash;I took a note of it&mdash;that it would be likely the proposed industries in other areas may be switched to congested areas.  That, in itself, leaves the field wide open for many suggestions. While it might be more preferable if we could discuss this Bill in a non-political way, we must admit that, if we are to be genuine, criticism must be offered in a constructive manner.  Why, first of all, even suggest the transfer of proposed industries from areas already without industries to congested areas?  If the Bill is to benefit congested areas, surely it ought not to be introduced with a view to being detrimental at the same time to other areas which are at the present time trying to secure industries?  That is one point.</P>
      <P>I am sure members of this House and the members of all Parties must realise and admit that, while we are duty bound to do all we possibly can for the Gaeltacht, we are also duty bound to have regard for the people in the Midlands, the North, South, East and in that part of the West which may not be classified as a congested area.</P>
      <P>When introducing this measure, the Tánaiste more or less gave us the impression that the definition &ldquo;congested areas&rdquo; might have a wide scope.  He made one remark to which, I believe, it is worth drawing attention. He stated&mdash;I do not wish to misquote him or anything like that&mdash;something to the effect that he would wish other undeveloped areas not to press unduly for a definition of &ldquo;congested areas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If up and doing industrialists or business people anywhere outside the western seaboard area question the meaning of &ldquo;congested districts&rdquo; they are told by the Minister that it is not advisable for them to question that definition unduly.  Deputy Cowan mentioned about £2,000,000 and that is <Col N="271" /> mentioned in the Bill.  If we are to divide £2,000,000 or even much more we must do so in a genuinely serious manner that will not be detrimental to any section or any part of the country. We have, unfortunately, a Border at the present time between North and South; we have a border between plenty and poverty, and we do not want to create another artificial border by telling the people on one side of a line that they are not living in a congested district and telling the people on the other side that they are.</P>
    <P>Information in many other respects is not given in the Bill or even in the Minister's introduction.  For instance, he stated that the £2,000,000 was not allocated to anywhere.  I do not wish to misrepresent him, and we all know naturally that he meant that it was not allocated to any particular area.  I appreciate that, but as this Bill is so loosely drafted, is there a danger that, finally, that £2,000,000 will not be allocated to anywhere?  The Minister has bound up this question with private enterprise and he has the backing, rightly or wrongly, of Deputy Cowan. Do we not all know the failure we have met with in areas which we can truly say are congested districts?  I am speaking of South Cork now as well as of the West of Ireland, because there is much so-called congestion in this area and poverty because (a) we had not sufficient local capital or (b) sufficient people would not invest their capital locally because they found it more suitable to put their money in foreign or other industries.  They did not find it suitable to invest in local industries.  The Minister with all his experience appreciates that fact.  I can say, as every Deputy in the House can say, that in any town in my area I could get an industry going in the morning.  We would have no trouble if first of all we could get local capital and if the local industrialist investing his money were sure that the material placed by him on the market would have a ready sale.</P>
    <P>On that point we come to another difficulty.  Have the Tánaiste and his officials in preparing the Bill considered the form of economy which prevailed <Col N="272" /> in this country many years ago? We were told of course and are told that the modernisation of the plant and machinery in our factories is essential. We believe it is.  But yet there were many small industries in our countryside in years gone by, even before the time when men on both sides of the House were of age to take the part which many of them did in securing independence for the country.  These small local industries catered perhaps for a restricted market in a restricted area, but they were assured from their local knowledge that the produce they were placing on the market would have a ready sale.  There is no use, of course, in going into the matter too deeply. We know that foreign competition and strangulation killed that type of small industry in rural Ireland but in their time these industries definitely gave employment to many people in those areas when the population was much higher than it is now.  We cannot operate this Bill in that fashion because the Minister has given us no clear indication that the industries started in these areas will have in any true sense protection not just from foreign competition but from the competition of highly developed centres such as Dublin and Cork City.  If places on the western seaboard or South Cork, places like Kinsale and Passage, are to come in for industries they will be at a certain disadvantage compared with industries which have been in existence for many years past and which have brought their system of production up to a very, very high level and which have transport available to them.</P>
    <P>I presume that these industries have related these problems to the prices they charge.  I believe that many of them have probably reduced to the minimum their costs with regard to transport and many overhead charges. Will new industries started under this Bill be safeguarded by any form of protection?  The Minister has stated that these industries are to be operated by private enterprise, but will industrialists start factories along the coast of Kerry and West Cork simply because they may get a slice of that £2,000,000?  They will have to operate in a market which has been developed and cultivated for many years by <Col N="273" /> industrialists whose factories are situated in the large centres.  We are handicapped there and in all fairness the Minister should give us some indication of where we stand in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a board but he also made another important statement when he said that if this new board were set up they could if they so decided allocate part of these funds not merely to one industry in an individual town but even to two industries in the same town.  The board would naturally take into consideration the type of industry to be operated, but considering the number of industries catering at the present time for the home market and also considering the fact that many of the articles which we import could not readily be manufactured here because of the prohibitive price of importing the raw materials, I believe that at this stage of our industrial development the industries with the best possibility of a good sale for their produce have already been snapped up by would-be industrialists.</P>
    <P>It is no use for members of any Party to think that this will be the means of raising industries like mushrooms all over the west or south coast. I do not know and I do not mind if the Tánaiste has any political ideas about this Bill.  I have no political interest in either praising or criticising the Bill.  I have before my mind the plain fact that even in a constituency of South Cork there are towns which are excluded from this Bill.  The Tánaiste stated that such places are not finally excluded but at the same time he stated that people outside the so-called congested areas are not to press unduly for a definition of the phrase &ldquo;congested district&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Industries could be started in those centres at present but unfortunately our Irish industrialists never found it suitable to extend their activities to such places.  I suppose they are entitled as individuals to decide that they will operate their industry in a centre from which they can operate most profitably, where materials, labour, light and power are available.  If that is so, what hope has the Tánaiste that he will get an individual or group of individuals <Col N="274" /> to form an industry in the areas named in this Bill unless they are assured that the product of their industry will have a ready sale?  Is that product going to compete against the same type of product manufactured in other centres or is it intended to confine the sale of the product to a provincial area, as some of the products of olden times were confined?  While that might be the ideal solution, it might not be practicable under our present system of commerce.  The present system of commerce has proved to be chaotic except in one or two large centres.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the best way would be for the Minister to form a board, to give them greater powers and greater financial backing, and to offer industrialists a certain amount of co-operation if they were prepared to go into the undeveloped areas and establish factories even on a smaller scale.</P>
    <P>We have the responsibility to do something for the people in these areas.  We cannot let the people of the Gaeltacht or the people in the areas that are so loosely defined be the playthings of politicians or industrialists. At times it is difficult to know whether it is the industrialist or the politician who is the biggest rogue. The people cannot be left at the mercy of one or the other.  The politician, perhaps, in an effort to save himself from political oblivion, will play the game of offering a factory to one town as against another, and the industrialist will try as far as possible to prevent foreigners from coming in to open up trade.  Indeed, some of the industrialists in the South are most anxious that the Border may continue much longer, so as to exclude competition from Northern industrialists. That does not apply to all the industrialists in the South, but it certainly applies to some of them.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not offer a true sense of protection to those who need protection most.  The purpose of the Bill should be, not merely to establish an industry, but to establish an industry which the industrialist will know has at least a fifty-fifty chance of succeeding, and which will not exist merely as a small workshop, to be operated in <Col N="275" /> a careless and gay fashion for the purpose of showing, no matter what Government may be in power, that we have so many industries in so many places.  It is essential to get away from that idea.  We must try to develop industries in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Has the Tánaiste taken into account the possibility of working this scheme through co-operatives in the various centres?  Organisations such as Muintir na Tíre are in their own way trying to do certain things for the improvement of rural Ireland.  Would it not be advisable for the Tánaiste to have discussions between the members of this board on the one hand and co-operative societies on the other?  I do not mean some of the existing co-operative societies.  Let a group of individuals in areas surrounding a particular centre group together for the purpose of establishing an industry which will have the backing, not merely of one individual or a group of individuals, but of the whole countryside. The Tánaiste should know better <Col N="276" /> than anyone that, at present, we have not the backing of the persons who could help us financially to start an industry.  Members of all Parties know that we have all done our utmost to encourage local people to throw in their weight to help local industries. I do not know whether or not the Irish people have come to realise that £.s.d. is everything in this life.  That is the 1951 materialism.  Some of us who have not been long enough in this House expect a lead from those who have been in this House for years, from the men who played their part in the struggle for political freedom. The slogan at that time was Sinn Féin Amháin.  There was enshrined in that slogan a true sense of economic freedom as well as political freedom. We must do our utmost to have the idea of Sinn Féin Amháin fulfilled.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 5th December.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of each month in 1950 and 1951 the amount in volume of each type of artificial fertiliser imported differentiating between imports by Government Department and the Irish Sugar Company on the one hand and private firms on the other, and giving the country of origin in each case.</P>

      <P>No import of artificial fertiliser was made by a Government Department in the period in question.  Since it is not the practice of the Central Statistics Office to disclose particulars relating to the business of an individual firm, the only relevant information available relates to the total import of artificial fertilisers in each month of the years 1950 and 1951 to date.  This is given in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if a survey of householders in the Ferbane, Clara and Ballycumber area was carried out in the spring of 1951 for rural electrification; and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the Ballycumber area was considered for selection in October, 1951, but the result of the canvass was not good and the financial return was insufficient to justify selection.</P>

      <P>Ó 4ú Lúnasa, 1951, tá an tseirbhís sheachtainiúil gháltain idir Ghaillimh agus Oileáin Árann a hoibriú ag Córas Iompair Éireann mar chuid den chóras iompair náisiúnta. Chuir Córas Iompair Éireann iniúil dom go bhfuil an <i>Dún Aengus,</i> an bád doibríodh an tseirbhís de ghnáth, bainte den tseirbhís le haghaidh deisiúcháin agus go bhfuil bád is lú ná í curtha ina háit go sealadach. Seolann an bád sin trí huaire sa tseachtain idir na hOileáin agus Ros an Iuhíl.  Tá an scéal á bhreithniú féachaint an féidir feabhas a chur ar an tseirbhís, ach níl ar intinn faoi láthair aon bhuan-athrú a dhéanamh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the amount spent on construction work on the River Brosna from May, 1948, to October, 1951, and (b) the amount spent in each of the Counties of Offaly, Laoighis, Westmeath during the same period.</P>

      <P>The gross expenditure on construction works on the Brosna Catchment Drainage Scheme for the period May, 1948, to 31st October, 1951, was approximately £725,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> As regards the second part of the question, separate figures for the amount spent in each county are not available, as the accounts for arterial drainage schemes are recorded in relation to entire catchment areas.</P>
