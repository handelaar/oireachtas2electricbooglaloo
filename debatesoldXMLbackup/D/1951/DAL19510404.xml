      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy, actuarial costings and considerations were embodied in various memoranda forming part of the comprehensive consideration of the various aspects of the coverage provided for in the White Paper.  The main features of the actuarial costings so ascertained were embodied in Part V of that paper and provide all the essential information the Deputy can reasonably require in the matter.

No figures have been calculated for years later than the 20th year.  On the basis of the best figures available, including the operation of the existing schemes, it was estimated that the cost of administration would be in the region of 12½ per cent. of the benefit expenditure.  The estimated income from all sources was assumed to remain constant&mdash;see paragraphs 116 and 120 of the White Paper.

      <P>I have told the Deputy, and apparently I have to repeat it again, that it is stated clearly in the White Paper that we propose to review the position at the end of five years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the consent of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The cheap fuel scheme in the Dublin area is operated by the Dublin Board of Assistance and they are responsible for the provision and distribution of fuel under that scheme.  I understand that, due to transport and other difficulties during the recent inclement weather, supplies of turf to the Dublin depots have been irregular and that sufficient fuel was not available to meet all requirements.  Special arrangements have been made, however, to provide sufficient fuel in the depots to meet all current demands and also to supply the arrears of fuel to voucher holders who were unable to obtain fuel during recent weeks.  With regard to the latter part of Deputy Cowan's question, I am informed that efforts have been made by the Dublin Board of Assistance to establish depots in both Clontarf and Donnycarney, but it was found that the owners of suitable premises were not prepared to lease them for use as fuel depots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I take it from the Minister's reply that the hold-up in the delivery of fuel to those depots, which has caused great hardship to the unfortunate poor in the City of Dublin, has been satisfactorily adjusted, and that there will not be any similar hold-up in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that up to last Friday similar conditions existed in regard to the New Street fuel dump?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise that the arrangements for getting and transporting this turf rest in the hands of the Dublin Board of Assistance. That is the body primarily responsible.  I understand that the difficulties in the matter of procuring fuel were due to the appallingly inclement <Col N="10" /> weather and the soggy condition of the bog on which the turf was dumped.  These conditions were such that I understand it was impossible for the men even to attempt to load the turf, with the result that there was no turf delivered on these days.  I understand that the Dublin Board of Assistance have now made arrangements which will enable them to obtain turf and at the same time make good the turf not supplied during the period of scarcity. Again, I should like to emphasise that the responsibility lies with the Dublin Board of Assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any representations been made to the Minister by the Dublin Board of Assistance for the making available of more than one bog?  I understand the complaint was that they were drawing from one bog only and for that reason the difficulties were increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing everything possible to facilitate the Dublin Board of Assistance in the matter of procuring fuel.  In fact, we are allowing the Dublin Board of Assistance to draw first-class machine-won turf from a special dump where it is ricked at Timahoe bog.  The Dublin Board of Assistance will get every possible assistance both from my Department and from Bord na Móna.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>I think it desirable first to quote for the Deputy's information from the Rules and Regulations for National Schools the official position concerning this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> Rule 92 (2) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whilst teachers are permitted to be members of county councils or other statutory local bodies, it is to be understood that they shall not absent themselves from their schools during school hours or interrupt their school duties for the purpose of attending meetings or transacting other business arising out of their membership of such bodies, except as provided in section 3 of this rule.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 3 of rule 92 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Teachers who are members of school attendance committees under the School Attendance Act, 1926, or of scholarship committees, vocational education committees, library committees or school medical service committees established under county, borough or urban councils may be absent from school during a school day, in whole or in part, with the permission of the manager, in attendance at a meeting of such committee.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Arrangements, however, should be made to ensure that, as a rule, a school will not be closed to enable a teacher to attend such meetings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 4 of Rule 92 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Payment of salary may be allowed to a teacher for absence from school under the conditions specified in rule 92 (3) provided that he has not been absent from school on more than six occasions for such cause during a calendar year and that the Minister is satisfied that his absences were reasonable and necessary.  This limitation does not apply in respect of attendance at meetings of school attendance committees under the School Attendance Act, 1926.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are quotations from the regulations.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from this that the rules as they stand allow in general reasonable facilities to teachers who are members of committees whose work has a direct educational connection, and I am satisfied that it would not be in the interests of the pupils of the schools that there should be any departure in principle from the present position.</P>

    <P>I should like to make it clear that <Col N="15" /> as Minister for Education my powers in the matter of securing the safety of school children outside the school are limited.  I am, however, prepared to co-operate to the fullest possible extent within my powers with the association and the various authorities concerned to secure the safety of school children in coming to and leaving schools.  Following the discussion of the 23rd March, 1949, I arranged that a representative of the Department would act on the Schools Committee of the Safety First Association.</P>

      <P>Of the expenditure initiated since February, 1948, on the short-wave broadcasting station the amount that has been spent is £2,054. The transmitter, with the associated equipment, has been completed, but I am not so far in a position to make a statement about giving regular broadcasts.</P>
      <P>I think, however, I should tell the House that the general position about short-wave broadcasting has recently worsened very materially.  A conference held in Italy which was expected to complete a plan of allocation of wavelengths to stations failed to produce a plan.  In normal conditions it appears that agreement on a plan would have been difficult as the demands for wavelengths far exceeded the supply, but the strained international situation put an end to any hope of an agreed plan.  It is also the case that relatively very few receiving sets in the United States of America are equipped with facilities for short-wave reception.  These matters will have to be taken carefully into account in deciding whether there should be regular transmissions from this station. The whole position is under review between my Department and the Department of External Affairs.</P>

      <P>There is no restriction on the export of store cattle from this country to Northern Ireland and the introduction of any such restriction is not contemplated. The cattle traffic at the Port <Col N="21" /> of Dublin and other Irish ports is highly satisfactory and will, it is hoped, materially expand, but I have no doubt the Deputy will agree with me that, unless the anarchical conditions amongst port workers which have disgraced the Port of Dublin in recent years in connection with the cattle export trade are firmly controlled and put an end to by the appropriate trades union authorities, it is impossible to ignore the inevitable effect on employment at the Port of Dublin consequent on the growing reluctance of foreign shipping lines to use the Port of Dublin for the purpose of live-stock shipping.</P>

I am anxious to see that the Port of Dublin gets its full share of that growing traffic and nothing can prevent the Port of Dublin from getting its full share of that growing traffic, unless the masters of foreign vessels are dissuaded from using the Port of Dublin, and that is a contingency that has to be reckoned with, unless there is a material departure from the conduct that has characterised the port in the past.</P>

      <P>The average price paid by creameries for milk supplies received in 1950 cannot be accurately given until the annual audits of creamery accounts have been carried out.  Preliminary returns collected by my Department, however, indicate that (1) the average price paid for milk by creameries mainly engaged in butter production for the year 1950 was 14.97 pence per gallon, and (2) the average price paid for milk by creameries mainly engaged in chocolate crumb, evaporated milk and cheese production for the year 1950 was 15.68 pence per gallon.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered, however, that where milk is used for purposes other than butter-making, the skim milk is not returned to farmers but is purchased by the creamery.  The average price paid for skim milk in 1950 is estimated to have effected an increase of approximately 3d. per gallon in the price of whole milk for those farmers who did not get back their skim milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Bran and pollard are byproducts of the flour milling industry and their price is related to the price at which such offals are generally obtainable on world markets.</P>
      <P>Owing to the limited quantities of bran and pollard of domestic origin it was found impossible to distribute them equitably through the retail trade amongst farmers desirous of purchasing them, and it was accordingly decided to incorporate available supplies in white pollard, which is a mixture of bran, pollard and wheat feed, now available in unlimited quantities.</P>
      <P>It is intended to continue to supply bran at the same price for the convenience of those who require it for horses and calving cows during the spring and early summer.</P>

Married officers provided with public quarters were ineligible for the allowance.  Since the introduction, on the 1st April, 1950, of the new consolidated rates of pay for officers, the children's allowance is payable only to officers who were in receipt of it on the 31st March, 1950. Each such officer continues to receive it, for so long as he has four or more children within the ages mentioned, in respect of the fourth and each subsequent child who was born before the 1st April, 1950, or who became his stepchild before that date.</P>
    <P>Allowances for children (including step-children) are payable as portion of the marriage allowance for which N.C.O.s and privates are eligible on being admitted to the married establishment.

    <P>The normal conditions rendering a soldier eligible for admission to the married establishment are that he has reached the age of 22 years, has rendered two years' service in the Forces and has received the prior permission of his commanding officer to marry.  A soldier who has re-enlisted on a normal engagement and who has two years' service in the Forces, all or part of which was rendered during the emergency, is also eligible for admission to the married establishment, provided, however, that if he was unmarried at the date of re-enlistment, he has received the prior permission of his commanding officer to marry. Married men with two years' previous service in the Forces who are recruited under the current scheme of enlistment for three months' service in the Forces and subsequent service in the Reserve of Men&mdash;First Line, are eligible for <Col N="33" /> admission to the married establishment as from the date of enlistment.</P>
    <P>Marriage allowance is normally paid to the soldier's wife, but where the wife of a soldier on the married establishment dies or in the case of a widower soldier who would be eligible for admission to the married establishment if his wife were alive, the children's allowances may be paid to an approved guardian.</P>
    <P>There are various circumstances, prescribed in regulations, in which the children's allowances may be discontinued or be diverted from the mother to the soldier himself, a guardian or some other person.  I will not go into these, as I presume that the Deputy is interested only in the general conditions of eligibility.  If, however, he desires information about these circumstances, I shall be glad to furnish it.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the allowances for the current financial year is £860 in respect of officers' children and £131,900 in respect of the children of non-commissioned officers and privates.</P>

      <Col N="35" /> Rations at an approximate present cost of 2/6 a day are ordinarily issued to soldiers.  An allowance in lieu of rations at the rate of 2/9 per diem is, however, payable to a non-commissioned officer or private on the married establishment not provided with married quarters.  This allowance is also payable to a non-commissioned officer or private on leave and to a non-commissioned officer or private to whom in exceptional circumstances rations in kind cannot be issued.  The cash value of rations (2/6 per diem) is payable to a married non-commissioned officer or private, whether on the married establishment or not, who at his own request is removed from the ration strength.</P>
    <P>The assessed cost of accommodation, clothing, medical treatment and private travelling facilities provided free of charge for soldiers of the forces is approximately 18/2 per week.</P>
    <P>The prescribed allotments from the pay of married non-commissioned officers and privates on the married establishment and the allowances in respect of the wife and/or children are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister not see&mdash;I am sure he does <Col N="37" /> see&mdash;the advisability of placing this information in a concise clear way before applicants for pensions who have to go before the board?  Does he not see the necessity of setting out the conditions in a clear concise way which applicants can understand?  Ordinary applicants for an I.R.A. pension have very little understanding of Acts of Parliament.  In view of the severity of past regulations, and the great disadvantages under which applicants have laboured, I should like if the Minister cannot see his way to give a more explicit assurance, to have an opportunity of raising the matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>(a) All vessels of the naval service, except the corvettes, are bunkered locally in Haulbowline or Cobh; (b) the corvettes are bunkered in Dublin as the necessary facilities are not available locally, and for this purpose advantage is taken of the vessels' normal patrol duties on the east coast; (c) it would not be practicable to differentiate between the quantity or cost of fuel oil used for bringing the corvettes to Dublin for bunkering and that used for patrol duties; the question of providing bunkering facilities for the vessels at Haulbowline is being considered at present, but at this stage it is not possible to say when these facilities are likely to materialise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. P.D. Lehane Mr. P.D. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion, I was speaking to the amendment which I had tabled to this Bill.  That amendment asks that the opinion of the people in the country be obtained to it before the Bill becomes an Act.  I was very glad to note that the Minister, when introducing the Bill, announced that he was about to increase the means test and to increase the amount of old age pensions.  I think that if this amendment of mine and the amendment of Deputy Flynn have done nothing else, they have, at least, succeeded in getting the Government to agree to commit themselves to an increase in the old age pensions.</P>
      <P>This is the second Bill which the Minister has introduced, and it is well that the public should know that there is not one mention of old age pension increases in the Bill, even though it is the second and, I assume, the revised Bill which the Minister has introduced. On a number of occasions since an increase was given to old age pensioners in 1948, the Minister was questioned repeatedly in this House and asked to improve their lot, having regard to the cost of living, and on every occasion, I think, the Minister emphasised the increases that were granted to the old age pensioners.  He did that in reply to questions by Deputy Cowan, Deputy C. Lehane, Deputy McGrath and other Deputies. As late as last June, the Minister, speaking at column 1174, Volume 121, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Old age pensioners are to-day receiving in old age pensions nearly £2,000,000 more than they received in February, 1948.  I cannot, at this stage, hold out any hope of the introduction of further proposals to increase the pension rate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister I should add that he did say&mdash;I have not got <Col N="46" /> the quotation with me&mdash;that when the Social Welfare Bill was implemented, or was about to be implemented, possibly something else could be done in that respect; but, even as late as the 14th or 15th February last, the Minister had not his mind made up about the old age pensioners.  I think it should be made quite clear to the people of the country that there is not one sentence, or one reference, to increased pensions for old age pensioners in this Bill, or one affecting blind pensioners or affecting the means test in any degree whatsoever, and that anybody who likes to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill will not be in any way voting against the old age pensioners or the blind pensioners or the increase in the means test.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made several accusations in his statement and in the White Paper in regard to malingering. I should like the Minister, when replying, to give us some information as to what he means, and what the references in the White Paper are to this malingering.  In the White Paper, in paragraphs 72 and 73, the Minister said that it was to be feared that &ldquo;the degree of malingering would be even worse than it had been&rdquo;&mdash;in the case of married women and a lot of those enjoying the low rates of benefit.  In paragraph 56 of the White Paper, dealing with agricultural or private domestic workers and those on low wages, they cannot get the higher benefit because as the White Paper says &ldquo;it may be a dangerous incentive to malingering.&rdquo;  In paragraph 81 of the White Paper there are restrictive conditions attaching to retirement pensions &ldquo;in order to prevent abuse.&rdquo; In paragraph 53 of the White Paper, all independent workers are excluded because there would need to be too high a degree of inspection and supervision. I should like the Minister to explain these matters when he is replying.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 53 of the White Paper it is stated that safeguards must be established against the serious possibility of malingering in other cases. The Minister speaks also of contributions by employees.  I should like the Minister to explain how he can reconcile <Col N="47" /> this with the admissions in paragraph 135 of the White Paper that contributions are met in the final analysis by increased prices and increased taxation.  I should like the Minister to tell us if the employees will really pay their increased contributions and, if they do, whether they will agree to lower wages or whether their wages will be increased to cover the increased contribution and, further, whether their increased wages will be tagged on to transport charges and other service charges that the community as a whole will have to bear. It is obvious that even the poorest in the country will have to pay these increased benefits if they are transferred. Under the existing scheme, as I pointed out before, bank managers and company directors will all qualify for certain benefits.  However, the charges that will have to be borne to cover these extra benefits will not come from income-tax or from any small section of the higher paid groups because the greater bulk of the revenue comes from customs and excise and vehicle duties: it is about three times as much as we get from income-tax. I pointed out the last day I was speaking on this matter that while we are including these higher paid groups in the benefits of the scheme we are, at the same time, excluding those who are most in need of benefit, namely, the newsboys, the hucksters, the small farmers and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the extra 1/7 which the employee will have to pay will not be a very serious imposition.  But if the Minister really believes that, why does he not consider having a scheme that will be a vocational scheme, a scheme that the State can step outside of, a scheme that will enable the employers and employees or outside insurance companies to manage in such a way as would completely divorce it from State interference and the expenditure that any State-controlled scheme must inevitably incur.</P>
    <P>A number of people believe that the scheme as outlined by the Minister is a scheme which is designed solely in the interests of the urban sections of <Col N="48" /> the community.  Recently the Minister for Agriculture told us that the population of rural Ireland is increasing but as late as 20th December last, when the trend of employment figures was published, it was proved that there was a reduction of 11,235 in the number employed in rural areas in this country.  If this Bill will have the effect of putting urban employees in a more favourable category than rural employees, the flight from the land will increase to a considerably greater degree.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  I say that if this scheme is, as a number of people feel that it is, designed to look after the interests of urban employees rather than the interests of rural employees, it will have the effect of increasing the flight from the land.</P>
      <P>In section 66 of the Bill the Minister has made certain provision whereby farmers may come under the scheme subject to their paying a contribution and subject to the payment by the co-operative society to which they belong of an equal contribution. If the co-operative society to which they belong pays an equal contribution, that amounts to the farmers paying a double contribution he gets less benefit than his counterpart in the city or town who pays one contribution. Will the Minister make it clear that the farmer will be eligible for the same benefits as are enjoyed by the urban worker, even after he pays double the premium?</P>
      <P>The Minister also announced that this is the first of many such Bills. Before going any further along that road, will the Minister tell us what his aims really are and what he visualises the future commitments of the State to be in respect of the Bills which he visualises, as forecast in that statement?  On the last occasion.  I pointed out that a number of bodies&mdash; professional bodies, bodies of workers, salaried classes, employees of Guinness', and so forth&mdash;do not want this Bill.</P>

      <P>I promised Deputy Hickey that I would give the reference in relation to the workers' council.  I was wrong when I referred to the &ldquo;workers' council&rdquo;: I should have said, &ldquo;council of workers.&rdquo;  I apologise to Deputy Hickey.  I was under a misapprehension.  However, the Bank Officials' Association, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, the Electricity Supply Board, Guinness' employees, the Insurance Association and other bodies have already expressed their opposition to this measure.  They do not want it.  I appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment which seeks to let the people say whether they want this scheme or not.  If it is a good thing for the people I am perfectly satisfied that the people will say: &ldquo;Yes, give it to us.&rdquo;  If it is bad for the country I have great faith that the people of this country will let us know whether it is good or bad.  I am satisfied that Deputies on both sides of the House have not any mandate to put this into operation at the moment.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment which is put forward in all sincerity because I think that there is a very considerable volume of opinion in the country against the Bill.  A number of people think that it will do harm to the country and to the people whom it is intended to help.  I would appeal, therefore, to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>In order to regularise the position, I should point out that there are three amendments. I assume that Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment will be seconded.

I am not asking for a seconder now, the discussion can go on, but they must be seconded before they can be formally put to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not move my amendment, but I wish to discuss one or two points.  I am not moving it because the Minister gave an assurance <Col N="50" /> that the old age pensions would be increased immediately.  I also appreciate the concession to Old I.R.A. veterans who receive special allowances and I am sure that the whole country will appreciate that. That is a strong point but I would ask the Minister to go further.  He has conceded that the special allowance will not be regarded as means when a man reaches 70, but I think that there should be no means test when a man applies for it.  As this affects the Department of Defence as well as the Department of Social Welfare, I would ask the Minister to co-operate with the Minister for Defence in order to bring that about. Men in urgent need apply for the special allowance and, although the medical officer certifies that they are incapable of work, they are deprived of this allowance by a means test.  If necessary I will table an amendment on the Committee Stage to that effect.</P>
      <P>I am not at all pleased with the Minister's reply to my amendment about small farmers.  In Section 66 he has made an effort to meet the farmers if they come into co-operative societies or creamery societies and I would ask him to give small farmers the same concession as he has given under Section 6 to the lower-paid workers with less than £3 10s. 0d. a week.  I refer to small farmers in mountainous districts with a valuation of £4, £3 or even £2 who are dependent on the dole and on road work. In effect, that type of man is a worker, not a farmer in the real sense of the word and my amendment was specially drafted to cater for him.  We have thousands of them in the State and they are some of our best citizens. The Minister should treat them as a class as he has done with certain grades of trade unionists and workers. He has already made a class as he has put the lower-paid workers in a special grade so why not do the same with the small farmers?  They are certainly entitled to a concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Minister's policy &ldquo;no contribution, no benefit&rdquo; is wrong and should be amended.  While he has given a concession to Old I.R.A. men who are in receipt of allowances <Col N="51" /> care must be taken that what is given by one Department is not taken away by another.  Immediately an old age pension is granted to any of these men, the Department of Defence makes a corresponding reduction in the allowance thus nullifying its effect.  The Minister should consider that point when he says that the special allowance will not be regarded as means when the recipient reaches 70.  That will be nullified if the Department of Defence gives no corresponding concession.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give an assurance that on the Committee Stage he will do something to treat small farmers as a class and allow some concession to them.</P>
    <P>I claim, as Deputy Lehane has done, that these amendments have had the desired effect by exercising a certain pressure on the Minister to increase the old age pensions.  I am quite frank about it; I would have pressed my amendment if the Minister had not given those concessions to old age pensioners and to Old I.R.A. applicants for special allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan must, I think, be the special person selected by Fianna Fáil to champion lost causes.  When Deputy de Valera wanted to make agriculture the sport of his political ideas it was Deputy Dr. Ryan who had to carry the baby and later when Deputy MacEntee had insulted Dr. Dignan it was again Deputy Dr. Ryan who had to try to save the lost cause.  Over the years people, I think, had sympathy with Deputy Dr. Ryan in some of the difficult positions in which he was placed, and I think that everyone had sympathy with him in the impossible position in which he was placed by his colleagues and in which he placed himself when he rose to oppose this Bill on the 2nd March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years, we on this side of the House, have been taunted by Fianna Fáil, particularly by Deputy Lemass; they said it was ridiculous that this Bill had not been introduced long ago because when Deputy Dr. Ryan and the Fianna Fáil Party left office they left behind them a complete <Col N="52" /> scheme.  It must have been very galling for the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and for Deputy Lemass to find that when it came to producing a scheme to the public there was no scheme to produce.  What was put up by Deputy Dr. Ryan on the 2nd March is not a scheme; it is only a very minor amendment of the scheme put forward by the Government.  If Fianna Fáil had been truthful in saying they had left behind any plans, surely those plans would have seen the light of day when their spokesman, Deputy Dr. Ryan, was making the case against the Bill?  The truth of it is that there were no plans left behind and that what the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, had said was correct, namely, that his predecessor in that Ministry had not really got down to grips with the situation at all.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have the reverse effect from that which has just been expounded by Deputy Lehane.  One of the reasons why there has always been some anxiety on the part of agricultural labourers to get into the cities or towns or into urban employment, has been the fact that they were not covered for unemployment benefit in agriculture.  This Bill remedies that situation and to that extent&mdash;and it is a very substantial extent&mdash;it will succeed in making the lights of the cities and towns not quite so attractive as heretofore.  It will to that extent minimise some of the benefits that the urban dweller has in preference to his colleague in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane must have completely misunderstood the position as it arises under Section 66.  As I read the Bill and the speeches by the Minister, I see no suggestion whatever that the contributions which will have to be paid by farmer members of a co-operative society will be for benefits that are less than those payable under the scheme in the full class of benefit incorporated in it.  I would ask the Minister to make that position abundantly clear when replying to the debate, as Deputy Lehane appears to have got himself into a misconception on that point.</P>
    <P>When this proposal came before the Dáil on the 2nd March we found that the primary thing done in the Bill is something agreed on by both sides of <Col N="53" /> the House as desirable, namely, the co-ordination of all the existing schemes of social benefits.  That has been put forward by many Parties for some considerable time.  Quite recently I had occasion to read a speech made by Mr. W.T. Cosgrave as Leader of the Fine Gael Party in 1937, in which he made it perfectly clear beyond question that the co-ordination of the schemes of social benefit was a thing that would have his support and the support of his Party and that it was a thing he believed would lead to easier, simpler and better administration.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dr. Ryan was speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil on 2nd March, he concurred in the view that the first principle this Bill achieves, the principle of co-ordination, is a good one and a desirable one.  So far as that aspect of the Bill is concerned, therefore, there is no difference of opinion on it.  Suggestions have been made in other places that it would have been desirable, when a scheme such as this was being produced, to have it arranged on vocational lines.  Theoretically, that may sound very attractive and desirable, but I cannot see how it would work out in practice.  In vocations you would not have sufficient numbers of people with sufficient time to put the practical working of the scheme into effect within the vocations. The only result of trying that would, I suggest, be that there would be bureaucracy under each vocation instead of, if you like, bureaucracy under the guidance and direction of this House.  That would be the inevitable result of any vocational scheme, as the people in the vocations who would be responsible for directing it would not have the time available to do it in a way that would mean real direction.  It would only mean handing over the work to executive nominees of theirs, and then it would at once fail to be vocational in its actual working, quite apart from the theoretical argument.  Furthermore, it would be impracticable at the present time, as there is not adequate vocational development in the country to ensure that anything at all comprehensive could be worked out.  One <Col N="54" /> must, therefore, from a practical point of view, discard what might otherwise be regarded as intriguing on theoretical lines, the question of developing a scheme for social benefits solely on a vocational basis.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that have taken place on this Bill&mdash;through the Press, at meetings and even here&mdash;the line has been taken of giving to the Bill a slant that is not in it.  I saw yesterday in one of the papers&mdash;I forget which&mdash; a letter saying the Bill would not be a success and giving as an example for its prospective failure the fact that the groundnuts scheme of the British Government in Africa had failed.  I find it rather hard to see the development of that type of argument, which has been used fairly extensively in one of the daily newspapers and in one of the evening newspapers.  In fact, all the objections that have been approached from that particular line are objections not to this Bill but to one which does not contain the provisions that are in this one&mdash;or, to be more strictly accurate, the objections are to conditions that are not here.  It would be, perhaps, desirable that we should realise what exactly this Bill does and that it is not a step which, as some people have suggested, is making us here an entirely welfare State.  It does not do anything of that sort.  It would be undesirable and unfair that the Bill should be criticised on the basis that it does bring us to a welfare State when in fact it does not.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to deal with six types of benefit.  After all, the disability benefit is an extension of and a better type of benefit than the existing national health insurance benefit. It is an extension of it and a desirable extension.  The unemployment benefit as I already said, is not merely an extension of the existing unemployment benefit for the cities, but an extension of it to the agricultural labourers in the rural areas.  The widows' and orphans' pension benefit is a benefit that is already there.  The maternity benefit and the death benefit are not such enormous steps of themselves that they will convert us overnight into a welfare State.  These two benefits are a new type of benefit; <Col N="55" /> the others are very desirable extensions and co-ordinations.  But these benefits, as I say, do not take us along the road which many people have suggested, because they do not understand exactly the proposals which the Government are asking the Dáil to approve of.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there has been criticism in respect of the contributions, and it was only in respect of the contributions that any real suggestion came from Deputy Dr. Ryan when speaking on behalf of his Party.  I want to put this to the House in that regard.  Most members of the House will agree that it is essential to relate the provisions in regard to contributions in the Bill with the provision that there shall be no means test in its administration. I suggest that, if it were not for the fact that those who are benefiting are paying a very substantial portion of their benefits by contributions, it would not be just to impose taxation, particularly on poorer people, for those who might be able to do without the pensions.  It is highly desirable that there should be no means test in the administration of the scheme.  The means test acts at all times as an irritant and as a deterrent against saving.  How often do Deputies see cases where the provident man has put aside something for his old age, has saved up during the years he was working, and when it comes to his old age applies for the pension.  He may have a schoolfellow of his of the same age living side by side with him who has not made the same provident provision to help himself in his later years.  Both apply for a pension under the existing scheme, and the one who has put by something is penalised for having done so, while the man who has put aside nothing gets the full benefit of the State's assistance under the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>
    <P>If we can get away from that we will be giving a very great inducement towards saving and, far from making for more State paternalism, we will be making sure that people who do save will be able to get the full benefit of their savings and that portion of their <Col N="56" /> savings will not be set off by a reduction in the State's payment.  Deputies, Senators and people in public life who frequently come across cases where means are being assessed under the Old Age Pensions Act and other similar Acts will, I think, all agree that the abolition of the means test will act as a genuine assistance, as a genuine incitement towards people being more provident and saving something.  But you could not, I suggest, have that complete relaxation from any means test without, at the same time, having a provision that under the scheme a substantial portion of the cost of the benefit will be paid by those who are to benefit by contributing over the years they are working.  I want, therefore, to make it quite clear that we regard the abolition of the means test and the payment of the contributions as provided in this Bill as being entirely interrelated; that each has a vital bearing on the other, and that, far from making the inducement towards saving, towards provident provision being made by people while in employment less, there will be a much greater urge to do so in future, knowing that what they do will not be set off by a reduction in the State benefits.</P>
    <P>When the Fianna Fáil case was being put to this House on the 2nd March there seemed to those of us who were in the House a rather remarkable thing about that case.  We heard a great deal of ballyhoo over a long period about this proposed Bill.  We were told that the Bill would be opposed tooth and nail.  We were told it would be disastrous for the country. Every opprobrious epithet that could be applied was applied to it by the Opposition and by their supporters throughout the country.  Yet, Deputy Dr. Ryan spoke here on this measure before Easter and during his speech he referred time and time again to the provisions in the Bill and indicated that he agreed with them. Later that day there was a hurried issue to the Press of proposals which the Opposition described as an alternative scheme but which is, of course, really not an alternative <Col N="57" /> scheme at all.  That scheme contained a few amendments to the proposals put forward by the Government and those amendments are in themselves clearly amendments more germane to the Committee Stage of the Bill than to the Second Reading. I listened to Deputy Dr. Ryan that day and I subsequently read his speech.  I think there is only one reason why one particular amendment was put down; it was done in the hope of securing some political kudos or political tactical success. Quite clearly that amendment was not put down as being in the nature of a sincere objection to the principle underlying the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was sorry that Deputy Dr. Ryan had to act that day as the champion of a lost cause, because it was certainly a lost cause he was attempting to uphold.  The Minister in his speech indicated that there was one particular change in the measure, a change which would have been indicated in all probability in the forthcoming Budget. He referred to the provision in the Bill in relation to old age pensions. That provision would naturally entail the making available of additional finance for the purpose of ensuring that non-contributory old age pensions could be raised from 17/6 per week to £1 per week.  It is interesting to remember that that increase comes three and a half years after Fianna Fáil refused to make a very much smaller sum available for the same purpose in October, 1947, on a motion standing in the names of the then Deputy Costello and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  In respect of that motion, Fianna Fáil solemnly walked into the Division Lobby to reject it.</P>
    <P>The provision announced by the Minister will be one that will be welcomed and accepted by all, even by those who will have to bear the cost.  We are all anxious to see those who cannot provide for themselves provided for to the best of our abilities.  Those who will have to pay for that provision will pay for it willingly in the knowledge that the money will be spent in a good cause.  The wind having been taken out of the sails of the Fianna Fáil Party by the Minister's announcement <Col N="58" /> that day, that Party, on the same afternoon, issued a hurried statement to the Press; on the face of it, it must have been a hurried statement, because the sum they suggest of £4,600,000 to be raised by taxation would not be nearly sufficient.  I think the Minister would be well advised in this connection to give us the figures worked out by the actuary as to what the cost would be. I believe, though I may be wrong, that it would be substantially in excess of £4,600,000.  It must be remembered, too, in that connection, that we are not discussing this measure from the point of view as to whether there shall or shall not be a social welfare scheme. It has been made abundantly clear that everyone agrees there should be a co-ordinated measure in order to bring all social welfare within the scope of one central administration.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party evidently wants to have things both ways.  They suggest that there must be increased benefits and they also suggest that nobody should have to pay for them. They suggest that all the benefits provided for in this measure are essential. At the same time we heard them make the welkin ring just before Easter because of the burden of taxation.  Yet, Deputy Dr. Ryan suggests that another £4,600,000 should be added to that burden.  I think the figure would be very much more.  I would be interested to know where they propose to get the £4,000,000.  What articles do they propose to tax?  Have they even considered that aspect of the matter? Were they merely trying to pretend that increased benefits could be given without anybody having to pay for them?  One of the unfortunate things of life is that someone has to pay for everything.  I think that the cost of these benefits will be met in a very fair way by the proposals put forward by the Government rather than by the amended proposals that Deputy Dr. Ryan put forward.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party supports the principle contained in this measure and the proposals put before the House by the Minister.  There is, however, one suggestion I would like to make.  It is obviously a point for consideration in Committee.  I think <Col N="59" /> there should be some inducement for people to remain at work after 65 if they are physically fit to do so.  It would be impossible to provide a reduction in contribution after that age because there would then be a tendency for employers to employ those over 65 because of the lower rate of contribution.  In the measure in the British House of Commons a suggestion was made that those who were still able to work after 65 years of age would be enabled to pay portion of their continued contributions towards building up a fund from which they would eventually get some additional benefit having continued in work after 65 years of age.  It could be done by means of a deferred credit, payable when they actually did retire.  Probably that would be easier than varying the amount of the retirement pension itself.  But some type of inducement in that regard would, I think, improve the scheme.</P>
    <P>This scheme, and any scheme there is, can only become a success if we have a real productive effort by every section of our people.  Any scheme for social benefit of any sort is merely a redistribution of the national income and, unless the national income is increased by greater production and greater effort, then the redistribution will only change the incidence and perhaps bring a better comparison to those who are not so well off, but it will not increase the national pool as a whole.</P>
    <P>In that effort towards production I believe this scheme will play a substantial part.  I believe that when people know they will be enabled to get a retirement pension at 65 without a means test, when the agricultural workers know that they will be able to get unemployment benefit, when people know they will be able to get maternity and death benefits such as are provided in this scheme and that they will be able to get widows' and orphans' pensions, then there will be a greater inducement for all concerned to put their backs into full productive effort and in that way ensure that not merely will the Bill act as a method of <Col N="60" /> distribution, to some degree, of our national wealth, but that it will also act as a means towards increasing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has submitted a reasoned amendment to the motion for the Second Reading of this Bill, because although we believe that legislation to amend and to extend the existing social welfare arrangements is due, and indeed overdue, we do not consider that the proposals which have been submitted to the House by the Government are satisfactory in all respects.  It is quite true, of course, as Deputy Sweetman said, that there is an area in which agreement exists.  That was made quite clear by Deputy Dr. Ryan when speaking here last month.</P>
      <P>It is agreed that a comprehensive scheme is necessary.  The need for bringing all our social welfare arrangements into one comprehensive scheme has been obvious for some time.  I will not claim that we were the authors of the idea.  I do not think anybody else can put forward a valid claim to the authorship.  We do claim, however, that, recognising the need, we took practical measures to reorganise the distribution of functions amongst members of the Government so as to bring into existence a Social Welfare Department charged with the primary duty of preparing proposals of that character for submission to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agreed that the comprehensive scheme should provide for increased benefits.  The existing benefits were devised at a time when money values were different from what they are now. Apart from any feeling that the provisions against undeserved want arising from poverty or other causes should be expanded as the improvement in national circumstances permits of it, it is clear that even if we had been ourselves in a position to produce proposals for a comprehensive scheme with higher benefits in 1948, as we hoped, in 1951, in view of the change in money values, some reconsideration of the scale of benefits then fixed would be necessary.  We agree that the present scheme must level out the anomalies which emerged as a result of the piecemeal manner in which the existing services were <Col N="61" /> brought into existence, and also the time has come when we should provide additional safeguards against undeserved want arising from causes to which the existing schemes do not relate.</P>
    <P>We have got from the Government, after the lapse of a considerable period, their proposals in relation to these matters, and these proposals are all right in some respects and objectionable in others.  Any Opposition Party in any Assembly considering a Bill of this character, a Bill aiming to achieve results which are generally desired, but which seeks to achieve them in a manner which appears defective, has a problem to solve.  This Bill has created a problem for us.  The question we have to consider and to decide is whether we should take this Bill for what is good in it, or whether we should reject it and, by rejecting it, leave the way clear for a better scheme.</P>
    <P>In answering that question we have to have regard to many factors, including the attitude of the Government and of the Minister.  It seems to us that if this Bill is accepted by the Dáil without a division and a situation created in which the public would be led to believe that the Bill represented the best that the combined wisdom of members of the Dáil could produce, then it would, in our view, make a better scheme subsequently more difficult. It would create obligations and claims which could not easily be disposed of.  It might conceivably, because of its defective character, tend to make amending legislation in the future less easy to enact by creating a prejudice against all legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister for Social Welfare has fully appreciated the extent to which public opinion is concerned about this type of legislation. The recognition of the need for it, the recognition of the desirability of establishing certain safeguards against undeserved want, does not altogether remove anxiety as to the possible economic or social consequences of the legislation produced for that purpose.  On the whole, it seems to us that the defective character of this Bill justifies the Dáil in rejecting <Col N="62" /> it, but on the understanding that its rejection would be accepted by the Government as an indication that a better Bill was desired and desired promptly.  We recognise that if we secure its rejection here or by our criticism of it induce the Government to withdraw it, our position may be misrepresented.  I do not think that is important.  What is important is that the outcome of our discussion and our vote should be a better series of proposals for the improvement of our social welfare arrangements.  I think there is no doubt whatever, having regard to the fact that the principle of inaugurating a comprehensive scheme and of extending and improving our social welfare arrangements is generally accepted by all members of the House, that if this Bill were withdrawn by the Government, a better scheme which would not be as controversial as this one could be framed and enacted very speedily.</P>
    <P>To some extent, our attitude to the Bill has, however, been affected by the tone of the speeches made by members of the Government and their supporters inside and outside this House on this subject of social welfare.  There appears to be amongst them a desire that Fianna Fáil Deputies should vote against the Bill so that they can be represented as being opposed to the principle of improving social welfare services.  Various observations made justify that impression.  I have said that we have no need to worry about the danger of misrepresentation.  I think that the record of the Fianna Fáil Party in this matter of improving the social welfare arrangements of this State will stand against any misrepresentation of which Deputies opposite are capable.  We have always argued that benefits of an improvement in the national position should be shared by everyone, whether these benefits came from an expansion of national production, as Deputy Sweetman has been advocating, or an improvement in the terms of trade.  We have recognised that if that is to be secured the State must intervene to ensure that a due share of any improvement will go to the weakest section of our community, the sick and unemployed, the widows and old aged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> I do not believe that it is practicable to leave these classes to private charity no matter how extensive or well organised or to the voluntary efforts of trade groups.  If there is to be an extension of the provision made for them and if the improvements in national circumstances justify it, the State must intervene to secure it. Before, therefore, going on to discuss the terms of this Bill, I think it is no harm that I should make quite clear what our position is.</P>
    <P>We would have been able, I think, to have produced in 1948 our own proposals for a comprehensive social welfare scheme, a scheme which would have the aim of removing the anomalies of the existing arrangements, levelling out the provisions made for various contingencies, improving these provisions and extending them where necessary.  I realise that in speaking in a matter of this kind, it is necessary to bear in mind that the circumstances of any time are an unreliable guide to the future.  We are dealing with money and the making of money payments to various classes of our people who need to get them in order to maintain themselves.  We judge the value of the proposals in this Bill by relating it to our knowledge of what money will buy to-day.  If in a year's time prices have so risen that the purchasing power of these payments has been substantially reduced, then they will have to be revised.  I am sure there will be general agreement that they should be revised.  It is rather futile to be criticising past administrations by relating proposals produced in 1951 to those that were discussed ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  I am doubtful if many economists will agree that a £1 old age pension is to-day worth more than 10/- before the second world war or 5/- before the first world war. In the case of people who benefit under these social welfare arrangements it possibly is because the general deterioration in the value of money has been offset so far as they are concerned, so far as the necessaries of life are concerned, by the food subsidies arrangement which we introduced in 1947.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> When, therefore, Deputy Sweetman criticises the Fianna Fáil attitude to this Bill on the ground that its spokesman had to express agreement with many of its provisions, it merely indicates that he misunderstands it. We agree with many of the provisions of the Bill.  Some of them we might have framed differently, some we may seek to amend slightly, but in so far as they are aiming to do what we ourselves would have attempted in 1948, we cannot disagree with them.  Many of the provisions of the Bill we do disagree with.  We agree with the proposals in the Bill which secure that, in future, equal benefits will be paid to the unemployed and to the sick and that there should be attached to these benefits equal additions for dependents. We accept, or are prepared to accept for the purpose of this discussion, the Minister's proposals as to the level of these benefits even though, as it was pointed out, they involve in a few cases a disimprovement on the present position. We agree to the proposals that sickness benefit should continue for the duration of a claimant's illness without deduction.</P>
    <P>We are doubtful about some of the provisions of the Bill, doubtful about the wisdom of segregating the insured population into a lower wage group and a higher wage group.  I think that will produce a practical difficulty, that it will complicate the administration of the scheme.  While recognising what the Minister was aiming to achieve and recognising the circumstances which induced him to put forward the proposal, we think it should be reconsidered. We question the wisdom and desirability of including within the scope of unemployment insurance domestic servants.  It seems to us unfair to domestic servants, in so far as few domestic servants are ever likely to qualify for unemployment insurance benefit on the ground of being unable to obtain work.  These provisions appear to us merely to involve imposing an obligation on them in respect of payment of contributions against which they can never benefit.</P>
    <P>Let us come now to the points on which we disagree.  So far as we can calculate, all these benefits I have <Col N="65" /> enumerated, the higher rate of benefit payable in case of unemployment, the equal rate of benefit payable on sickness, the provision for maintaining the rate of sickness benefit for the duration of the applicant's illness and so forth, can be financed out of the existing contribution revenue.  There appears to us no justification whatever, in so far as these benefits are required, for increasing the contributions payable by workers and their employers. The House will remember that, in 1948, one of the first Bills introduced by the present Minister involved an increase in the contributions payable without any increase in benefits and, although it may not have been specifically stated, there was a suggestion then that the higher contributions which became effective from 1948 were preparatory to the introduction of this comprehensive scheme and designed to facilitate the general improvement in benefits for which this scheme provides.</P>
    <P>Against the higher contributions which became payable in 1948, there was no improvement in benefits.  Now, an improvement in benefits is proposed and, against that improvement, a very substantial increase in the contributions is also proposed.  The worker's contribution will be increased from 1/11 to 3/6, an increase of over 80 per cent. in the amount paid by him each week by deductions from his wages towards the cost of providing him with these social security benefits.  No calculation which I have been able to make from the information supplied by the Minister justifies an increase of that character.  In so far as I can see. the higher rates of unemployment and sickness benefit, all the proposals in this Bill relating to unemployment and sickness benefit, can be financed from the existing contributions without any increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that calculation requires an actuary. The Minister, according to his White Paper, made his calculations as to the <Col N="66" /> cost upon the basis of assuming that the number of persons who would be unemployed or sick in any future year would be the same as at present.  We advocate a higher old age pension to be financed out of taxation and generally applicable at the same rate to everybody.  We recognise that some means test is probably necessary. I have always been doubtful of the validity of estimates given as to the cost of paying a non-contributory old age pension without a means test, but, recognising that there is objection in principle to asking the taxpayers to contribute to the Exchequer for purposes of this kind, unless the money is to be utilised to deal with real need, and that that involves a means test of some character, we are prepared to accept it and recommend that it should be liberal and simple.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan suggested that in the case of landowners the means test should be the simple one of debarring only those whose poor law valuation exceeds £25 or £30 a year.  In the case of other persons, a simple assessment of cash income is all that would be required and the exclusion of those whose cash income exceeds £100 a year.  For reasons which Deputy Ryan advanced, it is recognised that it may be desirable to provide, over and above the non-contributory old age pension available to everybody, a special pension for insured workers, providing an increase upon the non-contributory old age pension and an additional payment in respect of a wife under 70.  Again, however, it seems to me that that addition, if the age limit is fixed at 70, instead of 65, will not involve a substantial addition to the present contribution revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the Government to this matter of old age pensions has been made very doubtful by some of the speeches made, including the speech we have just heard from Deputy Sweetman, who made it quite clear that the increase was proposed last March for the purpose, as he said, of taking the wind out of the sails of Fianna Fáil.  From every point of view, it is highly undesirable that any substantial alteration of our existing social welfare arrangements should be <Col N="67" /> made for political purposes of that character.  I think most of us would have agreed that, apart altogether from what we may say as to the adequacy of arrangements in the past, an increase was justifiable now; that even the increase in the cost of living last year alone, the increase which is still proceeding, would have necessitated some revision soon.</P>
    <P>When the Minister circulated his White Paper, it contained no reference to any intention to increase the old age pension.  Some months later, the White Paper was followed by the Social Welfare Bill and that Bill contained no reference to any intention to increase the old age pension.  Subsequently, the Minister indicated that he desired to reconsider the provisions of that Bill and asked the permission of the House to withdraw it.  He got that permission and he withdrew the Bill.  The present Bill was later introduced, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, and that contained no reference to any intention to increase the old age pension.  Until the Minister made his speech here on the Second Reading of this Bill, no such intention was known to anybody, outside the immediate circle of the Government and their friends.  There is at least good ground for the belief that the criticism of the Bill which had been expressed by various Deputies on the Government side and the possibility that that criticism would be expressed by votes in a Division Lobby against the Bill was responsible for the proposal to raise the old age pension and not any belief that the condition of the old age pensioners required it.</P>
    <P>If that view is without foundation, if the proposal of the Government to increase the old age pension came from a belated realisation that, when proposals for social welfare which were described as comprehensive were being discussed by the Dáil, additional provision for the old age pension should, in justice, be included, then it is difficult to understand the subsequent decision of the Minister to delay the implementation of the decision until this Bill, this rather elaborate Bill, has passed through the Dáil in Committee, through the Seanad and <Col N="68" /> put into operation.  I do not think that was the Minister's original intention. When he was making his announcement in introducing this Bill, he stated that the Government had decided to promote legislation to increase the old age pension.  It was subsequently, at a political meeting, that he revealed that the change relating to the old age pension was to be made by an amendment introduced to this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Is there a difficulty in that regard?  I mean, if that is put forward seriously as a difficulty, I will make my suggestions.  We suggest also that widows' and orphans' pensions should be payable at equal rates to everybody without distinction as to whether they reside in urban or rural areas or whether the deceased husbands were insured contributors or not, and that these pensions should be paid out of taxation.  We think it will be agreed that, irrespective of the former social status or employment experience of their husbands, their needs will be equal when their breadwinner dies and that there is little ground in justice for making any differentiation between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess that I was very much surprised at the decision of the Government not to include in this Bill any proposals for the amendment of children's allowances.  The reason for my surprise is that, is so far as the House has available to it definite information as to the conditions prevailing amongst any classes of our people, we have it in relation to larger families <Col N="70" /> of workers and small farmers and the like.  The nutritional survey which was carried out in 1947, the reports of which have been circulated to Deputies, makes it quite clear that, despite the provision made in that year to minimise hardship arising from prevailing conditions, despite the distribution of assistance through various Government schemes and local authorities, despite all the efforts made to keep down by subsidy the price of essential foodstuffs and the operation of the existing children's allowances scheme, there was real hardship in the case of the largest families, and it was only amongst the largest families that the real hardship was shown by the survey to exist.  Having regard to that definite evidence of need in the case of these families, it seems obviously desirable now, when we are reconsidering our social welfare arrangements, that the children's allowances scheme should be amended, at least in respect of the children of the larger families.</P>
    <P>The need in the case of larger families arises from understandable causes.  For reasons which are obvious and not necessary to discuss, the whole trend of trade union agitation has been towards establishing in every occupation a standard wage, and that standard wage, while it may be adequate to provide for the needs of the average family, will, even if it is so adequate, be insufficient for the needs of the much larger family.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of the man who is getting his livelihood from a small farm or such an occupation as fishing, or who is an independent tradesman, his earning power cannot expand with the needs of his family and, while he may be able to get enough to provide for the reasonable requirements of an average family, he will be unable, and is frequently unable, to get enough to provide for the needs of a larger family.</P>
    <P>It was these considerations that, I think, justified the introduction of the children's allowances scheme originally and that justify us now in continuing it.  But, in view of the scientific evidence which is available to us, it seems necessary to revise that scheme <Col N="71" /> by increasing the allowance in present circumstances, if not in respect of all children, then at least in respect of children beyond the fourth or fifth. From the information which is available from the census of population, I do not think the additional cost would be very considerable.  Certainly, it would be small in relation to the expenditures proposed in other directions.</P>
    <P>The amount which this community can set aside out of its current earnings for services of this kind is, naturally, limited.  The aim of any comprehensive social welfare scheme must be to make the best use of that amount, to distribute it, not in the manner that will prove most popular politically, but so as to provide the most effective safeguards against undeserved want where it is most likely to arise.  It would seem to me that, even if it is not possible to increase the total provision for social welfare, it would, nevertheless, be justifiable to revise the provisions of this Bill so as to make available whatever might be required for the amendment of the children's allowances scheme on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>It will be clear, therefore, that the differences between the proposals put forward here by Deputy Dr. Ryan and those contained in the Bill are these: that Deputy Dr. Ryan's proposals provide for no increase in the existing contributions; they provide for benefits in the case of unemployment and sickness equivalent to those provided in the Bill; they provide for better help, through an amendment of the children's allowances scheme, for larger families and, so far as I can calculate, when provision is made for the additional cost of the old age pension amendment, no higher charge on State revenue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman accused us of trying to suggest that it is possible to get something for nothing.  We have no such desire.  It has never been our policy to mislead the people as to the sources from which the cost of these services must be met.  If it is possible to hold out the prospect of a social welfare scheme better than that contained <Col N="72" /> in the Bill and costing less, or avoiding the increase in contributions for which the Bill provides, then we must show how that is possible.  The main difference between the proposals put forward by Deputy Dr. Ryan and those contained in the Bill was that Deputy Dr. Ryan's proposals contained no provision for a retirement pension at 65.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy not aware that no such proposals were put forward by Deputy Dr. Ryan in the House?  They were put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party after the House adjourned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Deputy reads Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech he will see that they were put forward in that speech.  I think it is true to say that, of the increased cost of benefit which will follow the enactment of this Bill, by far the single biggest item is the cost of retirement pensions.  In that regard, I think we should consider the position carefully and there are a number of aspects of it to which the Minister should direct his attention. There are four classes of persons who will be affected one way or another by that provision.  There is the man who, at 65, is unfit to work or the man who, because of his age, is unable to get work.  Both of these persons will be entitled to get, or should be entitled to get, under the provisions of the Bill the same cash payment in respect of unemployment benefit or sickness benefit as the Bill proposes he should get by way of retirement allowance.  If the regulations are framed accordingly, we do not have to worry about these two classes.  The other two classes are subdivisions of those who have work available to them&mdash;either those who wish to remain at work and who may be deprived of that chance by reason of the enactment of this measure, and those who do not wish to work and who would prefer to retire on the strength of this retirement pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the Bill does not make any provision for compulsory retirement but that is more a legal than a real distinction.  I think it is certain that if the Bill is enacted, and if this idea of retirement at 65 receives the <Col N="73" /> sanction of the State through the enactment of the Bill, if there is a provision of a State pension for those who do retire at 65, inevitably the practice of employers will be to terminate engagements at that age.</P>
    <P>There are many employers who retain in their employment men who have reached or passed the age of 65 because of their long association with their undertaking and who would dislike getting rid of them so long as they are capable of doing work, even though they might look forward to the day when they could get younger men to replace them.  I think, however, it is almost certain that once the Bill is passed, once the idea of retirement at 65 is established, once the retirement pension comes into operation, every employer of that character will establish the practice of retiring his staff at 65 and will do so with an easy conscience knowing that this pension will be provided.  Therefore, in practice, the effect of the enactment of the Bill will be compulsory retirement at 65 even though it is not a legal obligation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the railway companies in a moment. There are a number of employers who have voluntary pension schemes in operation, and one of the queries that I want to address to the Minister will bear on the effect of the Bill on these voluntary schemes.  I am merely now raising the issue of the desirability of making this provision of a retirement pension at 65 in relation to all the facts as we know them.  In the case of a man who is dismissed at 65 or who is at that age unfit for work, there is no problem, because even under the Bill, he would qualify for a similar amount of money weekly in respect of unemployment benefit or sickness benefit. In the case of a man who is fit for work and who has a job available to him, the <Col N="74" /> effect of the enactment of the Bill will tend to deprive him of the opportunity of continuing in employment.  I recognise that there are a number of workers who might wish to retire at 65 even though they were fit for work and had work available to them. While it might seem unlikely that a worker in that position would be induced to retire on a pension of 24/- a week with an additional 12/- if he has a wife, it is in that connection that we have to consider the fact that a number of firms have in operation pension schemes which might provide an additional retirement allowance which would be sufficient to induce the worker to retire.  It is in respect of these classes that I am anxious to get from the Minister what he thinks could or should be done in that regard. I shall confine myself to some of the bigger undertakings and, in order to avoid any difficulty for myself, I shall take those which are established in my own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, the pension scheme operated by Messrs.  Arthur Guinness and Company.  It is specifically provided in that scheme that the pensions granted by the company will be subject to abatement for any benefit or allowance to which a member pensioned from employment in the Republic of Ireland may be or may become entitled under any legislation of the Republic of Ireland providing for old age or retirement pensions. Unless that scheme is amended by Messrs Guinness, the effect of the operation of the Bill on the workers there would appear to be to put on them an obligation to make an increased contribution to the State scheme while they would not have an opportunity of benefiting by way of the retirement pension, because whatever retirement pension they will get will be automatically deducted from the pension to which they are entitled under the company's pension scheme. I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether Córas Iompair Éireann or the Electricity Supply Board had in contemplation any modification of the existing pension schemes in the event of the Social Welfare Bill becoming law, and he informed <Col N="75" /> me that Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board were examining the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill to see what modification, if any, of the existing pension schemes might be necessary. This is obviously a matter of importance to a number of workers.  It is true that probably the majority of workers are not covered by voluntary pension schemes inaugurated by employers, but there are a substantial number of firms, an increasing number, who have in operation voluntary pension schemes who might think it desirable or necessary to modify the pensions payable under them in consequence of the enactment of this Bill. Some of these workers are paying contributions under these schemes, and, if their pensions are modified, they may be left in the position of paying two contributions for a pension no higher than that which would be generally applicable.  On the other hand, some of these schemes involve no contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably true of the older employees.  One of the objections to the means test under the old age pensions code to which I have frequently referred, is that it practically forced an employer to reduce the amount of pension payable under any voluntary scheme because the benefit of not reducing it would redound to the Exchequer and not to the individual. I have always thought it practicable to devise a system by which an amount equivalent to the old age pension, that would otherwise be payable, would be paid not to the individual but into a <Col N="76" /> pension fund and from that fund to the beneficiary under it without deduction.</P>
      <P>My point, however, in this regard is that the inauguration of a system of State retirement pensions at 65 will probably have the effect of forcing the retirement of some workers at that age who otherwise might be able to remain in their employment, and will, in respect of those workers who are benefiting under existing pension schemes, create a problem in respect to which the attitude of the Minister must be made known.  I think it is desirable that he should express a view on the matter, but it is not quite a simple problem to deal with.  It would be quite easy to say that we would like all employers to continue to pay whatever pensions are now established, in addition to the State retirement pension, but in so far as those voluntary schemes involve, in many cases, deductions from an employee's pay against that pension, a contribution from the employee, it might, with the addition of the contribution provided by this Bill, put, in many cases, on the present weekly wage a burden heavier than the employee would care to bear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman said that the revelation in Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech last month was that the difference between his proposals and the proposals in the Bill were not very considerable.  We do not regard them as such, but if that view is held generally opposite, is there not an opportunity available to the Government now to take this question of social welfare arrangements out of the <Col N="77" /> field of Party politics by moving to meet the proposals put forward by Deputy Dr. Ryan?  Mark you, they may not be convinced that they are better than their own proposals, just as many of the detailed provisions of the Bill which we are prepared to accept could, in our view, be bettered. But, if the Minister would intimate the willingness of the Government to accept our proposals as an alternative to the Bill, not merely would he get the advantage of putting the question outside the limits of Party controversy but we could, I think, expedite its enactment, nor do I think that the Minister, by doing so, would damage either his own reputation or political prospects.  I think it is very undesirable from every point of view, that the political Parties of this State should appear to be bidding against each other in matters bearing on social welfare.</P>

      <P>I think that any doubts as to whether this Bill has been produced primarily for political purposes rather than social purposes have been created by some speeches made by its advocates.  All of us are, I think, inclined to underestimate the volume of public opinion which is beginning to question the wisdom of proceeding in this matter of extending social welfare arrangements as rapidly as we are.  As one of those who had, perhaps, more individual responsibility than any other for pushing ahead various schemes of this kind, and had always looked forward to the day on which we could claim to have here as satisfactory a system of social security as any other country enjoyed, I am anxious that we should do nothing to arouse public hostility to the idea.  Public hostility to that idea is being aroused by the impression created that this is a matter upon which the political Parties are <Col N="78" /> merely concerned to outbid each other. If we could get rid of that idea by bringing out of this Dáil now a Bill which would be agreed by all sections, and that would mean a Bill which would conform to the main proposals which have been outlined by Deputy Dr. Ryan, then, I think, we would have done something much more than improving our social welfare system: we would have improved the public life of the country as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The public uneasiness is due to the belief that we are, in fact, proceeding with the process of outbidding each other, and that we may never stop, that we may develop a system of State benefits which will have no relation whatever to the economic condition of the country.  It is true, as has been said, that we are, as a nation, living beyond our means. It is not merely enough for the Minister or for Deputy Sweetman or for others to say in general terms that they realise that any development of this character must be related to our efforts and to the progress made in increasing production.  The fact that we are living beyond our means at present is not an argument against the enactment of a comprehensive Bill to modify and improve our social welfare arrangements, but it is an argument in favour of doing so on grounds which the public will understand.  At some stage some Government will have to make the people understand that the present standard of living is something which our present level of production is incapable of supporting, and that, sooner or later, if we do not get that level of production up, the standard of living will have to come down, and come down for everybody.  Here we are discussing rather the disposal of the means now available to us so as to avoid undesirable social conditions affecting any class.  But the public anxiety to which I refer is accentuated by the fact that this measure to improve the position of a particular section of the community, by making more money available to them, is proceeding in circumstances in which <Col N="79" /> there appears to have been created&mdash; perhaps by Party political propaganda and perhaps by other means&mdash;the belief that everybody can be made better off by giving out more money.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister was fair in his comments to the critics of the idea of a comprehensive social scheme.  They are not all as ignorant of the facts as he seemed to think nor was all their criticism entirely baseless. Part of it represents a very genuine public anxiety as to the social consequences of the extension of State paternalism, and requires attention. Perhaps I should say that I considered the possibility of incorporating this improvement in our social arrangements with the development of vocational organisation.  However desirable it may be that our State should develop upon vocational lines, the fact is that, so far as circumstances are at present determining out procedure, the only gesture that might be made towards vocationalism in this Bill would be to trust its administration to some committee.  I should be against that.  I think that the safeguard which exists when schemes of this kind are administered by Ministers responsible to the Dáil, should not lightly be surrendered&mdash;and certainly it would be surrendered or, at any rate, considerably reduced, if there was interposed between the Minister and the Dáil any non-official committee.  The Government has already gone too far in establishing these non-official authorities to discharge functions which should more properly be discharged by Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave a fair answer to those who said that the proper system of social security was the payment of adequate wages and the availability of work for everybody.  That would be the ideal system.  If we had full employment, no risk of unemployment, and an economy strong enough to enable a distribution of wages through employment sufficient to enable everybody to maintain a reasonable standard of living and to make provision for future contingencies, we should not need State social security arrangements <Col N="80" /> at all.  It is because our economy is working defectively, because its character inevitably means that there will be unemployment&mdash;fluctuating in volume, no doubt, but persistently there&mdash;and because it is incapable of putting every member of the community in a position, even if he were prepared to do it, to make ample provision against the other risks of life, that the State has to step in and, through taxation or otherwise, provide the resources for schemes to provide safeguards.</P>
    <P>We have always stood by the principle that the State is entitled to call on the community for contributions towards the cost of protecting people against undeserved want.  We are asking the Dáil to pass the reasoned amendment on the motion for the Second Reading which appears on the Order Paper in Deputy Dr. Ryan's name.  It is quite true that the belated announcement of the Government's decision to improve the non-contributory old age pension has done something to redress the unbalanced nature of the scheme as it was introduced, and therefore weakens the objection to it set out in (1) of the amendment, but it does not dispose of it entirely and, particularly in regard to the proposals in relation to widows' and orphans' pensions, it is still valid.</P>
    <P>It is very undesirable from every point of view that we should try to finance the improvement of social welfare systems by increasing the contributions now payable by workers and employers.  That system of meeting the cost of social welfare arrangements operates unfairly.  It is possible for some employees to suffer no loss through an increase in these contributions because they can make their employers pay more.  It is not possible for others.  It is unfair also to the employers&mdash;small farmers and others who come to mind in that category&mdash;who cannot possibly recover the increased contributions they will have to pay in higher prices realised for the goods they sell.  The higher contribution means a lowering of their standard of living.  They are a section of the community who, under this Bill, are being asked to bear an undue <Col N="81" /> share of the burden of providing these social arrangements.  Industrial employers suffer no personal loss but the introduction of the charge in this form means that it becomes an item of production costs which inevitably affects prices.  It means that the whole community will pay higher prices which will be inflated in the process of distribution and thereby bear more heavily on the community than direct taxation designed to secure the same amount of money would involve.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from other objections to this Bill which have been voiced, it is desirable that the Government should reconsider the proposal to finance these schemes in the main by these very substantial increases payable by workers and their employers. If the Government are not prepared to reconsider that matter, then the objection to giving this Bill a Second Reading, set out in (2) of Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment, will justify our pressing the motion to a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very pleasing to hear Deputy Lemass's speech&mdash;I presume he is voicing the opinion of the Opposition.  The Labour Deputy who is our Minister for Social Welfare in this Government was not actuated with those very sinister motives which were attributed to him from public platforms by members of the Opposition recently. It is very hard to follow Deputy Lemass this evening, because undoubtedly the olive branch was held out.  I realise that, though we may differ about details, we have in common a fundamental desire to improve the lot of our fellow men and women in this country. Undoubtedly, Deputy Lemass's speech this evening was worth listening to and certain suggestions which he made might very well be considered and implemented on the Committee Stage, but I am afraid I have to contradict him when he states that Deputy Dr. Ryan was going to give old age pensions at 65.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister adopts 65, that is his look out.  I hold out for 70.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That may be said by the Opposition, but Deputy Dr. Ryan said on the 2nd March (column 1113):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not prepared to ask the <Col N="82" /> Minister to agree that the old age pension should be all round at 65 on the same level as in the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he finishes in this tone:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would make it easier for the person to get the old age or the widows' or orphans' pension.  So, if I propose benefits better all round than the Minister every time, the only objection he can have is that the scheme I propose is too costly&mdash;and that will be a new role for the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan was anxious to wound but was afraid to strike.  Deputy Derrig, however, is reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of April 2nd, when he spoke at a lecture in Cork:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Retrenchment, he said, was forgotten.  Nobody could see what the ultimate cost of the social welfare scheme would be.  If it went through the Dáil, it was certain that the country would be faced with a heavy increase in expenditure and a growing weight of taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot say that Deputy Derrig and Deputy Ryan are in unison on this Bill, because it looks as if there is a big divergence of opinion between the two ex-Ministers.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly this is a long-wanted measure and nowhere is it more wanted than in rural Ireland.  Certain allegations were made about people influencing the Minister, but I may tell you that at all times the Minister was conversant with the affairs of the people who were not insured, the small farmers, referred to by Deputy Seán Flynn, and the middling farmers, who were just eking out an existence, and keeping their noses above water and whose economic structure was at all times such that it could easily collapse. I know very well that his trouble was to please those people within the principles of the Bill and it was not on Thursday night last either.  It is no use for the Opposition or members of the Government Parties who are taking an individual exception to the Bill to attribute sinister motives of political expediency to the Minister's gesture.</P>
    <P>The Opposition speak about what <Col N="83" /> they gave old age pensioners; they made a statement about 15/- payable to every old age pensioner prior to the advent of this Government, but that is not the fact.  I do not know whether it was the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Social Welfare who gave the stamp for 2/6 and I do not know what year it was, but the old age pensioner had to convince the local assistance authorities in whatever administrative area he lived in that he had not £20 in the bank.  I have known cases where an old age pensioner because he had £20 in the bank did not receive the other 2/6, which was supposed to come from the local authority.  It was a most humiliating experience for an old age pensioner.  When we came into power we enacted a firm Act which gave them an increase of 7/6.  The stamp was only a temporary expedient and at any time it could have been taken back, but it would require the repeal of legislation to take back the 7/6 we put on.  We mean, again by firm legislation, to increase it from 17/6 to £1 and we hope that the Opposition, in their wisdom, actuated by their charity, will not delay the Bill.  From what Deputy Lemass said this evening it looks as if they are prepared to row in the same boat and on the Committee Stage give what some consider to be their invaluable assistance in giving more concessions to the people who need them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane would have thrown the Bill out completely on the Second Reading and would have gone to the country, had we decided on doing so, in his solicitude for the old age pensioners, the blind pensioners and the widows and orphans.  Deputy Lehane is a member of an association which is more or less confined to the superior type of farmer in Cork&mdash;they call them, I think, &ldquo;gentlemen farmers.&rdquo;  Quite recently, in order to offset the Social Welfare Bill, a gentleman introduced an insurance scheme whereby the farmer would pay a premium for so many years and a man or woman who had worked for a number of years with a farmer would draw a couple of hundred pounds at the age of 65.  But <Col N="84" /> there was a condition as to whether that man or woman was a proficient worker.  I can say that the majority of farmers in Cork are good, decent, charitable men, but unfortunately in this deliberative Assembly I cannot say that the particular farmers who formulated that scheme are in that category.  I would not like to trust them too far when the worker came near the time for benefit and they had to say whether he was proficient or not.  When legislation was going through here to give to the farm labourers certain amenities that are overdue, Deputy Lehane was against it in his utterances.  I am not too sure that he did not accept the inevitable afterwards, but I have not gone to the trouble of looking up the Official Report to see which way he voted.  I know that Deputy Lehane may be at heart a good Irishman and a good Christian, but there is the old saying: &ldquo;Show me your company and I will tell you what you are.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; in deference to the Chair, I will continue on another line.  There are certain people voicing an opinion which is not in keeping with the Christian outlook these people are supposed to be inculcated with, from organisations that are working in shelter and with profit and that are protected with superannuation <Col N="85" /> by law.  They cannot see that they should contribute at all. Some of these people are very vociferous at times in regard to their own grievances.  At no time since an Irish Government took over has a year passed that we have not heard complaints and read resolutions in the papers from some of those organisations. All we say to those organisations is that, as far as we are concerned and as far as the Party I belong to is concerned, we will look after and give prior attention to the people who require our consideration most, and those are the masses of this country. After that, we will give due consideration to the other categories.  It is most uncharitable for certain organisations, who are sheltered and safeguarded in regard to the future, to have any objection to this House passing legislation to provide for the members of the community who are not in the same category or who do not enjoy the same privileges of life.</P>
      <P>I would like to bring before the Minister the anomalies that could occur regarding the Old I.R.A. in receipt of disablement benefit or special allowances.  I think the Minister should embody in this Bill a safeguarding clause for them.  We are all aware that between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Defence there is always some little row as to who will deduct from the allowances when a man gets something subsequently. I would like the Minister also to examine the pensions of Guards' widows who, when they recently got an increase from the Minister for Justice, found the little sum they were getting from social welfare was taken off.  The means test was put into operation immediately and although they did gain, they did not gain to the extent that they should have.  The means test, to say the very least of it, is a penal test, a humiliating test, and if we could do away with it in this country we would have a lot of better people and the country would be better to live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing applies to Guinness. Deputy Lemass drew attention also to Córas Iompair Éireann.  Those people may have certain qualifications within <Col N="86" /> their superannuation scheme, whereby if the State contributes their amounts will immediately be reduced.  It was in existence regarding old age pensions with Córas Iompair Éireann.  I had several Córas Iompair Éireann people before me, as chairman of the Old Age Pension Committee, and I could not understand at first what the reason was until I discovered that Córas Iompair Éireann were paying them 15/- a week and the very minute they got anything from social welfare or the old age pension, that 15/- was reduced.  The Minister should safeguard those people in this Bill when the final amendment is being decided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the position of Córas Iompair Éireann employees in the future, if they come into this scheme and are covered by the provisions they will receive the full benefit under this Bill, without regard to whatever they get from Córas Iompair Éireann in the form of pension or any other type of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is perfectly right in that, but I want to point out to him that when they do get the benefits of this Bill, Córas Iompair Éireann, Guinness or the Electricity Supply Board may reduce their pension.  It is there stated in the terms of the superannuation regulations made by Guinness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not because of anything in this Bill that that has happened and there are other ways of dealing with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Lemass reading out about it and I certainly know what happened in Córas Iompair Éireann before.  We did not reduce at all: it was Córas Iompair Éireann that reduced their pensions when the people got the old age pension. They let workmen go at 65 and immediately they attained the age of 70 Córas Iompair Éireann insisted on their applying for the old age pension and when they got it they reduced the superannuation.  There are people even within our own Party who would be conversant with the superannuation scheme of Córas Iompair Éireann as it used to be formerly.  I think that we <Col N="87" /> should take the necessary precautions to prevent them from putting that into any new superannuation scheme that is passed.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Lemass mention that many parts of this Bill were acceptable to him&mdash;and I presume he was speaking as Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  He said that other parts were objectionable.  I think there is a way of dealing with that without appointing a select committee of this House to deliberate on a better and more permanent Bill.  On the Committee Stage, in regard to those points which Deputy Lemass thinks objectionable, if he could see his way to put down amendments which would be acceptable, I am sure that most of us on this side of the House would be only too delighted to give them every consideration and perhaps they could be embodied in the Bill before it goes through.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, in his statement to-night, said that the Minister was moving too fast.  Now, there was nobody on the other side of the House who goaded the Minister to action more than Deputy Lemass, who fired questions across the House, session after session, asking: &ldquo;What about the social welfare scheme?&rdquo;  I suppose the Minister realises, Deputy Lemass realises and I daresay every Deputy realises, that this scheme is more or less an experimental one, the fundamentals of which are O.K., but the details of which can be changed from year to year.  I have had some experience of the actuarial system and, without casting any aspersion on any individual, I certainly say that that system, which generally covers a period of five years, is a slow moving one and at times people cannot very well understand why there should be such delay.  If a blood transfusion could be given to this system which would bring the period to three years rather than five years, I certainly would like to see it happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is certainly not the last word in regard to social welfare.  It is only really laying the foundations on which an improved social welfare scheme in the future can be built.  I <Col N="88" /> am sure nobody realise that better than the Opposition, because we had a very interesting contribution from Deputy MacEntee some time ago on local government in which he stated that local government was still in the experimental stage.  I quite agree with him in that.  This is the first Social Welfare Bill we have had before us.  There were several Local Government Bills passed after the abolition of the grand juries and there have been several Local Government Bills passed since this State was set up, but we have not yet got the ideal Local Government Bill.  Neither can we have the ideal Social Welfare Bill at the first attempt.  No doubt Deputy Lemass will realise that.  As a matter of fact, you could infer from some of his remarks that he did realise it.</P>
    <P>There are times when Deputy Lemass can be very convincing, although some of us may not always accept everything he says as expressing what he wants to have done.  This evening I certainly think we heard Deputy Lemass at his best.  His speech was reminiscent of the time when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Without casting any aspersions on any ex-Minister, I certainly would say that he was one of the most convincing Ministers I ever heard speaking.  To-day he was one of the most convincing ex-Ministers I ever heard speaking.  Undoubtedly, the form which he displayed is something which we appreciate.  We do not want to make any political kudos out of it. After all, the Government are perhaps in a better position to prepare schemes and legislation than the Opposition because they have the machinery of the State at their disposal.</P>
    <P>If we are to judge by Deputy Lemass's concluding remarks, I believe that the Second Reading of this Bill will go through without a division, because I do not believe anyone will support Deputy P.D. Lehane, as nobody takes any notice of him.  On the Committee Stage suggestions can be made by Deputies like Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Lemass, who have experience of certain social services and who can, if they wish, make very valuable contributions.  I feel proud to be a Party member with the Minister <Col N="89" /> who introduced the Bill.  Even before he accepted the onerous position of a Minister, I always found him to be solicitous for the welfare of the rural population.  I resent the suggestion made by Deputy P.D. Lehane that the proposal to increase old age pensions under this Bill is a political expedient.  That was a very ill-mannered remark.  Because we are public representatives we are the target for every abuse that can be levelled at us.  We must realise, however, that we are given the meagre pittance of £624 a year to be the target for punches.  We may duck them or sideslip them sometimes, but occasionally they hit the mark.</P>
    <P>In the Cork County Council or in this House I never heard any criticisms of improvements in social services for the masses of the people except from one particular section of the community. These are the people who are always moaning and groaning about conditions in rural Ireland.  They state that they are just eking out an existence, that they are going down every day deeper into the mire.  I suppose it would take one of the Minister for Agriculture's bulldozers to take them out of it.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by voicing the hope that, instead of a Select Committee being appointed to hammer out a more efficient and more elaborate and suitable Social Welfare Bill, this deliberative Assembly as a whole will act as a committee and that on the Committee Stage each and every one will do his utmost to make a contribution which will improve it for the particular elements of the community that require it most.</P>

      <P>These social welfare proposals, though far from being balanced and comprehensive, are however a step in the right direction in so far as they benefit sections of the community who are badly in need of assistance.  They are welcome proposals, too, in so far as they put an end to the speculation and uncertainty caused by their tardy introduction and the tardy introduction of the Bill which we were promised in the first year of the Coalition's administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limitations and defects of the <Col N="90" /> Bill are so patent that I am convinced it will receive a reluctant acceptance and will cause unrest and dissatisfaction amongst many sections.  We were led to believe that this would be a comprehensive measure.  It has turned out to be non-comprehensive in so far as less than half the working people will benefit.  Only 700,000 workers will benefit.  Some 700,000 self-employed, who may be more in need of social security, are excluded although they are compelled to contribute by taxation towards the cost of the scheme. Also excluded by ministerial Order are certain white collar workers, such as civil servants, members of the Defence Forces, local authority employees, members of the Garda Síochána and teachers, both primary and secondary.</P>

      <P>Practically half the workers are being excluded from the Bill.  I believe that, because of their exclusion, the Bill will receive a reluctant acceptance and will be regarded as generally unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my principal objections to the Bill is that it caters for the urban areas to the detriment of the rural areas. The agricultural community is almost entirely excluded, with the exception of some 17,000 agricultural labourers. The agricultural industry is our most important industry.  It produces our greatest wealth.  Yet, those who man this industry do not come within the ambit of this scheme because there is <Col N="91" /> no voluntary provision in it.  There are some 500,000 farmers, some 300,000 of whom are small farmers with 50 acres or less.  It is said that the income of a small farmer approximates to that of an agricultural worker.  Now the agricultural worker is entitled to national health insurance benefits, workmen's compensation and unemployment assistance. The small farmer is denied any or all of these benefits.  He receives no consideration under this Bill apart from a slight modification of the means test and an increase of 2/6 in the old age pension.  I take it that these latter proposals were introduced by the Minister for the purpose of securing the support of those members of the Coalition who had openly declared their antagonism to the Bill and the loss of whose votes would undoubtedly bring about its defeat.</P>
    <P>If it was the Minister's intention to compensate old age pensioners for the enormous increase in the cost of living over the last three years he could have achieved his object overnight, and he would have received no opposition from these benches even if his proposals were for a much greater increase in the old age pensions and a much greater modification of the means test.  We appreciate the justice of the scheme in providing for an increase in old age pensions, but we believe that that section of our people is entitled to a greater income than they will be permitted under this measure in order to qualify for an old age pension.  If the Minister is honest in this matter he will implement his proposals immediately by accepting the motion standing in the name of Deputy Cogan for the introduction of a Bill to bring about an immediate increase.</P>
    <P>The only concession the small farmer gets is a slight modification of the means test and a slight improvement in the old age pension.  He figures in the Bill only in so far as he is required to pay for it by way of taxation.  I doubt if the Minister is unduly worried in that respect since he has never got from that class any political support, nor does he ever hope to get such support from them in the future.  Any Bill which excludes the small farmers, <Col N="92" /> who are a most deserving class, is neither just nor equitable.  The Minister has put forward the excuse that his reason for excluding them is because he feels it would be extremely difficult to expect them to pay the full contributions for the employer and the employee since they are not regularly employed.  I admit it would be difficult to expect them to pay that.  Could it not be arranged that they should pay a reduced contribution and receive reduced benefits?</P>

      <P>How would the Deputy feel if I told him that his own Government in 1947 had decided to exclude farmers and, in fact, put that on record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe they should not be excluded.  I suggest they might be included by making it possible for them to pay reduced contributions, say half, and let them receive in return reduced benefits.  They cannot receive unemployment assistance since they will always have work to do so long as they are capable of doing it.  They will never be unemployed in the way in which an industrial worker might be unemployed.  They might also be excluded from sickness benefit for short periods of less than two weeks.  I believe they are entitled to all the other benefits and any Bill which does not embrace the small farmers is both unjust and inequitable.</P>
      <P>The social welfare scheme deals particularly harshly with the people on the southern and western seaboard, from Waterford and Cork right up to Donegal.  The small farmer, the fisherman, the tradesman, the artisan, the country blacksmith, the man with a horse and cart or a donkey and cart, to serve his own or his neighbour's needs, are all excluded although they are compelled to contribute to the cost of the scheme.  Instead of their burden being relieved it is being made harder for them to bear.  I believe this Bill will have the effect of further depopulating the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trend of the rural population towards the cities and towns will receive a decided fillip under this Bill.  The farmer's son, the rural craftsman, will see that it will be to <Col N="93" /> his benefit to leave the country to take up residence in a town or city and, if he fails to get employment there, he will emigrate.  Rural life as we know it is, in my opinion, bound to decline at an increasing rate under this scheme.  The rot and the decay in the rural areas, which has caused so many of our boys and girls to leave the country to search for employment across the seas, will get a decided fillip under this Bill.  There is nothing in it that would tend to attract the people who have gone away; there is nothing to provide an incentive for those who are at home to remain there.</P>
    <P>Another objection to the scheme is the cost of administration; it will be about 12½ per cent. of the benefit expenditure, and I regard that as out of all proportion.  The Minister should endeavour in some way to administer the scheme more economically.  A building costing £1,000,000, which was designed for quite a different purpose, is now required in order to house the staffs necessary for the administration of this scheme.  That administrative cost is altogether out of proportion and the Minister should endeavour in some way to have it reduced.</P>
    <P>One of the most cogent arguments against the scheme is the high amount of the contributions that will go towards administration.  The Minister should endeavour to have this high cost reduced.</P>
    <P>The treatment of the lower wage groups under the Bill&mdash;that is, those earning less than £3 10s. 0d. a week&mdash; is hardly fair or entirely just.  Under the present system an insured man, single and unemployed, receives 22/6 a week unemployment assistance, irrespective of what he previously earned. Under the new scheme he will receive only 18/-, if his wages prior to that were less than £3 10s. 0d. a week.  The present 1/11 stamp will be increased to 2/6 and, in the case of the single man, his benefit will be reduced by 4/6 to 18/-.  An unmarried woman will receive only 15/- a week, a reduction of 3/-, her rate of contribution being the same as at present.  It is realised that all workers will receive new benefits, such <Col N="94" /> as a maternity allowance in the case of females, a retiring allowance and the death grant, but it seems to be very unjust that a single man or woman, because he or she is earning less than £3 10s. 0d. a week, must in future accept a reduced benefit of 4/6 and 3/- a week, respectively.</P>
    <P>Again, it is very unjust and inequitable to exclude all these people who are too poor to contribute, without making alternative provision for them. The position is that the tradesman who is earning £10 a week, or the manager of a business who has a salary of £2,000, if he has a wife and two children and if he is unemployed, will receive 50/- a week under this scheme, while a casual worker with a wife and several children, if he is unemployed, must prove he is not in receipt of 15/- a week in order to qualify for a dole of 25/-.  The £10 a week tradesman or the £2,000 a year manager of a business can retire at 65 years and will receive 24/- a week, while the worn-out 70 years old agricultural worker, before he can qualify for an old age pension of £1 a week, must prove he is not in receipt of more than 8/- a week.  To exclude all these people from the scheme because they are too poor to contribute, without making alternative provision for them, is scarcely just or equitable.</P>
    <P>Any scheme which excludes tens of thousands of workers, small employers, small farmers, shopkeepers, independent workers, tradesmen and rural craftsmen, who are as much in need of help and social security as those people who are included in the scheme, is far removed from the comprehensive national scheme we were assured we would get.  To say the least of it, this is a scheme in which it is proposed to give benefits to a privileged class, industrial workers and wage earners.  The cost of it will be paid for by the community at large, many of whom are as much in need of help as those who come within the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on this Bill on behalf of the people whom I have the honour to represent, and I wish, too, to express <Col N="95" /> my own feelings in relation to the measure.</P>
      <P>I am not a person who would stand up here and back any Bill of this nature if I were not genuine and sincere in doing so.  It is for that reason I am on my feet now.  Lots of things have been said about this Bill throughout the country, and in this House this evening and on another occasion.  What I have in mind is this.  Many things are, perhaps, lacking in the Bill, and there are many things we may not agree with or that certain people do not agree with.  I have heard certain criticisms expressed throughout the constituency I represent and here in Dublin and, indeed, throughout the country generally.</P>
      <P>If we mean to be sincere about social welfare, if we desire all sections of the people to benefit by this scheme, we must make a serious effort to achieve that end.  There are many people who appear to be very concerned about certain sections of the community and yet they falter when it comes to putting into operation a Bill of this character, which aims at giving benefits to those certain sections of our people.  For 15 years we were hearing about something that was going to be introduced, but nothing was introduced until a few weeks ago.  We all seem to want certain sections of the community to benefit, but yet we falter when it comes to meeting whatever expenditure may be involved.  The point is, are we coming clean about it and are we clear in our minds how we stand in regard to a scheme of this sort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain people have been left out of the Bill, and we have heard much about that.  I sympathise with them and I am sorry they cannot all be included.  I am sorry for the people concerned.  Again, I regret that it is necessary to have increased contributions from the employers.  In many cases, no doubt, the employer cannot afford these increased contributions. He may be looked upon as a rich man, but in many cases he is the poorest man of the community to-day.  He has a certain appearance to keep up.  He is a decent man generally, and he does his best for the country, for his family <Col N="96" /> and for the people he employs.  We want that spirit to exist as it has existed in the past; we want good fellowship between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>Then we have to consider the increased contribution from the employee.  We realise that that, too, may be a hardship.  I have heard criticism of the proposal.  We must be realists, particularly when we consider the state of the world to-day.  We must realise that we are living in 1951 and we must be prepared to contribute our share.  We must put our backs to the wall, and whatever job we are bound to do, we must do it.  We must realise that if we want the people to benefit through this scheme, we all shall have to make our contributions towards it. We have been told about the people who have been left out of the scheme, but we must take into consideration the many people who are brought within its scope.  There are, for instance, many benefits being given to the poorer people, particularly the old age pensioners. Are we sincere when we say that the cost of living has gone up and, on the other hand, we falter at the small pittance that we are now asked to give to these people?  I do not know; I will take what comes whenever the day of judgement comes as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>We have various other benefits for our people, such as the birth gratuity. We all realise that births cost money for anybody with a family.  The advent of a birth is a delight and a joy but, at the same time, it is a great expense. A little contribution from the State and from others will not be missed in the long run.</P>
    <P>We have also a retiring gratuity benefit, and, finally, a burial gratuity. In connection with the latter, surely nobody in this House, at least, will have the courage to stand up and deny that to anybody any more than they would deny an increase of the old age pension.  We want sincerity.  Cut out this nonsense about politics and what was said in years past.  We want a clear-cut policy, and we stand for what was said in days gone past.  I think that it is money well spent, and <Col N="97" /> if the scheme is explained properly and genuinely to the people, to the employer and employee, there will not be any of this alarm that we hear about at the present time.  I realise that the cost of administration will be quite heavy, especially for a poor country such as this is, but when we consider the many able-bodied men in receipt of good pensions we will not deny the right to live to an old age pensioner.  It cuts both ways.  I am not saying that by way of boosting the Government.  I say what I think whether it pleases or otherwise and do my best for the people as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly gives one food for thought when we hear Deputy Ormonde repeating a catch-cry that has been echoed around this country since this Social Welfare No. 2 Bill was first moved, a catch-cry of setting up a new privileged class.  I often wonder just what would be the reactions of Deputy Ormonde's constituents or the constituents of other Fianna Fáil Deputies if they went down to meetings of the workers in their own constituencies and said the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it suggested that because this Bill is being introduced the whole social system, as we know it and have known it from the time we came to the use of reason, will be completely upset and revolutionised in this country and that, whereas formerly we had a privileged class who were generally regarded as employers, we are now going to put in their place the working people as a privileged class by passing this Bill? I never heard so much nonsense talked in all my life.  I was struck particularly, as I am sure every Deputy, even Fianna Fáil Deputies, must have been particularly struck by the complete puerility&mdash;it cannot be described as anything else&mdash;of Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech in moving the rejection on the Second Reading.  It did not, to my mind, contain any constructive proposal that could be implemented.  It contained, on the other hand, what could well be regarded as retrogressive proposals. Deputy Dr. Ryan seemed to deplore the fact that the Bill gave the opportunity to aged workers to retire at 65 years.  We all know&mdash;those of us <Col N="98" /> who are concerned with the running of public authorities&mdash;there is a strict rule that public servants must retire at that age.  I take it that the same thing applies in the Civil Service.  People who have businesses of their own and who manage to run them successfully generally do not take too active an interest in them, except for recreation purposes, after the age of 65 years. Deputy Dr. Ryan thinks it is a bad thing that the ordinary workers should have the opportunity of retiring at 65. At least it can be said that admission was dragged out into the open on the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is not out of line with the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, in the course of his speech, claimed that the Fianna Fáil record in the matter of social legislation of this kind was one which the Party could stand over.  The Fianna Fáil Party were in power for 16 or 17 years.  They were in power longer than any other Party since this section of the country achieved freedom.  It made certain steps forward over that period. That cannot be denied, but I say and maintain that it could have gone twice as far and had ample opportunity for doing so.  If Fianna Fáil now feel that this Bill is inadequate and that much better could be done they will pardon me, I am sure, for asking: &ldquo;Why did not you do it when you had the opportunity?&rdquo;  It is not that there was not sufficient time, slow and all as Government Departments are under any Government and God knows they are slow in operation.  Still, it must be admitted that 16 years is ample time to do whatever you want to do.</P>
    <P>From the moment that the Government and the Tánaiste announced the intention to introduce this Bill, we had a sustained campaign carried out through the Press and by every organisation that would lend itself to the campaign of attacking the Tánaiste, the Government and all associated with it.  It was claimed that this Bill would never see the light of day.  It was also claimed that it was put off from one month to another and from one year to another so that eventually when election time would come again there would not be any implementation of it.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy was circularised by <Col N="99" /> self-appointed experts on social security, some of them very well meaning organisations.  At least one of these organisations, I recall, circularised all Deputies with an alternative plan for social security.</P>
    <P>The whole plan for the solution of the problems of social security occupied a space of a quarto-sized sheet of printed paper.  We have all to recognise that it is a complex problem, a problem which could not be solved quickly, and, judging from the point of view of the achievements of past Governments, it was solved by the present administration with far greater expedition than that with which anything comparable was dealt with in bygone years.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been made applicable to the largest possible number of people.  Fianna Fáil Deputies have raised&mdash;perhaps more particularly Deputy P.D. Lehane has raised this issue, as well as Deputy Cogan and, to some extent, Deputy Flynn&mdash;the question of how the small farmer, the self-employed artisan or small contractor stands in relation to this Bill. Is it suggested by any Deputy that if it were possible to devise a satisfactory scheme whereby that section of our people could be provided for, that would not be done?  In all the wealth of statements and the propaganda attempted to be made, we have not heard a single suggestion as to how that section can be brought in.  How can the small farmer be brought in? How can one determine when the small farmer is unemployed, when he employs himself?  How can one determine what contribution should be payable by that section when we take into consideration the fact that the employee in industry or agriculture, the wage worker, who may be earning over £3 10s. 0d. per week, will pay under the scheme a contribution of 3/6 and his employer a further 3/6, making 7/- in all?  How can one get a contribution from the small farmer or self-employed person to equal that contribution and to make the same benefits available?</P>
    <P>That is a problem to which the Fianna Fáil Party might have applied <Col N="100" /> themselves when telling us about the great scheme which was supposed to be on the stocks when this Minister took office.  We were told at various times that the road was made easy for the Tánaiste by virtue of the fact that a great deal of preparatory work had been done in the Department prior to the change of Government on the formulation of a comprehensive scheme.  We all accepted that there was something in that, but what did we find?  We found that there was nothing in it.  We found that the scheme propounded at a late hour on the night of the introduction of this Bill was a very poor, belated and half-hearted attempt to justify the prolonged Fianna Fáil propaganda of the previous three and a half years.</P>
    <P>We have got a scheme which does not claim to be the be-all and end-all of the endeavours of the Irish people in the matter of social security.  The Tánaiste has very truly said that this is not the last day of the Irish race, but those of us who have had some experience over a number of years of the working of the existing social welfare legislation in relation to national health benefits, unemployment benefits, old age pensions and so on, will recognise, if we are honest, that it does represent a very big step forward.  Will anybody deny that the provisions in relation to maternity, the provisions in relation to payments to women expecting to be confined and, after confinement, the payment on the birth of a child, are very big advances?  Will anybody deny that it is a very great and necessary thing, and something which is long overdue, that, when a worker's family is stricken by death, they will get something to help to pay the undertaker? I do not think anybody can deny either that the amount to be paid by way of unemployment benefit, 50/- to a married man with two children, is a very big advance on the amount provided at present.</P>
    <P>The Opposition fell into serious error in regard to this Bill inasmuch as they proceeded in this matter, as they have been proceeding in every matter, on the policy of attacking this Government, no matter what it does, purely <Col N="101" /> for the sake of trying to damage it politically.  They burned their boats two or three years ago when they first heard of this Bill and they had to try to justify themselves in some way. Their attempt at justification has been shown up to the country as being, as I described it, half-hearted and insincere.  They must know that this Bill does represent the best that can be done in existing circumstances. Attempts have been made to suggest that these advantages I have referred to, these improvements in payments, could be made available without any increase in the existing contribution. If that were so, it would be a very good thing; but I am satisfied that the Tánaiste had the advice of people best qualified to know, actuarial advice, on that matter and that, in fact, what is being done now, or the amount of the contribution being asked, is the best possible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>What does it mean?  It means that the worker earning over £3 10s. 0d. per week will pay an additional 1/7 per week in order to enjoy the benefits set out in the Bill, and, to my mind, that is not unreasonable, particularly in view of the expansion of the trade union movement and steps being taken to ensure that workers will get increased wages to enable them to meet increased charges of this kind.  I was glad to hear Deputy Sweetman point to the fact that, whether Deputies are against or in favour of the Bill, it means a redistribution of the wealth of the country, and, with a redistribution of wealth in this manner, there is an incentive to greater production.  It is a far cry from the days when employers and those interested in getting production for profit believed that the only way to achieve that end was to pay the lowest possible wage for the longest possible working day.</P>
    <P>It has become accepted now that, in order to get the best results from workers, fair wages must be paid, decent conditions must be observed and there must be a reasonable working day.  This Bill represents, in my mind, an inducement to the worker, in a very concrete, a very solid, way, to increase production.  Increased production, as we very well know, is the <Col N="102" /> keystone upon which our future prosperity must be based.  It is a good thing, also, that it represents a departure from the cry which we have been listening to over a long number of years for increased production, without any reference to the rights of workers.  This Bill gives the workers advantages and rights that they have not hitherto enjoyed on a scale which it was not thought possible could be achieved within so short a period of the life of this Government.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the increased, non-contributory, old age pension.  It has become axiomatic that politicians have an epidermis that is not renowned for its tenderness. Fianna Fáil excelled in that respect because it is not so very long ago since they trooped into the Lobby to vote against an increase of 2/6 for old age pensioners at a time when old age pensioners were getting 12/6.  In 16 years of office, the Fianna Fáil Administration increased the old age pension by 3/6.</P>
    <P>When the next month has passed, this Government will have increased the old age pension by 7/6.  Deputy Lemass tried to hand off that fact by reference to the value of money to-day as compared with pre-war days, but there is not such a great difference in the value of money as between 1946 and the present.  Money lost its value largely during the years of the war, and in 1946 12/6 per week was a very meagre sum when it came to a question of buying the essentials of life.  One pound per week in this year will not afford to old age pensioners all that they should get but, at any rate, it does represent an earnest and an evidence of the desire of this Administration, of the Tánaiste and of the Party to which I belong to see that the best that can be done in the circumstances will be done for these people.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the workers of the country get down to the bones of this scheme they will realise its advantages. The scheme has been clouded by propaganda from the day of its birth.  A smokescreen of propaganda has billowed over the country from the time it was first mentioned, generated partly by the Fianna Fáil organisation, to a great extent by employers' <Col N="103" /> organisations, and to some extent by misinformed and perhaps wellintentioned people.  When we come to vote on this measure, as a result of the debates which have occurred in this House, the winds of truth will have swept that smoke cloud away and the minds of the workers will be very clear as to what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that much of the criticism which has been levelled against the Tánaiste on the score of this Bill is the kind of criticism which is designed to ensure that the old system of <i>laissez faire</i> will prevail and that there will be no change, no improvement, or as little as possible, in the conditions of workers.  This Bill does represent, as I have said, a very big improvement.</P>
    <P>I want to refer especially to agricultural workers.  Deputy Ormonde, like myself, is spending his first session in this House.  Perhaps he does not remember what has happened in other years.  I have occasion to remember, especially in regard to agricultural workers.  This is the first time in the history of this State that agricultural workers will become entitled to unemployment benefit.  Agricultural workers, that is, those earning wages in agriculture as distinct from the families of farmers, number some 100,000.  If one takes their families into account, I suppose the figure of 250,000 would not be an exaggerated one when speaking of that particular section of the community. A quarter of a million human beings, who never benefited before, will benefit by this Bill in respect of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Judged from any point of view, the Bill is one which should be accepted by the Dáil.  Apparently, Fianna Fáil, having burnt their boats, cannot very well turn back; they must find some excuse for going into the Lobby.  I am quite sure that there are members of the Opposition who will not be too happy about that.  If I were in their shoes, in that position, no power on earth would induce me to vote against a progressive measure of this kind, because a vote against it, no matter what excuse is given, is a vote to put it out, a vote to destroy it, a vote to keep workers in their present position, <Col N="104" /> in which the social security that they enjoy is social security of only a limited kind, and, in many cases, social security only in name.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Tánaiste because of this Bill.  A tremendous amount of work and effort has been put into it, much more, I would venture to say, than ever has been put into a measure of this kind since the establishment of this State.  I feel that when the Bill passes through the Dáil, as pass it will&mdash;there is no doubt about that; pass into law it will&mdash;and when it is placed out of danger, on the Statute Book, the workers will bless the day when it was introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking some time ago in Cork and defending the present measure, the Tánaiste informed us that the Government could not take out of the national kitty something that was not in it and that intelligence demanded that any scheme of social security must be based on the realities of life in Ireland.  A good many people think that it is based, perhaps, on some idea of a fool's paradise rather than on the realities of life as they confront a great many of our people at the present time.  Whether that be so or not, the fact is that even the Tánaiste, now that he has acquired some sense of responsibility, realises that there is a limit to what you can do in the way of providing for extra services.  There is, first, the limit of what the country as a whole can afford. Different people will have different ideas but, last year, when the total bill for national and local taxation came to some 25 per cent. of the national income, the Minister for Finance suggested that that was about the limit that should be reached.  This year, the figure seems to be about 35 per cent.  That is on the existing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other services clamouring for attention.  We have not had the problem of rearmament in this country and, in that way, we have escaped heavy obligations which, if we had to face them, would create serious upsets and call for very serious adjustments in our economy.  There is then the normal expenditure of the State which goes ahead by leaps and bounds. <Col N="105" /> There is the demand for educational reform, for the raising of the school-leaving age, an extension of education, free secondary education and even free university education.  We used to hear a great deal of that.  There are also the health services.  I do not know what the cost of these might be eventually but the figure of £12,000,000 has been mentioned as being the total cost of the scheme that has been envisaged.  It seems to me that as well as keeping an eye on the proportion of the national income and of the citizen's wage or salary which is going to be appropriated for State services, there is also the important question of the priority in which the money will be spent.  Is it going to be spent on the basis of dealing first with the claims of those who are in a position to organise and compel attention to their claims?  Is it to be on the basis of these organised groups or sections securing what they have in mind, perhaps at the expense of the rest of the community, or are priorities to be determined on the basis of the needs of particular classes?</P>
    <P>The old poor law system, whatever its defects may have been, was at any rate based on the idea of need&mdash;the needs of individuals.  Now it is the needs of particular classes and sections that are in question and it is forgotten that in some of these sections, classes and groups there are very many individuals, perhaps the majority, who do not require to have these services provided for them, who have not asked for them and who might very well say that they could make better arrangements if left to their own devices&mdash;arrangements, for example, for their old age.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in his Second Reading speech that there was no necessity for a scheme of social security &ldquo;if a living wage were a reality but the day of the living wage has not arrived.&rdquo;  What is a living wage and how far have we succeeded in reaching the goal of a living wage? Is it that we are perpetually chasing something that eludes us, something that we shall never attain or that is not, in fact, attainable?  Has it been attained in nationalised industry, in Great Britain for example?  We were <Col N="106" /> told that all the defects of private ownership and so on, would be rectified under public ownership.  Does anybody now believe that under public ownership alone, in contradistinction to private ownership, you are going to arrive at a position, just by nationalising industry, where you will be able to pay a living wage?</P>
    <P>Social economists recognise, whether in Great Britain or in any other country, that you have to gear up the productivity of the country and the productive level in order to be able to pay higher wages and that, in the long run, the incentives you give by way of higher wages or otherwise will have to be met by a consciousness on the part of the workers that the higher wage can only be got through greater production. That consciousness may in due course, in this new shape of society that we now seem to be faced with, eventually lead to a sense of responsibility in these matters, which unfortunately has been very often lacking up to the present.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted, I think, that workers' wages should be sufficient to satisfy their everyday living needs, sufficient to support the worker and his family.  The State has done a certain amount by way of various measures, in particular in regard to the provision of houses, so that it cannot be said that, even long before our time, there was not a realisation that the lower-paid workers and those in need of protection and assistance, should get such assistance.  In our time also you have the organisation of workers carried on, on a great scale. You have tremendous organisations containing thousands of members and you have machinery available by which, through arbitration, conciliation or some State machinery such as the Labour Court, you have processes of wage-fixing.  On the whole there has been an advance, a steady advance all the time, sometimes somewhat slow perhaps, but at other times operating with greater speed.  In other countries, while recognising that a fair wage was the ideal, the position was that the wage that industry could pay was not sufficient to provide for the workers' family needs, and you had a system of family allowances.  In France, this <Col N="107" /> started through endowment by groups of employers of mutual aid societies. There were contributions to these societies based on earnings.  It was fairly typical that to the funds of these mutual aid societies the employer contributed 10 per cent. and the employee 6 per cent. and out of these funds the workers were paid a certain amount. If the wage was not sufficient for a worker with several children, these funds served the admirable purpose of providing him with an increase in his wages.  He might get 5 per cent. on his wages for the first child, 10 per cent. on the second child and 15 per cent. on the third child.  I think there was a certain advantage in that, as in every scheme formulated by workers and employers in a particular industry you get a co-operation that you would not get in a State scheme.  I think you will get a sense of responsibility among all concerned that you may not get under a State scheme.  I think it could be claimed for such a scheme that it would be managed at least as efficiently, having regard to the fact that the numbers would be smaller, that all concerned and contributing to it would be <i>au fait</i> with the circumstances and would take an active part in it in much the same way as the suppliers to an Irish creamery organisation society meet regularly and know what is going on.</P>
    <P>We have examples of these schemes in this country.  In some of the Scandinavian countries some amelioration was made in the case of large families of wage earners either by way of a rent reduction or otherwise. I think that in Sweden, for example, they had a system by which the larger the family the larger was the reduction in the rent.  That is one of the weaknesses of this system which came from Germany to England and which has gone on ever since Mr. Lloyd George established it.  When he did that, he pretended that the people were getting 9d. for 4d.  In fact, we all realise now that we are paying pound for pound, and that if the beneficiaries do not pay, then the contributors or the State and the taxpayer, or both combined, will have to provide the finances.  That seems to me to be in line with the <Col N="108" /> tradition that we should think in these matters in terms of the individual.  It is a bad old legacy which seems to have come in here from Britain, where the idea of family endowment was only taken up very late in the day, and that the Minister and the Government are subscribing to it.  Instead of helping the family and of trying to endow it more generously than it has been endowed up to the present, we might really call this Bill a family disendowment measure.  Except for the family of two children, where allowances are made in case of sickness and unemployment, there is no provision for the larger family.  In fact, I think it can be shown that the larger it is the more unfavourable is its position under these proposals relative to the family of one or two children.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that poverty is generally associated with the larger families just as the worst occupations are generally associated with the larger families.  The people with more children are worse off.  During the period when children are going to school there is a very heavy burden thrown upon the family, particularly in times like the present, when food and clothing are very expensive.  It may be that people expect a little more now than they used to long years ago. Habits have changed.  Fruit and other things that were very rare then are perhaps in more general use now.  But, on the other hand, we see from the nutritional report, to which reference has already been made in the House, that in the City of Dublin, for example, the consumption of milk is not satisfactory. Two classes of families, the larger family in what is called the slum area and the larger family in the lower-paid artisan class&mdash;even that class which many would describe as having had its position substantially improved &mdash;are quoted as examples where, in the case, I think, of three children, the consumption of milk is insufficient. In that report, too, fault was found with the monotony of the diet.</P>
    <P>We all know that milk and fruit, if they possibly can be obtained, are necessary for children, but unfortunately they cannot be.  It seems extraordinary that, at this hour of the day, we should talk about social security and ignore completely the <Col N="109" /> family which is the foundation of society, the family which, under the Constitution, is described as receiving special protection from the State, and the mother of the family who is described as the person who must receive special consideration and special assistance from the State so that she may not find it necessary to leave her home and children to go out and seek employment in order to find money to provide for them.</P>
    <P>The falling value of money certainly has pressed hardest on these, the very poorest, as well as the largest, families. I cannot understand why, if we are so much interested in the welfare of the people, we should ignore completely the growing generation.  After all, they are the real asset of the nation.  They are what we have to depend upon in the future.  There is no reference good, bad or indifferent in these proposals to the children's allowance scheme, and from the very beginning there has been no suggestion of doing anything.  The Minister has not even considered it necessary, or worth while, to pay any lip service to the idea of additional allowances for large families.  Therefore, we are going to be faced with the position in the future that we have had in the past, that those people who have four, five or more children will know that for every additional child they have, certainly above the third, the cost of bringing up that child is going to be so serious that there is going to be a question as to whether they can afford it.  Surely we ought to revise our attitude in this matter considering that the numbers of larger families in question is not very great.  According to the figures which the Minister supplied to me, two-fifths of the families seem to have three children, one-fourth have four children, one-sixth have five children and one-fifth have six or more children.  With the increase which the Government proposes to give, by way of amending the means test for old age pensioners, we shall be spending nearly £8,500,000 upon old age pensions, which is nearly four times as much as we are spending on children's allowances&mdash;but then, as was mentioned, these children have no votes.  If they had votes, of course, the boot might be on the other foot.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I come now to the aged.  I think there is a definite distinction which should be drawn between those who are living alone in rooms with nobody to look after them and those who are still in the fortunate position that they are living with their families and can, therefore, have the family attention and care that that means for them. We know that there is a class of old age pensioner who is living alone and who, perhaps, has no friends.  If we could do more for them I think we ought to do it.  I do not necessarily mean that it is entirely a cash question: it is a question of care.  It is a question of having visitors of the type of hospital almoners&mdash;trained workers who are in a position to discuss their problems with people who are afflicted or aged, who can try to help them, to secure some little comfort and, above all, who can give them the support they require morally by their sympathy and their understanding.  It has to be said, with regard to that class, that the rents they have to pay are a considerable item in their meagre housekeeping allowances.  Under the system that we have, no special arrangements can be made to deal with that problem unless it is being done by way of home assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne takes us to task because more was not done in our Administration but, according to the Minister, we are to have more Social Welfare Bills so that it is doubtful if any of us here present, whatever our views about the immediate measure may be, will see the day when we will be able to find everybody satisfied with what, in fact, is being done. Before we left office there was 15/- all round, and 2/6 for those special cases of people in need, through the home assistance authority.  This matter is important because of the very large size of the provision for retirement pensions in these proposals&mdash;leaving aside for one moment the £8,500,000 for old age pensions and looking at this question of persons who reach the age of 65.  We find that from 1901 to 1946 the number of persons between 15 and 64 years of age decreased by 10 per cent.: we lost 222,000.  Of the number under 14 years of age, the school-going population, we lost <Col N="111" /> 150,000: the number in that class went down by 15 per cent.  That means a fairly substantial decline in the population of educational age or of working age in a small country such as this.  Every man and every woman who reaches maturity should count, and we ought to try to get the most out of them.</P>
    <P>However, with regard to the class over 65 years of age there was an increase of over 50 per cent.  They increased by 105,000&mdash;and the increase will be even greater in the future because, as has been pointed out&mdash;unless some catastrophe occurs&mdash;with the spread of medical science and the improved standards, the expectation of life has increased.  It is calculated that in Britain they will have double the numbers they had when the Government introduced the proposals based on the Beveridge Scheme there.  Here, it seems to me that the number who reach 65 will be double in ten years. According to the figures, you will have 25,000 in receipt of the retirement pension in the first year.  In 20 years you will have 74.3 thousand.  You will have three times as many in 20 years in receipt of the retirement pension as you had at the beginning.  Of course, the cost rises rapidly and steeply on account of that&mdash;while the children's allowances, presumably, will remain at the figure of £2,250,000 unless this Government or whatever Government may be there changes its mind about this fundamental matter.  In the first year we are going to pay £2.1 million in retirement pensions.  In the fifth year it will be £3.65 million.  In the tenth year it will be £4.95 million&mdash;nearly £5,000,000.  In the twentieth year the figure will be £6,750,000.  Therefore, this element of retirement pensions is by far the biggest factor in the very heavy expenditure which is necessitated by the present scheme.  The total cost of this scheme is to be £10,500,000 in the first year; £12,600,000 in the fifth year; £14,250,000 in the tenth year, and £16.6 million in the twentieth year.  I do not know whether that is the maximum figure or not because the Minister has not answered the question I put him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> When I say &ldquo;ultimate cost&rdquo; I mean the ultimate cost on the basis of the present benefits and the present scheme and if the actuary can tell the cost in 20 years' time he can certainly give some idea of what the ultimate cost will be.  I hope I am not wronging the actuary.  People like Deputy Keane find fault with me because I point out the heavy expenditure and additional taxation which will be involved but I am only repeating what the Minister for Finance has stated very frequently and I consider it my duty to do so and the duty of every Deputy here.  It is not merely a question of adding on millions; the millions have to be found and as I said in the beginning there is a limit to the total amount that can be found.  If, as Deputy Lemass said, the House were left to determine the issues freely and fairly from the point of view of what was best for the country, would they spend the money in the way proposed under the present measure?  An important consideration is whether the money should be spent in that way and whether the country would approve of it.</P>
    <P>If you believe that you will ultimately get value by way of incentives from expenditure on a scheme of this type, if it will be worth the money involved by getting from the workers more co-operation, better returns, higher productivity and a great addition to the national wealth, then it is surely necessary to make it clear to them since they are the people who must pay for it that they are not getting something for nothing and that in some cases such as unemployment benefit only 10 per cent. will ever draw benefit.  In the case of national health insurance the number is higher and will go higher with the higher benefits. Then you have the problem of malingering. There are 20 per cent. who at one time or another may draw national health benefit but generally speaking you must have at least four or five workers who will not draw any benefit at all until they reach retirement age.  Those who are now entering employment will pay 3/6 a week until they reach that age and they may not draw any benefit for unemployment <Col N="113" /> or sickness during that whole period.</P>
    <P>The question is whether those people consider that it is worth the contributions because not alone will they have to pay the contributions but a proportion, and a larger proportion if we lump in assistance services with the insurance services proper, will have to pay when old age pensions, education or anything else demands additional expenditure.  They may have to pay if the wide net which has now been spread over industrial workers for income-tax reaches them.  I venture to say that the single man who may look forward to a benefit of 24/- a week as against 22/6 at the present time will wonder whether it is worth the extra 3/6 contribution he will have to pay.  I cannot say at the moment whether a man with £3 10s. a week would have to pay income-tax; probably not even if he were a single man, but certainly if he is in the £4 10s. or £5 10s. class, he will have to pay something.  As well as that, as well as the contributions and the income-tax, he will have to pay unless he is a non-smoker, a nondrinker and a non-dancer and does not attend race meetings or greyhound races.  Even if he only smokes a few packets of cigarettes every week he will have to contribute substantially to meet the additional expenditure.  To the extent that it cannot be raised through his direct contributions and the contributions of his employer it will have to be made good by the State and that can only be done through taxation.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows the demands of a population that seems to be ageing are higher.  When the numbers in the upper age groups tend to be greater than those in the lower age groups you are not replacing your working population and with the diminishing population you must provide extra amounts for the older people who are in a very strong position politically as we see from their attempts to get something more than they have been getting.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of cost which, let us not deceive ourselves, must be met in some way or other, I would quote the British Government actuary reporting on the Beveridge scheme (paragraph 13, page 180):</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" />&ldquo;If the actual rates of mortality experienced in the future are substantially below those on the standard taken, more particularly at the older ages, the population of pensionable age may be materially in excess of my estimates.  But the future is obviously very speculative, and after consideration of the statistics of the last 30 years, and in view of the uncertainties due to the war I have thought it premature, for the present purpose, to modify the relatively light rates of mortality disclosed in recent years in such a way as to incorporate a loading on the Estimates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards disability benefits, I have assumed that an appreciably higher claim rate will be experienced than that now prevailing in the national health insurance scheme, <i>inter alia</i>, on account of the substantial increases proposed in the rates of benefit....  Moreover, these benefits are payable without reduction in cases of prolonged disability. They are thus much greater than the present health insurance rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to give the figures:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Past experience of sickness insurance&mdash;both State and voluntary &mdash;leads to the conclusion that, even with the support of a satisfactory system of medical certification and adequate measures of control by sick visiting and by medical referees, these high benefits will result in materially increased claim rates, especially in respect of prolonged incapacity.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While it is true that as a result of the comprehensive health and rehabilitation service which is to be provided in case of the more limited existing medical benefit, a substantial improvement in the health of the community should be secured in due course, it does not necessarily follow that the cost of benefit will be correspondingly abated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So we are in the position that while we are spending millions on health services, perhaps having a State medical service costing £12,000,000 a year, <Col N="115" /> we have no proof that we shall not have to pay increased sums by way of sickness and disablement benefit under the scheme.  The British actuary says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is due to the fact that under the altered arrangements there may be a tendency on the part of doctors to require longer periods off work in order to secure complete recovery from the effects of an illness, and there will also be less incentive than in the past to return to work owing to loss of income.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps there will not be sufficient accommodation in the hospitals and the doctor will have to rush them out in order to find room for others waiting; but in that case he may not consider it appropriate to ask them to report for work.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this report&mdash;seeing that I have to depend on it to a great extent, when we cannot get copies of a similiar report which ought to have been provided&mdash;I would quote further:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;<i>Position after</i> 1965.&mdash;I have not carried my estimates beyond the year 1965.  There is no doubt, however, that estimates of the position after that year would show a further growth in the proportion of social security expenditure to be provided from the Exchequer as compared with the proportions met from the contributions of insured persons and their employers, for the following reasons.  First, the cost of the scheme will still be increasing substantially, mainly on account of pensions, because (1) the aged population will be increasing, and (2) the average rate of pension will be rising as pensioners then existing and receiving a reduced transitional rate are replaced by others receiving the full rate.  Second, the contributing population will probably be stationary or declining.  Thus, for many years at least, the whole of the additional expenditure, i.e., a growing proportion of the total expenditure, will fall to be met from the Exchequer under the method of finance envisaged in the plan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, no matter how many questions I put down to the Tánaiste I dare say <Col N="116" /> I could never get him to say what the British actuary has said in an official publication, of which I suppose millions of copies have been sold and which is there for everybody to read. If we are not to have the same position in this country, then let us know on what the hypotheses are based that we are not going to have it.</P>
    <P>The question then arises: &ldquo;Are we to compel those who have made other and suitable provision for themselves to participate in these schemes?&rdquo; They may consider that the superannuation schemes into which they have entered, or whatever provision they have made for themselves individually, are superior.  As well as asking ourselves that question, why we should compel these people to come into the State scheme when they feel that their own scheme is better, we must ask ourselves why we should find it necessary to have the position that those reaching 65 must be deemed to be persons who must retire from work.  In view of the figures I have read out and which everyone who has looked at this population question knows, in view of the shortage of the labour corps, in view of the possibility of a decline in the numbers of the working population, would it not be advisable to keep on those who have been trained and experienced and who have spent their lives at particular occupations, and let them continue as long as they can?  It has been accepted in Britain that they should be left at work as long as possible.</P>
    <P>An organisation over there which cannot be said to be in any way backward in propagating Socialist views&mdash; because it is a pioneer of Socialism in Britain&mdash;the Fabian Society, giving evidence before a commission dealing with this matter, recommended that an allowance should be paid to persons who reached the age of 65 to continue at work, that it would be better to do that, in view of the need for keeping the largest numbers possible on at work instead of retiring them.  Though the Fabian Society had no doubts about where this retirement pension scheme should come in the general scheme of things, they thought that it should rank behind other social services <Col N="117" /> and even behind the educational service.  They agreed&mdash;and I think we can all agree&mdash;that at the age of 65, or earlier, if there be a case of need or disability or loss of capacity to work, there should be full provision made for the person concerned.  I think that is what Deputy Dr. Ryan had in mind in his scheme, and I think we could accept the view that, if our circumstances permitted, such persons should not be treated less favourably than those who remain on.</P>
    <P>The British were daunted by this problem of retirement pensions and the formidable expenditure of hundreds of millions &mdash; in 1945, retirement pensions, £120,000,000 and in 1965, £300,000,000.  Daunted by those figures, they determined to see whether they could reconcile them with the principle which the Beveridge Report had laid down of making the scheme comprehensive for all citizens. &ldquo;In respect of both the persons covered and their needs, the plan covers all citizens.&rdquo;  That was the promise and that was the principle that was laid down, but modifications had to be made.  If you set out to do something that you cannot do in the long run, you may find yourself in the position that the ex-President of the United States found himself in, when he said recently: &ldquo;You can have social security&mdash;and a ration with it.&rdquo; It was not possible to do it and a compromise had to be effected over a transitional period of stages, over 20 years.  It was determined that eventually those who reached the age of 65 should be brought on to the full plan, the full pension, but it would take 20 years to do it.</P>
    <P>In an Act passed in 1946, provision was made by which a weekly bonus of 1/- would be paid to workers reaching the age of 65 for every half-year they continued to remain gainfully occupied up to a total bonus of 10/- per week after five years' additional work beyond the age of 65 for men and 60 for women.</P>
    <P>It seems clear to me that the complete ignoring of the recipients of children's allowances and of the members of larger and poorer families in the present scheme is a proof that there are and must be other classes <Col N="118" /> that will suffer if you go ahead and spend more than is necessary, certainly more than seems to be right if a proper balance is to be kept in the scheme between the claims of the family and the claims of the aged. Perhaps a scheme will be utimately devised which will cater fairly for all classes, including both the aged and the young.  But, at the present time, however the aged may be doing under these proposals, it is quite clear that the family is being completely ignored.</P>
    <P>I cannot allow this important occasion to pass without dealing with the point of view that this scheme is unfair and unbalanced in that it does not benefit all sections of the community. When we remember that the contribution from the employees will be declining, contrary to what Deputy Sweetman has stated in the Press&mdash; during the first year, as I calculate, employees will be paying 30 per cent. and that, over a 20-year period on the figures available, will be reduced to 20 per cent.&mdash;there will be a deficiency, because the Tánaiste to-day in reply to a parliamentary question reminded me that, according to the White Paper, the total amount that will be got from contributions will be £7,250,000.  But, as I have shown, the cost of the scheme is to go up from £10,500,000 to £12.6 million in five years, £14,250,000 in ten years and £16.6 million in 20 years.  Of that £16.6 million, £7,500,000 will be by way of contribution.  The remaining £9.4 million will have to be got from the State.  Therefore, even on the present basis of the scheme with contributions being paid, in 20 years you will be asking the general taxpayer to contribute £9 for every £7 that both the employee and employer combined are contributing towards the scheme.</P>
    <P>That is a clear proof that the general taxpayer, apart from the old age pensions, would be paying the lion's share and it is wrong to suggest that there is an even one-third.  Of course some of our friends think that £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 does not mean anything one way or the other.  But let us try to be accurate.  In the first year, the figures would be £3,250,000 from the employees, £4,000,000 from the employers <Col N="119" /> and £4,000,000 from the State, and, as I have shown, while the combined contributions would remain at the figure of £7,250,000, there would be a deficit.  The Tánaiste could not tell me what the deficit would be.  That deficit has to be got from the Exchequer, from the taxpayer.  As in a general scheme like old age pensions it seems reasonable that it should be paid from general taxation since everybody is benefiting, in the same way it would seem to follow that, if much the greater proportion of the cost is coming from the State as against that coming from the contributors, there ought to be an effort to bring in the remainder of the community, whether you give them the same benefits or lesser benefits.  At any rate, the community as a whole is paying the major share and why should any section therefore be omitted?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste told us in his speech that the employer does not benefit from employing persons at a lower rate of wages than £3 10s.  No doubt, it would be a greater virtue in the Tánaiste's eyes if the employer could pay £4, £5, £6 or £7.  But is there not the question in regard to the individual employer, as in regard to the State, of how far he can go, how much he can pay?  The Tánaiste tells us through the White Paper that the farmer who employs a few men, if he is paying them less than £3 10s., and that may not continue very long, should not get away with anything, that it is his moral duty to pay the 3/6 a week whether the sum is under £3 10s. or over £3 10s.</P>
    <P>Although the Tánaiste represents a rural constituency, he told us that the farmer was a factory owner.  We used to hear a great deal about those miserable factories that were started under the Fianna Fáil régime in the back streets and laneways and so on.  But think of all these factories, think of the tractors, the combined harvesters and the thousands of pounds invested in capital equipment.  Perhaps the Tánaiste, like the Minister for Agriculture, dreams of the prairies of America.  But, if we come down to figures, we find that the position is not anything like that.  We have 378,000 <Col N="120" /> holdings; 165,000 are in the congested districts; 31 per cent. of these are under £4 valuation; 32 per cent. are from £4 to £10 valuation.  In other words, in the congested districts 63 per cent. of the farms are under £10 valuation.  But take the districts that are not congested.  You have 212,000 holdings, 28 per cent. under £4 valuation, 26 per cent. between £4 and £10, and 52 per cent. under £10 valuation, or, taking the country as a whole, we have about 53 per cent. of all our holdings under £10 valuation and we have 60 per cent., or thereabouts, of uneconomic holdings.  There then is the farmer, a property owner with an agricultural factory; he may be a plutocrat, one of these gentlemen with a gold watch chain swinging across his capacious paunch, as compared with the toiling masses&mdash;the toiling masses that the Minister has so often told us must be provided with full security against all the hazards of life.</P>
    <P>The farmers are a very important section of our people.  There are about 500,000 altogether engaged in agriculture. A certain number of them, stated to be about 120,000 paid agricultural workers, are expected to pay up to 3/6 per week.  They will be no more able to pay up than will the employer who is sometimes not very much better off so far as cash resources are concerned than the men who are working for him.</P>
    <P>This land of ours is producing the wealth upon which our future depends and all our progress and all our schemes; 80 per cent. of our exports are based upon the land.  Nevertheless, the net agricultural output per male engaged in farm work in 1948 was not very much more than half that of the industrial worker, £210 as against £378. The Minister has told us that it is necessary to have schemes like this because they prevent the growth of conditions which would encourage the spread of Communism.  Perhaps the United States of America has a different view and we depend a good deal upon the United States of America, not alone we but a number of other people who talk a great deal about social services and social security. It would be interesting to know how far social security would go without <Col N="121" /> Marshall Aid.  It seems to me to be a kind of Maginot Line which it would not be very hard to pierce should some cataclysm descend upon us or some depression such as we have had experience of in the past.  From where will all these £ millions of deficiency come? If there is a depression, one cannot increase the contributions even if one wishes to do so.  Will taxation be increased in those circumstances to provide for these £ millions of deficiency in the scheme?</P>
    <P>The Minister tries to put us off by telling us that such things will not arise for five years.  If we have a proper idea of our responsibility in looking after the national housekeeping we will not wait for these troubles to arise five or ten years hence.  We will look at them in advance and try to make provision for them.  If we do not do that, as I have tried to stress, we will simply retard progress and hold up our advance because we are mortgaging the future finances and revenues of the country to a particular scheme.  One can do that for a certain length of time but ultimately one finds one has to call a halt.  The question then is, who will suffer?  What part of the scheme will feel the axe?</P>
    <P>It is a very extraordinary thing that in Great Britain they have been able to cover persons who are gainfully self-employed. I think it is a very important principle.  If we believe in the doctrine that property ought to be more widely distributed and if we want to combine that idea with the idea of improved social benefits, we certainly ought not to allow those who are in possession of some little property, and we have stated that principle in regard to old age pensions where we have tried to meet the position of those who, through their own thrift, have built up some reserves and some resources for the evening of their lives, suffer through lack of provision for them.  If we recognise that principle in regard to old age pensions, why should we not recognise it with regard to other benefits such as sickness and disability?  It has been done in Great Britain.  There, there are 2,500,000 independent workers who are insured.  They have contribution cards. Their insurance is higher.  Perhaps <Col N="122" /> that would not be possible of achievement as Deputy Dr. Ryan, who knows more about these matters than I do, believes.  If that be the case, then the only alternative seems to be to provide corresponding benefits.  In Great Britain, at any rate, there is insurance against disability for persons who are gainfully self-employed, so apparently it has been capable of accomplishment over there.  Sickness benefit is available to the self-employed on the same basis as to the employed contributors. As regards the technical difficulty of dealing with disability and long sickness and as to estimating whether or not they are bona fide, if provision can be made in the case of the ordinary insured worker there seems to be no reason why it should not be done in the case of those who are working for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is recognised in the White Paper that the principle of contributions is really a form of taxation.  It is recognised in the social security White Paper that it is merely a question as to whether what we call contributions should be raised either by a tax on the individual employed and the person who employs him or should be raised through general taxation.  In the Government White Paper on income and expenditure insurance contributions are now regarded as part of the general total of taxation.  There is no doubt whatever but that in wage bargaining in the future, if the employee cannot make the employer responsible for his contribution he will at least try to compel him to increase his wage to meet the level of the contribution. That issue will certainly arise in future industrial relations between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out frequently in the debate that these contributions will ultimately be passed on.  If the employer has to pay, he will not pay out of his own pocket.  He will pass on the cost by way of an increase in prices.  There will be an automatic increase which will pass on through costs into prices and ultimately on to the cost of living.  If something is saved in one direction there will be a loss in another direction.  Whether it will be perceptible or not, there must <Col N="123" /> be some reduction in the standard of living.</P>
    <P>Taxation, if it is to be equal and fair, must rise gradually, and the people with the higher incomes should pay a larger proportion, as in the case of super-tax and income-tax and so on. Here in these contributions we are making the man at the bottom of the ladder pay proportionately a higher percentage of his income in the form of a contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to strengthen my remarks by saying that no less an authority than Lord Beveridge, having considered the criticisms of his scheme when it was first published, said the big criticism was this flat-rate contribution. Flat-rate contributions are an undesirable form of taxation, because they take no account of the capacity to pay.  That was the chief criticism by experts, by those who were qualified to criticise the Beveridge proposals.  It is a concealed wages tax and it is passed on to the public, not once, but several times over, as has been pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Minister has recognised in the case of the agricultural workers that they cannot pay the same contributions as other sections.  I refer to those below £3 10s. 0d.  He did not find it possible, he said, to schedule the particular occupations.  There is an admission to that extent of the truth of what I am saying.  That had to be counter-balanced by smaller rates of benefit.  The Minister also spoke of the guarantee that a man has that when he pays his contribution he will get the benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Dr. Ryan, I cannot see that.  We know that even in Britain the benefits have either had to be curtailed or contributions increased when these large deficits made themselves apparent.  There is no way out of it <Col N="124" /> and, to the extent that it gives contributors the impression that they are getting something for nothing, that, in fact, they are going to get back the whole of what they are paying in, in the way of benefits, is it not misleading? May I ask the Minister is there a provision by which contributors will get back, at the end of their period of insurance, whatever is left from the total amount they have paid, after benefits have been deducted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said is that a person pays his contribution and certain risks are covered and he will have the satisfaction of knowing that, if he lives to a ripe old age, he will get a State pension from 65 onwards for himself and his wife.  Unless he suffers premature death, if he runs through the normal span of life, he will have received in benefits much more than he has paid.  A cursory glance at the scheme ought to convince the Deputy of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were so, the scheme would break down very early. We all know, whether we are <i>au fait</i> with the scheme or not, that the main purpose is to spread the risks, to bring in larger numbers.  The risks are very substantial and only by having still larger numbers bearing the responsibility for them can you face these risks. I suggest it gives the impression that this benefit is available as of right and that the contributor is entirely responsible when, in fact, the State and the contributor himself, as a taxpayer, are providing a very large proportion.</P>
      <P>It also gives the impression that you can avail of the scheme without working for it and that in some way or other this scheme is going to work of itself.  If you believe that the scheme is of value as an incentive, that it is going to increase the productivity of the country and increase our national wealth, then it seems to me you have to take steps to make that position clear and that you have to explain clearly to the workers in a way that has not been done either here or elsewhere that the success of the scheme, the possibility of improving it, depends to a large extent upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether you get that done through the present machinery and the cooperation you expect to get through <Col N="125" /> trade unions, or whether you get it from setting up a special organisation, such as has been so often suggested, of joint production committees, which would be able to come along and assure the people: &ldquo;These services have cost so many millions, but we can give you facts and figures to show that the wealth of the country has increased by millions more than that&rdquo;, well and good, but nothing has been done in that respect.  The people will have the impression when they are dealing with the State that it is all there for the taking, that it is merely a question of: &ldquo;Take it, and the more you can get the more success to you&rdquo;; or: &ldquo;Good luck to your elbow&rdquo;, as they say.  That, I am afraid, will be the position with a great many.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the workers are just as patriotic as any other section of the community, just as anxious to do their share if the position were explained to them.  Unfortunately, it has not been explained and they believe that these additional benefits and services can be provided and that somebody else is paying for them.  In fact, whatever way the payment is made, whatever way the contributions are provided and the deficiencies made up, we know it is they who will provide the vast bulk of the money in the long run.</P>

      <P>When Deputies speak in this House they usually follow Party lines.  I believe, however, that on this measure the views expressed by Deputies will, of necessity, be somewhat different from mere Party approaches. I believe the general approach will have a different tendency and the expressed word will have connection directly or indirectly with the environment and the surroundings in which Deputies live.  What is to be said on this Bill must, I believe, be somewhat different from the usual line that is taken here to suit a Party or an occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, let me say in all sincerity and earnestness that I sympathise with Deputy Dr. Ryan.  I had wondered why Deputy Dr. Ryan, when Minister in that Department, had not proceeded with such a scheme himself I am not saying that in an endeavour to claim political kudos but, <Col N="126" /> having heard Deputy Derrig, it just struck me what a woeful time Deputy Dr. Ryan would have had in offering any scheme if he had to put up with the destructive attitude and destructive criticisms of members such as Deputy Derrig.  I do not know where we actually stand in so far as that earlier this afternoon Deputy Lemass followed a line of thought completely different from that of Deputy Derrig. I personally believe that Deputy Lemass believes that at all costs he and his Party cannot afford to miss the bus.  I may be wrong, but that is my view.  After he had finished, other members of the Party stood up and the climax came when Deputy Derrig, in one breath, pointed out what was needed and followed that up by an argument to justify himself at any rate in saying that it would be impossible to make a success of any scheme.  Why should Deputy Derrig quote to us the example of a foreign State roughly 3,000 miles away?  If we are interested in social security and the welfare of our people, we cannot forget the fact that in these States and in the State mentioned by Deputy Derrig there were people queued up in bread lines some years ago.  If these States had social security, then their people would not have to go through the years of depression and misery they had to go through. Let Deputy Derrig remember that some of us, at any rate, speak with all sincerity.  Coming as we do from homes where we know what it is to have unemployment and sickness, we say that our approach to this Bill is not one of mere political propaganda. It is an approach which has been advocated by the Party of which I am a member all the years back.  No one will ever say that we can close our eyes to the hard realities of life, to the conditions under which the section that Deputy Derrig tries to say is not so all important, the working people, live.  They are the section that may be catered for most in this Bill, but yet they are the section that must be protected.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the question of the contribution by the workers. Take, for example, the position of a farm worker at the present time.  Are <Col N="127" /> the members not aware that a farm worker in any part of the Twenty-Six Counties of this small State is denied any advantage except the one, that is national health?  Is it a credit to the members of this House and to the Governments of the past to have to admit that a farm worker, in the case of unemployment, had nothing to fall back on except home assistance?  Will they say at this late hour that the few shillings the farm worker has now to pay is something too dear?  Are they willing to say that it would be better to leave the farm worker, in a period of unemployment, draw home assistance than to ask him, proud man as he is, thank God, to give his weekly contribution? Do we not know that, in the years past, as regards insurance companies and the money they are drawing in on insurance policies, a large proportion of the premiums paid on them come directly from the workers? Even though workers' wages may not be adequate, the workers have always realised the necessity of trying to the best of their ability to provide against the rainy day.  Therefore, workers will see through any propaganda that may be used against the scheme now.  They will see, and more important of all, farm workers will see that they are coming to a time, please God, when they can say that in the time of unemployment they can go to the labour exchange, where some of us ourselves at times had to go and draw unemployment benefits.  Let me say here and now that it was only when employment was not available and it was only as a last resort that the worker went to such places.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Dr. Ryan on the question of retiring at 65 or 70, I believe that that in itself is not even an open question. We know that the workers are not compelled to retire at 65 under this Bill, but why clamour and say that the workers should not of necessity have to retire at 65 years?  It may be correct to say that those of the professional classes may not have to retire at 65 years and that their conditions of life and environment may warrant them to continue further on. But down through the country the <Col N="128" /> answer that has always been given by the old man or old woman when they reached 70 and applied for the old age pensions was: &ldquo;Oh, 70; if we could have got it at 65 we know we would have some few years of enjoyment at the end of our lives.&rdquo;  Do not we know that a man or a woman, after working for 50 years, is entitled to retire? I say that any worker is entitled to retire at 65 years.  Let that be quite clear.</P>
    <P>On this point I may draw attention to the belated suggestions of would-be critics who claim, perhaps, themselves to be critics of a constructive character. I wish to give a quotation from the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 12th March, 1951.  I may say, in passing, that I am not going to judge on this quotation because I did not see what came before or after it.  I am quoting it simply in order to follow up the points expressed by others.  The quotation is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If there was any difficulty to-day in getting social services for the people who needed help from the community it was because some sections would not be honest.  If there were not people who wanted to live as drones on the community there would be no problem whatever about social services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, I am not going to express any views on the quotation, because I believe that if it were taken it might have a completely different sense in its context from that which it has as I see it before me.</P>
    <P>In the March issue of a famous or infamous&mdash;I leave the House to judge &mdash;magazine known as <i>Irish Industry</i>, this quotation was repeated and we find it finishing up with this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why must the careful, thrifty, honest section of the community be asked to provide social welfare for the drones and the dishonest?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems that, no matter how some of us may wish to get away from the bitterness and hatreds of the past, there are some in this country yet who are willing to express their views by word and deed in such a way as to cause utter confusion in the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>This magazine mentioned a few other points.  It referred to the dangers <Col N="129" /> of the Communist State and pointed to what it described as the dangers of this Bill, saying that the Communist State was one in which all citizens were considered children of the State.  It is, of course, a poor comparison between this measure and the measure promoted by a Communist State, but may I ask these would-be critics who try to tell us what is right and what is wrong if it is correct for us to say that, in the last analysis, the State is responsible for the citizens and that, as the father has the responsibility of the baby in the home, so, too, must the State, in the last analysis, bear the responsibility of both the father and the child.  If the father is unable to provide for that member of the home, it does not become any section of the community to deny the fundamental right of the State to say: &ldquo;It being our duty, we are determined to provide security for these members of our community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This magazine also states that the Bill, in its essence, is an attempt to induce our citizens to look to the State for everything and goes on to say that, instead of living and making provision for himself by his own labour, this Bill tends to make the citizen look to the State for his well-being.  It finishes up that line of argument with the statement that that is a false philosophy which merits condemnation.  They are apparently worried that the citizen will look to the State for protection and that this Bill will make drones of honest citizens; but if they want to go to the trouble, or if any critics inside or outside the House wish to go to the trouble, of finding out, they will find that the number of persons in insurable occupations in this State, on the basis of the return of unemployment books, in 1923, was 242,494 and that, in 1948, the figures were 476,539, a good increase in these years.  The number of those who claimed unemployment insurance in 1923 was 32,075 out of that total 242,494, while, in 1948, the number was 19,291, out of a total of 476,539.  It is quite clear that during these years the number of those employed increased greatly, while the number who claimed insurance benefit dropped considerably.  Taking the <Col N="130" /> figures for unemployment assistance in the years 1935 and 1949, the critics of this Bill, who apparently always find time to oppose any measure which is of benefit to the people, will find that, to the credit of the workers, there are fewer claiming now than in the past.</P>
    <P>When these critics and this journal, through its editor, speak of the danger of the workers living on the State they are ill-advised and any members of the House who follow the same train of thought are also ill-advised, because we can, in turn, ask them a question.  If they are worried about the number of workers living on the State, we can ask them the very simple question: how many workers during the years of the emergency faced the destruction and the miserable conditions of life in England to earn a living, and, during the same period, how many of our industrialists, who may be supporting this journal, emigrated to England?  They say that it is tyranny to ask those &ldquo;who are prepared to provide out of their own labour for their own medical services and other necessities to pay for giving social welfare free to those who can and ought to provide it themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do the public not know and do these critics not know that, it being a contributory scheme, it is by their contributions that the workers benefit from it?  Why should they, at this late hour, try to put across something which is so false as the suggestion that the workers will get something free by sponging on the State?  They admit that the proportion of citizens at present who evade their responsibilities is not large, but yet, in summing up, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are opposed to mulcting our citizens to provide money for those who live on the work of others.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our words in this House are expected to express the sincere and clear views we may hold, and I believe that no member of the House and no Party in the House can say that the attitude expressed by an individual or an organisation in those words is one which can, with any sense of justification, be described as true.  We could all speak hard here of the past, but I do not want to.  I believe that, in <Col N="131" /> relation to this Bill, it is far better for us to appreciate the advantages that will accrue from it.  If there is to be criticism, well and good.  If members of the Dáil are to be deafened by accusations, drawing counteraccusations, much may be said that will not, perhaps, benefit those for whom we are trying to provide benefits because, the longer the discussion lasts, the longer will these people be without these benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.D. Lehane, in moving his amendment, made a few points that are worth considering.  At column 1127 of the Official Debates he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know that people throughout the country-railway clerks, workers' councils, employers' associations, professional associations&mdash;have publicly stated that they did not want it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He concluded by saying, &ldquo;I will read a few quotations in due course&rdquo;.  I am very sorry that Deputy Lehane, even in his contribution to the debate to-day, withheld from us the sources from which he took this quotation.  I should prefer not to have to question the accuracy of the statement made by him, but I should like to know what workers' council followed the line expressed by Deputy Lehane.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane also said in the course of his speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are certain other people who have objections to the scheme on moral grounds, on social grounds, on economic grounds and on legal grounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On moral grounds.&rdquo; Are we to be considerate with the people who have opposed this scheme on moral grounds, some who have gone so far as to express the view that there is as much justification for free love as there is for free spectacles?  Are we expected to bow the knee to the expressed views of individuals who could not claim that they were speaking with full authority for either Church or State, who were merely expressing their own personal views?  Has it come to the time, in 1951, when the workers are to be told what they have been told in a pamphlet which was handed to children in a certain school, the children being told to <Col N="132" /> bring 6d. for it on the following day? Are the workers and the children of the workers expected to believe all that is written in a pamphlet, the views expressed being the views of an individual? It is cold satisfaction that anyone in public life at the present time should be said and led by such views. We say truly, that with God's help, we will believe to the end in our religion, as we have in the past, but never will it be said that we would sacrifice the workers and their children to suit an individual. The less we have to say, perhaps, on that, the better.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if words are hot but, when we know the conditions under which children throughout South Cork and other rural areas must live and must be brought up, as a result of meagre wages, insecurity of tenure, we realise that the responsibility devolves on each and every one of us to make up his own mind as to what is right for the people. Having come to that decision, we must face up to our obligations and say, honestly, openly and above board, that if the parents of such families cannot provide for themselves, the State has a duty to perform, a duty which is in keeping with the teachings of Christianity and the Catholic Church, that the State must stand by these people in their hours, days and years of hardship and distress.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.D. Lehane mentioned that Deputies have not a mandate for this. I make no bones about it&mdash;of course, I speak for myself&mdash;in South Cork and everywhere I went in 1948 at election time I stated, as I believe every member of the Party stated, on Party lines, that this was a scheme which we had been advocating for years, and which had advantages for our people and we made it clear that, if we were put in a position to do so, we would do our utmost to implement these points.  No one condemned us for that. I presume that the people who returned us sent us here for the purpose of trying to bring to fruition what we told them at election time.  If we make statements in public, we have an obligation to act according to them.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points from this famous journal to which I should like to draw the attention of the House.  It is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" />&ldquo;Those of the Church who have spoken, as far as we have seen their published views, are at one in condemning the Bill in various aspects of its provisions and in the general underlying philosophy of the measure.</P>
    <P>It is a complete negation of the Divine precept that man shall live by his own labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is very little that we can say when an Irish journal publishes this. I wonder&mdash;or is it beyond wonder-would the same paragraph fit in in respect of the members of the organisation for which this journal writes so fluently, so eloquently: &ldquo;It is a complete negation of the Divine precept that man shall live by his own labour.&rdquo; All I say is, let them put their own house in order.  If they live by their own labour, they will not begrudge the worker the benefits of this Bill.  I believe, in all earnestness, that the people writing such stuff as this ar the people who are determined at all costs to keep up the old slogan of the past, that is, capitalism versus trade unionism.  Even in this House this evening, it was referred to time and again.  It was referred to by members on my left-hand side who said that this Bill had one advantage, and one only, that is, that it is catering for the urban people, or the trade unionists.  Why should anyone object at this hour  our history to trade unionism?  Have we not organisations of all kinds?  If finally, they must fall back on that line, I say openly, and I accuse them openly, that their opposition to this Bill is in complete conformity with the views of the writer of this article and of those who, directly or indirectly inspired him to write such an article.</P>
    <P>They had one question, of course. They asked, have Irish insurance companies been asked to submit a scheme covering social welfare proposals?  It could be done, they said, perhaps by the formation of a co-operative insur ance firm, and it could be done better and cheaper.  It is surprising the Tánaiste did not think of it.  It is amazing that he did not realise that our insurance companies, or the writer of this article, might not at all condemn this scheme if he gave them the <Col N="134" /> plums out of it.  They would not object, perhaps, to giving the crumbs to the workers provided the best of the loaf had been left on the tables of the directors of the insurance companies.  I believe there are some members in this House who hold the view and who would much prefer to see this scheme, when put into operation, operated by some of our Irish insurance companies.  Thank God the Minister made short work of such a suggestion and treated it with the contempt with which it deserved to be treated.</P>
    <P>They did mention, in fairness to them, that there should be no means test, but as I said a few moments ago, it is amusing to realise that a few years back, when the means test was a very live issue, these self-same people never complained about the means test.  To-morrow if this measure before us had no question of the means test, these self-same industrialists would never mention a word about the means test because they, and all belonging to them, never knew what it was to have to undergo a means test.  They finish up by stating that &ldquo;the thrifty must be encouraged and those who prey on the community must be, if necessary by penalties, discouraged.  The thrifty must not be condemned to provide for wastrels.&rdquo; I am only sorry that the ordinary citizens down the country could not see that full publication and are denied an opportunity of realising that in this country, in this so-called enlightened age, we have people who themselves are clamouring day after day for protection, and at the same time are doing all they possibly can to prevent the creation of a proper sense of security for the people who stand most in need of it.  We here realise the obligation that is placed upon us.  Our actions must be such that the workers can appreciate that we understand the importance of their position at the present time.</P>
    <P>I shall finish on the same note as that on which I started.  We must appreciate, as time marches on, the hardships which poor people are compelled to undergo at times.  The reality of that hardship was brought home to me only a few days ago when a poor <Col N="135" /> old woman who had to live unfortunately on home assistance was found dead one morning in her bed.  It is distressing to think that any section of our working people should be obliged to live under such miserable conditions. If we are sincere, if we are genuine when we preach about the necessity of a true Christian philosophy, we must do our utmost to provide for these people the better conditions which they deserve.  No matter what Party is in power, no matter what Minister is in office, the self-same responsibility is placed on their shoulders. I would appeal to the Opposition to forget what perhaps may be the disappointments or the bitterness which dictated their line of action on this Bill.  I would point out to them that in years past nothing was done along the lines of this measure.  What is gone can never be recalled.  The Minister has now put a Bill before this House and nobody can say other than that Bill expresses the views of a man who in the past, whether in opposition or otherwise, expressed these same views year after year.  If decisions in the past were such as to place that Minister in the responsible position which he holds to-day, then all I say is, may God be good to him, for introducing such a measure and may those members who oppose it realise their responsibility in voting against it.  They tried to suggest that were it not for their amendments there would be no increase in the old age pensions but let them finish with the hypocrisy of that type of political propaganda. Let them realise that there was no coercion attempted and no fears raised in January, 1949, when the old age pensions were increased.  Let them recall that in his views, expressed time and time again, the Minister made it clear that his ambition was&mdash;and he has proved it by the action he has now taken, not by words alone&mdash;to increase the old age pensions, to increase blind pensions and to help the blind by giving them the pension to which they are entitled at an earlier age, to help men, to whom some of us of the younger generation can never give the full credit to which they are entitled, the men of the Old I.R.A., the men who were handicapped <Col N="136" /> in the past by the fact that they were in receipt of disability pensions, men who in the latter years of their lives because of actions in which they had taken part in years gone by, suffered a disability which otherwise they might not have incurred.  Thanks be to God the day has come when full recognition will be given to them, not through lip service but through financial help.  We can also congratulate ourselves that the burden of life for the blind and the old will be considerably lessened as a result of the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told in years gone by that this Bill, when introduced, would be a comprehensive Social Welfare Bill, but there is one remarkable omission from it that certainly means that it cannot be called comprehensive.  That is the omission to deal with the question of children's allowances.  Personally, I cannot understand why a man like the Minister introduced this Bill without making some provision for improved children's allowances.  To me, it seems to be a vital necessity to provide for such an improvement in our social welfare scheme.  We have been told here by other Deputies&mdash;I admit I myself have not studied it&mdash;about the returns under the nutritional survey&mdash;how it showed that large families were the only units who suffered severely under the conditions existing at the time the survey was made.  That is plain evidence that large families need some immediate help.  From personal experience, many of us know that it is almost impossible under present trade union rules for any man with a large family to give them the necessary nourishment.  I think that is the very first fact that would strike me if I were the Minister responsible for introducing a social welfare scheme. Other people, such as small shopkeepers and small farmers who cannot increase their incomes when their families increase, are in the same position as the man tied down by a trade union to the same wage as that paid to the man beside him, who may be a single man or a man with a very small family.  I think, from the Christian point of view, that is one of the urgent questions that need attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> We on this side certainly approve of the co-ordination of services which is provided for in this Bill.  We hope that it will lead to a great improvement in administration and to a lessening of administrative costs.  As a city Deputy, I certainly believe that the improved sickness and unemployment benefits are absolutely necessary as well as the improvement provided for in the continuation of sickness benefit during a period of illness.  There is no question that, in spite of what may have been said here to-night or in the number of criticisms that have been made on this Bill, so far as the ordinary workman in the cities and towns and, indeed, throughout the country, is concerned, the provision against sickness and unemployment is absolutely necessary.  Nobody on this side of the House will, I think, be found to say otherwise.  In fact, I think I may say that we are all agreed upon that.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to pensions for widows and orphans, I am of opinion that in any Christian State those in it who come within these two classes should be a charge on it.  There should be no question as to whether a man had paid a contribution during a certain period of his life, his widow and children should be provided for against starvation.  I think the time has arrived when all widows and orphans should be equally provided for directly by the State.  That is the only way in which we, as members of a Christian community, can look on that question.  We have tried to do that under the alternative proposals put up by Deputy Dr. Ryan&mdash;to provide for all widows and orphans in the cities and throughout the country without any contribution from them.  I think it is the proper way to do it.  I hope that some members on the opposite side who, I know, are sympathetic to this question of the provision for those people, will try to get their minds out of the rut, and admit that we have tried to take a new outlook on that question and as to how it should be approached.</P>
    <P>One of the main differences, at any rate, between the alternative scheme proposed by Deputy Dr. Ryan and the Bill is in regard to old age pensions at 70 instead of 65.  Due to the advance <Col N="138" /> of medical science, there can be no doubt whatever but that there is now a longer expectation of life.  Even the insurance companies admit that.  The new health services which have been provided, and which we hope will be provided to an even greater extent in the next few years, should lead to a further improvement in that respect. If development along that line continues for some years, as we all hope and expect it will, the position will be reached whereby a number of people will not want to cease work at 65.  If you provide old age pensions at 65, then, whether a man likes it or not, he may find himself, by the pressure of circumstances, forced to retire.  The question remains as to whether the country is going to be able to stand that and pay for it.  Personally, I am of opinion that it would be rather premature to run away from the age of 70, the age that we had over a period when the expectation of life was not as long as it is to-day.</P>
    <P>There is the other point to be considered, that if we once introduce that provision and then find the position to be in years to come that the country is not able to bear the cost of it, it would certainly be a retrograde step in those days if the age had to be put back to 70.  If we make provision for the payment of sickness and unemployment benefit for a man over 65 years of age, who may be forced out against his will or who may not be able to work at that age, then I think it would be unwise to fix 65 as the retiring age. Admittedly, there is nothing in the Bill to say that a man will not be allowed to work beyond 65, but circumstances may arise which may force him out at that age.  I myself know men over 70 who are not only willing to work but are looking for work, but who cannot get an employer to take them since they cannot be insured.  Deputies could take examples of that kind and multiply them several times over.  We all know that you could find many hefty strong men at the age of 65 who are better and stronger than some men are at 50 years of age.  Yet, for the reason I have stated, they cannot get work because they cannot be insured at their age.</P>

      <P>There are not exceptions. You are going to have a great number of such men in that position if you reduce the age to 65, especially in view of the present trend in health statistics.  There will be no objection, I think, in any part of the House to increase the old age pensions to £1 a week.  We are all agreed on that.  In view of the increase in the cost of living recently, the improvement that is indicated there is necessary.  It was a pity, I think, that it should have been introduced in the form in which it was. The first two Deputies who spoke to-day, Deputy P.D. Lehane and Deputy Flynn, both claimed credit for having got that increase in the old age pensions through their opposition to the Bill.  I do not think it should have been introduced in such a way that Deputies could say that they were able to get £1,250,000 spent because they put up opposition to the Government.</P>
      <P>Under the Fianna Fáil alternative it is proposed to pay the £1 a week out of taxation to all old age pensioners at 70 over the whole country.  With regard to insured workers, Fianna Fáil propose to pay the difference between the £1, up to 24/-, if my memory serves me correctly, from the fund to be provided under the Bill.  I think that that provision is wise because in most cases the insured workers will live in the cities and larger towns, and will be under a higher expense than the people in the rural areas.  To give them the few shillings extra is, I think, a wise provision but, at the same time, it makes the application of the provision general all over the whole country.  I think that the Minister should bring in a separate Bill&mdash; I am sure it need only be a short one &mdash;to provide for that improvement in old age pensions at once.  He will have no difficulty in getting it through the House, whereas there may be some delay in getting it brought in under an amendment of this measure.</P>

It would practically eliminate it and it would greatly lessen administrative costs in connection with old age pensions.  It would also eliminate something that we have all complained about in the past, namely, that old age pensions, as administered at the moment, penalise the thrifty man.  The man who made provision for his old age found that he was penalised as far as the pension he got from the State was concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We improved old age pensions when our predecessors cut them down.  We heard about the 2/6 which was given by the Minister in 1948.  He did it by bringing in £1,000,000 in extra contributions from the workers under the national health insurance.  In the previous year we gave as much&mdash;without any increased contribution.  The Minister paid for that 2/6 by bringing in the extra contribution of £1,000,000.  We had done as much&mdash;and yet you went out on the platforms telling about the things we were not doing.  You have been in office now for three years and that is all you did until this measure was brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the question of contributions. Undoubtedly, the contributions are a direct tax on the people who pay them.  Looking through the Return of National Income which was recently issued to us, we find that they point out that they have treated contributions in respect of national health insurance as a direct tax and undoubtedly it is the proper way to treat them.  This Bill will mean a direct tax of £9 per annum on the contributor, and in the White Paper we are given the figure of £3,500,000.  New classes will be brought in under the Bill to pay this direct tax.  People who have never had to pay it before, and who, in all likelihood, will never draw any benefit out of it, are being included. <Col N="141" /> It is provided that civil servants, local government officials and suchlike will be included.  Admittedly, the Minister has taken some power to modify in these cases but we have no idea to what extent the modification is going to apply.  In the City of Dublin there are people in white-collar occupations such as insurance, and so forth, who never paid this contribution before and who, under the conditions of their employment&mdash;unless these conditions are altered, which may happen&mdash;will not draw any benefit from this scheme.</P>

      <P>If, for instance, local government officials are going to be brought within the scope of this scheme, I should like to point out that the new officials are already paying 5 per cent. of their salary towards superannuation, under the Superannuation Act.  Now they are going to have this further £9 a year.  In addition, I estimate that if the Dublin <Col N="142" /> Corporation officials and employees are brought in, it will cost the corporation about 4d. in the £ on the rates to pay their side of the contribution. At the moment the conditions of those men are such that I do not believe most of them would consider it worth paying that contribution to get whatever extra they could get under this Bill in the way of a longer sickness benefit because the benefit they get at the moment, even when it comes down to the half pay or even the quarter pay, in most cases would be more than the maximum paid under this scheme.

He says as the rules are he will get no increased benefit.  These classes also will have to share in the taxation and cannot avoid it.  Whether that taxation is paid by customs duty as Deputy Lehane mentioned this evening, by income tax, by both or by any other system, these men will have to pay their full share as well as their contribution and will get no benefit out of it as they see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe that our scheme would lead to less administrative costs.  I do not think anybody can be happy to read in the White Paper that 12½ per cent. of the cost of the proposed scheme is estimated for administration.  That in itself is very high, and we know from experience that these estimates are usually on the low side, and that in fact it will probably work out at far more.  Nobody wants to see the funds provided to meet the various ills of life frittered away on administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased benefits in the alternative scheme proposed by Deputy Dr. Ryan would be far more widespread. It would not increase contributions or direct taxation to the people who are already contributing; it would spread the cost more equitably amongst all classes without asking some classes to pay in two or three ways.  The Minister should seriously <Col N="144" /> consider the point made by Deputy Lemass this evening that he should accept the scheme and make this an agreed measure, thus taking social welfare out of the realm of party politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I rise in this debate is that I am very sorry that it was a Deputy from my constituency who moved that this Bill should not get a Second Reading.  He said that he put down the amendment on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  Having the honour to represent Wexford, I wish to state that Deputy Dr. Ryan had no mandate from the people of Wexford, the workers of Wexford, to ask the Dáil not to pass the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>When I hear Deputy Corry speaking about the omission of children's allowances from the scheme I remember an occasion in this House when I put a question to a Minister, who is now the President in the Park, asking him to give 2/6 and increase the number of youngsters from two to four.  When I told him that there were people in the rural areas and towns with four children, two under age and two over, who got no children's allowances, the Minister's reply is on the record of the House.  Deputy Lemass joined in, saying that the agricultural labourers were multi-millionaires and the Minister, Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly, said that there were no hardships in the rural areas and that there were more children in the rural than in the urban areas.  Then we have one of the Fianna Fáil Party with the cheek to stand up to-night and talk about children's allowances and old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He should be ashamed to mention it. Go back over the Official Debates of the Dáil where Deputy Dr. Ryan said the country could not afford it and sent the rural people to the Home Assistance Officers for half a crown.  He said he had a better scheme.  After 16 years, they had no scheme and when they are faced with this Social Welfare Bill to-day they do not know whether to vote for it or vote against it.  Like the other Bills that have been brought in here, they say it might be <Col N="145" /> a good thing or it might be a bad thing.  Fianna Fáil got plenty of criticism throughout the country in the Fianna Fáil clubs, from the workers there, for opposing this Bill.  That is why they are wavering, changing over, and telling us they have a better scheme.</P>
    <P>Anyone who goes to the Official Debates of the Dáil, when this Bill was introduced on 2nd March, could quote Deputy Ryan where in one paragraph he said they had a better scheme.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not prepared to ask the Minister to agree that the old age pension should be all round at 65 on the same level as in the Bill.  I think it is more than the country could bear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is the man honest who is talking on that side of the House, when Deputy Dr. Ryan says it is more than the country could bear and says that men should work up to 70?  Little do they know the people.  If they speak at all, they should speak to the men in the factories, in the workshops, in the coal yards or docks, doing manual labour at 65, and tell them that is too early to give up work.  How many people had to leave and are in the county homes to-day because they had nothing to keep them outside?  They had no old age pension, as they were not 70, so they had to go into the county homes all over the country.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable for anyone who knows what the people are going through and what they went through to bring us to where we are to-day, to speak like that.  We have the ex-Taoiseach going down to County Meath and saying that social welfare was only for the dishonest and the drones.  Are the workers of this country after 70 or 65, after hard toil and sweat, the people that the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, refers to as drones?  I challenge him to say that in any constituency in the near future. We are not one bit afraid and we are prepared to face the country on this issue, if necessary.  We are not one bit afraid and if Fianna Fáil wants it, let them vote against the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are people here talking about <Col N="146" /> the white collar worker and about people who will not get any benefits. Deputy Dr. Ryan asked why should we give a young widow a pension and tell her she has a pension for life.  He said it would be stopping human endeavour.  Let him go down the country and tell that to the young widows in Wexford, let him go on the platforms and tell them that.  These are the things the people are fighting for.  I have met people in my constituency who are waiting to-day for this increase in the old age pension. If Fianna Fáil are honest, that they do not want any delay about it, that they want to give those people something, let them allow this Bill to go through, to help the men and women who are 65 to-day and who are waiting and praying that this House will pass the Bill.  But no!  Politics is all Fianna Fáil are thinking of.  They said in this House &mdash;and Deputy Dr. Ryan said it also &mdash;that to get four or five votes to keep the Coalition here, we are giving the pensioners an increase.  How could any man say that, that it was to keep the Coalition together that we were giving that increase in old age pensions, in widows' and orphans' pensions and pensions to men of 65.</P>

Why did they have Deputy Colley and his colleagues voting in 1947 against the old age pensions increase? Do they forget all that?  I do not, anyhow, and I am sure the people I represent down the country do not forget it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> We want this Social Welfare Bill for the people of the country.  I know that my colleagues in the industry I worked in for 25 years will be glad to retire at 65 when they know that they will get the old age pension.  For 16 years we had a one-man Government which never thought of the people who were toiling either in the fields or the factories.  They only think of them now when they are faced with a scheme that they know is popular. We were told by ex-Ministers that this scheme would never see the light of day, that it was only a sham.  We were told that we were the tail of Fine Gael.  We are not ashamed to be associated with any Party which will do the right thing for the people we represent.</P>
    <P>Anywhere I go in my constituency in future I shall quote the words of Deputy Dr. Ryan in this House which they did not publish because it would not suit them.  I think this measure is long overdue.  If I were back in employment again, I would not object to paying 1/7 a week when I knew I would get the benefits provided and that, if I died, my wife and family would be provided for.  These are the things the workers are looking for to-day and not the talk which we hear from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Can they not be honest with the people and not be playing politics?  Do they not know as well as I do that this scheme is long overdue?  It was a great mistake that the Fianna Fáil Party did not bring in a scheme when they had a majority in this House and could have carried it.  They were thinking more of the capitalists.</P>
    <P>The sooner we pass this Bill the better.  There may be some who are anxious about their own section of the people.  When the National Health Insurance Act was passed and the people were asked to pay 6d. a week there was no opposition to it, and 6d. a week was a lot of money at that time to a worker.  When the Unemployment Insurance Act came into force there was no objection by the workers to paying the contribution.  It was paid and the employers also paid it. The same thing will happen in this case.  We are told by Deputy Dr. Ryan that the country cannot afford it.  The <Col N="149" /> workers never object to paying a few pence a week when they know they are getting benefit for it.  There are thousands of people who will never draw benefit under the present social services except they are sick.  While they are healthy they will carry on their work.  If they have continuous employment they will never sign on at the labour exchange.  Thousands of people would have gone to their graves without having drawn a penny from the present social services.</P>
    <P>Those who are opposing this measure were talking a few years ago about the men on the land who fed the nation, while at the same time they deprived them of unemployment benefit because they lived in rural areas. I am glad to see that the agricultural worker will get benefit under this scheme just the same as the city or town worker who becomes unemployed. I am very glad that the sickness benefit is to be increased to 50/- a week instead of a man being given 22/6 a week for six months and 15/- a week afterwards.  Do the people who are opposing this measure realise that there are men at present lying on sick beds trying to exist on 22/6 or 15/- a week?  These are the things we have to face up to because we have to think of these people.  Of course I know that Deputy Dr. Ryan is a director of an insurance company and does not want to see a death benefit of £6 being paid for a child of three or £20 for anyone over 18.  At present many workers are paying an insurance company more than 1/7 a week.  That has to be paid every week even though a man may be unemployed.  I see that the chairman of the New Ireland Assurance Company objects to this social welfare scheme.  Why would he not when he knows it will be effective? This is a quotation from the <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have no use whatever for the very elaborate social service envisaged in current legislation,&rsquo; said Mr. D. McCullough, chairman of the company, at the annual dinner of the New Ireland Assurance Company, Ltd., in the Hibernian Hotel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the sort of criticism we get from these people, and then we have <Col N="150" /> other people saying the scheme is not elaborate enough.  Some say the Second Reading of this Bill should be refused because not enough is being given.  Deputy Dr. Ryan said that here in the House the last day and the chairman of his company said that he had no room for social services.  Sometimes when I listen to the speeches here and outside and when I read the papers I ask myself are people really in earnest?  Are they honest when they make these statements?  There are very few of the Fianna Fáil Party present now.  There is at the moment no ex-Minister on the Front Benches of the Opposition.  Since this Social Welfare Bill was introduced on 2nd March last the Opposition are feeling pretty dismal.  They are worried now about the old age pensioners and they want a separate Bill to cover them. At the same time Deputy Dr. Ryan wants to refer this Bill back though he complains that we are not giving the increases quick enough.  The country welcomes this Bill with the exception, perhaps, of a few narrowminded individuals.</P>
    <P>This is one of the best Bills that has been introduced here.  Fianna Fáil promised many things but after 16 years the people had got nothing. They had social services for themselves and they forgot the people outside. That is really what Fianna Fáil did and that is how they implemented their policy: it was themselves alone. Listening to Deputy Lemass to-day, one would think that there would be no opposition to this Bill but at the very end he said that he intended to oppose it.  I do not know what Deputy Colley intends to do.  He was asking for increased allowances for children. Perhaps if children's allowances are in the Bill he will vote for it.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill should be held up here any longer than to-morrow night.  I represent the working-class people.  I am a worker myself and I want this Bill passed this week in all its stages.  There is plenty of other business to be done.  Deputy McGrath has been very vocal here about old age pensions on occasions. Does Deputy McGrath forget that he voted against an increase in old age pensions in 1947.  I am afraid Deputy <Col N="151" /> Dr. Ryan forgets that he did that but the people of Wexford did not forget it in 1948.  He very nearly lost his seat there.  The people will not forget it the next time either because I will make sure of that.  I do not think I would be treating my constituents properly if I did not expose him and tell them what he said here about the widows and the old age pensioners. Perhaps the Opposition would reconsider their attitude by to-morrow and change their minds thereby enabling this Bill to pass into legislation without delay.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Leary I would be anxious to have a vote to-night if I thought some of the holy family were missing.  I think Deputy O'Leary nearly let the cat out of the bag to-night.  Listening to the Deputies here to-day one wonders whether those who profess to be representatives of the workers have themselves ever worked in their lives.</P>

      <P>You have been dodging it all your life and you are still dodging it.  When one comes to consider this Bill one is immediately struck by the fact that no provision is made for some 500,000 of our population while the farmer with a valuation of £10 down in Laoighis and Offaly will have to pay in taxation, while trying to support his <Col N="152" /> wife and family on about 20 acres of miserable land, his share of the £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 so that Deputy Davin and the other employees of Córas Iompair Éireann may get pensions. It is just as well to be straight about this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin said that 7/- a week would have to be paid and the deficit would have to be paid as well.  It is not the general manager of Córas Iompair Éireann who will have to pay the 7/- a week; it is the unfortunate fellow with the £10 valuation down the country will have to pay, not alone the deficit to be made up in meeting the general manager's contribution to this Bill but he will also have to pay his share of taxation and the general manager of Córas Iompair Éireann will be legally entitled to something that the unfortunate fellow who is footing the bill will never be entitled to and the people on the Government Benches know that.  Why should any responsible Deputy like Deputy Davin come in here and vote for something which will have the effect of making some unfortunate fellow down the country pay 7/- a week for his benefit?</P>
