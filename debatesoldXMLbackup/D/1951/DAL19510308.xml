    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that at a political convention attended by the Minister for External Affairs a resolution proposing to establish units of an illegal organisation all over the country was, according to newspaper reports of February 19th, discussed in private, whether he knows the decision arrived at, and whether he will inform the Dáil of the Government's attitude in regard to this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have no responsibility for proposals which may be made at political conventions. However, in view of the suggestions contained in the Deputy's question, I have made inquiries, and I am in a position to state that the resolution referred to in the question was withdrawn and not discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask whether the Taoiseach would not take occasion to advise and to warn young people who might be induced or tempted to join this illegal organisation that the inevitable end of the course on which they are embarking will be conflict with the forces of this State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the attitude of this side of the House on that has been made abundantly clear, but I may say that I think the homily preached by the Leader of the Opposition does not arise on this particular instance, as inquiries clearly demonstrate.  There was no question of people joining this particular organisation at all in connection with <Col N="1490" /> this matter, as ascertained by inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach is he aware that there is a special drive at the present time taking place in the United States for funds for this organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this is concerned and the organisation referred to in this question, that does not arise, as I am informed from the inquiries I have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister says anything, I would like to ask him a question so that he may answer it at the same time, in connection with the drive for funds in America.  Can we get an undertaking from the Minister that his visit to the United States is not in connection with that drive?  This is going on now.  In the past he did collect for that organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful if Deputies would keep silent for a minute.  This is serious.  This particular proposal was withdrawn, the proposer of the particular motion explaining that what they really meant was that they would like to see the F.C.A. strengthened and young Irishmen who had hitherto joined other organisations joining the F.C.A.  That is a desirable development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether in or about May, 1949, a record was prepared in his Department showing the steps which had been taken under the direction of his predecessor to procure and collate the data required to enable a comprehensive and equitable scheme of social <Col N="1497" /> security to be formulated for the consideration of the Government; whether a considerable number of memoranda and estimates dealing with the more important aspects of the problem were prepared and submitted to the Minister; and whether the work of preparing a scheme of social security was brought to a standstill in or about June, 1948, because of the failure of the Minister to give decisions on important issues of principle which were required to enable further progress to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question seems to be based on incorrect information apparently received by him from a source now obviously anxious to deliberately distort the facts of the situation which obtained in my Department in 1948.  In that year my Department produced the Social Welfare Act of 1948 and the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1948.  The former amended no fewer than five major Acts and gave increased pensions costing an additional £2,500,000 while the second amended the Workmen's Compensation Acts and increased the maximum benefit payable under them by 33? per cent.  Reciprocal arrangements were made in that year with Great Britain and Northern Ireland, some of them for the first time. The preparation of the White Paper on Social Security continued with all speed and it has now been crystallised in the Social Welfare Bill at present before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The documents available in the Department prove conclusively that my predecessor never contemplated the introduction of legislation which would confer benefits on anything like the scale provided under the present Bill. The Deputy would be well advised to seek his information from more reliable sources in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not quite clear now that it was not until after the proceedings.  Norton versus the <i>Irish Press,</i> that the Minister began to give any attention to the social security scheme at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a gross misrepresentation and, if necessary, officials of my Department who know much more about the matter than the late <Col N="1498" /> secretary can be produced to give the lie to that statement.  Let me say, in addition, that so far as the Social Welfare White Paper is concerned.  I not only gave speedy decisions on any matter that was submitted to me, but, as the records of the Department will show, unlike the records made available by my predecessor, I pressed on every possible occasion to speed up the production of the White Paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is to be found in the Social Welfare Bill now before the Dail, and I would suggest to the Deputy that if he is concerned with objective truth in this matter he ought not to go to poisoned wells for his information.</P>

I do not accept these assertions as true, except in so far as I am compelled to do so by the conventions of the House.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether, in view of the fact that a forestry centre is now being established at Glencar, he will instruct his Department to develop afforestation schemes in Glenbeigh, Caragh Lake, Kilgobinet and Beaufort districts at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Caragh Lake.&mdash;As soon as the Lickeen area is acquired it is my intention, to acquire, if possible, further areas adjoining it in the townlands of Drombane and Cosha South.  Investigations already made have disclosed that there is a further area of 650 acres approximately in these townlands which would be suitable for State forestry purposes.  Most of the tenants, however, do not appear to be disposed to sell for cash or to surrender the land unless given other land in exchange and so the building up of a large forest unit in the district will be slow and will probably in a large measure depend on the Land Commission being in a position to provide the tenants with alternative holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Glenbeigh.&mdash;I have already negotiated <Col N="1510" /> successfully for the purchase of a block of 97 acres which can be worked in with the main block at Lickeen and another offer of 100 acres at Lyranes is listed for inspection.  The land in this district is eminently suitable for planting but prescriptive claims to grazing will render acquisition very difficult.</P>
    <P>Kilgobnet and Beaufort.&mdash;I have not had any offers of land from these districts but I will be very pleased to consider the acquisition of any suitable areas which may be offered.  Perhaps the Deputy could indicate where areas are available for offer and the forestry division will approach the owners.</P>

    <P>The price of a 50-foot fishing boat depends on the lay-out, the materials used, the equipment installed and labour factors such as the conditions of wages.  It is not possible accordingly to give a comparable figure of cost for each boat, but it can be stated that the cost of building and equipping the 50-foot boats obtained to date ranged, between £4,300 and £5,000 per boat.</P>

      <P>In 1949 and 1950, the board planned to work bogs in the Dromreask, Keale and Cratlow districts of West Limerick, but in each year failed to procure the necessary labour and in 1950 had to suspend operations after four weeks because of the shortage of men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Vote on Account it would be no harm to refer back to three years ago when this Government took office at the behest of the electors of this country. We are now celebrating the third <Col N="1529" /> anniversary of the election to office of this Government.  No matter what the Deputies opposite may say, it must be agreed that this Government represents the views of the Irish people and at the last general election the electors made it very clear they were tired of Fianna Fáil and that a change was necessary.  Despite the statements of the Deputies on the Opposition Benches that the people are dissatisfied with this Government, anybody who goes through the country and hears the views of various people as individuals and as members of organisations will be assured that the people have no desire to bring about a change of Government at the moment.  Agriculture has never been so prosperous. When Fianna Fáil left office there were fewer cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry on our farms than ever before. During the past three years our live stock population has increased by leaps and bounds and the position now is that we have more stock on the farms of Ireland than at any time since the famine years.  Every opportunity has been given to the farmers to reclaim and refertilise their land so as to enable them to bring about greater production in the years to come. Owing to world conditions to-day it is very necessary that the Minister for Agriculture should make every provision to enable farmers to produce sufficient crops and stock of all kinds to enable our people to live during a serious emergency if we cannot bring in anything from abroad.  The best way to do that was to provide that the land would be drained and fertilised and then to make agreements with our nearest neighbour, always our best customer, England, on a long term under which she is willing to buy all our surplus stock and produce from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Fianna Fáil Party believe in compulsion, we of Fine Gael, and I think every Party supporting the Government, believe that the best way to entice people to produce more from the land is by giving remunerative or economic prices.  Fianna Fáil Deputies speak frequently of the growing of wheat but during the emergency the regulations were such that people <Col N="1530" /> could grow wheat on any type of land and were not obliged to grow it on the land which was bound to produce the best crops.  If they ploughed ten acres there was no obligation on them to sow more wheat on that land than would cover one acre, so a certain type of people took advantage of that. While in 1946 over 600,000 acres of wheat were grown in this country the produce last year from half that acreage was greater.  No matter what Deputies opposite may say about the position of agriculture and of the Irish farmers, I feel sure that they are perfectly satisfied at the present time.</P>
    <P>Coming to the industrial arm, while I will admit that the Fianna Fáil Government did its best to improve our industries and also set up many factories here and there throughout the country, still at the present time more people are engaged in Irish industry than ever before, something in the neighbourhood of 220,000, whereas when Fianna Fáil left office the figure was about 68,000.  Also this Government has made agreements not only with England but with continental countries by which we will get a sale for our surplus industrial products, and that is the first time that has been done in the history of the new State.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said from time to time by Deputies opposite by questions and in other debates to the effect that in an emergency this country is not prepared to defend itself. I do not think that it is a good thing for Deputies to try to draw information about our defence services, because after all if there were a war it would be well if potential enemies did not know our position.  Some of the speakers opposite, and especially Deputy Major de Valera, who is apparently the shadow Minister in a future Government&mdash;he seems to be making an attempt in that direction&mdash; are continually raising the question of defence just as if this were a powerful nation, and we could defend ourselves independently of world conditions.  It has been fully understood that in future wars our position must always be as far as possible to maintain neutrality.</P>
    <P>It may be said that certain nations <Col N="1531" /> have a benevolent neutrality, but there is entirely too much talk about defence measures.  Instead of bringing our young men into barracks to have them, as the Minister for Defence stated, knocking sparks out of the barrack squares, they should be working on the land or in the factories producing all the surplus goods possible so that we may stockpile and have vast surpluses for any emergency that may arise, when we cannot bring from abroad the goods we are unable to produce at home.</P>
    <P>While the last Government did a great deal in connection with building houses there has certainly been no lack in that respect with the new Government. More men are employed on housing to-day than ever before, about 14,000, and we have built more houses. The object of this Government is to place a house at the disposal of everyone who requires one either in town or country.</P>
    <P>From the point of view, therefore, of agriculture, industry, defence and housing, everything possible has been done for the welfare of our people.  We have also been able to carry out very important drainage schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and all over the country to-day farmers are taking advantage of that drainage scheme as well as of the land reclamation scheme.  The arterial drainage scheme has also been put into operation as quickly as possible in so far as the machinery available will allow.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that while the Vote on Account may seem a big sum of money, still the people to-day are so prosperous and are being given so many advantages and opportunities of improvement that even the Opposition cannot show any item which might be reduced.  The various services require the sums of money allotted to them and no matter what may be said I think that the Opposition themselves are fully satisfied in their own mind that if they were in office to-day the Vote on Account might exceed £100,000,000 instead of the £83,000,000 we have at present.</P>
    <P>After all, it is the wish of all Parties forming this Government, as I am sure <Col N="1532" /> it is the wish of Deputies opposite, that everything possible should be done to enable our people to live in the greatest form of prosperity.  This Government has done much not only for the farmer but also for the industrialist, the industrial workers, the agricultural workers, the road workers and workers of all kinds, and has improved their position in every possible way, both as regards wages and conditions of service generally.  So, in spite of the fact that Deputies opposite may criticise the supporters of the Government in the different Parties, I can assure them that never before during the three years that this Government has been in office has there been greater harmony and unanimity between the various Parties forming the Government than there is to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Vote, as is perfectly permissible, the discussion has ranged over a very wide field. Last night we had a contribution from Deputy MacEntee in regard to the form and type of Government that is most suitable for a people.  Deputy MacEntee made the point that, in a Coalition Government comprising Ministers representing several Parties, there cannot be progress, whereas the facts are that, under a Coalition Government comprising many Parties and Ministers representing different Parties, there has been a record of substantial progress and improvement, in spite of great difficulties during the past three years.</P>
      <P>There is undoubtedly a fundamental difference between the type of Government we have now and what I might term the Fianna Fáil type.  The present Government is a democratic Government in the proper sense of that term.  The Parties in that Government can combine together to bring about benefits for the people.  The most recent example of democracy in action was the decision of the Government to increase old age pensions to £1 a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The decision to bring about these improvements for these substantial sections of the people was due to the fact that we had a democratic Government in office, a Government that would not be deflected or prevented by the demands of financiers from doing their duty to those important sections of our people.  The present Government is an example of democracy in action.</P>
      <P>Clearly, in that form of Government there will be different points of view on many matters, there will be different stresses from time to time; but so long as the Government as a whole consider that their function is to operate in the interest of the public good, then that form of Government is the best form to have.  What would the alternative be?  It would not be a Government of people with different ideals each stressing a particular point of view, but it would be a Government ruled like a rod of iron by an individual, supported by a group of &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; whose only anxiety would be to be loudest in their shouting of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when the chief said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo;. when the chief said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  That is the problem that is worth discussing on this particular Vote on Account. Are we to have the Government we have at the moment, democracy in action, or are we going back to the tyranny and the dictatorship of the one-man Government?</P>

      <P>The country at the moment is considering whether this inter-Party arrangement is better than the system of one-man Government we had prior to that.  We know that under the present system a worker, whether he is an agricultural worker, a road worker, an industrial worker or a worker of any other type, has freedom to express his political views.  He has freedom to belong to any political Party he wishes.  He knows that even if he is loudest in his condemnation of the inter-Party Government it will not affect his employment or the benefits to which he may be entitled from the State.

The unemployed man who considers that his unemployment benefits might be affected by a change of Government knows now that, instead of having a Government which will interfere adversely with these benefits and allowances, he has a Government that is endeavouring to improve them. The road worker has not to be whipped into a Fianna Fáil club and has not to produce his Fianna Fáil membership card for the purpose of getting employment on the roads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That the allegations of jobbery will cease.  We have all some responsibility to the country, and it is wrong that we should have these allegations bandied about from time to time.  Fianna Fáil were in office for 16 years, and during that period they never held that there was anything wrong with appointing a person to a public or other office simply because he was a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They never held that that was wrong.  In fact, one of their Ministers, the then Minister for Lands, Deputy Moylan, laid it down that the loyalty of the individual to the Fianna Fáil Party was one of the matters to be considered, all other things being supposed to be equal.  I take it that, <Col N="1538" /> having fixed up any appointments of their camp followers over a period of 16 years, the Fianna Fáil Party cannot understand what has hit them in the teeth that they cannot do it still, and they are annoyed that some person who has not a Fianna Fáil card in his pocket is appointed to some job.  It is a great matter for the country that somebody other than a member of Fianna Fáil can get an appointment. That situation ought to be accepted and it ought to be faced.  If it is accepted and faced, we would have less of the allegations that are being made from time to time in the House.</P>
      <P>A complaint has been made in regard to the Vote on Account that the sum necessary to run the country efficiently is too high.  At the same time as we have that viewpoint expressed, we have claims and demands for increased expenditure here and increased expenditure there.  Everybody realises that in the matter of defence every reasonable step ought to be taken by the Government.  Fianna Fáil wants us, wants the Government and wants the country to spend millions on buying armaments and equipment&mdash;which may be entirely out of date and useless in a year or two from now.  Those speeches and declarations that we have heard in regard to defence are not concerned with defence at all.  They are concerned with politics. They are playing politics pure and simple, demanding on the one side that you reduce expenditure and on the other that you increase expenditure by spending millions of money on armaments, which might be useless in a conflict that might take place in a year or two from now.  This Government from its inception worked on the basis that war was not inevitable.</P>

If the world is so foolish as to go to war in the immediate future, with the dreadful instruments of destruction that are available, it will be an end to civilisation.  Responsible statement and responsible authorities are endeavouring to find day after day how peace can be achieved.  While that is <Col N="1539" /> the attitude of responsible statement all over the world&mdash;when it is the thing for which His Holiness the Pope is praying night and day&mdash;we find the Fianna Fáil Party telling us that war is inevitable.</P>

      <P>That is an attitude of mind which ought to be exposed in the country.  I said yesterday in regard to the Supplementary Estimate for External Affairs that we are inclined to forget we are a small country.  We are inclined to forget that we are a small country of 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 inhabitants, and we want to talk and swagger as if we were a nation of 100,000,000 or 200,000,000 inhabitants.  It is, perhaps, a good thing that we are not part of the North Atlantic Defence Organisation, because we would have this Government twitted day after day from those benches if some naval, military or air force commanders were not from this State.

When the Taoiseach faced up to realities in Canada and announced the decision of the Government to put an end to the sham and establish instead the Republic <Col N="1542" /> of Ireland, where did he get his support?  He got his support on these benches, the benches occupied by the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>I agree, and I accept the ruling of the Chair.  I think it is quite out of order and out-of-date; but when Deputies, like Deputy Brennan, make these observations naturally I have to answer them.  One of the objectives of the people who established this State was to establish democratic Government.  For a number of years an effort was made to establish that democratic Government and then suddenly we found ourselves with our democracy gone and with a tyranny and a dictatorship established in the guise of democracy.  We had to exist under that for 16 long years.</P>

They were booted out.  Every facility that could be given to them to leave was given. They were forced out by the back of the neck.  The returns show more people employed in industry now.  That is proved by the statistical returns. But what is more important than all that is that the people are now taking an intelligent interest in what is happening.  There cannot be a meeting in the Taoiseach's room now at 11 <Col N="1545" /> o'clock at night that is not discussed in every tavern and pub and hall all over the country.  Is not that democracy?

      <P>It is vitally important and every democrat&mdash;I am glad to be able to express my faith in democracy&mdash;will be glad to know that that is the position in the country.</P>
      <P>While we can maintain our democratic form of Government, the moneys voted by this House will be used in the interests of the people, and properly used in the interests of the people, and we will not be tied down by old ideas of so many shillings, so many pounds or so many millions.  Money is not the be-all and the end-all of everything. Money is simply a vehicle or instrument by which people can render service to the community and receive from the community benefits in return. Whether the bill is £80,000,000, £90,000,000 or £100,000,000 matters nothing.  What does matter is the happiness and prosperity of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very proud to stand here to-day and accept the very dirty challenge that has been thrown out by the <Col N="1546" /> Fianna Fáil Party, with all these allegations of corruption that they are raising day by day, by this filthy conduct that we see from the Front Bench, of investigating in public the private and family affairs of public officials.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry, as a Dublin Deputy, that Deputy Peadar Cowan did not avail of this opportunity to voice the feelings of his constituents. He is in touch with most people, he says.  He has been in taverns and elsewhere.  I have been elsewhere but not in taverns but I have my agents in taverns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Government, if they do not know it, that what the average man in the bus queue, in the tavern or at the football match, or wherever else he is in Dublin, is saying: &ldquo;How long more is this crowd going to hang on?&rdquo; That is what he is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>No more and no less. The people of this city and the people of this country have no longer any confidence in the groups that form the minority Inter-Party Government.  The <Col N="1547" /> inter-Party Government is the coalition of a number of Parties, but they are in fact kept in power by a number of Independent Deputies.  Sooner or later&mdash;and the sooner the better&mdash;the Independent Deputies must go to the people.  The people want to meet the Independent Deputies who are keeping this minority inter-Party Government in power.  The sooner a general election takes place, the better for this House because I am certain&mdash;I never was more certain of anything in my life&mdash;that if there was a general election in the morning the Fianna Fáil Party would come back with an overall majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go as far as the Iron Curtain on one side or any other distance on the other side.  I think that Deputy Peadar Cowan or any other Deputy who speaks here should voice the feelings of his constituents. If Deputy Peadar Cowan thought more about Fairview, Marino, and the North Strand than he does about the eastern direction, it would be better for all concerned.  The electors of this city had a specific promise from the people who constitute this inter-Party Government that the cost of living would be reduced.  The biggest question confronting the average citizen to-day is the cost of living.  The people who sit behind the Government on the Government Benches are the best indication and illustration of that&mdash;Deputy Jim Larkin and those who are actually officers of organised trade unions.  I could give a whole list of organisations of workers that would refute the statement of the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Morrissey, that we are the best-off people in the world.  Recently we saw in the City of Dublin a hunger march, if you please&mdash;that is what it was called&mdash;by the Post Office Workers' Union.  A general meeting was called to demand increase in wages and as far as I know, the only person who did not attend that meeting of the Post Office Workers' Union was their general secretary, Deputy Norton, the present Tánaiste.  Why?  Why did he not attend the general meeting of the Post Office workers who were demanding an increase in wages having regard <Col N="1548" /> to the cost of living?  Why does not he go back and face the people from whom he has got a livelihood over a great many years?  Why does not he face the workers of Dublin?  Why do not he and his colleagues in the Government decide to face the people when they know that the people are saying what I have said they are saying, that they are hanging on to office and will hang on as long as they are able?</P>
    <P>The sort of talk that we heard from Deputy Peadar Cowan about the dictatorship that existed under Fianna Fáil is the greatest nonsense and the greatest rubbish, but, unfortunately, there were people who fell for that sort of foul propaganda before the last election, just as they fell for it when they were told specifically by Deputy Peadar Cowan and his co-candidates in Dublin North City that the cost of living could be reduced by 30 per cent. They promised to reduced the cost of living by 30 per cent.  &ldquo;Defeatists will tell you it cannot be done.  It can be done and it will be done&rdquo;&mdash;that is from their own election address.  I would ask Deputy Peadar Cowan to ask any worker in this city how does the cost of living now compare with the cost of living before this Government took office.</P>
    <P>The unemployment question was to be solved overnight.  It is not yet solved.  I read figures yesterday in the daily Press which gave the figure around 68,000 unemployed.  Approximately 70,000 people are unemployed in this country and approximately 20,000 people emigrated from this country last year.  For the first nine months of the year the figure was 15,000 as published in the daily Press, and it is safe to assume that a comparable number left in the last three months.  My belief is that many more left.  Deputy Alfred Byrne and other Dublin Deputies who are in the House know the people who are coming to them and other Dublin Deputies every day of the week, the people who are literally and starkly on the bread line, who have no work and for whom we cannot get work.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, and in the opinion of those who have followed events in this <Col N="1549" /> country over the past 16 or 19 years, the unemployment question would be infinitely worse if the Fianna Fáil policy of industrialisation had not been carried into effect.  They know the people would be infinitely better off if that policy of industrialisation had not been obstructed.  What is now admired and taken over, and what is spoken highly of by the present Government, the industrial position here, was referred to in other terms in years gone by.  During my 11 or 12 years in the House, I heard Deputies talking repeatedly about the workshops and the factories as the sweat-shops and the back-room factories.</P>
    <P>I say that it is largely due to our policy in the past that there are not a lot more than 70,000 people now out of employment here.  The people who form the present Government told us at one time they could sweep unemployment away overnight.  As it is, they are still sitting there clinging on like limpets to a rock, holding on to office, and refusing to take the opinions of their constituents, the opinions of members of various organisation that have worked for them and that have since resigned, organisations that helped to form this inter-minority Party Government.</P>
    <P>Those people are still hanging on to office and we, in Dublin, who are in touch with development works, know that there cannot be any considerable expansion of the industrial policy of Fianna Fáil because the majority of the people in this country have no confidence whatever in any part of the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about emigration and we were often told that it was Fianna Fáil that caused emigration.  There was nothing at all said, when these gentlemen were going before the electorate, about the exodus that occurred under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. Only Fianna Fáil could cause emigration&mdash;that was the cry during the war period when it was impossible to bring in the raw materials of industry.  The fact is that since the inter-Party Government were formed, emigration continued just the same. Has there been any reduction in <Col N="1550" /> emigration?  They set up a commission, but that commission has not yet reported, and the exodus goes on, to the tune of at least 20,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>I did not hear Deputy Cowan adverting to the position of vocational education in the City of Dublin. Deputy Cowan is as much in touch with events in Dublin as I am.  He, too, is a member of the Dublin Corporation and he must know that the Government have done nothing whatever to extend vocational education in the city.  Representatives of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee have gone to the Government to ask what their policy is and where the money is to come from to put into operation the building and other plans already prepared.  They were told: &ldquo;Go to the Dublin Corporation and see what they can do for you.&rdquo;  Last year the Dublin Corporation put up £130,000 for this purpose.  This year they have been called upon to put up another £125,000.  That is what I want to hear Deputy Cowan and other Dublin City Deputies talking about&mdash; the apparent policy of this Government reneging its responsibilities and putting them on to the rates.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that any great proportion of the millions that Deputy Cowan says are being spent, is coming the way of the Dublin ratepayers. So far as I am aware, no very significant or proper proportion of that money is coming our way.  We were asked in the Dublin Corporation only a few weeks ago to reimburse a sum of £3,000 for a temporary health clinic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard Deputy Cowan's arguments on defending, or rather not defending, this country as the most fallacious I ever heard.  I cannot quite see his reasoning and I cannot agree with his idea of not defending ourselves against outsiders. He tells us the equipment we would buy would be obsolete in a couple of years and his suggestion is we are not to do anything to defend ourselves.  It would appear that while he is thinking of that in the international direction, he is at the same time thinking about a little private army that he may or may not have.  Where he is going to get the weapons&mdash;even obsolete weapons&mdash;for that little army in order to undo Partition, I do not know.</P>
      <P>We should be prepared to defend ourselves here in this part of Ireland. We should be prepared to put on the hair shirt, if necessary, and spend to the limit on defence.  The people who talk about not defending this country obviously have not been in the Irish tradition at all.  I would advise them to read Griffith and Pearse, to read anybody, any revolutionary particularly, who ever wrote on this question. What is the use in winning freedom only to lose it, Davis said.  We must arm to the utmost.</P>
      <P>I do not attribute this to any Deputy in the House, because I have no evidence, but the only sense I can see in some arguments advanced is that some people would prefer to see somebody else either conquering us or defending us.  That is as much as I will say on it.  I believe we should defend ourselves and spend to the limit, even until it hurts us, in preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard all this rubbish about war being inevitable.  Fianna Fáil is not saying that war is inevitable. Fianna Fáil is saying what every sensible Party and every sensible leader the world over says.  They hope war is not inevitable but at the same time the people who say that are arming to the teeth, arming in defence <Col N="1552" /> of their rights and their homes.  That is what I understand as being free and guarding freedom.  There is no other way of guarding freedom except by arming.</P>
    <P>We are not against social welfare schemes.  If Deputy Cowan or any other Deputy talks about Fianna Fáil being against social welfare schemes, I say that that is not so.  The criticism directed against us by the biggest Party in the present inter-Party Government was that we were spending too much in our time on social welfare schemes.  I remember well in my early years in this House the Leaders of the Opposition talking about the squandermania of Fianna Fáil.  I remember clearly the occasion when an Opposition Deputy was asked by the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, would he be prepared to cut down on houses and what would the people do without houses and that Deputy replied: &ldquo;Let them go along to Hell and do without them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to be the opinion of that Party, that we were spending too much on social welfare, that we were creating a spirit in the people of ne'er do well, and that we were responsible for doles and everything that was un-savoury in life.  They cannot have it both ways.  We are not opposed to social welfare and I am not going to attack the scheme or the Bill.  We, in fact, are the Party who introduced the social welfare scheme in this country and the Leader of this Party and the men who form the Opposition Front Bench, are the people who can best be looked to, to operate social welfare schemes when we are again returned as a Government which I hope will be soon.  If the present Government have any honour left in them at all, they should go to the people.  The people want them to go to them so that they can turn them out of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote on Account is only part of the total bill which the Minister for Finance hopes to present to the House for sanction in the course of the next few months.  In introducing the Vote, the Minister gave a concise explanation of the various sums included in it and stated the reasons <Col N="1553" /> for the increase in the various Estimates for the coming year.  One of the points he made should, I think, command the serious consideration of Deputies and of the people of the country generally.  That is, that you cannot have increased social services and increased expenditure unless you have more production and still more production; in other words, we cannot have our cake and eat it.  The Minister referred to the fact that there was a good deal of extra money in circulation during the last few years, due to a very large extent to the fact that we have repatriated a good percentage of our sterling assets.  He expressed the view that that could be a good policy, so long as the people spent that money on essentials but he issued the warning that, so far as his judgement went, he was afraid that a good part of these assets were being spent on non-essentials. In other words, whilst we hear a good deal about the high cost of living, any man who has given any thought to the position, who keeps his eyes open and sees what is going on around him, must come to the conclusion that there is another factor responsible as well as the high cost of living and that is, the high cost of pleasure.  It may be an unpopular thing to say but it is, nevertheless, true.  Therefore when one hears about the high cost of living one should keep in mind what is happening in other directions so far as amusements and pleasure are concerned.</P>
      <P>Personally, I think that Deputies of all Parties should hearken to what has been stated by the Minister for Finance.  Deputies opposite may think that it would be good propaganda for them to quote some of the statements of the Minister for Finance but I, personally, think he would be falling in his duty if he did not, in view of the responsible position which he holds, sound a note of warning as to the course we are pursuing in this country. That refers to the people as a whole, the people who voted for Fianna Fáil as well as those who voted for the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those who always believed in the divine precept that man must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.  It is not by passing Acts of <Col N="1554" /> Parliament that this country can be made prosperous.  I believe that there is no use in magnifying out of all proportion any little inconveniences from which the people of this country suffer at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say that the inter-Party Government are infallible or that they have turned this country into a land flowing with milk and honey but I do say, as one who has studied the position of the country from every angle, that, taking a general view, the people of this country enjoy as high, if not a higher, standard of living at the present time than the people of any other country in the world.  I think we should all be thankful for that happy state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Comparisons have been made here between the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government and that at present pursued by the inter-Party Government.  Let me say, as I said when Fianna Fáil were in power, that I think they did the best they could, taking into consideration the set of circumstances which existed during those years.  I gave vent to my feelings on many occasions during those years. I wish to give vent to them again on this occasion and to tell Fianna Fáil that, when all is said and done, a great part of the policy which they pursued for those 16 years will be pursued, and must necessarily be pursued, by whatever Government succeeds them.  It would be a very sad state of affairs in this or any other country if a change of a Government meant that everything that the outgoing Government did was wrong.  I think that is an aspect of the matter that should be recognised by Deputies of all Parties.  There is no use, therefore, in wasting time in speaking to Deputies regarding the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil, especially as it affected industrial production in this country.  They pursued it at great length and made a success of it.  We are pursuing the same policy and if as a result of the efforts of the Minister for Industry and Commerce during the past three years, the numbers engaged in industry have increased and production has increased. I think that should be a matter of congratulation for all concerned, including <Col N="1555" /> the Opposition because that is a factor that is going to affect the prosperity of the people who support Fianna Fáil as well as the people who support the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>As regards other matters which have been discussed on this Vote, I made up my mind that I must obey the Chair on this occasion because it would be unwise to dwell at length on the different items that comprise this Vote.  We shall have many occasions in the next few months to deal with these questions on the Budget, but I would appeal to members of the Opposition to cease belittling the efforts that have been made in particular by the Departments of Agriculture and of Industry and Commerce.  Such criticism is not good for the future of this country.  The Fianna Fáil Party consists of 66 or 67 members and, assuming that each Deputy received between 5,000 and 6,000 votes, that Party represents a very considerable section of our people.  Neither this nor any other Government can do very much unless they have the co-operation of that large section of the people.  When a Government is established, all Irishmen who are anxious for the welfare and prosperity of the country should do what they can to assist in reason the efforts of the various Ministers. Therefore, I deplore some of the references that have been made, particularly to agriculture.  While I may not be a farmer, I come from farmer-stock.  I do not wrap myself up in a box all day, but move about a good deal.  I do not think there is any Deputy who moves as freely as I do amongst the people in the constituency I represent.  I am not going to say that the members of the farming community are all millionaires, but I can honestly say I see, on all sides, in their case a degree of prosperity which has never been equalled over the last 40 or 50 years. I say that honestly, but I may be wrong.  Human nature being what it is, I know, of course, that you will always find some people who may not be doing well.  You will find that in every sphere of life.  The human factor being what it is, you will find <Col N="1556" /> that some men cannot succeed no matter what they have.  But, leaving politics out of it altogether, I would say that the farming community, as a whole, are to-day enjoying a degree of prosperity which has never been surpassed in this country over the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>I am not attributing all that to the efforts of the inter-Party Government. The circumstances which exist at the moment may have a lot to do with it. Above all, I would say that the chief credit for it must be due to the farmers themselves, including those who support the Fianna Fáil Party.  That again, I suggest brings home the force of my argument that you must have co-operation if you want to have prosperity in the country.  Therefore, when I hear a Deputy say that the farmers are a depressed class my feeling is that such as statement is not calculated to do a good service to his Party, to the people as a whole or to the country.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the question of unemployment.  There, again, that is a matter which cannot be solved overnight.  Since I became a member of this House almost 24 years ago, I have been preaching that there is no such thing as a solution for unemployment. The human element enters into that, too.  You will always have unemployment as you will always have emigration.  I have made that clear in every election which I have fought.  I have never promised the people that I had a solution for that problem.  It is a problem which will always remain not only here but in all countries.  Therefore, there is not much use in quoting statistics as to the number who are or who are not employed.  About 19 years ago, when the present Leader of the Opposition was in opposition, I remember him making a statement to the effect that he saw no reason why this country could not support 9,000,000 people.  I was only a back bencher at the time, and I said to him that sooner or later, he would have to go back on that statement, which he did.  I give him every credit for doing so.  He found later that it was a much more difficult question to solve than he then thought, and I give him credit for having made that admission.  As a back bencher at the time, I knew that <Col N="1557" /> it was one of the things which could not be solved, and that never will be solved.  The only thing a Government can do is to keep down the numbers as far as possible.  There, again, the question of its solution, even in a partial manner, will depend to a very large extent on the Government and the Opposition working together in providing the ways and means of giving added employment to those who at the moment are unemployed.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make is one which I have repeated many a time from public platforms during general elections.  I want to emphasise it here and now.  The point is that there seems to be an inclination on the part of the people of this country not to recognise the fact that this is a small country, and that we can give a certain decent standard of living to the majority of our people, that is in the physical sense&mdash;not from the point of view of pleasure or amusement, but from the point of view of physique and good health.  If people would only recognise that fact this could be one of the best and happiest countries in the world.  We cannot give a standard of living to certain of our people, one which, to say the least of it, would not be good for them.  We have to remember that this is a small country of about 3,000,000 people.  It depends in the main on agriculture.  We must admit, when all is said and done, that agriculture is the mainstay of the country.  When we see how the people engaged in that industry live, I think we must come to the conclusion that, though we are a small country, we are enjoying here as high as a standard of living as can be found in any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>The warning that I want to issue is that, if we want to maintain that standard of living we can only do so by hard work and by increased production, and by more production, to use the words of Sir Stafford Cripps when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Labour Government in England a few years ago.  Acts of Parliament will not make this country prosperous but rather co-operation between employers and employees, together with the doing away of class distinction, the mistrust <Col N="1558" /> and the selfish spirit which seem to be creeping in amongst the people of this country, and which, if persisted in, will do more damage than all the guns or airplanes of an enemy or of an invading army.</P>
    <P>I think that, taking everything into consideration, this Vote on Account, although it only represents something less than one-third of the total amount which will be necessary to carry on the government of the country during the next 12 months, is one that should be examined very carefully by all Deputies.  We should not forget the fact that we can only give the money to whatever Minister is in power as we have it.</P>
    <P>The best way to have it is to work for it.  I should like to say also with regard to taxation, especially on the farming community, that I was surprised and pleased to hear the Minister for Social Welfare stating that almost 75 per cent. of the moneys given by way of social services, old age pensions and so on, went to the rural community which proves that all the moneys raised for carrying on the social services of the country do not go merely into the pockets of those in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I make this final appeal, that, if we want this country to prosper, there must be more co-operation and less carping criticism.  This talk about a general election is all moonshine.  It may provide a certain amount of excitement for the Irish people&mdash;we are an excitable people and we like excitement&mdash;but general elections are not just good paying things.  As to the people being bubbling over with a desire to get this Government out, I might remind Deputies that I am in my constituency almost every day and I have never met one man yet who said that we should get out.  If we are as bad as we are made out to be, I should imagine that there would be howling mobs with bludgeons outside the gates to meet every member of the inter-Party Government.  I do not see these things happening.  Let the Opposition wait for another year and a half and all Parties will have an opportunity of putting their respective programmes before the people.  This being a democratic country, the people can put this <Col N="1559" /> Government out.  We will give them the opportunity, but we will not go until the time is up, because we believe we have a duty to carry on for the five years for which we were elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister brought in this Vote on Account, he scarcely had in mind the matters of which Deputy Coburn has reminded the House, that we are a small, poor country of about 3,000,000 population, that the only way we can afford to pay this Bill is by working hard, that we are mainly an agricultural country, and that all these millions, or the main part of them, must come from agriculture. I wonder if the Minister, in preparing the Estimates represented by this Bill, I had all these things in mind.  We have heard people in this House described as having faces of brass.  It is a popular phrase with the Minister for Agriculture when referring to Opposition Deputies.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister for Finance has a face of brass in coming before a country of 3,000,000 people, a people who are mainly an agricultural people, and asking them to foot the bill set out here in the Book of Estimates, plus another £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 for Central Fund Services and large amounts for borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although when they took office, each and every group represented in the Government was pledged to reduce taxation, to reduce the cost of living and to make the country a better, a cheaper and an easier place to live in, in the three years during which this heaven-sent Government has been in office, the cost of Government has increased by £28,000,000.  In addition, £54,000,000 have been borrowed in the same period, plus £41,000,000 made available out of the Transition Development Fund, which is borrowed money also.  That means that £95,000,000 of borrowed money has been at the disposal of the Minister in the past three years.  The national debt has increased by almost 100 per cent., leaving aside the American counterpart fund, in these three years and the service of debt has gone up practically 100 per cent.  There are the Minister's <Col N="1560" /> figures and I am sure he will not deny them.</P>
    <P>Can the country afford to continue increasing the cost of Government each year?  When this Minister took office in February, 1948, the Book of Estimates was just being issued and he incorporated in that Book of Estimates the now famous blue slip stating that the Coalition Government were repudiating that Book of Estimates, that they were not accepting it and did not propose to provide moneys to honour it, but, in spite of that, we find that in three years he has increased the cost of Government services by £28,000,000 over and above what it was in the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, gave no justification whatever for that huge increase, for that alarming and frightening increase, in the cost of Government.  Remember that this sum of £28,000,000 adds nothing whatever to the wealth of this community. It is true that it may be providing a livelihood for a large number of people, but it adds nothing to the community's wealth.  It is completely non-productive and will return nothing to the Exchequer, except what comes in in the shape of income-tax.  The capital and other services of this State have gone up from almost £59,000,000 in 1947-48 to over £83,000,000 in 1951-52, and capital liabilities have gone up from £100,000,000 to £183,000,000. While the Fianna Fáil Government in their 16 years of office borrowed £38,000,000, the Coalition Government in three years have borrowed £39,000,000.  In addition, they have borrowed 128,000,000 dollars and they also got 16,000,000 dollars in grants.  Is it any wonder that we have the claim that there is prosperity in the country, whether there is or not.  There should be prosperity of a type hitherto unknown in this country when all these millions are being let loose.  If we have not got prosperity when all the millions being screwed out of the taxpayers' pockets, not to speak of the amounts taken from the pockets of the ratepayers, and all the millions being borrowed we are being let loose in the spending spree we have had in the past three years, we will never have prosperity in this nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> It never can, because it will be agreed even by the Minister for Finance that this borrowing and going into debt cannot continue.  This nation cannot continue on the basis of borrowing and of increasing the public debt, in addition to increasing taxation&mdash;taking people's earnings year by year.  We see the colossal sums that the Minister is demanding for the present year.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate which has ranged over many problems, charges were made against this Party to the effect that when we were in office we did not provide money for social services on the same grand scale as this Coalition Government now proposes to do.  It might be interesting to throw our minds back over a few years and to see what Fianna Fáil did during its term of office.  One of our first actions in 1932 was to restore the shilling to the old age pensioners which our predecessors in office had taken from them when they were hard up for money.  Just imagine that there was an Irish Government, less than 20 years ago, that took a shilling from the old age pensioners&mdash;and the majority of the members of that Government are now sitting on the Government Front Bench to-day.  However, Fianna Fáil restored to the old age pensioners in 1932 the amount which they were getting previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Rooney object to that?  They also brought in many other social benefits for the poorer sections of the community.  There is, further, the question of unemployment assistance.  Many of us can remember that less than 20 years ago a man, if he was not in industrial employment and happened to lose whatever employment he might have had, had nothing to fall back on but home assistance.  That was so in 1927, 1928 and 1929 and it affected many fine young agricultural workers in the country. If men employed in towns in nonindustrial employment happened to lose their employment, there was no public fund except the Home Assistance Fund to draw on&mdash;and what they got from that was not capable of keeping body and soul together.  We also brought in a Wet Time Insurance Act, which operatives in the building industry hailed at the time and which is praised at present as being one of the best Acts ever introduced.  Numbers of people engaged in the building industry have told me that during the past winter, because of all the bad weather and frost during December of last year and January and February of this year, they would have found themselves in very serious difficulties were it not for the Wet Time Insurance Act which enabled them to draw two-thirds of their ordinary rate of pay during all the broken weather in these past three months.  In addition, we increased unemployment insurance benefit by 50 per cent. in 1947.  We increased national health insurance benefit by an extra 50 per cent. and both without any extra charge to the insured person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first actions of the Coalition Government was to steamroll an Act through this House forcing the employees and the employers to pay extra on stamps each week.  At the time the Labour Party in this House were as quite as mice, as the Minister for Agriculture said.  They allowed this Act to go through without a protest even though it imposed an extra burden on the workers of the country. We introduced a Holidays Act to give holidays with pay to many sections. <Col N="1563" /> of the workers, for the first time in the history of this country.  Our social legislation at that time was in advance of that of any other country in Europe.  We gave the farm workers, for the first time ever, a charter which entitled them to a minimum rate of wages.  That social benefit affected many thousands of farm workers and it is still regarded as a great benefit by the agricultural workers of this country.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government an extra £9,000,000 was provided for social services, while only £4,000,000 was provided for that purpose by their predecessors in office.  At the time we left office £13,000,000 were being paid out in social services to the different sections of the community.  We built 34 hospitals and tens of thousands of houses.  The great Health Act of 1947 was put through this House by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Under that Act, full benefits were provided for the first time for those who are unfortunate enough to be suffering from tuberculosis, and also for their families.  It has taken three years, a lot of noise, hot talk and nonsense before any further section of that Act has been put into operation.  The mother and child section of that Act was ready to be brought in when the present Government took office.  It is not going to come into operation yet.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare published a scheme in 1946. When he was Deputy Norton he announced it in this House and told the country about it.  He published it during the general election campaign, but it was almost three years before that scheme saw the light of day.  He was not then, however, simple Deputy Norton, but Minister for Social Welfare.  What happened to the scheme of plain Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party in this House, the scheme published in 1946 or 1947 that was going to cost only £26,000,000 or £28,000,000?  Lo and behold, this one is going to cost £6,000,000.  That was a big climb down, and I am sure that the Minister for Finance had a big hand in paring down <Col N="1565" /> that wonderful scheme which the Minister for Social Welfare had prepared and on which he fought the election in 1948 and which he had published a year before in pamphlet form.  Deputy Fitzpatrick may have seen it.</P>

      <P>To finance those schemes you will have recourse to borrowing if you can find anyone who will give you anything.  The counterpart fund, of course, is at the Minister's disposal and is not all used up.  He can draw on that for a while, but, unfortunately for the country, the day of the spending <Col N="1566" /> spree will come to an end very shortly and well the Minister for Finance knows that.  Our sterling assets, about which there has been so much talk in the country during the last three years, are being brought home, but they are being brought home via luxury goods, not for capital investment.  They are being depleted and spent on luxury goods.  That is not what the country and the House would like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>All you have to do is to read the Minister for Finance's opening statement on this Vote on Account and you will see that, while he is very perturbed, he has not succeeded in influencing his colleagues in the Cabinet about the seriousness of the situation.  I am sure that he has told them time after time that this colossal borrowing cannot go on. There has been much talk about general elections, but the people are more perturbed about the colossal borrowing and the money which is being spent like jackstones by this Government than about anything else.</P>
      <P>Any family knows quite well that if it goes into debt it is only a matter of days, weeks or months until it must go bankrupt.  If a family goes on spending more than it earns in any week or year it will be pile up debt and credit comes to an end in a short time.  The danger is that our credit, because of this colossal spending and borrowing and the dissipation of our assets abroad, must come to an end in a short time.  In introducing the Vote on Account the Minister for Finance said (column 789, Volume 124, No. 5):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The disturbing feature, of course, is the deficit in the balance of payments, particularly when that is marked by the great increase in consumption here, especially when that great increase in consumption is attached to the non-essential goods. The continuance of such a situation for any period would be highly dangerous.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is being done to stop that situation from continuing?  He went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It would jeopardise the policy, popularly, I think, approved of, to <Col N="1567" /> repatriate sterling assets.  But repatriation of sterling assets is only of use if they are used solely or mainly for investment and development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Were the £30,000,000 sterling assets which we brought home last year used for development or investment at home?  The Minister for Finance seems to think they were not?  He goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the development policy must be continued, that policy can only be continued without danger if the savings of the community are increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are the savings of this community being increased at the present time? Is our agricultural output greater now than it was in 1938?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It just barely reached the 1938 figure and is not increasing. The indications are that the increase which took place since the end of the war has now ceased.  Referring to the repatriation of our sterling assets, the Minister also said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They can be increased if people refrain from expenditure on non-essential goods.  There is a tremendous margin over what was spent in 1938.  There is plenty of slack to be gathered in.  That is the chief lesson to be learned from the economic trend of 1950.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will seek to gather in that slack.  It will be necessary to gather it in from somewhere.  It will not be got from the Phoenix Park, as all that is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the country is disturbed because of many serious factors in Government policy.  It is well known to every section of the community that this Government, and many members of it, are being driven along a line they do not approve of.  It is a well-known fact that, day after day, month after month and year after year, this Government, in order to maintain its position as a Government and keep <Col N="1568" /> itself together, had to pay out to one or other group of its members, in one form or another, by giving way in this direction or that, in order to keep itself together.</P>

      <P>I will deal with that in a moment and am glad the Deputy reminded me about it.  There were many pay-outs to the groups forming the Government, in order to keep them together for the last three years, very many pay-outs at the expense of the community, at the expense of the taxpayer. That is a well-known fact, which is disturbing the people more than anything else.  That is why they are wishing for a general election, wishing for an opportunity of putting in place of the present Government a Government of responsibility.</P>

They need not wait to send State servants out to make the publicity they are hoping to get from this extra 2/6. The House and the country know why this was announced last Friday, why it was not announced the previous Friday or six months ago.  Everyone is fully aware that the extra £1,000,000 was provided for one purpose.  It was not for the interest of the old age pensioners, but to keep the 13 Ministers together in that Coalition Government. It was the price that was paid, the latest price, and it will be charged against the country, to keep the Coalition together.  Is not that a well-known fact?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very happy at all.  That is the price this country is paying for its so-called liberty under its Twenty-Six County Republic. Included in this bill before the House is money that it is proposed to vote out of the Counterpart Fund for certain financial expenditure on land rehabilitation and under the Works Act.  I want to say, with a full sense of responsibility, having seen these two Acts of the Oireachtas in operation, that the big proportion of that money is being badly spent and will bring no return whatever to any section of this community.  The works Act, it is true, is providing much-needed employment for many men who had no other employment in rural areas.  To that extent only it serves useful purpose.  There may be here and there a minor drainage scheme of certain utility and of certain advantage to the community being done but, taking the work, by and large, that is being done in order to spend this money, it is of no utility whatever and will give no return.  The Government would be wise to apply for the authority of E.C.A. to spend this money in other ways.  It could be spent by the local authorities with great advantage on the country roads, on tourist roads, if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not need their authority to spend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should use his influence with the Minister for Local Government to divert a big proportion of that money from the so-called drainage and the waste that is going on to county councils to reconstruct county roads.  We are providing in a Supplementary Estimate which the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be introducing this evening almost £1,000,000 to subsidise the <Col N="1572" /> transport company of this country&mdash; Córas Iompair Éireann, as it is known. We do not know how many millions the State may have to provide in future years in order to keep that transport company going.  But everyone in this country does know that the traffic formerly carried by Córas Iompair Éireann has all been thrown on the roads which were never planned for such traffic and which cannot be maintained at present out of local taxation.</P>
      <P>This money that is being spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act could more usefully have been diverted to building up the county roads.  We have thousands and thousands of miles of them in the country.  There is no doubt that, if a major emergency does not arise, motor transport has come to stay and that the goods of this country will be carried on the roads in future. The railways may be performing a useful service in a limited way, but some future Dáil may have some doubt as to whether the railways justify the expenditure on them.  Personally, I should like to see the railways maintained, but I say with all responsibility that if the cost of maintaining the railways, with no traffic on them, is to be borne by the taxpayers, the taxpayers also will have to bear the additional burden of building up the roadways in order to carry the traffic of the country.  It cannot be done otherwise.  We have thousands and thousands of miles of country roads and many hundreds of miles of ordinary main roads which must be built up and which will cost anything from £2,000 to £4,000 a mile to make them suitable for carrying the traffic that is being carried on them at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Counterpart Fund could be more usefully spent in the interests of the whole country rather than continuing with this drainage work.  It would give as much employment to people living in the rural areas as it given at present to men who have to work in rivers in the depth of winter.  These men could not have carried on for the last three months up to their hips in water without keeping themselves warm by taking shelter and getting paid at the end of the week for that. That is all the majority of them have <Col N="1573" /> been doing.  We do not blame them for that.  That Works Bill was forced through this House.  The scheme may have served a purpose in the first year by the carrying out of some drainage, but, from what I have seen of it over a wide area of the country, there is no responsible person in public life who would recommend its continuance on the present basis.  The money has been literally thrown down the drain.  It has given employment to many thousands of men who had no other employment, but that is all it has done.  If that money had been given to these men for the carrying out of some useful work it would have been all the better.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take note of that and that he will consult his colleagues and the Deputies sitting behind him who know what is going on and how this money is being spent.  It may be that in the Midlands or in the flatter areas of the country an amount of useful work has been done, but a serious check up on that should take place. The money should not be spent purely for the purpose of giving employment. It should be expended in a way which will give a return to the nation.  It certainly will not give such a return by being expended in the way I have seen it expended for the last three years.  I have no objection to spending money on giving employment.  I only wish there was more money available for the employment of more men.  But it is not giving any return to the nation in the way in which it is being spent.</P>
    <P>There are also mixed feelings amongst the people as to whether the money which is being spent on the land rehabilitation scheme is going to give results.  It is certainly not going to do what the Minister for Social Welfare claims in the little Blue Book he issued boosting his Social Welfare Bill in which he claimed that the £40,000,000 which the farmers would get under the land rehabilitation scheme would put them in a position to be well off enough to pay the 3/6 or the 6/- extra per week for their employees.</P>
    <P>I should also like to advert to the policy of the Government in importing products that could be produced in this country.  I refer especially to the policy <Col N="1574" /> of importing the wheat that we need when much of it could be produced at home.  A very drastic change is needed in that respect.  No one man in this State has the right to determine what the national policy of the country in any direction should be.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture was opposed to the growing and producing of wheat in this country.  He has made no secret of that.  Recently he announced in this House that he was having last year's Irish wheat ground into animal feeding.  I wonder if it is good national policy to degrade the product of our land.  No Minister in an Irish Government should degrade any product of his own country whether it be from field or factory. Least of all should the wheat that is necessary for the maintenance of the human being in the country be belittled, ridiculed and damaged in the eyes of the people.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Finance that the policy of importing wheat at £32 a ton and offering the Irish farmer only £25 a ton is a bad financial and a bad national policy.  It should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearly as bad as importing it at £50 a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is bad under any circumstances. The matter of £50 per ton for wheat can be discussed separately and on its own merits.  It has been useful propaganda for the Coalition to talk about £50 a ton for wheat and about the fact that in 1949 with a lesser acreage of wheat there was a higher yield as compared with the year 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every farmer who lived on the land in this country in 1946 or 1947, whether he is 60, 70 or 80 years of age, if he is still alive, knows quite well that the most serious year in his lifetime from the point of view of farming was 1947. Every farmer will admit that no matter what his politics are in other directions. The yield from all products of the land in 1947 was down to zero because of the severe winter of 1946 and the bad weather in 1947.  It is a well-known fact that the turf crop could not be saved that year either.  It is also a well-known fact that the cow population <Col N="1575" /> of the country that year did not give the produce it would give in a normal year.  It is wrong altogether to be using the year 1947, as it has been used, for propaganda purposes only and comparing the yield that year with the normal yield over ten, or 15 years previously.</P>
    <P>The highest yield in cereal crops was obtained in this country in 1949. That is an admitted fact.  When the Minister or any Minister or anybody else compares the year 1949 with 1947 I would say that is wrong and damaging the national interests.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the matter of the tomato crop.  The Minister for Agriculture set out to kill wheat, tomatoes and root seeds growing.  He has succeeded in all three directions.  He has succeeded admirably.  It is extraordinary that with a Party of over 70 sitting behind him the Minister for Agriculture is allowed to get away with it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the House or the Minister any longer.  This has been a prolonged debate.  I want to say that the bill with which the Minister has faced the country in the present year is a colossal one.  Much of the borrowing he proposes to do in the present year is for services which were provided by the previous Government out of taxation year after year. That colossal bill will damage the future interests of this State.  Labour Members who sit in this House should take serious note of it because it is the workers, when this money is expended, who will first be affected through loss of employment, reduced standards of living and reduced earnings. The end of it will be the emigrant ship.  That must be the end of this mad hatter scheme of finance, borrowing and colossal spending which is the policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>I thought the Deputy said he was not going to delay the House any longer.  Deputy MacEntee told us in the same terms that under the present Coalition Government the country would be reduced to economic servitude.  That is the note of the debate, the country is being reduced to economic servitude.</P>
      <P>If we have not immediate mass unemployment, low wage conditions, depressed conditions both in agriculture and industry and the emigrant ship, we are certainly going to have them in a couple of years.  That was the moaning which was started here on the Vote on Account in 1948.  It deepened its tone in the Budget of 1948.  It was repeated with monotonous regularity on the two occasions last year, and here we have it again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, dealing with the Book of Estimates, the foundation for all this wailing and moaning, told us in a speech at column 1035, Official Dáil Debates for Thursday, 1st March, 1951:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I said here last year in the debate on the Vote on Account that I had gone through the Book of Estimates and that I had examined every Estimate in it with a view to ascertaining whether there were any specific economies I could recommend and that, a part from cutting out some follies and fripperies, there was nothing I could suggest which would make any significant difference in the total figures.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said here on Thursday that he was not in a position to indicate any significant economies; that there were a few Coalition follies scattered around the Book of Estimates but that they would not be significant in relation to the total bill of £83,000,000 because when one talks in terms of a saving of £25,000, and that was the only thing put up by the Deputy who said that he could pick out a few follies here and there and that the tot was in the region <Col N="1577" /> of £83,000,000, it shows exactly how genuine he is when he says he can suggest no economies in the bill.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree also that many, if not all, of the genuine capital projects upon which the Government proposed to embark were desirable; that in fact its investment programme was on the whole desirable apart from borrowing to meet Budget deficits or to defray the costs of various recurring grants which would create no Exchequer assets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, there we are.  He did say also on 6th March that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The level of borrowing is a different matter.  The Government has a special responsibility to safeguard the national resources entrusted to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and then came this significant comment from Deputy Lemass:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt whatever that the public of this country want investment in housing, hospitals, electricity, telephones, afforestation, land improvement, in all the things which were on the list given by the Minister when announcing his capital budget last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The public want these.  There are no economies in the Book of Estimates that can be suggested and as far as capital projects are concerned the public wants these things.</P>
    <P>I will deal with his comments on borrowing in a moment.  Later he said, when interruptions brought him back to what he said in 1948 when he had condemned me for what he described as championing a policy of austerity&mdash; I quote again from his speech on 6th March:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I said in 1948 that in the circumstances of that year there was no need in this country for a policy of austerity.  I was assuming that the Minister for Finance in outlining his policy in that year meant what he said.  I have not yet discovered that he was speaking then with his tongue in his cheek.  I argued strongly that in the circumstances of 1948, having regard to the sound position of this country at the end of the war year <Col N="1578" /> and having regard to the general expectation of an improvement in economic conditions throughout the world, that we did not have to embark on a policy of restriction such as the Minister for Finance appeared then to be foreshadowing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask to be allowed to make this comment on that.  Have the circumstances of this country improved since 1948, since the day when Deputy Lemass ceased to be a Minister and became an ordinary Deputy?  I suggest they have.  I suggest that every economic statistic we have bears out that fact.  Therefore, there was no reason for a policy of restriction such as he thought I was then foreshadowing. But Deputy Lemass went even further on 2nd March and stated that he did not think circumstances had arisen to justify a policy to which the name of austerity could reasonably be applied.  I took that statement by Deputy Lemass as setting the discussion here in its proper framework and one member of the Opposition at least, after indulging in the same volume of lamentation that Deputy Lemass set as an undesirable precedent for the rest of his followers, paid attention to it.  Deputy Lemass admitted there was nothing in the Book of Estimates that he could cut out.  One knows what that means. There is nothing in the Book of Estimates that he will not stand over if anybody suggests the excision of a particular service because Deputy Lemass knows that at least these services are popular.</P>
    <P>When it comes to borrowing, he is of the view that there is nothing in the programme outlined that the people do not want, and as a corollary to that&mdash;and I expect Deputy Lemass to accept the corollary to his argument&mdash;there is no project that Deputy Lemass would hesitate to go on with: to put it positively, any Government, even if Deputy Lemass were a member of that Government, would continue with all these projects.  The only difference between us then is that Deputy Lemass would carry out these projects, or most of them, by means of taxation.  Yet, Deputy Lemass and all his faithful followers complained bitterly throughout the debate that <Col N="1579" /> taxation was too heavy.  They told us that the present rate of taxation is having the effect of depressing business people.  Deputy MacEntee actually said that people had been &ldquo;stood off&rdquo; because of the Price Freeze Order.</P>
    <P>A picture was painted of a failing agricultural industry.  It was said that there had been no increase of any kind except in unemployment, emigration and depression.  We were told that all that is due to taxation.  Yet, the very people who tell us that these ills are due to taxation tell us in the same breath that they would carry out our programme by means of taxation, instead of trying to limit, as we are doing, in a reasonable and prudent way, the weight of taxation upon the generation in which we live.  That is the chief contradiction that appears in the Opposition speeches.</P>
    <P>Now, that is the first point to which I would like to address myself in concluding this debate: is it or is it not reasonably prudent when we are faced with the necessity of carrying out so many schemes, schemes that are thought so desirable not only by those who support the Coalition but by their opponents on the Opposition benches?  Possibly we shall have this matter debated here on another occasion in a more reasonable way, when we can get away from the lament that there is something imprudent in doing what we are doing.  Is it worth while taking such a risk as undoubtedly attaches to the great capital development programme upon which we embarked last year, and with which we are proceeding this year?</P>
    <P>I would like to deal, first of all, with some of the minor matters that were raised here before I deal with that important point.  Deputy Lynch spoke in this debate under the handicap of being a professional man because he had to speak after his would-be leader had told him that the most stupid of men he, Deputy Lemass, had ever met outside the law were the lawyers themselves.  The result was that Deputy Lynch spoke with considerably less verve than he usually does.  I presume the reason for his loss of verve was because of his leader's comment. He did, however, harp on the <Col N="1580" /> plaint that he and Deputy McGrath have in relation to the fuel situation in Cork over the Christmas period.  I understand that the situation was that in the early part of the year, a few days after the New Year dawned, Deputy McGrath and Deputy Lynch sent a joint telegram to the Department of Industry and Commerce to the effect that fuel supplies were short. In fact, they said they were at famine point in the City of Cork, and that fuel should be made available immediately, particularly for the poor. Inquiries were straightaway made by the Department the day after the telegram was received.</P>
    <P>These inquiries revealed that certain firms in Cork had over a week's supply on hands and were supplying consumers freely.  One merchant in Cork stated that no one need go short of a bag of coal.  The Department followed up that investigation by sending an inspector down.  The results of his investigation showed that, while some merchants had run out of coal, others had stocks of coal on hands and were selling it freely to domestic consumers; and, in any event, cargoes of Polish coal were due to reach Cork a few days afterwards.  Those cargoes did reach Cork a few days afterwards and since that time there has been no complaint with regard to the fuel situation there.</P>
    <P>What is abundantly clear from all this is that this was merely another scandalous attempt, similar to attempts that have been made over the past three years, on the part of Fianna Fáil to make political capital out of the exigencies of a situation, no matter how unreasonable their action might be and no matter how easy it might be to view the situation in its proper perspective and adopt a sensible attitude towards it.  Deputy Aiken led off with a complaint; Deputy Lemass followed him but I think it was left to Deputy Derrig to make the chief burden of his song a complaint with regard to the development of the cement industry. The precise statement was made here by both Deputy Aiken and Deputy Lemass that they had plans in hand before they left office for the expansion of the cement plant at Limerick.  I have turned up a famous minute that <Col N="1581" /> has been often referred to in this House but mainly in connection with the matter of turf production.  It is of date 12th February, 1948, about a week before Deputy Lemass left office.  It is a record of a conference presided over by Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>To that conference there came, amongst a number of other things, a report with regard to cement.  It stated that the cement company had indicated that they were planning a development&mdash;that they were <i>planning</i> a development&mdash;and the decision that was taken by this departmental conference, on the 12th February, 1948, under the presidency of Deputy Lemass, was that the cement company's scheme for development would be examined when submitted.  On the 12th February, 1948, they had not even got a plan for it and there was no expansion promised.  There was a mere recording in a minute that the scheme for development would be examined when submitted.  Despite that, the scandalous perversion is chanced here that there was a scheme for the development of the cement industry in Limerick and that we had upset the plans which the Fianna Fáil Government had in train for that.</P>

      <P>On the 12th February, 1948, the scheme for development would be examined when submitted. At the same conference of the 12th February, they discussed turf &mdash;I will come to the details of that in a moment&mdash;and they decided that no provision was to be made in respect of hand-won turf in the 1948-49 Estimates. They, presumably, discussed wheat on that occasion too but it was not until the end of the week, I think about the 17th, that the decision was taken, of course, to pay the £50 a ton for the Argentine wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke of the rural <Col N="1582" /> electrification scheme and again the attempt is made here to confuse Deputies and to have it represented that there was a grand scheme, with detailed plans, for progress in that rural electrification scheme, made out by him, and that that progress has been interrupted.  In fact, the situation is that this matter started in the year to the 31st March, 1947.  I am speaking, in each year, of the year to the 31st March.  In the year to the 31st March, 1947, the scheme was just barely getting under way.  In 1948, if I take the mileage of lines strung, there were 700 odd miles strung; the number of consumers connected was 2,200; there were seven areas completed. The advance that was made for rural electrification was £550,000. For the year to the 31st March, 1949, the miles of lines strung was 1,730; the number of consumers connected was 9,262; there were 30 areas completed and the advance made for rural electrification was in the region of £900,000.  In the year to the 31st March, 1950, there were 2,083 miles of lines strung; consumers connected rose to 13,688; there were 45 areas completed, at a cost, by way of advance, of £1,050,000; and as between 1st April, 1950, and the end of December, 1950, there were almost 16,000 miles of lines strung, which is, roughly, the same progress as in 1949; 116,786 consumers connected, 34 areas completed, and the amount of money provided by way of advance was £1,300,000.</P>
    <P>People will not understand these figures as I read them but they may look at them in the Official Report when published.  There is nothing there on which anybody can possibly found a complaint that there is not the progress being maintained in connection with rural electrification that was decided upon.</P>
    <P>Another complaint is with regard to Irish Shipping, Limited, and here again it is sought to delude the Dáil into believing that there was a plan to have the tonnage of the Irish mercantile marine increased to the point that all our seaborne traffic could be taken by ships of Irish Shipping, Limited.  It is a fact that in 1943, as far back as that, a Cabinet committee agreed that Irish Shipping, Limited, should proceed <Col N="1583" /> with the preparation of plans for the development of an Irish mercantile marine on the lines outlined in a previously prepared memorandum and it was aimed to make the aggregate tonnage of the company's fleet not less than 250,000 tons dead weight.  That was 1943.  But, in 1947, Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in this House, said that provision was being made in legislation for increased capital so that, if necessary, the company could call upon it to implement fully their plans for the establishment of a worth-while merchant fleet composed of modern ships. No such capital provision was made by Deputy Lemass while he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the matter remained there until the present Government took it up.  They have added&mdash;to a slight degree only&mdash;to the tonnage of Irish Shipping, Limited.  It is not an easy matter to decide as to what tonnage they should eventually aim at, but all that I can interject in this debate is that there is no question of progress or arrangements or plans being made by the last Government which the present Government interrupted. There was no provision by way of money for plans, but the acceptance in an academic way of a plan, which was toned down by the then Minister, Deputy Lemass, when he said, not that they were aiming at the 250,000 dead weight tonnage, but that the aim was to get a worth-while fleet.</P>
    <P>I am not competent to deal with the many matters that have been discussed here with regard to agriculture.  I have been irritated during the course of this discussion by the numerous falsehoods that have been tossed into the debate by members of the Opposition with regard to agricultural production. It will take many repetitions, I am sure, of the particular figures I have here before the situation with regard to butter in this country will be clearly disclosed.  The fact of the matter is, as the Minister for Agriculture has so often said in recent days, weeks and months, that in the year 1950 there was more creamery butter produced and consumed in this country than there ever was in the history of <Col N="1584" /> the country since it became a country. More butter was produced and consumed. There were other occasions when more butter was produced.  In the year 1950, the home consumption of creamery butter was 745,000 cwts. odd. In the year 1934 the production of creamery butter was more than that and for a number of years about that time&mdash;1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938&mdash; the production, in thousands of cwts. was as follows: 769, 827, 837, 758 and 766 but in those years there was an export which ranged from 454,000 cwts. of creamery butter in 1934 to 327,000 in the year 1938.  There was an average of about 430,000 cwts., I would say, exported in each of those years and it was exported bearing a heavy subsidy, the fact of the matter, then, being that the people of this country could not afford to buy and consume the amount of creamery butter which was produced, as nowadays they can.  That is the big improvement in the country.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get a proper line with regard to wheat.  It did appear to me as I listened to certain Opposition Deputies debating the Vote on Account that their anxiety was for ploughed fields and if you could get a statistical return that there were so many acres under the plough, it did not matter what those ploughed acres produced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>If anything.  The whole ideal appears to be, can you get a statistical return showing a greater area of earth in this country ploughed? In any case, these figures appear to be relevant.  One way in which this is challenged is, is not it a poor thing to be paying money abroad for such things as wheat and flour?</P>
      <P>In 1947, when the country was under the control of Fianna Fáil, the net imports of wheat and flour cost £7,742,000.  In 1950 the imports of wheat and flour cost £5,668,000.  There was £2,000,000 less spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was £2,000,000 less spent than in 1947.  Now I will come to the bad year.  In July, <Col N="1585" /> 1947, the Fianna Fáil Government had to prepare a reply to the Food and Agriculture Committee&mdash;that was a committee of the Commission on European Economic Co-operation&mdash;and they gave a forecast of what the national production would be in respect of certain crops.  Their forecast for the year 1950-51 was that they would reduce the wheat acreage to 247,000 acres.  Last year, in the year in which they forecast 247,000 acres of wheat, we grew actually 366,000 acres. Deputy Kissane mentioned that that was the bad year, and he was excusing these comparisons with 1947. There is the programme that Fianna Fáil was aiming at, that in the year 1950-51 they would sow 247,000 acres of wheat.  We had actually 366,000 acres.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that one should in this matter look to acreages.  In 1947, in the Fianna Fáil period of office, within this bad year that is talked about, 579,000 acres were under wheat and that acreage produced 313,000 tons of wheat.  In 1949 we had 366,000 acres of wheat and we produced 360,000 tons of wheat.  Does Deputy Kissane want us to go back to the 579,000 acres, almost 600,000 acres, almost half-yielding acres, or would he not rather have the 366,000 acres producing the 360,000 tons of wheat?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have one figure to argue on.  If the Deputy wants the figures for 1945 we will get them.  Will he now tell me, if 1945 had a bigger yield or if 1945 had a better acreage, why was the forecast for 1950-51 made out and sent to the European Commission as 247,000 acres? Why did the people around the Deputy advise the Government to forecast to the Food and Agriculture Committee that the acreage would be reduced to 247,000 acres?  That apparently was their plan.  It is all very well to talk about the plans for the Irish Mercantile <Col N="1586" /> Marine and for turf and cement and to put forward complaints that Fianna Fáil plans were not carried out.  Here, in any event, was a target that they set for themselves.  Their target was 247,000 acres, and that is the figure I bear in mind when I hear any complaints about reduced acreages for certain crops.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy went so far as to suggest that the numbers in live stock were down.  Cattle numbers are up. In the figures here, in the calculations made in January in each of the years 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951, there is an increase from 3.7 million cattle to 3.9 million cattle Sheep also show an increase.  Pigs show a slight decrease from 1950, but a definite increase from 1947.  Poultry show a decrease from 1950, but a definite increase from 1947.  In all these increases of live stock, making a comparison with the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government, there has been an improvement in every grade. There have been ups and downs with regard to sheep, pigs and poultry, but in all cases the figures are well over the returns for January, 1947.</P>
      <P>There was another complaint voiced in the House.  It has been made often and it was made as recently as the 28th February this year in the Seanad when Deputy Corish, the Parliamentary Secretary, was speaking there on the Rates on Agricultural Land Bill.  I think it worth while to put the figures on record here.  Deputy Corry stated during the debate here that an effort was being made by the Government to transfer a lot of the burdens that were previously paid for by the Central Government on to the local authorities. Certain figures were given by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Corish, on the 28th February, in the Seanad&mdash;column 474 of the Seanad Debates&mdash;and I will mention a few of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that in 1947-48 the total rates collected amounted to £9,111,000 and State grants were £8,230,000.  I am taking that as the last Fianna Fáil year.  The rates exceeded the State grants by about £1,000,000.  In 1948-49, the total rates collected were £9,500,000 and the State grants were £10,749,000. In 1949-50, the total rates collected <Col N="1587" /> were £10,900,000, but the State grants came to £13,649,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary summed that up by stating that it meant, in effect, that the State grants equalled only 60 per cent. of the total rates collected in 1939-40, and in 1949-50 they equalled 120 per cent. of what was taken from the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, speaking here and hurriedly flying from the House the moment the Minister for Agriculture rose to reply to him, made the burden of his song the money which is being taken by customs and excise duties on certain matters connected with motoring, the money collected through the revenue derived from petrol and the road tax, as it is known.  The burden of the complaint was that not all these moneys went to the local authorities. So far as I remember, his calculation was that there was about £2,000,000. There was a sum of money collected in the various ways I have mentioned which exceeded by £2,000,000 the amount provided for the roads by the Central Government, the Road Fund, say, and by the ratepayers.  In that the calculation is about right, but Deputy Corry goes on the assumption that the duties levied on petrol were put towards the roads.  They never were, neither were the customs and excise duties on tyres, etc.  They never went towards the roads.  The only thing that went towards the roads was the produce of what is called the road tax.</P>
    <P>That road tax was increased in the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  The duties on mechanically propelled vehicles were increased in that year. In that year, introducing the Supplementary Budget, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have decided to provide additional subsidies for the purpose of reducing the prices of flour, bread, tea, sugar and fertilisers and to meet the cost by imposing the necessary taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the necessary taxes was to increase the road tax on cars so that the tax on an 8 h.p. car became £12, on a 10 h.p. £15, on a 12 h.p. £20.  The <Col N="1588" /> Minister added that it was proposed to appropriate the additional yield for Exchequer purposes.  Deputy Corry, speaking in the debate on the 15th October, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt that the attempt made by the Government in this Budget for the relief of the ordinary wage earner in this country will be welcomed by all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Twice the Deputy marched into the Division Lobby in order to support the Minister in carrying that particular Budget.  It was quite clear from the statement of the Minister for Finance in those days that the road tax, amongst other taxes, was intended to provide the Minister with money for the payment of the subsidies which were then introduced.  Speaking in particular of the road tax he said&mdash;I am quoting from the debates of the 15th October, 1947, column 395:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and appropriate the additional yield for Exchequer purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry now tries to put the bluff across on his colleagues of the Cork County Council that he is against the appropriation of any part of the road tax to the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>This matter of who stopped the turf schemes and when they were stopped has often been debated in this House. I am not going into it again in detail, but it was a matter which agitated the mind of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health of the last Government as early as the year 1946.  There are many memoranda which proceeded from the Department that year.  Towards the end of 1946, on the 18th October, the Minister for Local Government writes to his Cabinet colleagues in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister would not merely object to any enlargement of the scope of the functions of his Department and of country councils in regard to turf production but also to any intention of continuing beyond the current year his present responsibility for turf production through county councils.  The principle of making local authorities responsible for turf production came into existence only as an emergency measure and it would seem proper that local <Col N="1589" /> authorities should be informed as soon as possible that they have been released from these exceptional responsibilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, as we know, a letter went on the 18th August, 1947, from the Custom House to the secretary of each county council, telling the county councils not to participate in the production of turf after the 31st December.</P>
    <P>When the matter swung over to the Department of Industry and Commerce with a view to seeing how Bord na Móna was to be helped, we come on to the meeting, to which I have already referred of the 12th February, 1948. There were three items on the Agenda dealing with turf.  One was a complaint about the quality of turf supplied to the Department's offices.  The second was the turf development programme for 1948.  I read from the minute and I shall give the decision afterwards.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with the preparation of the Estimate for the Department for 1948-49, a decision was requested as to whether provision should be made for hand-won turf production in 1948.  If the Bord na Móna scheme were not proceeded with, no unemployment would result as the workers would be absorbed in the machine-won scheme or other schemes.  It is not known, however, what the effects of a cessation of hand-won turf production by the county councils would be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Note the date&mdash;12th February, 1948. a rather critical date.  The clouds were gathering round the heads of the the Government.  They seemed to be pretty certain of their doom but they were hoping against hope that the consolidation of Parties which was then taking place would not hold together. The decision was that no provision should be made in the 1948-49 Estimates for a Bord na Móna hand-won turf scheme and that the question of the discontinuance of hand-won turf production by the county councils should be further examined.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Department had already written down to the county councils to say that the scheme was finished but apparently, on the 12th February, in the critical situation <Col N="1590" /> which was then about to develop, it was thought well to say: &ldquo;Well we shall have a look at that then&rdquo;, but, one thing certain was, that there was going to be no provision made in the 1948-1949 Estimates for Bord na Móna hand-won turf.  In face of that, how anybody can say that the last Government had decided to go on with the hand-won turf scheme beats me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken and his colleagues have often given many excuses with regard to the Government Buildings that were proposed for Dublin.  I think it fair to enumerate four of the excuses that were given.  One was to deny that such a scheme existed at all. When the file was produced, and they were no longer in a position to deny it, we were told this scheme would give employment.  We were later told&mdash;I think it was in an inspired utterance of Deputy Lemass&mdash;that there had been in the old Cumann na nGaedheal days a proposal lodged in the Office of Public Works for such a scheme.  I have asked the Office of Public Works for any minute of that decision but so far they have not been able to discover any.  The third excuse was that it would be nice to have such public buildings.  Finally it was said that the scheme was not proceeded with because it was suggested to Leaders of other Parties that they might agree to it and that, on disagreement being registered, it was decided to abandon it. In any event, let us see what actually happened.</P>
    <P>There was such a scheme.  The deliberations started in January, 1936, and I have here a file which dates from that time.  One of the memorandum deals with the scheme in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before any such scheme becomes acceptable to the general public which will have to pay for it, and to put up, over a number of years, with the disturbance which it would necessarily involve, the Government would have to win the support of the Dublin Corporation which would be vitally affected and to gain the approval of the growing body of town planning opinion and of the professional associations interested in such a project.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> Later on it says: &ldquo;It might be even said in criticism of the scheme as a whole...&rdquo;  This I quote for the purpose of countering the argument that this was a plan more or less blue printed and left aside for the purpose of meeting a big unemployment period, unemployment in the building trade:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It might be even said in criticism of the scheme as a whole that one effect of putting it into operation would be to postpone inevitably the solution of the problem of the housing of the working classes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the choice.  There is no doubt that would have been one effect, to postpone inevitably the solution of the problem of the housing of the working classes.  That was weighed in the balance against this scheme for £11,500,000 and, having been weighed in the balance, it was decided to go ahead with, at least, the deliberations for the scheme.</P>
    <P>When I hear complaints in this House about projects for which I have asked to be allowed to borrow £12,000,000, I can only reflect on how insincere these complaints may be rated, coming from a side of the House which supported a Government that proceeded to deliberate on a scheme of that kind.  It is there very definitely to be seen in the memoranda of that time:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before, however, any decision is taken on the points enumerated in the preceding paragraph, there are certain of the financial implications&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>which are referred to here.</P>
    <P>The memorandum goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is obvious that the necessary funds which, as shown in paragraph 6 would, at a minimum, be in the neighbourhood of £3,000,000, would have to be found by borrowing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, was a very meagre scheme, but, at a later part, it became a scheme of £11,500,000.  It was then £3,000,000.  What is said here with regard to the £3,000,000 scheme applies with more effect to the £11,500,000 scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" />&ldquo;It is obvious that the necessary funds which, as shown in paragraph 6, would at a minimum be in the neighbourhood of £3,000,000 would have to be found by borrowing. A loan floated specifically for the purpose of the scheme which, in effect, is merely the provision of palatial buildings for housing Civil Service staffs would scarcely be attractive from the point of view of investors in so far as the asset created would be regarded as entirely unproductive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the sober comment, that the asset was regarded as unproductive. Yet, that was considered a good project for the flotation of a loan, even though the asset was to be so unproductive. Some years later, in 1944, the figures as to cost were given, but with this warning that the figures of the cost to the State must be purely conjectural. The following figures may be taken as an indication of the size of the project: acquisition and compensation for disturbance, £2,500,000; demolition of sites acquired, £500,000; building works, £7,500,000; furnishing and equipment, £1,000,000.  These figures give a tot of £11,500,000.  Just after that was proposed, there is a record of a conference with the Taoiseach and the then Tánaiste in Government Buildings.  A difficulty which emerged at that time, one of the matters that was under consideration, was that there were so many buildings that would have to be exempt or excluded, and the board were to reconsider the whole problem.  Here are some of the buildings that were going to be demolished or, if not, they would either have to be exempted or excluded from the scheme: Holles Street Hospital, St. Stephen's Church, the convent chapel at Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Street corner.  There was also the fact that it was recognised that Merrion Square itself had been spoken of as the site of a new cathedral, and the people considering that were not sure whether the ecclesiastical authorities might not still have the cathedral project in mind.</P>
    <P>That is the scheme which was to cost £11,500,000 and which it was recognised was not going to be of a very attractive <Col N="1593" /> nature for the public.  It certainly could be criticised on the grounds that it was going to result in an entirely unproductive asset.  Yet it was contemplated, a scheme leading in the end to the extravagant sum of £11,500,000.</P>
    <P>At the end, of course, it came to a different point.  The difficulties about building in Merrion Square had by that time been discovered to be serious.  At that point the architects in the Board of Works were switched over to the Phoenix Park and to the possibility of siting these Government Buildings in the Phoenix Park.  That was brought under consideration in 1945.  In the end, the Board of Works got one of its architects to prepare a layout which is rather humbly stated &ldquo;to have some merit.&rdquo;  That is all set out here, the building of an enormous new House of Parliament and a whole block of Government offices in the Park.  The question then arose as to whether it was proper to deprive the people who enjoyed certain amenities in the Park of those amenities.  The further extravagant idea was then mooted that the great thing to do in return for the taking away of certain of those amenities in the Park, as described in the layout for the proposed buildings, was to provide extra acreage elsewhere. That led to a grand scheme going up the river from Kingsbridge to Chapelizod, the taking of land on either side of the river, stripping it of buildings and putting into it some sort of playing fields and then handing it over to the public in return for the amenities of which they had been deprived in the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>Will people remember that the Government which considered that, and which was prepared to go on with it, are now, as members of the Opposition, severely critical of the plans to embark money on houses for the people, on electrical development and all other sources of investment which Deputy Lemass said the people desired to have, but still they are critical of that being done by borrowing?  They intended to borrow £11,500,000, and the figure was only conjectural, for the provision of these particular amenities.</P>
    <P>The second big matter under discussion <Col N="1594" /> in the House was the question of the Order freezing prices.  That has been criticised on a variety of grounds.  It was said to be a panic Order.  It was said, first of all, that it was not meant seriously, and was not to be taken seriously.  Secondly, it was said that it was a drastic Order, that it was a setback for every trader and industrialist in the country, that they could not find it possible to make forward purchases, that they were entirely hamstrung in the way of making extra provision against an emergency ahead, and that the whole thing was iniquitous.  It was particularly iniquitous for that reason.  The burden of the waspish attack that was made on the Supplies and Services Bill was to the effect that it was completely unconscionable to ask traders to produce records of their business and allow anybody to look at statements which would show if they were making profits or what profits they were making.</P>

      <P>I have a few of the Deputy's records here, in any event. The prices Order was then removed, or thawed, in regard to certain things. The <i>Irish Press</i>, no doubt guided by the Deputy, wandered into the statement that meant that merchants had now complete liberty to charge whatever prices they considered proper.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that at least that would be an easy way out, for the Deputy to say that.  The Deputy, in am ambiguous phrase he used when speaking about the speech the Tánaiste made, referred to what he called his &ldquo;rushin' &rdquo; tactics.  He explained afterwards that the word he used was &ldquo;rushing&rdquo; and had no reference to Moscow.  I take that to be the case.  Nevertheless, the line he has suggested all the time is that there is a completely anti-social point of view displayed by the Tánaiste and those who support him in connection with this price freeze, that we are trying to get people into the frame of mind of being against private industry.  So he said at the Federation of Irish Manufacturers' Dinner:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There was a persistent and apparently organised campaign against private-owned industry, which was being represented as necessarily anti-social, whose owners <Col N="1596" /> displayed inordinate selfishness and disregard for the public weal and were responsible for all price inflations and for the social injustice, the discontent and disorder which followed from that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is his line.  A price freeze would not be too bad, but, in the framework of, say, the Tánaiste's speech, it was something approaching what Moscow would do.  That is the insinuation that is all the time around it when the Deputy is speaking on this matter. We used to be told, and it was one of the complaints the Deputy voiced in the past couple of days, that there was good price-fixing machinery when he left the Department of Industry and Commerce and that, in fact, all that is happening is that his successor in the Ministry is avoiding his responsibilities, that if he had worked that machinery everything could be done.  I think that was the Deputy's complaint.  Does he agree?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  He decontrolled 28 of the materials, the prices of which he is now trying to freeze.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was possible to decontrol with the Deputy's old machinery.  The Deputy, in 1945, had other views.  He then got his Government to get the length of a white print of a piece of legislation called the Emergency Powers (Unlawful Profits) Bill, 1945, and the memorandum which accompanied that piece of legislation contains a few comments which the House might be glad to hear.  I am sorry that Deputy Childers is not here for the opening bar of it.  Deputy Childers has committed himself to the view that prices have nothing to do with profits, and I think that even Deputy Lemass has given himself over to that idea from time to time.  At this time, he was against that thought.  The memorandum says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the aim of the methods of price control adopted by the Minister for Supplies to restrict profits within reasonable limits and thereby to keep down the level of prices....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that, in 1945, there was some relationship between profits and prices.  It goes on then to speak of the price <Col N="1597" /> Orders he had made and the way they worked&mdash;generally informally, by getting the decent business men and industrialists of the country to give an undertaking and relying on that, but it does say that there are certain defaulters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The importance of the issue cannot, however, be judged relative to the number of defaulters, since such default, if tolerated, would likely be claimed as unfair to other traders and would almost certainly lead to a general failure of the system of control adopted.</P>
    <P>Later, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt as to the traders who are deliberately evading control, but it is in this sense that any legislation must give the Minister for Supplies the fullest discretion in deciding what defaulting traders or firms deserve to have penalties imposed, and what traders or firms have erred unintentionally and are to be required merely to rectify the position when subsequently framing their prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of all the undesirable pieces of legislation that ever may have been introduced, this surely ranked as the worst.  Power was claimed and power was going to be given for the Minister for Supplies to have complete discretion in deciding what traders he would mulet.  One could see the subscription list to the funds swelling with a little bit of manipulation of that power.  But that is what was proposed&mdash;complete discretion. The Minister was to choose the defaulting traders who deserved to have penalties imposed.  The scheme was that the Minister for Supplies would by an Order say to the firms whom he chose: &ldquo;You have made unreasonable profits&rdquo;, and would state what the amount of the unreasonable profits were and would demand these profits from these firms.  But they would have leave to appeal from him to an appeal tribunal, which was to consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  &ldquo;Of the three members of the tribunal, one at least should be a practising barrister of not less than ten years' standing and one at least <Col N="1598" /> shall be a person having knowledge and experience of accountancy&rdquo;&mdash; these are not civil servants; they are taken from outside&mdash;&ldquo;and they shall be appointed for such period not exceeding one year as the Government may think proper&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Think of what the Deputy has said in answer to a question of mine&mdash;he objects to traders books being investigated by anybody except established civil servants who have a vow of secrecy on account of their office or people who will be put under a vow of secrecy.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The appeal tribunal,&rdquo; this memorandum says, &ldquo;would have full powers of investigation, including powers to obtain all relevant documents, accounts and information and would, on completing its investigation, give a decision confirming, altering or modifying the determination of the Minister, or imposing additional penalties, subject to a maximum of twice the amount of excessive profit earned, as decided by the appeal tribunal.&rdquo;  The memo states that &ldquo;since it would be the policy of the Minister to confine the exercise of this power to cases in which discussion and negotiation have proved a failure, in which the conditions of gross profiteering is obvious and in which the sums involved are substantial, it follows that the amounts to be collected by way of penalty would be substantial and it will therefore be necessary to provide wide and drastic powers for collection of such sums.&rdquo; One of these powers was the power to put in a receiver and the memo says with regard to that receiver:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is intended to make provision in the Bill with regard to the powers of the receiver to carry on the business as a going concern and to indemnify that receiver against any act done under the provisions of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you had a pretty scheme.  The Minister was to tell chosen traders: &ldquo;You have defaulted in your arrangements with me and have made unreasonable profits.  I will tell you what the amount of those unreasonable profits is.  I make an Order, and, if it is not appealed against, it becomes a civil bill collectable in the <Col N="1599" /> ordinary way.&rdquo;  If there was an appeal, the appeal could go to three people not civil servants, who were to be appointed very definitely on a temporary basis and yet that body was to have power to examine books and records and the Minister wanted drastic powers. one of which drastic powers is dealt with later.  According to the memorandum:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not intended that there should be any appeal to the ordinary courts against the decision of the Minister or the appeal tribunal as the case might be.  The Minister feels that recourse to court proceedings and the delays which are unavoidable in such proceedings would greatly nullify the deterrent effect of the exceptional measures which it is proposed to take.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After that, does the Deputy want to complain?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We got instead an Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill, 1947.  It was a bit of a change from this undoubtedly, but a great many of the features are exactly the same.  One of the points in this measure was that the Minister had power to make Orders with regard to control of prices, profits and trading methods. The Bill never advanced beyond Second Reading, but it set out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall not make any Order under this Part in relation to a commodity or service unless</P>
      <P>(a) the commission have recommended it or</P>
      <P>(b) the Minister is of opinion that.</P>
      <P>(i) unduly high prices are being or are likely to be charged for the commodity or service, or</P>
      <P>(ii) owing to the scarcity of supplies, there is a possibility that unduly high prices will be charged for the commodity or service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> In these circumstances, if there was a possibility that because of the scarcity of supplies, unduly high prices might be charged, the Minister could make an Order freezing prices.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably because he thought that it was better to get after the traders on the question of high prices.  In the miscellaneous portions of this Bill we read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of obtaining the information necessary for the exercise of any functions under this Act, the commission may, from time to time, publish in such manner as they think fit a notice requiring persons who carry on the business of producing or selling a specified commodity or of providing a specified service to furnish them at such times as may be specified in the notice such accounts and returns relating to the business as may be specified in the notice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, &ldquo;the purpose of obtaining the information necessary for the exercise of any functions under this Act&rdquo; was the fixing of prices or profits.  They could get accounts there. This was not supposed to be a permanent tribunal.  Then we read also:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Why all the trouble about the freeze Order and this undesirable process of making manufacturers produce to a tribunal documents relating to their business when, in fact, the Deputy, as Minister, had intended it in 1944?  He brought his views before the House in 1947.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You object to it for the sake of an objection.  I should like to put this freeze Order back into the framework in which it was put by the Tánaiste on the night on which he spoke on this matter in the Dáil in connection with the Supplies and Services Act.  The debate is reported in Volume 123, Nos. 8 and 11.  I need not quote at length from the speech made by the Tánaiste on that occasion.  I have quite a number of points marked here to which I could refer.  A brief summary of what he said is that it was proposed, because of the possibility at any time of a scarcity and an unduly high price being charged for certain articles, to take precautions by establishing an advisory body which would be armed with certain powers and, if necessary, power to call for the production of traders' books.  A trader need not produce them but if he did not he would suffer the same consequences as a trader who would refuse to produce his books for examination by the Revenue Commissioners.  There was nothing in the proposal to make traders produce their books for inspection at a public sitting.  If anybody thinks that that has been done I ask them for an example&mdash;and when the first example comes we can take cognisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste went on to say that he proposed that this tribunal would have power to look at the grouped profits of industries, that is, not revealing the individual profits.  I think that recently a group of jam manufacturers went before that particular tribunal.  It was thought <Col N="1602" /> proper, and it is a suggestion that I stand over, not that the profits of X, Y or Z should be produced publicly but that the public should know that that industrial group were making profits and that some comparisons should be given.  I do not think it is necessary here to go into the question of grouped profits.  I get grouped profits given to me for the purpose of investigation.  Each Minister for Finance gets these grouped profits for the purpose of preparing his Budget&mdash; in order to enable him to see how revenue is bearing up, and so forth.</P>
    <P>For years back, the Minister for Finance has got that information.  He never gets individual profits because that would be entirely wrong but he gets the group profits.  Take a particular group of manufacturers who go before the Prices Tribunal to have discussed in public whether the price proposed to be charged is reasonable. Would it be proper to have, say, a comparison made between the group profits of a particular group of industrial traders in 1939, when standard profits were taken, and, say those of the year merely preceding investigation? I have here particulars of one group whose standard profits were taken for excess corporation profits duty during the war years.  The group profits, which were in the neighbourhood of £600,000 in the peace years prior to 1939, had risen to £2,018,000 in 1949.  Would that be a relevant consideration, without mentioning an individual firm?  I think it would. There are many other such comparisons which could be given.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to get the matter of profit-making and profit-taking into a proper framework.  I have already read a point in the memorandum from the Department which was under the charge of Deputy Lemass when he was Minister that he then considered profits had something to do with prices.  When profits have risen from something in the neighbourhood of £600,000 to over £2,000,000 after the war is over, it is at least something to be taken into consideration.  As far as I know, individual traders will not be asked to or coerced into giving any indication of their trading profits or <Col N="1603" /> their secrets in public.  I should hope that it will become the practice that, as that tribunal meets, the proper setting will be there&mdash;that when the individual comes along, though he may be a poor member of the trading group or the exploiter of the trading group, he will be allowed to take his place amongst. his colleagues.  When they come to the tribunal and ask for an increase in prices, the public, through the tribunal, will have the information.  Here is the setting.  They used to make £600,000 and now they are making £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>On the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill, Deputy Lemass said that one of the reasons why price control was relatively ineffective was because there was not public confidence and one of the reasons for that was that the public had no information, but that if the public could be induced to take an interest in it and have some idea as to whether a price should be raised or not, things would be different.  They would then be informed, and if they had to submit to an increase because of increased labour or raw materials charges, they would know where they were and they would be better able to bear the cost because they would know that the prices had been discussed publicly and declared, after examination by an independent body of people, to be justified.  That is our aim.  There is no panic in what we are doing.  The only panic is amongst our opponents. They do not want this system of fixing prices.  I believe they would prefer prices to go up, because it would damage us as a Government.  They would not look to the good of the community for having prices kept to the lowest possible point.  Therefore, they objected to the idea.  Then, when the prices Order was brought in, of course there were fulminations throughout their kept Press regarding the way business was to be impeded by this.  You were presented with this as the system of the business community: that a business man in this country bought for sale almost the next day, and certainly the next week, and that if he could not see his prices rising the week after, he could not buy although the finished <Col N="1604" /> goods would not come into use until somewhere around next autumn.  That was the impression we had from the <i>Irish Press</i> and from the other side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The Deputy says that it is the cost of replacing the materials, although he thought at one time that there was a possibility of providing against that by getting inspectors to go in and get the books and investigate them for him.  I do not agree that the cost of the replacement of goods, if those goods are to come into use six or even 18 months hence, should be the price charged next day across the counter.</P>
      <P>I have heard my colleague the Minister for Agriculture speaking of what he thought and of what I think was the unreasonable drive for very unreasonable increases in wages made by certain parts of the community in the autumn of last year and the winter. The reason why a lot of those people moved in that way is, I know, what they hear from their colleagues who are assistants in shops.  I am told over and over again that shop assistants have reported that articles which are in the window on display with a price ticket on them are taken out of the window, put into the back of the shop, kept for one week and then put back into the window with the price doubled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The man with a load of mischief is one thing but the man who tried to prevent the mischief of the Deputy would have a still heavier burden.</P>
      <P>I think this is a decent endeavour in the interests of the community to prevent the only thing that can be prevented, namely the abuse which may normally be expected in a time of scarce commodities and rising raw material prices.  In such a time there is not merely a possibility but a probability that unduly high prices will be charged and we will do our best to prevent that abuse.  We are doing it with the system which we have got with some modifications and there may be more modifications.  I believe that with that we will get a good tribunal with good machinery geared to its proper purposes.  I would ask its help to see that the consumer is protected while at the same time, as the Tánaiste said in his speech, industrialists are allowed a proper profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say one thing about industrialists. One speaks regarding the people who were not behaving properly in the industrial line and in the trading line and, of course, an opportunity is immediately offered there to papers like the <i>Irish Press</i> to parade that in a placarded and distorted way.  You are attacking Irish industry because you mention what is known: that there are rogues in Irish industry, as there are rogues nearly everywhere. A lead has been given to the rogues by the Opposition.  I do not know how many meetings there have been of semi-political bodies masquerading as industrialists and business people, but several times we have heard about the prices freeze Order <Col N="1607" /> being exceeded all over the country by business men.  Deputy Childers added whatever little bit of fuel his faint voice could add by telling the country that he knew that the Order was being disobeyed up and down the country, that people were making their profits and were continuing to make them. That is said all over the place.</P>
    <P>I have spoken in the same tone since 1948 with regard to that.  The last tax in the world I regard as a good tax is the excess corporation profits tax.  Its reimposition at the present time would cause great difficulty.  In any event, it would run counter to the other policy and the other policy I believe to be the correct one, that is, letting people make reasonable profits and using whatever is in excess of reasonable profit to reduce their costs and give a lower price to the community.  I would far rather get the benefit of excess profits spread in that way to the community rather than get a wad of money by slicing off any profits above a certain level.</P>
    <P>This boasting, this arrogance in the face of a Government Order that people are disobeying, would certainly drive one to punitive measures against the people who are behaving in that way.  For three years this Government have resisted the temptation to reimpose that particular Order and have hoped instead that the people who are making these profits would see reason and reduce their profits.</P>
    <P>On the last opportunity I had of meeting industrialists as a group before Christmas, I met one group of traders with a very definite appeal, phrased in such a way that I do not think it could be regarded as anything but sincere.  I made it in the most pointed way, addressed to those people, that they would content themselves in time of scarcity with a less profit than what they considered the normal profit they would be entitled to make in ordinary periods.  There was a good response from part of the group I met.  I have the feeling that some people for political purposes have tried to stampede the group.  As Deputy Lemass has said, there is the bad example of some <Col N="1608" /> people getting away with it, when others say because of that: &ldquo;It is unfair; we are abiding by the regulations and other people are running away from them.&rdquo;  That sort of thing may have to be met by the reimposition of taxes of that type.  It will be the last thing I will approach.  Certainly I would approach it with the greatest possible distaste, as I would much prefer to get industrialists to realise how greatly they are in debt to this country and to give some token of that in their attitude in a period of scarcity and of crisis.  I say that of industrialists here in this country, because I do not know of any country in which industrialists are better guaranteed their profits than they are here.</P>
    <P>We have a wide range of tariffs.  The height of the tariff barrier is extraordinary. There are quota arrangements to prevent even anything that might flow in over this extremely high tariff barrier.  There is aid given to people in business and particularly in manufacturing industry by way of credits, Governments credits, Government aid in every possible way.  In the end what it comes to is that this Government and the last, both Governments, have thrown the consuming community at the mercy of the industrial groups who are getting such heavy protection; because when there is no competition, because of the extremely high tariff barrier, then they could charge more or less what they liked and, in particular, in certain cases they could make it easier by making rings within the country, and a lot of them were doing it.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said with regard to the rights of capital in other countries, whatever may have been said in this country many years ago about the rights of capitalists and their rights to secrecy in connection with profits made and what the capitalist does with profits, that has very little application to this country in these years.  Most of those industries are not trading on their own capital: they are trading on possibly a small amount of capital that they put into the business themselves, but largely increased by their having the consumer put at their mercy.  To a very <Col N="1609" /> big extent it is the ordinary people here who buy the goods in the shops, who are definitely responsible for the big accumulations of capital that large industrialists have got.  In those circumstances, I am less inclined to be troubled about the delicacy of some of those people in producing before tribunals, particularly in private, their books of account.  I think they ought to show their books in private to the people who are set up there to examine them, because if they are honest people and have profits they can stand over, the best way of evidencing that is by showing their trading accounts and showing how they got their profits.</P>
    <P>The other side of this matter of prices is the labour charges.  I know that in many departments where the Fianna Fáil organisation has its roots, there are many complaints about the increases that have been allowed to workers over the last three or four years.  It was not what Deputy Lemass had in mind for them&mdash;the freedom that we have given.  Deputy Lemass, before he left office, had brought into memorandum form and Draft Bill form, a piece of legislation that was to be called the &ldquo;Industrial Emergency Bill&rdquo; of 1947.  I understand that when this was spoken of recently by my colleague there was incredulity expressed from certain Deputies that such a piece of legislation could be there.  The draft legislation was there. It was to freeze wages as they were on the 15th October, 1947, with certain additions.  The scheme was to make it illegal for an employer to pay more, and the only additions that were to be admitted were whatever increase would be warranted by the relationship of the new cost-of-living index figure to what it had been previously, a rise measured by that.  That is the index figure that is now so much derided by Deputy Lemass.  It was to be the measuring stick of this.</P>

The main part <Col N="1610" /> of the proposal&mdash;it was supposed to be an ingenious scheme and there is a minute from the Minister himself indicating the unusual features of the scheme&mdash;was that the burden was to be put on the employer, the employer was to be guilty of an offence if he gave any wage increase.  He could give a wage increase measured by the cost of living figure, or if there were an agreement between the employer and employee; but only if such agreement had not been come to under the threat of a strike or a cessation of work.  If there were a strike or cessation of work to make the employer give that increase beyond the measure allowed, then the protection of the Trade Disputes Act was going to be withdrawn from any employee who went out on strike.</P>

      <P>There are the proposals under two heads, by those who complain and object to the wage freeze and are full of anxiety about the consumer and are against the consumer being mulcted in increases.  They were very much in favour when in Opposition of allowing the industrial workers as a section of the community to get benefits, but they did not give them any benefits while they were in office. Perhaps some members of the Trade Union Congress or the Congress of Irish Unions who met the Minister may have had read to them the full purport of that Bill.  I wonder how many <Col N="1613" /> workers down the country knew about it.  How many people in Deputy Lemass's city constituency knew that he was proposing to get back to pre-Napoleonic times and to withdraw the Trade Disputes Act protection if there was a strike to enforce an increase in wages over what was being paid on the 15th October, 1947, with the addition of the cost of living index increase?</P>
      <P>I said before that the people who are facing me have got to the end of their tether.  I think that is not a bad description of them.  They talk of this bill of mine.  Before Deputy Lemass came in&mdash;I am sure his memory will not need any reminding of the matter&mdash;I read that he had said there is nothing in the Book of Estimates he would quarrel with except the borrowing and, so far as the borrowing programme is concerned, the objects of the investment are quite good, but what he objects to is having these put on the long finger, having an investment policy.  I take it that the Deputy does not disagree with that as a summary of his speech.  If he cannot find anything to reduce in the Book of Estimates and if he is in favour of the capital programme, he will have to get the money we are looking for one way or another.  If he will not borrow, he must tax.  I understand that that is the position.  He will take this Book of Estimates and, instead of deducting the £12,000,000 and the amount for loan service, he would put them on the taxpayer to-day.  I understand that is the Deputy's policy.  That is the policy, I understand, of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe added up this bill of mine and he was followed by Deputy MacEntee and, instead of £83,000,000, they got £100,000,000, whatever way they got it.  In any event, if it is £100,000,000, it will be £100,000,000 to be made up by taxation, according to Deputy Lemass's plan.  He is certainly out for a much more expensive type of social services than we are.  The mother and child service, in Deputy Lemass's mind, is only deficient in not being in operation already and not being expensive enough.  The social security plan of the Tánaiste is only deficient in the fact that it is asking people to pay contributions when the taxpayer <Col N="1614" /> ought to be asked to pay.  How many millions will that add to the £100,000,000?  Can the Deputy chance a figure?  That is the Fianna Fáil programme for the new election and I suppose we will return to the Emergency Industrial Bill of 1947 and, because increases in wages are undoubtedly inflationary, we will probably try to get the workers pegged back, as they were during the war years and as the Deputy intended to have them at the end of the war years, to the nearest date he could find.</P>
    <P>I noticed in this debate that, as each Deputy stood up and made his complaint, at some point or another an interjection stabbed into him: &ldquo;What will you reduce&rdquo;?  I waited for any reply but nobody gave it.  This money has to be found.  Deputy Lemass objects to find it by borrowing.  He says it is inflationary.  He says that last week I deluded the people by saying that I got it all out of taxation. I said nothing of the sort.  I indicated five sources of financing: small savings through the savings banks, a national loan, balances on various funds awaiting investment, the American Loan Counterpart Fund, sales of sterling investments of Government funds.  I said with regard to the last two that I brought these under criticism as being &ldquo;unrelated to current savings&rdquo;. I distinctly said in regard to these that any resort to them would undoubtedly be of an inflationary type and, therefore, caution in resorting to them had to be exercised.  I was gibed at for saying that, particularly by the Deputy who now is insisting that I tried to delude the public.  I tapped these various sources and I admit that I said in my opening statement that, in so far as I did not get finances to the point that they were related to current savings, to that extent some regard had to be had to inflation.  I pointed out, however, that we had a very good foundation on which to rest, that production was increasing, both on the industrial and agricultural side.  I pointed to the yield of the crops that were in the country; I was not bothering about the acreage.  I talked about the numbers of live stock there were in the country and the increase there <Col N="1615" /> had been.  I pointed out that we were coming somewhat nearer the end of those schemes that cost so much money.  I pointed to the fact that there would be more houses built in 1950 than ever before; and 12,000 houses, 1,000 houses per month, is not a bad record.  We did that as a result of this expenditure, or some part of it. The people who have gone into industrial occupations in the last three years, the three years in which we have had control, amount to 1,000 persons a month over every month of the three years, or 36,000 persons.  I pointed to the mechanisation there was on farms, particularly in the Leinster area; the abundant use there had been of fertilisers within the last two or three years, and to the fact that the fertility of the land had been restored.  I put all these as indicating that there is a good background to this programme of ours.</P>
    <P>I have quotations of what was said, such as: &ldquo;This madcap policy of finance&rdquo;; &ldquo;finances in peril&rdquo;; &ldquo;entering a wild period of inflation&rdquo;. These are the phrases of Deputy Lemass.  He went on a tour ranging from some parts of the south to Cavan about April or May last year raging and tearing about demoralisation, depression, forced emigration and so on that would be caused by this &ldquo;madcap&rdquo; scheme.  He is bleating the same old tale now.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat warnings I have made, warnings for the future.  I intended to say, but a colleague said it for me, at a bankers' dinner on the 18th November last year&mdash;I am going to ask the House to listen while I gallop through two pages:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am afraid that the world in which we live does not offer monetary stability.  The value of money has fallen steeply since 1914.  Rearmament is likely to carry this depreciation further.  We are forced to surrender, however reluctantly, the objective of stability and to choose instead the imperfect ideal of restricting the depreciation of the currency as much as possible.  But this I must stress&mdash;the value of money must be tenaciously defended if we <Col N="1616" /> are to preserve the incentive to work and save and ensure orderly economic development.  The recent upsurge in import prices is mainly the result of a scramble for essential raw materials.  We need these materials like other countries, but the goods we have to offer in exchange are not in such strong demand.  Our earnings will not, therefore, go as far as before.  The idea that more money all round will make everyone better off is, in the circumstances, completely illusionary.  We will only open the door to inflation by seeking to compensate ourselves for a rise in the cost of living.  Particular classes can, of course, maintain, or even better, their position by securing more money for themselves, but only at the expense of weaker members of the community.  The situation called first for an increase in home production and exports to counteract the adverse turn in the terms of trade and, secondly, for acceptance by both employers and employees equally of some disimprovement in the standard of living if prices internationally continue to rise.  The policy of the Government is to maintain fair shares in the distribution of the temporarily constricted national income and, as part of this policy, they are determined to prevent excessive price increases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What was Deputy Lemass's perversion in regard to the phrase, &ldquo;Particular classes can, of course, maintain, or even better their position, by securing more money for themselves&rdquo;&mdash; that that was clearly the trade unions I was driving at.  In any event, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Look at what is promised you&mdash; some disimprovement in your standard of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was supposed to be a sober comment.</P>
    <P>I have said with regard to the last Government that they were at the end of their period, at the end of their tether.  In the year 1947, the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, spoke here on his Estimate in July, He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Agriculture is the main industry <Col N="1617" /> in this country.  If anybody can give us a solution to the difficulties of agriculture we will be very glad to consider it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He spoke about the agricultural conditions here and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They can only put between 200,000 and 400,000 families on the land.  They will have a rural population of between 200,000 and double that figure.</P>
    <P>The flight from the land was happening in every country where people were being attracted to the larger communities in the cities.  They had reached a point where they had only 500,000 to 1,000,000 acres of land available for distribution and that land was practically required for two purposes&mdash;for bringing up the adjacent farms to an economic level and for dealing with the problem of congestion.  Although they had done their best to increase the population on the land they could not increase it beyond a certain point.  When they had done the best they could, there would still be a drift from the land to the cities or to emigration.  There was no other way for it.  Their policy had been to give the farmer stability and to put as many on the land as it would economically hold, as rapidly as they could, and to give land workers an assured market for their produce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In agriculture, there had been a constant downward trend, there being a drop of approximately 43,000 people in the last 15 years. Is there any way we can stop it?  If anybody can give us a solution we will be very happy to consider it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the man who came in on a full flow of promises in 1932.  He is here, pathetically looking at the Dáil. He told us previously in other speeches that this policy of subsidies was a rather vicious policy and only adopted as an emergency.  Am I right in saying that the people who spoke that way were certainly not holding out any prospects to the people?  They were at the end of their policy.</P>

Civil servants and other public servants, guards, teachers and the Army got increases which amounted to over £1,500,000&mdash;£4,000,000 between all these things.  We gave an increased ration of tea which cost £500,000 in a full year.  Last year, I brought in a Bill which increased the rates given to certain pensioners.  They are additions to the extent of £4,500,000, which, with the other additions and modifications of the beer, tobacco and income-tax, cost £7,250,000.  If I had not been persuaded by my colleagues to give the extra tea ration, the new aids to the old age pensioners and to the Guards, teachers and Army, we could have saved that £4,500,000.  I am told that the revenue <Col N="1619" /> is going up, and so it is.  Supposing the situation arrived in which I am able to reduce income-tax to the figure it stood at when Cumann na nGaedheal left office in 1932, 3/-, or 3/6 less than the present figure, and that there was then so much in the way of income being earned that the 3/- tax would give me the same revenue as 6/6 does now, would the Deputy accuse me of raising taxation?</P>

Apparently Deputy Aiken would just bash his way through like a bull in a china shop and take not merely £100,000,000 but an additional £1,200,000,000 or £1,300,000,000 to finance his various projects; and he would collect all that in the way of taxation and would not borrow a penny of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We put forward a proper programme.  We drew up that programme and we decided that we would subject it to a year's trial and criticism.  At the end of that year we find Deputy Lemass saying that there is nothing wrong with our investment programme except that, strangely enough, we are borrowing for that programme. That appears to me to be quite the maddest type of finance; one should not borrow for investment purposes. It has been said that we have got no direct return.  I never said we would if one thinks in terms of pounds, shillings and pence collected in one's hand.  Last year we tried to get the people to understand what our purpose was.  We said that we were about to indulge in a particular capital expenditure programme and we hoped we would get our return in the following manner: productivity would inevitably rise by so much as would bear over a generation the increased cost required to remunerate the moneys borrowed.  If we get that, the borrowing will be easy.  If we do not get it, the borrowing will be a bit of a headache; and, if the country's productivity fails completely, then the borrowing may be, what it is now described as being, a millstone around the people's necks.</P>

      <P>The Deputy in his own hard-headed way puffed along here for about an hour and a half. Silence becomes him better.  Productivity is increasing and it is bearing the cost of these projects.  Productivity is rising.  The bill that has to be faced is considerable.  Deputies can compare for themselves what appears on the face of the Estimate this year with last year's.  They can look at the revenue, if they want to have a peep at that side of the picture.  The Central Fund Services will be up about £1,000,000 this year.  Deputies will have to bear in mind&mdash;it will certainly be impressed on them by me at the beginning of May &mdash; that the new £1,250,000 for old age pensions and the modification of the means test will have to be found by taxation unless there can be retrenchment under some other heading.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding that fact, I am still in favour of the programme, weighing one item against the other and taking all the risks into account.  Our situation to-day is not unlike that which existed in America when President Hoover left office and President Roosevelt came in.  President Hoover had been telling everybody that he was governing the country according to the dictates of strict finance; the country had great recuperative powers and one day the country would recover; prosperity was always around the corner; no matter what street President Hoover went down there was still a corner around which he hoped prosperity would be found.  The people were hobbling along.  Men were queueing up in bread lines.  Suicide reached a truly remarkable figure.  President Roosevelt came in and he inaugurated what he called his &ldquo;New Deal.&rdquo;  I do not suppose there was a banker in the whole of the United States of America who did not howl his head off and hurl at that new deal the same kind of criticism that I have been listening to over the last couple of days.</P>

      <P>President Roosevelt proceeded with his plan.  He met the bankers in conference.  He told them quite frankly that he was taking risks. He proposed to take those risks.  He might disrupt their economy, but he would take that gamble.  He was asked what the prospects were and he said that if he could occupy human labour and material resources, those two things welded together might give him the productivity which would carry the cost of the various schemes he proposed to introduce.  Events have proved how right he was, because we are at the point to-day where American production not merely won the greatest war in history, but is now facing a condition which, according to a newspaper correspondent, will make America three years hence so strong in production in every way that she will equal every nation in the world, friendly, unfriendly and neutral.  That was done through the programmes inaugurated by a man who was condemned, as our policy is being condemned.  President Roosevelt said on one occasion that he was very proud that he was providing schemes even in this untried way; and, in any event, he hoped to rescue human beings, who happened to be American citizens, from economic ruin and moral ruin, because that is what they were sinking into under the bankers' régime and under Hoover.</P>

Savings, which will be found on other sub-heads, amount to £4,000.  I can only explain the increase by putting it in these words.  There has been an increase in the amount of travelling to attend meetings of the Dáil and Seanad.  More members of both Houses are using private motor cars in preference to public transport and both Senators and Deputies have been in the habit of travelling, even while the Dáil or Seanad is in session, as against coming up, if they have to come up for the week, and remaining in Dublin for that week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> There are quite a number of increases set out under the different headings here.  The printing increase is due to the increased cost of printing.  A certain amount of the expenditure was unforeseen, because costs did not show any sign of rising when the original estimates were prepared.  Under the heading of paper, that increase again is due to the fact that increases in the prices of paper have occurred.  These were unforeseen and they are quite heavy.  The same applies with regard to binding.  There are certain departmental requirements which now cost more than we thought they would. The other matters are small, excepting the item miscellaneous office supplies. That increase is partly due to stockpiling; in fact, to a considerable extent.  The greater part will be for extra stock reserves which will mainly be in regard to typewriting machines.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister state if there is any special significance attaching to the increased provision required under sub-head G?  The note attached says that the additional provision is necessary to meet unforeseen expenditure on printing.  Does that mean that some substantial printing order was given which was not anticipated at the beginning of the year, or that the amount of printing done was higher than anticipated?  I note that sub-head K.1 provides for the cost of printing and distribution of the brochure entitled &ldquo;Ireland is Building,&rdquo; but no appropriation in aid is shown in respect of receipts from the sale of that publication.  Were there any sales or any receipts?</P>

      <P>I am afraid there are not.  Of course, there would be none coming in before the end of the financial year.  Probably hereafter there will be an appropriation.  So far as the other matter is concerned, the expenditure was unforeseen.  I do not think it means there was more printing done, but rather that the expenses of printing have gone up.  It is almost entirely due to increases in prices.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This is a token Estimate for £10 because the bulk of it is met by savings on other sub-heads.  At this stage perhaps the most helpful procedure will be to go shortly through the several sub-heads.</P>
      <P>The first sub-head, sub-head B, in respect of which a supplementary sum of £4,000 is required, arises in connection with travelling expenses.  These are difficult to forecast with precision and they depend in each year very largely on the degree of activity proceeding in the Department.  In the financial year under review I am glad to say that the activity exceeded our most optimistic anticipations and it is necessary to provide that additional sum of £4,000 to meet the travelling expenses which will come in course of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head E (2), which is in connection <Col N="1628" /> with veterinary research, makes provision for £48,350.  That includes the sum of £37,000 which is the purchase price of Abbotstown, the property recently acquired in the vicinity of Clonsilla for adaptation as a veterinary research station.  As soon as we have the necessary adaptations carried out it is proposed to transfer the work hitherto done at Thorndale, Drumcondra, to the new premises.  One of the difficulties at Thorndale is that it is now completely encroached upon by the City of Dublin, and at no time had it more than 25 or 26 acres of land which was obviously a very inconvenient arrangement for a veterinary research station.  Abbotstown is a relatively large property and extends to some hundreds of acres.  It is proposed in the initial stages to divide the premises, and to appropriate the main residences and part of the outoffices for the purpose of a veterinary research laboratory, together with 100 acres of the land, using the remaining 300 odd acres for the purpose of the new division of my Department which has been constituted for the purpose of propagating cereal seeds, root seeds and grass land experimentation.  It is intended, in the event of the veterinary research station requiring, as its work progresses, more land, to transfer blocks of land to it from the propagation division of the Department, as and when the necessity shall arise.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in this sub-head for the purchase of a year's emergency supplies.  It was thought in the circumstances well to have at the research station approximately a year's reserves of stocks in view of the disturbed state of the world.</P>
    <P>We are also providing under this sub-head for the purchase of heifers.  That is really a part of a larger project.  It has been always the practice on Department lands to provide live stock to consume the produce produced thereon. Last year, on the farm at Grange, live stock, bullocks, were fed.  We are now about to embark on a very large-scale programme for the elimination from the dairy herds of the country, on a purely voluntary basis, of uneconomic cows.  When we came to consider the <Col N="1629" /> basis upon which that programme should be developed, we had to consider the scale of compensation that would be payable to a farmer who had agreed that two, three, four or five cows of his herd were uneconomic for one reason or another, and had best be eliminated from the dairy herd.  It occurred to us that a farmer might feel that though you paid him ample compensation, he would find great difficulty in replacing cows or heifers that had been removed for slaughter to the canning factory on the ground that they were no longer economic milch cows.  It was, therefore, thought well to provide for such a man the alternative of an in-calf heifer of his own choosing from the stock of 800 heifers which we propose to assemble at Grange farm in the County Meath, Abbotstown and possibly at Clonakilty, each of which heifers would have been submitted to the tuberculin test, inoculated against contagious abortion, artificially inseminated and proven in calf to one of the high-priced stock bulls which are now being installed in the insemination centres established by the Department. One such insemination centre will be located at Grange, Killeshandra, Lough Egish and North Leitrim.  Another will be established in Clonakilty with sub-stations, and another at Castle-island in County Kerry with substations to cover County Kerry.  There will be a further station to serve the Clare area, the site of which has not yet been determined.</P>
    <P>There may be headquarters for another insemination centre, which has not been decided upon yet, at Abbotstown for the purpose of serving such part of the Dublin milk supply area as is not supplied from Grange.  I think it is a desirable thing if you want to secure the maximum co-operation from dairy farmers in getting rid of uneconomic cows, to be in a position to say, if a man has for slaughter a substantial number of cattle: &ldquo;You can either have the money wherewith to go and buy your replacements and use your own judgment in the local fair, or you can visit the Grange farm, the Abbotstown farm, the Clonakilty or the Athenry farm, and you should be able to pick out of the 800 in-calf <Col N="1630" /> heifers, three or four for the replacement of those which have been slaughtered.&rdquo;  In any case it will be purely at the election of the farmer to take his compensation in whatever form he chooses.  That is the reason we are now stocking farms with heifers, rather than with dry stock.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (3) refers to subscriptions to international associations and research organisations.  It is not always easy these times to know what your liabilities are likely to be in respect of such bodies because their multiplication has become so remarkable since the war that very often, new ones arise in the course of the financial year which were not in existence at the beginning of the year and which, in the circumstances, it is desirable that this country should adhere to. One is the International Committee for the control of the Colorado Beetle.  We have every reason to be grateful to Providence that, so far, we have not encountered the Colorado Beetle pest in this country.  Unfortunately, we have learned that in England and the Channel Islands, they have encountered the Colorado Beetle arriving on the breeze almost like locusts and it is necessary to be ready, in such an event, to mobilise effective measures at once so that the spread of this pest to the potato crop can be controlled and expelled before it spreads throughout the country.  It is, therefore, necessary for Ireland to take an active part in these international bodies so that we may exchange information, one with another, as to the best methods to be adopted in the case of any unforeseen arrival of the pest.</P>
    <P>After the declaration of the Republic here, naturally, our membership of the Commonwealth Bureaux became incongruous and we accordingly withdrew from our membership of the Commonwealth Bureaux of agricultural sciences of one kind or another which have their headquarters at the Imperial Institute. However, the close and cordial relations which have always existed between the Department of Agriculture in this country and the Department in Britain, result in constant discussions taking place between the officials of my Department and the officials of the British Department of Agriculture.  In <Col N="1631" /> the course of these discussions, and of certain discussions which the ambassador had in London, it became clear that the Commonwealth Bureaux were not only willing, but anxious, to receive associate members from countries which were not in the Commonwealth or in the Empire.  They were gracious enough to indicate, in the new situation, that such associate membership of Ireland would be very welcome. That was an indication which we were very happy, indeed, to acknowledge, and happy indeed to avail of, because these bureaux are the depositories of vast reservoirs of research and scientific information, and constant access to their proceedings is of incalculable value to anyone who can avail of them. Our associate membership will appropriately mark the conditions under which we participate.  It affords to Ireland all the advantages of full membership which the members of the Commonwealth would ordinarily enjoy.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (1), which deals with agricultural schools and farms, contains provision for a year's emergency supplies, and for the purchase of heifers for Clonakilty, Ballyhaise and Athenry. There is also provision for the insemination equipment at the Grange cattle farm and the expenses of the management of the Chantilly stud farm.  I might mention that we hope to evacuate Chantilly at an early stage when the activities hitherto carried on there will be transferred to Grange.  Chantilly is situated in the direction of Loughlinstown, and from many points of view is very convenient.  It was held by the Department on a number of extraordinary titles, leases and head rents. We would have evacuated it some time ago but for the fact that the surrender of our tenancy is a matter of such grave complexity that it has taken us about 18 months to persuade the landlord, or the variety of landlords whose tenants we are that we desired to terminate the leases, head rents and so on that fall to be extinguished.</P>
    <P>The additional grant to the university college was, I think, dealt with by the Minister for Finance when he <Col N="1632" /> brought the main Estimate before the House.  There is a rather odd convention in connection with that matter. The Minister for Finance answers to the House and explains the university grant, but inasmuch as Albert College was at one time under the direct administration of the Department of Agriculture, prior to its transfer to the National University in 1924, the financial provision by way of a Government grant for the classes in the agricultural faculty, continue to be chargeable on my Vote.  In fact, the practice has been and will continue to be, that the Minister for Finance answers to the House in respect of it, as he does in respect of the balance of the Grant-in-Aid to the university.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I (1) will be, I think, of special interest to the House because it involves a somewhat larger sum than we had anticipated for the allocation of increased numbers of rams in the congested areas.  Heretofore, the House will remember that we have always provided pedigree rams at reduced prices for the people living in the congested areas for the improvement of sheep flocks.  In 1946, the allocation was 157, in 1947 180, in 1948 194, in 1949 227 and last year 412. I think I will have correctly interpreted the wishes of the House by the general direction which has been given to the agricultural overseers in these areas to place black faced or Cheviot rams wherever it appeared to them a useful purpose could be served. That has resulted in practically every application from sheep farmers in the mountain areas who required rams being granted in the past two or three years.  The results have not been unsatisfactory in as much as some of us here in this House will remember black faced wool being sold in West Donegal at 4d. per lb.  It realised this year up to 8/7½d. per lb.  Our forecast in multiplying the number of rams has been amply vindicated.  Deputies will learn that Cheviot wool which used to sell at 1/- per lb. was sold during the last three months at 16/3 per lb.  The activities of the Cheviot rams, we will all agree, have been of a very remunerative character.  Perhaps the House will be interested to learn that the exports <Col N="1633" /> of wool in 1950 were valued at £3,516,767.</P>
    <P>Anybody familiar with the congested areas will remember the perennial difficulty of providing West Donegal and parts of Connemara with the type of cow which would give a decent yield of milk under the very rigorous conditions that obtain there.  It is true that we have always been able to provide the people in these areas with a type of cattle which will produce good stores by the judicious crossing of certain types of Scotch cattle with Shorthorn foundation stock.  But it has been a chronic problem to secure an adequate milk supply in West Donegal and in parts of West Connaught.  No one would seem to have adverted to the fact that that chronic problem did not exist in Kerry.  It seems to me perfectly obvious that the reason it did not was because there was in Kerry a breed of cattle unique in the whole world.  To the best of my knowledge and belief, there is only one breed of cattle in the world which could live on the mountain and give milk on a scale which justifies it being kept as a milch cow, and that is the Kerry cow.  I confess it caused me some irritation when I learned that certain sophisticated farmers in the country were bringing in Jersey, Guernsey and Ayrshire cows.  I apprehended that they would start bringing in Abyssinian cows at a time when we had already an indigenous breed of cattle in the country of which you could keep three on the grass that you would feed two Shorthorns, and of which you could keep four on the grass that you would feed two Friesians. But there was no respect for the Kerry cow in this country because it was the Kerry cow.  If it was an Andalusian cow people would be paying 200 guineas for it, and would bring it in in a passenger liner.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we have arranged that, to meet this chronic milk problem in West Donegal, and in the west of the province of Connaught, instead of bringing in Ayrshires or Andalusians, we should bring in Kerry cows.  To date, we have only one moment of anxiety and that is because we discovered that the Kerry cows do not <Col N="1634" /> take kindly to sea voyages and that if you want to escort them, without mishap, to Aranmore island or across the sea, it is necessary to handle them for some time before you show them the bottom of a boat.  Otherwise, they are inclined to leap over the side. However, we have overcome that difficulty and we hope to embark the first contingent for Aranmore, if it has not already gone there.  We have located the first brigade on the mainland in Glencolumbkille and we propose to send further platoons and battalions in due course to various parts of Connemara, West Mayo and West Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform the House that one of the most distinguished breeders in Scotland hopes to establish a model farm in the south-west of Ireland, whereon to assemble consignments of Kerry cattle for shipment to Palestine, where a profitable market exists for them for precisely the same reasons as they are proving a success in West Mayo and West Donegal. Throughout the whole Orient, one of the great problems has been to find a breed of cattle which, on the extremely impoverished grazing there available, will survive and provide milk.  There are any number of indigenous breeds of cattle in the Mediterranean and East thereof which can be made to do in the special conditions there, but it is one of the chronic problems of the Middle East and the Orient to find livestock which, in the conditions there obtaining, will provide milk.</P>
    <P>I ignore no market, however novel, which can be conquered by the peculiar merits of the stock we have to offer and I think that, for certain conditions, in densely populated countries, particularly where poverty and malnutrition have been a perennial problem, the Kerry breed of cattle can provide milk from the domestic forage resources there available on a better scale than probably any other breed of cattle in the world.  If we could make of Kerry cattle as remunerative a business as the people of the Channel Islands have made of Jerseys and Guernseys, we would have secured for the kingdom of Kerry a not insignificant source of income, a source of income which would <Col N="1635" /> be perennial, which would not be for this year, next year or the year after only, but for all time and on an expanding scale.</P>
    <P>There is only one thing, in my judgment, that can prevent that development and that is the deplorable tendency of our own people to look down their noses at their neighbour's son or their neighbour's beast.  If it is ours, it is no good and it is only a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; to be trying to sell it to the people in Palestine, or the people here, there or elsewhere; but if it is a Jersey or a Guernsey, everybody kneels down in front of it and says: &ldquo;Is it not wonderful?  Is it not lovely?&rdquo;  I do not know why our people have that supreme contempt for the neighbour's son or the neighbour's beast, but the interesting thing is that the neighbour's son or the neighbour's beast from this country conquer the world when they get outside Ireland and very often are driven out of this country by the contempt heaped upon them by these neighbours.  I have no doubt that contempt will be heaped upon me for suggesting to anyone that it is anything approximating common sense to send a Kerry cow a couple of thousand miles away from Ireland&mdash;&ldquo;Sure, the poor creature will die of the lonesome&rdquo;.  A good many are going to go and I hope that considerable sums of money will be sent back for them.  In the meantime, I am going to send them no further afield than Donegal and Connemara, and, speaking as a Connacht man, and, as a Donegal man by adoption, I can guarantee that there will be a very warm welcome for them in both these localities.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (9) refers to the potato reserve scheme.  That money was used for the purpose of breaking a racket which was started in this city towards the end of last year.  Some enterprising souls got it into their heads that there was going to be a scarcity of potatoes in Dublin about May or June of last year, and suddenly, where there was an abundance of potatoes, to my knowledge, the vanishing trick took place.  There was not a potato to be found.  The price of potatoes began to <Col N="1636" /> shoot up on the Dublin market and <i>mirabile dictum,</i> as the price rose, a thin trickle began to approach the City of Dublin from the general direction of Donegal.  I then took precautions to bring sufficient potatoes into Amiens Street to create a situation in which the Great Northern Railway were not prepared to accept consignments of potatoes from Donegal because their storage in Dublin was packed, and, to my great amusement, a number of public spirited citizens sent urgent messages from a number of stations in Donegal asking what, in the Name of God, had happened and why would they not take potatoes, and they were damn nearly fainting on the floor when told that there were too many potatoes in Amiens Street to permit the shipment of another ton.  Whereupon, the lorries began to roll and the scarce potatoes, the non-existent potatoes, began to arrive from the faminestricken areas where men and beasts were dying from want of food, by night, and were hawked around the greengrocers of Dublin at any price they would fetch.  If I am not mistaken, some fingers were burned in the transaction.  I must say that I never smelt burning substance with greater joy.</P>

      <P>Because I broke the market.  I had to bring in the potatoes to break the market and the measure of my success was the loss I made, because the gangsters held me up when I went to get potatoes, but, when I got the potatoes, I held them up, and the holding I did was much longer than the holding they did.  I saved the citizens of this city, by the outlay of £5,000, probably £100,000.  The only difference was that that £5,000 went into the pockets of relatively honest potato growers, whereas the £100,000 would have gone into the pockets of the racketeers who thought they could get away with murder but learned, by night, that they could not.  I can assure the Deputy that if I lost £5,000, the racketeers lost 20 times as much, and I know that it will console him to know that the public were saved that <Col N="1637" /> exploitation by the expenditure of so modest a sum and he will be further consoled to know that the racketeers who sought to rob their neighbours were so sternly punished by the outlay of so modest a sum of public money, so prudently employed.</P>

    <P>Sub-paragraph (h), is merely the winding-up of the expenses in which we were involved by the outbreak of fowl pest.  May I avail of this occasion to express my admiration and that, I think, of everybody who knows anything about it, of the admirable co-operation afforded both by the people and by local officers of my Department in bringing under control as dangerous a situation as ever we have been confronted with in this country since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  We have modest reason to be proud that, in a very widespread outbreak of Newcastle Pest covering five south-eastern counties, the officers of my Department and the local collaborators so grappled with it that it never spread an inch outside the area and that we drove it back steadily to the coastline and eliminated it&mdash;and we have not had a similar occurrence since that outbreak.  Other countries who have been confronted with this appalling pest&mdash;on the continent or in the United States&mdash;have either abandoned their schemes or else have suffered staggering losses.  I know that the House will join with me in wishing the British Ministry of Agriculture the same measure of success in bringing the pest under control as met our endeavours and in expressing our sympathy with them for the staggering losses they have sustained in the past few years.  In some measure we are indebted to them for the exhaustive precautions they have taken and continue to take.  There is no use in disguising from ourselves that the continued presence of that disease in Great Britain would constitute a menace to this country.  It is a matter for congratulation to both of us that wherever our measures could be co-ordinated they have been co-ordinated <Col N="1638" /> to protect our several territories from the continued existence of this pest amongst us.</P>
    <P>Subhead N. (2) provides additional money for the Bovine Tuberculosis Order.  My only regret is that we cannot spend more under that Order.  I am not without hope that farmers generally will have more constant recourse to their rights under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order and at an earlier stage.  The great pity is that farmers allow cattle to become diseased and that when they are slaughtered they only get a pittance for the beasts which have been destroyed.  If they would take time by the forelock and notify the county veterinary surgeon at the earliest stage at which they suspect tuberculosis in a beast then it ought to be possible to give the farmer 75 per cent. of the market value of the beast destroyed under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order.  I sincerely wish that farmers would realise that if they call the county veterinary surgeon the first moment they have reason to suspect tuberculosis in a beast and if the veterinary surgeon determines that there is tubercular infection and slaughters the beast, they will get 75 per cent. of the true market value&mdash;whereas if they allow the beast to go on they will get only £3 or £4 for it when it is emaciated.  Further, while the beast is emaciating there is the danger that it will infect a few of the other beasts in the byre, which need not happen.</P>
    <P>The extra money required for part-time veterinary examiners arises from the growing trade in dead meat.  The House will be glad to hear that the animals slaughtered for the dead meat trade under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts and under the Pigs and Bacon Act are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>That shows remarkable expansion and it has the unsatisfactory feature in it that the hides and pelts of these animals are retained for processing in our own country.  We have inherited from our predecessors a most extraordinary situation with regard to <Col N="1639" /> hides, the resolution of which presents a most complex and difficult problem. When I came into office as Minister for Agriculture I found that if you slaughter a beast in Ireland you are under an obligation to dispose of the hide to a member of a ring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The slaughter of cattle for the dead meat trade in this country is materially conditioned by the price realised for hides.  I have shown that there has been an increase in the numbers slaughtered, and the hides retained for the domestic market.  But for that peculiar feature of the situation, we should greatly increase that figure.  I discovered that if you slaughtered a beast in this country, you had to sell the hide to a ring which had endowed itself with the high-sounding title of the &ldquo;Hide Improvement Society&rdquo;.  The improvement was that nobody else could buy a hide but themselves.  They paid the long-suffering farmers of this country 5d. per lb. for a hide.  At that time, hides were fetching 1/8 per lb. in Great Britain. After some considerable negotiation, we succeeded in persuading that society to pay 10d. a lb.  The world price of hides is now about 3/- a lb.  But take it at 2/10 per lb.  An average hide is about 50 lb. weight.  You lose 2/- a lb. on the hide or, in other words, £5 a hide.  The reason for that is that the tanning industry must have cheap raw materials or the price of leather and boots will go up.  The result is that at this moment the tanning industry, the boot and shoe industry, enjoy high protection and a subsidy from the live-stock trade of this country of between £1,000,000 and £1,500,000 sterling per annum.</P>

      <P>A sum of £5 per hide deducted from the price of cattle because they are being slaughtered in Ireland and the meat exported has resulted in great difficulty in my expanding the dead meat trade which would bring grist to our mill in Ireland.  If the hide goes out on the beast, if the beast is slaughtered abroad and the hide is torn off the carcase, it goes into the world market at the world market price.  But if the same beast is brought to an abattoir in Ireland for an Irish butcher to tear the hide off the carcase, it costs the Irish farmer £5 to let the Irish butcher tear the hide off his beast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A stroke of the pen can alter that.  But if that situation is altered one must remember that a whole structure has been built up on the basis of that annual subsidy.  Now it is perfectly true that we could end the subsidy by giving the hide merchants leave to export hides at the best <Col N="1641" /> prices they could get, and that would mean that the tanners would have to pay world prices for them.  That would put £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 on the price of boots.  If I were dictator of Ireland I could say that I did not give a hoot about the price of boots and that I wanted to get the best possible price for the farmers for their hides, but this House represents Ireland and all its constituent parts, and if you create a situation in which that set-up exists it is extremely difficult to put an end to it.  In theory it is perfectly easy, but to come up against the hard core of facts, where is the £1,500,000 to come from without which the leather and boot industry cannot carry on?</P>
      <P>I would like to see our hides flayed by Irish butchers fetching their full value.  I resent the fact that the hides of Irish cattle flayed by British butchers should be worth £5 while hides flayed by Irish butchers should not be worth more than 50/-, but that is the way it is at present and I have not been able to find a way out.  If I do, however, I can double, triple or quadruple the quantity of cattle slaughtered in this country for the dead meat trade for which there is now a remunerative market not only in America, Canada and on the Continent but in Great Britain.  The present situation creates the deplorable problem that although the British would gladly receive carcass meat if we sent them carcass meat I fine the farmers of this country 50/- on every hide I send out.  I would be glad if any Deputy on this side or the far side of the House could make any suggestion to me how I could resolve that dilemma without putting 5/- a pair on every pair of boots that the people in this country wear or closing down the tanning factories.</P>
      <P>I hope that I have not trespassed unduly on the time of the House and that I have established a nexus between this problem and the problem of the number of cattle being slaughtered in our slaughter-houses which I would like to see much higher than it is.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon, the Deputy is quite right.  This is a subsidy to the pedigree seed growers. When I came into office I discovered there was an arrangement with a body of gentlemen who are the pedigree seed growers and on whom I wish to cast no aspersion whatever.  They were invited by the previous Government to collaborate with them in the propagation of cereal seeds for subsequent sale to our farmers and they were, as part of a general arrangement, made the channel through which all pedigree cereal seeds reached the public.  It appeared that they had the effective enjoyment of a monopoly which I did not consider to be in the best interests of the farming community. I gave directions that all monopolies which forced the farmers of the country to deal willy nilly with one particular supplier were to be brought to an end.  It was suggested that there were some grounds for the belief that the members of this particular monopoly believed themselves to be possessors of a guarantee from the Minister for Agriculture that their monopoly would not be terminated without two years' notice and that if it were so terminated they would be entitled to some compensation.  The view I took was that they were not entitled to any compensation, but whether they were or not I was going to put an end to the monopoly and give the farmers access to whatever source of supply would give them the best seeds at the lowest price.  I ended the monopoly and discussions ensued as to whether they had any enforceable rights or not and if they had enforceable rights what those rights were.  Being reasonable men on both sides we eventually compromised on the issue and agreed that the payment of this sum would liquidate any claims that they had without prejudice on our part that any claims existed.  That is the history of that transaction.</P>

In the course of breaking the monopoly these boys said that they had unsold stocks and that they would lose on them instead of getting the mill price for them; it was all my fault that they had suffered a loss that they should not have been asked to sustain. By whatever they lost the farmers gained, but this is a free country; I was working for these people and was their servant.  My duty was to sit down with them and try to treat with them on an equitable basis.  That is the settlement I made, and now I come into Dáil Éireann to tell them of that settlement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I come to sub-head P.  This is a matter of such considerable complexity that I propose, by your leave, to have recourse to a copious note.  The original Estimate was for £7,200,000 and our revised Estimate is for £8,365,000.  The Department of Agriculture originally computed the flour and wheaten-meal subsidy Estimate at £7,400,000.  That was based on estimated weekly deliveries of subsidised flour, 50,600 sacks; and the estimated subsidy payable was thought probably to work out at 57/6 per sack.  We hoped on an estimate of the delivery of unsubsidised flour to recoup ourselves to the tune of 4,750 sacks a week and we hoped on that unsubsidised flour, which was provided for confectioners for the manufacture of white bread and cakes and biscuit manufacture and other luxury products, to realise a sum of 17/6 a sack, in relief of the subsidy payable on rationed flour.  It was computed that the subsidy required in the financial year 1950-51 to cover 12 months' deliveries of flour would amount to £7,465,000.  The sum of £7,465,000 covers only 12 months' deliveries up to approximately 19th January, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1947-48 inclusive, the annual subsidy payments covered deliveries from the 1st March to 28th February, but in 1948-49 we had to meet the unexpected charge which fell upon us as a result of certain purchases of wheat from an emergency source.  The House will remember that the Minister for Finance, in dealing with the flour subsidy, mentioned that he proposed to approach it on the basis of a quinquennial <Col N="1645" /> calculation with the intention of applying one-fifth of the quinquennial global sum to each financial year. Therefore, in 1948-49 when this unexpected burden fell upon the annual appropriation to meet the quinquennial sum, that quinquennial sum was charged to the subsidy which came in course of payment in that year only to the 1st January, 1949, instead of 28th February, as had been the practice heretofore.</P>
    <P>If you follow that on, you discover that a 12 months' payment of subsidy in the ensuing year only brought you up to January, 1950, and then 12 months' subsidy after that only brought you up to January, 1951.  It is now intended&mdash;and that is the purpose of this sub-head of the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;as from 1950-51 to revert to the practice of covering subsidy up to 28th February; and the sum here required it to fill the gap between 1st January, 1951 and 28th February, 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a practice calculated to fascinate the Deputy, he is so unaccustomed to it.  The Estimate for 1950-51 takes credit for a refund of approximately £40,000 due by the milling industry, arising out of the examination of the milling accounts for the year to August, 1948.  That was another odd thing I discovered when I took over this Department, that the millers accounts were normally from two to two and a half years in arrears, and they had a fit when I suggested to them that at some time in the calendar year after their financial year they should be able to produce accounts.  They have all been in a flutter ever since.  In any case, when we got the 1948 accounts we got quite a normal repayment which reflects on nobody but is part of the ordinary procedure, as a certain degree of approximation is necessary when the accounting year does not correspond with the year in which they draw their annual remuneration.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that payments not exceeding £200,000 will have to be made to millers in respect of the milling accounting period to August, 1949.  We have only got the accounts for that now and they are being wound up.  No provision had been made for that in the original Estimate and it could not have been made because we never knew of its existence.

    <P>The sum, which is £1,165,000, is now made up on this basis: the balance required to meet the original Estimate, based on 12 months' deliveries to approximately the 19th January, 1951, £265,000; an additional amount required to meet deliveries in the period from 19th January, 1951 to 28th <Col N="1647" /> February, 1951, £700,000; an estimated amount required in respect of the milling accounting period ended on 31st August, 1949, to bring the millers' profits up to the guaranteed amount, 6 per cent. on capital, plus depreciation, £200,000.  The total amounts to £1,165,000.</P>

We commissioned, I thought with undue optimism, 500,000 wrappers. They hardly got into the Department at all.  As often as they came in, they shot out again and we sent for 1,000,000 more wrappers, which came in in one door and out in another.  We then sent for another 1,000,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Open confession is good for the soul.  I never realised that our people were capable of absorbing as much as they did.  They got more butter from native production in 1950 than ever was eaten in Ireland since Brian Boru was killed at Clontari and, frankly, that took me by surprise.  The <i>Irish Press</i>, the kept newspaper of the Fianna Fáil Party, charged me with falsifying figures in saying in this House that we produced and ate more butter in Ireland in 1950 than we had ever eaten or produced since Brian Boru lost his life at Clontarf.  They said they knew a year since then, if you included the farmers' butter, when we ate more, but the astonishing thing is that in calculating for the year the poor innocent creatures compared our consumption of farmers' butter and creamery butter in 1935 with the consumption of creamery butter in 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I wrote and told them they were liars, they would not publish the letter because they said it was too rude.  I must say they published a charming cartoon, the original of which I very much like to have, because it is about the best I have seen. What tickled me was that their skin was so tender, when they got their ears nailed to the post and their hands pinned to the table for a lie, they said that it was a nasty, rude thing to call them liars and they could not publish it.  I will give them this credit&mdash;I think I know the reason why, because I took precautions to see that certain prudent pressure would be brought on them to publish the truth&mdash;to give the devil his due, in the most obscure possible language they did confess: &ldquo;We are liars.  You caught us out, but there was no need to get so vexed about it. Are you surprised to find out we are liars?&rdquo; I only hope the newspaper will give up treating its readers like <Col N="1650" /> morons and recognise that, silly as they may be, they are entitled to be treated as rational human beings.  I hope that kept paper will come to realise that only a fool or a rogue would compare one set of figures in 1935 with an entirely different set in 1950; a fool to think that he would be let away with it and a rogue who would make the attempt.  I have actually moved the risibility of Deputy Aiken, which is no small achievement. I like to see his bright countenance, because he is ordinarily a depressing figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I thought that other story was worth telling, recalling the injured innocence of a kept newspaper caught in its traditional practice of lying.  The reason for the deficiency was that my own performance in facilitating the increase of butter production which took place far outstripped my most optimistic anticipations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made provision when we were drafting the Estimate on the assumption that we would produce in the calendar year 700,000 cwts. of butter. In making that estimate, I felt that, perhaps.  I was allowing my natural tendency to optimism to bedazzle myself; but lo and behold, so beneficial had been the activities of my Department that instead of producing 700,000 cwts. we produced 725,000 cwts. of butter, and as a subsidy is payable on butter, but not at the point of production, the creamery is getting a subsidy as the butter passes into cold storage and is subsequently disposed of. The difference between the sale price and the price which the creamery receives is either met by way of subsidy out of the Exchequer or, when the butter is exported or sold at an economic price, the difference is met by what is paid for the butter which we consume.  My performance so far exceeded my most optimistic anticipations that I discovered my production had outrun my best hopes.  I would like to go back to the House <Col N="1651" /> deferentially to await their applause for the unprecedented achievement of drawing to the creamery a quantity of milk unprecedented in any year except 1936 when no less than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Springing out of his sleep every quarter of an hour will not keep him <i>au fait.</i>  I am talking of deliveries of gallons of milk to the creamery.  The Deputy will find that has been only exceeded in one year, 1936, in which year we were engaged in the profitable occupation of paying the British people a handsome subsidy to eat our butter.  We exported in that year between 300,000 and 400,000 cwts. of butter to every pound of which we attached a sum of money as a bribe to the British people to oblige us by eating it.  In this year, 1950, our people ate the butter, but if they had not eaten it and we had exported in 1950 the quantity of butter that was exported in 1936 it would have been worth £8,000,000 in the Balance of Trade.  Thanks be to God our people were fit to eat it and fit to pay for it. Thanks be to God our people have more sense than some of our continental neighbours who send their butter abroad for money and eat margarine themselves.  No Minister for Agriculture could ever face our people and suggest that they should eat 2½ ozs. of butter and ship 11 ozs. every week.  It is not the butter but the Minister that they would eat if he made any such proposal.</P>

I have heard him in another place, on another occasion pay a gracious tribute to the concept and those who seek to give effect to it. We are constrained to express regret for our failure to achieve perfection.

      <P>I am obliged to the Deputy for giving me the opportunity <Col N="1654" /> of dealing with that matter.  If we had sought to distribute Danish butter on the ration, I understand the distribution costs would have been greatly increased.  What we sought to do then was to let the Danish butter go straight out again as it came in without measuring it in the way that the rationed butter was done.  I may, however, tell the Deputy that, though I think it is, perhaps, something of an extravagance to implement the wishes that he and Deputy Byrne and a number of other Deputies representing the Dublin constituencies have given expression to, I have directed the officers of my Department that in the event of any such necessity arising again, we must closely examine the matter to find out whether a method cannot be devised in which the domestic butter will continue to be available on the ration and that any butter imported from outside sources will be sold in the 3/6 wrapper.</P>

      <P>If we dealt with the Minister in the way in which he used to treat this Party when we were in Government, we would call this Supplementary Estimate&mdash;I will quote the Minister's own words&mdash;&ldquo;A dirty fraud, a dirty deceitful game, a piece of flat-footed incompetence.&rdquo; Without using the extravagant language which the Minister used when he was Deputy Dillon on occasions when violent language could not be so well justified as on this occasion, I want to say that this Supplementary Estimate is completely false and that, instead of wanting another £1,000,000 odd to subsidise food for human beings, the real reason why we have to give the Minister this £1,000,000 odd for extra food subsidy is to provide him with another underhand means of subsidising food for cattle and hens.  The Minister is quite fraudulently diverting food for human beings into food for cattle and hens. The Minister is importing wheat at £32 per ton and the reason why he wants this extra subsidy is to buy that wheat at that price and sell it at the subsidised price.</P>

I think it is a scandal that the Minister for Agriculture, in a situation in which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have definitely said that we should spend money on stocking up because of a possible emergency, has not yet asked one farmer to grow the most essential food for human consumption, wheat.  He has spent a lot of money on advertisements asking the farmers to grow extra barley and oats, but not once has he by way of advertisement or appeal asked our farmers to grow wheat.</P>

Why go to all this trouble?  Everything will be lovely in the garden so long as we refrain from spending money on trying to produce those things which will sustain us in the event of an emergency.

      <P>I would advise Deputy O'Higgins to refrain from interrupting me.  The Minister must think that we are all very innocent in relation to this extra subsidy for butter.  Surely, he does not want us to believe that because of a 1/28th increase in the production of creamery butter he miscalculated the subsidy required by 1/5th.  The Minister said that production, instead of being 700,000 cwts., rose to 775,000 cwts.  He estimated in the beginning of the year for a butter subsidy of £2,600,000, and now he wants us to give him another £479,000, or nearly £500,000 on £2,600,000.  The figures do not tally.</P>

      <P>One-twenty-eighth on the £2,600,000 would come to very much less than £479,000.  As a matter of fact, it would come to only something around £100,000.  The fact of the matter is that the reason the Minister wants this £479,000 is to buy dear Danish and New Zealand butter and sell it on the ration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have not misled the Deputy.  The original Estimate was in respect of 650,000 cwts.  I offer the Deputy my apologies.  He has reason for complaint.  I misread this. The original Estimate was for £2,639,000, which would have been sufficient to subsidise production of about 650,000 cwts.  The Estimate was prepared in November, 1949, when the <Col N="1657" /> prospects of the financial year, 1950-51, were largely conjectural, weather conditions, and so forth.  It transpired that the production had reached 700,000 cwts. at the end of January and it is expected to reach 725,000 cwts. by the end of March.  That is the position. If the Deputy checks, I think he will find that that is approximately right.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will remember that Deputy Lemass made an observation in the middle of my speech which put me off my step.  Frankly, I read from the top of the page when there was a little addendum on the previous page.  To tell the truth, I did not believe that I could exceed the Estimate by 75,000 cwts.  I had 700,000 cwts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might have explained that in the production of creamery butter he corralled and got into the creameries quite a lot of milk that would ordinarily have gone for production of butter on the farm.  The reason he got it into the creameries was that he cut off the subsidy on farmers' butter, and a farmer who had cows and was not within striking distance of the creamery, even under the new system of collection, had to continue to produce butter at home and got no subsidy for it.  The result was the complaints that we hear that the farmers could not get even 2/- a lb. for butter at some periods last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was a crazy policy on the part of the Minister to export the butter in the early part of last season before he knew what the situation would be.  He paid a very much higher price for the butter he imported than the price he got for the butter he exported. He talks about the cost of distribution of the Danish butter that lands in Dublin port and goes down throughout the country, and gives that <Col N="1658" /> as his excuse for not giving Irish butter on the ration and the Danish butter off the ration.  Surely, the Irish people have to pay in one way or another the costs of transport of our butter from Limerick to the port and to England and elsewhere and then to pay the cost of transport of New Zealand and Danish butter from New Zealand and Denmark to the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>The Minister has succeeded in reducing the acreage under cereals pretty considerably during his day.  He has reduced the area under tillage crops by over 500,000 acres.  Last year he paid an additional £6,000,000, or so, for cereals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My question on the Order Paper to the Minister for Social Welfare to-day was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the dates and occasions of each of (i) the several lectures or talks delivered by, (ii) the conferences or discussions engaged in, (iii) the interviews given by, (iv) the articles or other publicity matter or statements published in the daily and weekly papers or other periodicals by the Information Officer in his Department; if he will give the subject matter of each of these and state where each of the lectures, talks, conferences or interviews took place, whether in Dublin or elsewhere, and in what papers or periodicals the articles or other published statements appeared.</P>
      <P>The answer which I received to that question was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards (i) I would refer the Deputy to my reply of the 1st March, 1951, to Question No. 5.</P>
      <P>In connection with the remainder of the question, records are not kept in such detail as would enable the information sought to be readily given, and I do not feel that the matter is of sufficient importance to justify the considerable use of official time which would be involved in its compilation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I would like to make quite clear to everyone at the outset that this question was not put down in order to attack the civil servant who is referred to in it.  That officer has no responsibility in the matter.  He is not responsible if public money is paid out and no return is given for it to the State. He is not responsible if he is paid out of the public funds to serve the narrow aims of a political Party.  He is neither Minister nor accounting officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put the question down in order to expose one little instance, one trifling example, of the manner in which the public moneys are being misused at the <Col N="1662" /> instance of the Minister concerned.  It is necessary for me to say that the officer referred to in the question was long absent from the normal work of the Civil Service.  His rank when he was engaged otherwise than in the service of the State was that of a junior executive officer.  It is generally believed that he was anxious to be recalled to duty in the Department of Social Welfare as private secretary to the Minister.</P>
    <P>For reasons best known to himself, the Minister refused to have him in that capacity, so another job had to be found for him.  He was so powerful, so influential, that, as I have said, an other job had to be found for him. Accordingly, in October, 1948, almost two and a half years ago, the post of information officer was created in the Department of Social Welfare and he was appointed to it.  I perhaps may comment in passing that this is only one of the many instances since the Government took office that henchmen of the Labour Party have been quartered on the public purse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a deliberate untruth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I use the word quartered deliberately, because it is clear, from the Minister's inability to say what this officer does for his money, that so far as service to the State is concerned the job is a mere sinecure.  When I say this, I do not wish to convey the impression that the officer is indolent or incapable&mdash;far from it.  I merely say that he has nothing to do inside his Department&mdash; he does nothing there, is seldom to be found there, but is very active elsewhere trying to bolster up the falling fortunes of the political Party to which, quite improperly as a civil servant, he has attached himself.  However, let me repeat that is not his responsibility, but the responsibility of the Minister, the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare and of the Minister for Finance, who cooperated in quartering him on the public funds in order to carry out this political work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned already that when <Col N="1663" /> this officer was working outside the Civil Service he was graded and paid as a junior executive officer.  When the Minister for Social Welfare brought him back to the Department to be his principal political organiser, he was jumped a step in the Service and was made a higher executive officer.  In that job his salary is given in the Book of Estimates for 1949-50 at £817.  I am not able to state what it will be for the coming year.  Every information on that point has been withheld, carefully withheld, from us by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will look at the Book of Estimates which has been presented to them for this year&mdash;Estimates totalling £83,000,000&mdash;they will find that the most significant figures in that volume, the most significant date which will enable the House to judge how the Department is being staffed and run, have been carefully eliminated.  They will not see, for instance, where this officer is being paid £817, as he was last year, or, as I expect, he will be paid during the coming year almost £850.  Now, what return is given to the taxpayers for that £850?</P>

      <P>Last week, I asked the Minister to state amongst other things the number of meetings which this, officer addressed.  In his reply to the question which I had on the Order Paper to-day he referred me to his answer to that question.  I might, therefore, refer to it now.  Here are <Col N="1665" /> the number of occasions on which, since his appointment, this information officer functioned according to the Minister's statement last week.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  The question last week asked how many occasions he was out of the office delivering lectures.  I have furnished information as to the number of occasions on which he was out of the office delivering lectures.  Now the Deputy is seeking to show that that was the only work he did, but he was in the office on the other days.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to state on 1st March how many lectures were given by this officer and he told me five lectures were given by the officer.  The number of occasions on which according to the Minister last week this information officer functioned was three&mdash;on 30th March, 1950, on 16th-18th May, 1950 and on 28th-29th August, 1950.  Only three definite dates were given by the Minister in his reply on that occasion.  In amplification of his meagre statement of last week, the Minister disclosed that, on some unspecified dates, his information officer had delivered two other lectures&mdash;one to the Institute of Personnel Management and the other to the Railway Clerks' Association.</P>

      <P>The result of this dental operation, performed I might say, without any anæsthetic, was that the Minister was compelled to reveal that the officer on two other occasions addressed meetings held to expound the political views of the Minister.  The second result was to draw from the Minister the information that the information officer had addressed a meeting of members of the Railway Clerks' Association at 48 Fleet Street, Dublin, on 1st February, 1951.  Note the manner in which it is intended to bamboozle the public about the activities of this information officer.</P>

      <P>Note the phraseology which was used to describe this occasion on 1st February, 1951.  The information officer, we were told, got an invitation to deliver a lecture to the members of the Railway Clerks' Association.  The Railway Clerks' Association, the Minister told us, has over 1,000 members.  There is no doubt about it that the phrase &ldquo;the members of the Railway Clerks' Association&rdquo;, was deliberately used in order to convey the impression that this information officer, who costs the taxpayer almost £850 per annum, had addressed a monster gathering.  Judging by the Minister's language to-day, however, the occasion must have wounded the Minister's vanity and conceit monstrously, for with that delicacy and refined, polished diction to which he has recourse so frequently, he described those who attended this meeting of the Railway Clerks' Association &mdash;I must refresh my memory in regard to it&mdash;as &ldquo;in the main political ward-heelers of the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>However, here we have it on record that the work of the Minister's information officer for whom the taxpayers have to provide £850 per annum, consisted of five lectures, beginning with a lecture, the date of which was resurrected to-day <Col N="1667" /> from the dim recesses of the information officer's memory, and ending with the lecture delivered according to the Minister to an audience of political ward-heelers on 1st February, 1951. No other lectures, no other addresses, no other talks were given for the whole of that period.  The activities of the information officer at conferences and discussions appeared to be equally extensive, so extensive that there is no record in the Department of them. Apparently there were no conferences, no discussions&mdash;none at any rate that dared be put on the records of the Department nor were there any interviews given, articles written, information published or talks broadcast.  So far as information to the public is concerned, the brain of the information officer appears to have been almost sterile from the date of his appointment up to the present.  Here we have, let me repeat it, on the Minister's responsibility an officer receiving £850 for doing nothing.  Is it any wonder that, with that sort of administration in the State, the volume of Estimates which was before us to-day has now swollen until it provides for a service costing £83,000,000, a large part of which goes in remunerating officers and political henchmen of Ministers who do nothing for their money or render no service to the State or to the taxpayer? When the secretary of the Department asked this information officer to account for his time, what happened? Did the Minister back him up?  Not at all.  Instead of telling the information officer to give that information to the secretary, the accounting officer, the head of the Department, the Minister had the secretary sacked.  That is the sort of thing that is going to bring down this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The mean matters, you mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You can have it either way.  I want to deny categorically some of the untruthful statements made by Deputy MacEntee.  So far as <Col N="1668" /> I know, the officer concerned never sought to be made my private secretary. I have never discussed that matter with him nor have I any record that he coveted such a post.  I think it highly improbable that he would look for such an onerous post in this busy Department, particularly in the condition in which it was because of the ineptitude of the Deputy's administration.</P>
      <P>That is No. 1.  So far as the information section of the Department is concerned, it was set up at the request of the late secretary.  He realised in 1948 that, although he had been there for 12 months, he had not yet started thinking about the preparation of the annual report on the work of the Department.  The information section, as I say, was set up at the request of the late secretary to the Department. Deputy MacEntee says this officer was brought back to the service on an increased salary.  He got no increase on coming back, and he profited in no sense by being brought back to the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee wants to know what work the officer did in the section.  In my view, the officer worked hard and industriously in the section, and I repeat now, what I said before, that he could be found more often than the late secretary to the Department.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Railway Clerks' Association meeting, the information officer attended a meeting at 6.15 p.m. in the evening in his own time and delivered a lecture there.  I was not present at the lecture, but those who were there told me that it was an excellently attended meeting. Subsequently, a small caucus, inspired by the Fianna Fáil Party, held another meeting at which there were 36 people present out of a branch membership of 983.  I said then, and I say now, that the bulk of the audience at that meeting were Fianna Fáil ward-heelers. I will not withdraw one word of that, and I make a present of it to Deputy MacEntee who prefaced his opening <Col N="1669" /> remarks in this matter by saying that this was not intended to be an attack on the information officer.  I suppose his speech this evening was intended to be a manifestation of kindness towards the information officer.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that it did not matter what I said to-day, in reply to Question No. 10, Deputy MacEntee would insist on raising this matter to-night, because he wanted to use the question and use the House in order to provide himself with the opportunity of vilifying and blackguarding a defenceless civil servant.  That is what he has done this evening.  I want to say, as a member of this House for a long time, that it is a scandal that the people's Parliament should be used for a sordid purpose of this sort.  This House and the community generally know Deputy MacEntee.  They know the depths of vituperation to which he is capable of descending.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>His record for dealing out slanders under the shelter of this House invites envy from no decent man or woman in this country.  I said to-day that it would be impossible for the information officer to keep records of everybody he sees, of everybody he talks to on the phone, of everybody who calls to see him and asks for information on this or that matter, or of every minute or memorandum which he prepares.  I would not allow the information officer to waste his time making a separate record of everybody he sees, of everybody he talks to on the phone and of everybody who rings him up or calls to see him asking for information on this or that matter. Deputy MacEntee knows perfectly well that it would be impossible for any officer efficiently to discharge his duties if he was going to be cribbed down in that fashion and compelled, not only to deal with inquiries and with phone calls, but to write minutes and memoranda for his own information, for the information of the secretary and for the information of the Minister, and then keep a log book of what he wrote, when he wrote it, how long it took him and the days on which he wrote it.  If that is Deputy MacEntee's <Col N="1670" /> conception of efficient administration, is it any wonder that we had the blunders which were associated with his administration?  I say that it would be sheer lunacy to permit an officer of the rank of higher executive officer to keep a log book of what he did as if he were an unreliable officer. There was much more of a case for asking the late secretary to keep a log book of what he was doing than there was to ask the information officer to keep a record of his work.</P>

      <P>Even Deputy MacEntee has been led up the garden in this whole matter.  Up to some months ago the late secretary to the Department and the information officer were close and intimate friends.  They visited each other's homes.  The late secretary enjoyed the company and the hospitality of the information officer's home and household and partook generously of the hospitality there afforded to him.  The late secretary took the information officer on visits to different parts of the country.  Why, I do not know, but he apparently thought his presence was necessary.</P>

      <P>That was the relationship and Deputy MacEntee apparently is not aware of it.  They quarrelled afterwards and civil war was unleashed.  The secretary became the secretary again, and the information officer became the subordinate again. The secretary went scalp-hunting with a vengence, the war cry was on, the lid of fury was off, and everyone can guess the rest.</P>
