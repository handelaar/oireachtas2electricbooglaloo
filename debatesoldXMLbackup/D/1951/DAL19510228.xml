    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been directed to press reports of a speech made on 17th February by Professor James Hogan, University College, Cork, regarding statements which he said had been made to him by members of the Government relative to a bargain concerning Partition and adherence to the Atlantic Pact; and, if so, whether he has any statement to make to the Dáil on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen Press reports of Professor Hogan's speech.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position in relation to the North Atlantic Treaty was clearly stated in the <i>aide-mémoire</i> which was presented to the United States Minister in Dublin on the 8th February, 1949, and was again made clear in the further <i>aide-mémoire</i> which was presented to the State Department in Washington on the 25th May, 1949.  The texts of both of these <i>aide-mémoires</i> are included in a White Paper (P. No. 9934) which was presented to each of the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 26th April, 1950.  There has been no change in the Government's views as expressed in those <i>aidemémoires.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the Press reports of Professor Hogan's speech, there is only one to which the Deputy's question could conceivably be related, and even that report does not bear out the Deputy's allegation that the speaker said that statements had been made to him by members of the Government relative <Col N="738" /> to a bargain concerning Partition and adherence to the Atlantic Pact.</P>
    <P>I need not add that the Government have made no bargain with anybody on the subject of Partition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct that Professor Hogan stated that the Government had decided that they were going to bargain on the question of Partition and that if they would get the Six Counties they were going to adhere to the Atlantic Pact?  Did he not say that &ldquo;he was informed by members of the Government to wait only a few months or at the very most a year and a half, and we were going to get all we wanted and then could ahere to the Pact?&rdquo; Were such statements made to Professor Hogan by a member of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the statements quoted by the Deputy from his own newspaper bears out the allegation in the Deputy's question that members of the Government made statements to him relative to a bargain concerning Partition and the Atlantic Pact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement on which I was questioned by the Deputy does not bear out the allegation which the Deputy made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give a straight answer to my question? Was Professor Hogan speaking the truth when he said that these statements were made to him by members of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question concerns a reported statement by Professor Hogan that statements were made to him by members of the Government to &ldquo;wait only a few months or the very most a year and a half and we were going to get all we wanted and then could adhere to the pact.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(a) In the year 1950, the total imports of hides consisted of 58,708 cwt. of cattle hides and skins and 1,575 cwt. of other hides and skins; the figures in both cases include wet hides, dry and salted hides and skins, undressed; (b) in the same period, the imports of hides from Argentina consisted of 21,489 cwt. of cattle hides and 295 cwt. of other hides and skins; (c) <Col N="742" /> the average prices, c.i.f., of the Argentine hides were £11 0s. 1d. per cwt. or 2/- per lb., for cattle hides and skins, and £6 13s. 6d. per cwt. or 1/2 per lb. for other hides and skins; (d) the price of native hides is not controlled by Order.  Control is, however, exercised by way of agreement between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Irish tanners.  There are a number of grades of home-produced hides, the top grade being first clear ox, heifer and cow.  The price of this grade from January to September, 1950, was 8d. per lb.; since then it has been 10d. per lb.</P>

      <P>Surely the Deputy is not serious when he says that an offer of 124 acres, 90 of which are under water, is an attractive proposition?  I do not like to give information of this kind here because, if the owner of this holding or any other holding wishes to sell it later to a private individual, it might have the effect of depressing the price.  My information is that there is no congestion in the vicinity and that the commissioners fully considered the question of the application for an exchange and decided to turn it down.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the reports in question.</P>
      <P>All horses exported from this country are, immediately prior to shipment, subjected to strict veterinary examination, and only horses which are in good condition, strong, healthy, fit to work and not aged are permitted to be exported.  In addition, all vessels used for the shipment of horses must conform to prescribed conditions enforced by my Department with a view to protecting the animals against injury or unnecessary suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the foregoing requirements provide all practicable safeguards and were observed in regard to the shipment of 71 horses from Limerick to Birkenhead early in February.  I understand, however, that unusually severe weather was unexpectedly encountered in the course of the voyage (which took 72 hours, instead of 42 in the ordinary course) and that this was the cause of the casualties which occurred.  The master of the vessel has reported that none of the casualties received broken limbs or other external injury and that the <Col N="762" /> horses died from exhaustion due to the long voyage under the stress of storm.</P>
    <P>I may mention that, out of a total of 1,436 horses transported by the particular vessel involved from Limerick to Birkenhead from the beginning of August, 1949, to the end of January, 1951, there were only four casualties.</P>

The reports of the British House of Commons debate may be seen in the Library.  Will the Minister say that horses and other animals shipped from here are not subjected to this treatment?  These horses were being shipped to a British dealer and it was stated that this dealer had been engaged in this trade before and had been found guilty of atrocities himself.  In these circumstances will the Minister ensure that horses are slaughtered here under humane conditions instead of being shipped for slaughter elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to the Deputy for offering me this opportunity of saying, first of all, that I am quite sure my good friend, Mr. Tom Williams, British Minister of Agriculture, never used any language calculated to reflect on our Department of Agriculture or on any public servant of this State.  It may have been his duty to refer to allegations which were made for the purpose of announcing his intention of inquiring into them, but I am quite certain he never lent the responsibility of his name to the allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> I am also obliged to Deputies for giving me this opportunity of clearing the character of a high-principled and excellent master mariner who has been scandalously, shamefully and fraudulently misrepresented in this business. The master of this vessel took his ship to sea with every conceivable precaution that a good sea captain could use.  With your permission, Sir, I want to read his own report of what befell him.  All the horses were properly accommodated.  His report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The vessel left Limerick for Liverpool at 3.00 a.m. on the 4th February loaded with general cargo also 71 horses, 21 cattle and 39 goats. At the time of departure a strong southerly wind prevailed and on arrival off Beagh Castle (River Shannon) we anchored awaiting favourable weather.  At 9.00 a.m. the wind had moderated considerably and we proceeded towards Scattery, arriving there at 10.45 a.m. By this time the weather was calm and there was a blue sky and there was every indication of lasting fine weather.  The barometer, although low, started to rise.  Upon dropping our pilot I proceeded to sea.  On approaching Innishterragh Island (outer Blaskets) the wind suddenly became gusty and a heavy westerly swell increased.  Before we got abeam of Innishterragh there was a sudden heavy squall of rain and hail and the wind increased quickly to gale force with a high tumbling sea, and the visibility in the squalls was very poor.  In the circumstances in which I was so suddenly placed it was absolutely impossible for me to turn back or run for shelter, being placed on a lee-shore.  Our difficulty was to get the ship off the land and we had to steer a west course, bringing the wind and sea on the starboard bow to ease the heavy rolling and render as much comfort to the animals as possible in the heavy seaway. Between 6.00 p.m. on the Sunday until midnight several horses fell in the stalls but were eventually raised to their feet again.  Five horses during this period, however, <Col N="764" /> died from sheer exhaustion.  From midnight onwards, until we reached the Fastnet Rock Lt. at 7.00 p.m. on the Monday 13 horses had died from exhaustion.  These dead animals eventually were jettisoned in the Georges Channel.  Three horses also died on arrival at Woodside Stage.</P>
    <P>I must emphatically state that throughout the passage every care possible was taken by the officers and crew in attention to the live stock.  During the heavy gale all deck hands were in attention in the cattle deck.  The horses died from sheer exhaustion and casualties revealed no broken limbs or other external injuries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want, lastly, to say that I fully appreciate the solicitude of the Deputies and of others who have read this story, but I want to warn them not to let themselves be made unwittingly the agents of a dirty racket in this country and abroad who want to engage in a dirty rotten trade of slaughtering horses here and shipping horse meat to Europe as prime beef and, so long as I am Minister for Agriculture, they will not be let, no matter whether they get well intentioned people to believe that horses are habitually injured by sea transport or not.  If they are hoping to ship any &ldquo;Con Biadh&rdquo; to Europe, they are going to get a disappointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy is to encourage in every way possible the export of beef in carcass, canned and processed forms, and there has, in fact, <Col N="765" /> been a big expansion in such exports. Total exports of carcass beef and canned beef during the year 1950 were approximately 15,500 tons as compared with 8,500 tons approximately during the year 1949; 5,000 tons approximately during the year 1948, and 6,300 tons approximately in 1947.  Exports could be raised still higher if a reasonable price were paid for native hides which have at present to be sold at a mere fraction of the world price, but which under an arrangement with this Government inherited from its predecessors, are subsidising the boot, shoe and leather industry in the amount of over £1,000,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it is the Government's duty so to order their business that it will not be necessary to interfere with Private Deputies' time.  For the past three weeks the House has not met on Friday which would be the second day on which Deputies would have an opportunity <Col N="778" /> of discussing motions which they had tabled.  I think it is grossly unfair and something should be done so as to ensure that motions will be taken before they are completely out of date.</P>

    <P>This Vote on Account is a regular feature, of course, of the financial system.  As Deputies are no doubt aware it is required to enable the Supply Services to be carried on until the individual Estimates have been passed and the Appropriation Act has become law.  As Dáil Éireann usually completes the examination of the Estimates during the first four months of the financial year, it is the practice to provide only sufficient money in the Vote on Account to enable the public services to be carried on until the 31st July approximately.  This year the amount required is £29,375,120.  The items are set out on the White Paper already circulated and now reproduced on the Order Paper.  One-third approximately of the total net estimate for the year is asked for in most cases.  There are here and there some cases where more than one-third is required because expenditure is heaviest in the first four months of the financial year and others where it is less than one-third for the opposite reason.</P>
    <P>Because of the early date by which the Estimates Volume had to be circulated this year it was not possible to show the effect of the Supplementary and Additional Estimates that were taken into account in arriving at the 1950-51 figures.  In the remarks that follow comparisons are made with the original Estimates for 1950-51.</P>
    <P>The total of the net Estimates for 1951-52 is £83,036,048.  On the basis of the classification of the Estimates into capital services and other services, which was introduced last year, this sum may be split into £12,079,705 for capital services and £70,956,343 for other services.  This, in relation to the <Col N="783" /> original Estimates for 1950-51, represents a decrease of £37,225 on capital services and an increase of £4,946,040 on other services.</P>
    <P>The total amount proposed in the Estimates for capital services shows little change from the 1950-51 provision. Within that total, however, the main shifts in emphasis may be stated briefly as follows: Increases of £650,000 for housing, including Gaeltacht housing and housing for turf workers; £484,970 for forestry, including £193,000 for reserve stocks, and £201,000 for new buildings and reconstruction works, offset by the following decreases: £755,000 for agriculture; £530,000 for grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949; £130,000 for sanitary services works, and £104,700 for aviation and meteorological services.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that provision previously made via the Transition Development Fund is now the subject of special provision in the Vote for Local Government.  I would like, once again, to emphasise the fact that, for a full amount of capital outlay financed by borrowing, regard must be had not only to the capital services included in the Estimates Volume but also to direct issues from the Central Fund for advances to the Electricity Supply Board, the Local Loans Fund, etc., estimates of which appear in the White Paper of receipts and expenditure published prior to the Budget.</P>
    <P>Turning now from the capital to the other services, which show an increase of £4,946,040, I may mention that roughly £1.8 million is in respect of provision for reserve stocks.  The Estimates mainly responsible for the increase of £4.9 million are Posts and Telegraphs (£1,223,400, of which £806,600 is for reserve stocks); Defence (£1,100,160, including £159,800 for reserve stocks); Health (£618,500, including £200,000 for reserve stocks), and Industry and Commerce (£505,170).</P>
    <P>Particulars of reserve purchases (i.e., purchases in excess of 1951-52 requirements) included in the non-capital services are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In 1948-49, expenditure on the Supply Services amounted to £64,638,094. Deducting from this total the expenditure on items now regarded as capital services, the expenditure on non-capital services in 1948-49 amounted to £62,709,953.  The corresponding estimate for 1951-52 is £70,956,343.  If, for the sake of comparability, the provision for reserve stocks included in the latter figure is deducted (£1.8 million approximately), the difference between actual expenditure on non-capital services in 1948-49 and estimated expenditure on such services excluding reserve stocks in 1951-52 is approximately £6½ million. An examination of the figures shows that the increase has occurred mainly under two headings&mdash;social services including health and education.  Social and health services accounted for an expenditure of £12.5 million in 1948-49 and are estimated at £16.2 million for 1951-52&mdash;an increase of £3.7 million. The various educational services accounted for an expenditure of £7.5 million in 1948-49 and are estimated to require over £9.2 million in 1951-52&mdash; an increase of £1.7 million.  Between them these two groups of services are responsible for an increase of £5.4 million.  There has been an increase of £526,000 in the supplementary agricultural grant, of £144,000 in the Vote for Lands, £302,000 in the Vote for Defence, £182,000 in the External Affairs Vote and £168,000 in the provision for Civil Service pensions.  For the Civil Service as a whole, including manual and industrial workers, total remuneration has increased from £9.1 million in early 1948 to about £10.7 million at present.  The cost of goods purchased by Government Departments has also risen since 1948-49; the wholesale price index shows a rise of roughly 10 per cent.  Savings as against these increases have been made mainly in the better administration and handling of subsidies and food.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the <Col N="785" /> occasion of the Vote on Account gives a background to the Estimates for the year, isolating and emphasising by putting outside of the national accounts the further details required to present a true picture of them. That will come when the revenue side can be examined and exhibited, but a full presentation must be deferred for over two months.</P>
    <P>There are some general remarks on the economic situation which seem to me to be relevant and appropriate. Deputies have recently got the Tables of National Income and Expenditure for 1938 and 1944-50.  These were presented on 24th February, 1951.</P>

      <P>They were presented to the Oireachtas on 24th February. They have been the subject of discussion in the Press.  There was a certain analysis made, I think, this morning in the Press.  The point that I would like to direct attention to as being the pivot of any remarks that I want to make at this time will be found in one of the tables on page 4.  It will appear from that that there has been, this year, a surprisingly high deficit in the balance of payments.  The trade gap in 1950 was £87,000,000.  Exports paid for about 45 per cent. of the imports. With the aid of tourist income, emigrants' remittances, net income from investments and certain other invisible payments, the balance is still £30,000,000 on the wrong side.  The terms of trade in 1950 turned markedly against this country.  I will be giving details of that later.  It is estimated that an amount of at least £8,000,000 can be associated with the turn of the terms of trade against us. National capital home investment shows an increase in 1950 over 1949 of £6.5 million.  These two items between them would amount to £14.5 million of the relevant increase in connection with the £30,000,000 deficit in the balance of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some stocking up undoubtedly is being done at present, but it is not an easy matter to distinguish what has been done.  It is not at all an easy <Col N="786" /> matter to put a real figure on that. The best evidence before the statisticians at the moment would seem to show that it is not a very significant item in conjunction with the imports of 1950.  It is quite clear in certain other tables that are in the Table of National Income and Expenditure that there has been a very definite increase in consumption, particularly in the consumption of non-essential goods in the country.  Agricultural output is at pre-war level; industrial production has shown a marked increase, but notwithstanding this the total quantitative output of goods and services has not increased as much as consumption. The table in this particular volume will show that the increase in consumption is most marked in the case of goods other than goods that are described as essential.  I count food, clothing, fuel, light and rent as being in the essential class.  It would appear that the increase in the consumption of essential goods is put at 9 per cent., while the consumption of drink and tobacco has gone up by 16 per cent.  The consumption of other goods, as the phrase is used, has probably&mdash;it would certainly mean non-essential goods&mdash; increased by 32 per cent.  Taking these two tables together it would appear to be the case that the standard of consumption is being maintained by imports, such imports not being paid by current earnings or by current savings.</P>
    <P>The details of the situation will be known to Deputies, but there are one or two I should like to stress.  I said already that the lack of the balance which has figured in the 1950 accounts is partly the result of a rise in import prices and that rise is not yet matched by a corresponding increase in the return for exports.  The rise in import prices is to some extent the product of devaluation.  Certain delayed effects of that began to make their appearance in the early summer of 1950.  But, more particularly, the rise is due to rearmament and the scarcity which that caused.  Import prices in 1950 were on average 8.6 per cent. higher than in 1949.  On the other hand, export prices rose by only 5.2 per cent., thus, as I said, the balance of trade turned <Col N="787" /> seriously against this country in 1950 and the calculation has been made that, but for that, the trade deficit would have been £8,000,000 or so less. As a result of rearmament, imported raw materials and manufactured goods have become scarce as well as being dear.  The shortages have already made their appearance, but it is expected that these will become more acute.  It has, nevertheless, not been seen proper to impose any physical controls.  They might prove premature or, in the long run, if imposed now, unwise.  It is desirable that stocks should be laid in while they can be still got and before price increases occur.</P>
    <P>So far as external disinvestment is accompanied by stock increases there will be cause for satisfaction rather than concern.  The extent, however, to which this has taken place is not easy to ascertain and it has not, at any rate, yet explained the way any really significant fraction of the large deficit which is represented by increased provision for consumption rather than new domestic investment.  It is probable that there has been a general stocking up to some extent or at least some advance purchasing.  If imports continue scarcer and dearer, there will tend to be an automatic check on purchases. At the same time it is hoped that there will be an upward movement in export prices and that between these the tendency will help to redress the seriously unbalanced state of external trade.</P>
    <P>The developments in 1950 are, of course, disquieting and it is clear that we could not for very long expand consumption at the present excessive level without inflation in the limited sense of price increases.  Most of the blame can accordingly be put on external forces outside Government control.  If it is argued that increased purchasing power released by any State capital expenditure aggravates the inflationary situation, it can be granted that that is a danger which certainly exists.  On the other hand, the future prospects are so bleak that it might well prove to be wise and to have been wise, despite the risk and the cost involved, to push ahead as <Col N="788" /> long as materials are available with housing, drainage and other improvement works.  It will, I think, be accepted as better that our labour forces should be employed in works of this kind at home than that they should be emigrating to armament and other factories in England.  The risk of a further decline in the purchasing power of sterling holdings is also a factor to be considered.  Capital expenditure above and below the line, which amounted to £21.5 million in 1949-50 may run to the figure of £24,000,000 for 1950-51.  Even if the present rate of outlay does not show a large increase, the current Budget is being kept close to current expenditure and it includes provision for redeeming in 30 years the debt incurred for voted capital services.</P>
    <P>In the year 1950, the following favourable features of the economic situation can be remarked upon.  There has been an increase in industrial output and employment.  The volume of production in industries producing transportable goods in 1950 was 14 per cent., 15 per cent. and 12½ per cent. higher than in the corresponding three quarters of 1949.  The numbers in nonagricultural employment have increased by over 60,000 since 1946.  On that side, agricultural production is at the pre-war stage.  There is, however, an incipient improvement beyond what is shown by that already achieved by agriculture. Cattle prices are at the highest points they have reached for a century. There have been substantial increases in recent years in the prices of pigs, poultry and sheep.  Creamery butter production in 1950 was 42 per cent. greater than in 1947 and 7.3 per cent. higher than in 1949.  All over the country there is increased mechanisation in agriculture and in the last couple of years there has been an increased use of fertilisers, all of which should tend towards greater production in the immediate future.  The level of unemployment stands to-day at a lower point than it was pre-war.  In the pre-war period 15 per cent. of insured persons were unemployed.  The 1950 percentage was somewhere between 8 and 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have already remarked on the huge surplus of imports over exports in 1950 <Col N="789" /> and mentioned the difficulties presented by the turn of the terms of trade against us.  The volume of exports, however, increased much more rapidly than the volume of imports.  The volume of exports in 1950 was 36 per cent. higher than in 1948.  The corresponding increase in the volume of imports was only 12½ per cent.  I have remarked that, notwithstanding the change in volume, the value of the import excess in 1950 was actually greater than in 1948, due to the unfavourable price charges.  There is, we maintain, a very high level of invisible earnings, particularly from tourist receipts.  Just recently we have achieved a very desirable increase in exports to the dollar area, mainly in connection with chilled meat.  It will be regarded with satisfaction that there has been an unprecedented increase in the rate of capital outlay.  As one feature of that, I point to the fact that the number of new State-aided houses built in 1950 is nearly twice that built in 1949.</P>
    <P>The disturbing feature, of course, is the deficit in the balance of payments, particularly when that is marked by the great increase in consumption here, especially when that great increase in consumption is attached to the non-essential goods.  The continuance of such a situation for any period would be highly dangerous.  It would jeopardise the policy, popularly, I think, approved of, to repatriate sterling assets.  But repatriation of sterling assets is only of use if they are used solely or mainly for investment and development.  If the development policy must be continued, that policy can only be continued without danger if the savings of the community are increased.  They can be increased if people refrain from expenditure on non-essential goods.  There is a tremendous margin over what was spent in 1938.  There is plenty of slack to be gathered in.  That is the chief lesson to be learned from the economic trend of 1950.</P>

      <P>As the Minister rightly said, the House is concerned with pay out rather than taxation on this occasion.  We are dealing with expenditure, and the discussion should be of a general <Col N="790" /> character and should not anticipate the Estimates on which the details of administration are discussed.  The Parties generally give the Chair notice of the matters they intend to raise.  On this occasion Fianna Fáil intends, I understand, to raise financial and economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that a very small proportion of our imports is going for stocking up or for capital development.  Last year and for many years past the Government set its face resolutely against taking time by the forelock.  When we on this side of the House asked the Government to take such steps as might give our people reasonable security should the international situation tend to get worse we were denounced as warmongers.  No later than last July the Taoiseach himself denounced our warmongering when we asked that our economic and defence policies should be adapted to the situation at the time, a situation that was apparent to most intelligent people, but which only became apparent to the Taoiseach and his Cabinet last December when he went down to Waterford and said: &ldquo;In one aspect or another the spectre of war has been haunting the world since the present uneasy peace began.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years prior to the last war and since the war we advocated an intelligent use of all our resources to build up our production and our defence capacity.  When the present Minister for Finance and his friends were denouncing the steps we took to build houses and industries here prior to the war we defended those steps; we were fortunate enough in getting a large number of our own people to use their resources while we used Government and State resources generally to build houses and erect factories, develop bogs and other natural resources.  Since the war ended it has been difficult for Governments to get all the equipment we require for development.  In the year 1946-47 it was in many respects more difficult to procure essentials in the way of capital and machinery than it was during the war years.  During 1948 and 1949 the position improved.  Machinery and building equipment arrived and were <Col N="791" /> purchasable pretty freely.  From the middle of 1950 onwards the situation once more worsened.  I think the country has a legitimate complaint that the Government did not use the years 1948 and 1949 to make more progress in importing those things which the country requires for capital development.  I think the failure on the part of the Government was largely due to the fact that the Government did not want to face the expense involved from a purely Government point of view; not only that, but there were certain difficulties which prevented the Government making the desired progress during that time.  Sectional interests in the Coalition Government were pulling in opposite directions. The result was that the work was not carried out as it should have been carried out.</P>
    <P>To-day the Minister gave some facts and figures, a large number of them taken out of a document on national income and expenditure.  I have not yet received a copy of that document but I have made certain calculations for my own information in an effort to find out where the country stands in its financial affairs.  Since the year 1947-48, the last year for which Fianna Fáil was responsible, Government expenditure on ordinary housekeeping &mdash;that is supplies and services, the central fund, the payment of judges' salaries, interest and sinking fund on the national debt and so on&mdash;has increased by £28,000,000 per year. According to the Minister, the national debt will have increased at the end of this financial year by £54,000,000. Our dollar debt now stands at £41,000,000.  Our external assets have decreased by £60,000,000 over the years 1948, 1949 and 1950.</P>
    <P>What have we got for that vast increase in public, expenditure?  The Minister himself could claim no more last year than £6,000,000 increase in investments here.  Of that £6,000,000 increase I bet that not £1,500,000 was imported; most of it was from our own labour or from our own material.  So little use was made in these years of this increase in debt and this expenditure of our national resources that emigration is going up and up.  In the <Col N="792" /> last year of Fianna Fáil, 11,000 more people came into the country than went out of it and, in 1949, 18,000 more went out.  Notwithstanding the fact that there was this big increase in emigration, the number of people signing the unemployment register last November&mdash;the latest date for which I have the figure&mdash;was 56,000.  No one can claim that any progress that has been made in the last few years is worth the very big increase in our national debt, our international debt and the liquidation of our assets held abroad.</P>
    <P>This nation must regard its external assets in the same way as a citizen regards his personal investments outside his own house, or his savings in the bank.  We should spend our external assets with the same care as an individual would take in expending his personal assets.  If we are going to liquidate all our external assets as quickly as we can, there will come a time when we must meet our annual commitments out of annual earnings. The Minister used to speak as if our external assets should be got rid of as quickly as possible; they were burning our pockets.  I noticed this evening he spoke with slightly more discretion on that matter and advocated that, if we were going to realise our national savings abroad, we should take care to see that the fruit of that realisation was produced here in equivalent capital investment.</P>
    <P>There is no sign that the £60,000,000 that has been realised in the last three years plus the £41,000,000 that we have borrowed from the Americans, has in any way resulted in £100,000,000 worth of new capital development.  Far from it.  It may be, of course, that one should not include that debt completely when computing the decrease in our external assets but there is no real provision made for repayment of that debt, that I can see, and certainly the capital services for which the Minister proposes to borrow, shown in this Book of Estimates, will not yield one penny of either interest or sinking fund towards the liquidation of the American debt&mdash;not a single penny.</P>
    <P>The services outlined may be desirable in themselves but they are not money-earning services.  The <Col N="793" /> Minister will not get anything back from the housing grants or from the grants given to farmers for the improvement of their land.  He will get no interest from the money which is being spent on buildings for civil servants, and so on.  Therefore, the capital items which the Minister has outlined here, particularly in an inflationary situation such as he has outlined, with prices galloping up, should be met out of ordinary, normal, current income.  In an inflationary situation, capital development of this kind adds to the inflation.  Inflation is a general tax upon all members of the community.  It was very difficult to get the normal person to take any interest, last year, when we warned that the easy method which the Minister was adopting in order to raise the finance to meet Government expenditure would do more harm than good in the long run.  I pointed out last year, when the Minister first started this game, that an equivalent type of operation by the French Government resulted in a doubling of the French cost of living within 12 months.  The Minister's borrowing last year for services that, in an inflationary situation, properly, should be met out of taxation, or savings, definitely helped to create the situation that we have to-day, where prices are tending to go through the roof.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister faced up to his responsibilities.  It is very easy for him to fool a large number of the people, particularly when the claque of the Coalition gets working, and the papers that support them in the country, into the belief that we should pass on as much as possible to the future payment for everything we do. The £12,000,000 that the Minister borrowed last year, the projects outlined in the Supplies and Services Estimate, and the £12,000,000 odd which he proposes to borrow this year are for services not new in the history of this State.  In the last year that we were in office we raised £3,000,000 for the same purposes by the normal method of raising Government funds for current expenditure, that was, by taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> The Minister said last year that as an office built for a public Department would last for a number of years, and so on, it was proper to meet the expense incurred for that by borrowing and to push the payment on to future taxpayers.  If we carried that argument to its logical conclusion, not only could he borrow for buildings being erected currently, but he could borrow on all public buildings and lands erected or purchased by the State in the past, and have no taxation.</P>
    <P>This treatment of the £12,000,000 for supply services as capital, and proper to be met by borrowing, was merely a political dodge and it is a political dodge this year, to avoid any political unpopularity and to prevent any possibility of a rift in the Government camp through lack of support of the Minister's proposals for taxation.</P>
    <P>What has been the result of all the borrowing that the Government have done in these last few years&mdash;this extra £54,000,000?  The result has been that the amount to be provided for the payment of interest and sinking fund on the national debt is estimated by the Minister this year to be £6.3 million, whereas in the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government it amounted to £3.25 million.  That represents an increase of over £3,000,000 for interest and sinking fund charges alone in a period of three years.</P>
    <P>There were many boasts made by the various members of the Coalition before they became the Government.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce promised that he would put all the unemployed to work within 24 hours. But I think the greatest achievement of the Coalition Government was to double in three years the amount this State pays for interest and sinking fund; to add as much in three years as all other previous Governments did since the beginning, not only of the Republic, but of the Free State.  Three million pounds may be sneered at by the Minister's friends&mdash;this adding of £3,000,000 to the sum that must be met each year by the taxpayers&mdash;but it was not thought such a very small sum in the autumn of 1947 and in the early months of 1948 when the Minister and <Col N="795" /> all his friends were cantering around the country describing how crazy Fianna Fáil were and what extortioners they were to collect by means of beer duties, tobacco duties, entertainment tax and an increase in the income-tax, the sum of £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>All that fuss was made about £4,000,000 which was collected to be spent for one year to meet a crisis situation.  But the Minister calmly proposed last year&mdash;and he has continued his policy&mdash;to add £3,000,000 every three years, we take it.  The rate of progress is going on and it might even be more than an average of £1,000,000 a year, because in the last year it has gone up well over £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>Now we know that Government Deputies just laugh when we recall some of the promises they made to the people and compare them with the performance.  The other day I asked as a supplementary question, would the Government consider bringing in legislation or making proposals to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent., and the whole Labour Party and Clann na Talmhan and Fine Gael sneered and laughed; they almost broke their hearts laughing.  Yet the 30 per cent.  reduction promised by these people in 1948 had a great weight with the voters who were making up their minds what sort of candidates they should return to look after their interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister may feel very happy coming forward to-day with this bill for £83,000,000, to which must be added £10,000,000 this year for Central Fund expenditure, making a total of £93,000,000, not counting what is to be spent for the Electricity Supply Board or the Post Office or any other capital development.  The Minister may laugh and think he is in a very strong position out of which no criticism uttered by Fianna Fáil can shift him. That is true.  The Coalition Deputies, even though they may be disgusted at their performance and bitterly disappointed that the various members of the Government made no effort to live up to their promises, must now hang together, for as soon as the people get a chance they will hang separately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> Here we have £93,000,000 a year for normal housekeeping expenditure.  I will make the Minister a present of £1.8 million which he claims this year is going to be used for stocking up, although stocking up should be a normal feature of any Government Department.  Indeed, I do not think I will give the Minister that £1.8 million because the Government sold more stocks that were left by Fianna Fáil than would account for the £1.8 million, so I will keep them to the figure of £93,000,000 which he is going to spend on normal housekeeping expenses this year.  That amounts to £31 per head for every man, woman and child in the country.</P>
    <P>When we were spending at the rate of £21 per head and adding each year to our real capital assets instead of adding to the dead-weight national debt, as the present Government are doing, we were denounced by the present Minister; the £21 per head was described as a &ldquo;crazy burden,&rdquo; and &ldquo;unjust extortion,&rdquo; and they promised the people that if they were returned as the Government the expenditure would be reduced by £10,000,000 per year, or from £21 per head to £18 per head.  Instead of the £18 per head which they promised the people, they are now putting £31 per head on every man, woman and child, almost double the figure.  Of course, we can do nothing about that matter beyond pointing it out.  There are plenty of people who will think that the members of the Government are only being smart, being very clever, showing their capacity as slick lawyers when they can break their word to that extent.  Instead of reducing Government expenditure by £10,000,000, they drove it up by £28,000,000.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, any increases the Government have given in social services and salaries do not compensate the recipients at all for the increase in the cost of living caused by the inflationary policy pursued by the Government. I do not believe that the people of this country are getting value for their money.  Although the Government have abolished portion of the beer duty and of the tax on cigarettes, I do not believe the people are getting <Col N="797" /> value for the increased taxation imposed upon them by the Government. We are paying very much more for our petrol, as a result of the increased tax.  There is also a tax on white bread, sugar, tea and dancing.  Even the shot-gun licence and the .22 rifle licence had to go up.  There has been a big increase in the price of the postage stamp while the price of the national health insurance stamp was increased without any increase in benefit.  The Government have not only broken their word to the people in regard to the reduction of taxation by £10,000,000 and have not only failed to keep their promises, but very blatantly, they kept on laughing at the idea that anybody should think that the Coalition groups should keep their promises.  They did not tell the people when they were making these statements that it was a mere political game they were playing.  They made all sorts of solemn oaths and promises throughout the country that they meant what they said.</P>
    <P>I was interested in looking back on some old papers the other day because a certain very active member of the Coalition groups went into court and swore that he was in Stamullen on the 19th January, 1948, when, in fact, he was in Limerick.  I looked up what he was saying in Limerick on the very same day when he swore he was in Stamullen.  He prated about Fianna Fáil corruption on that day in Limerick. He spent most of his time in denouncing Fianna Fáil corruption, and he said to the people of Limerick: &ldquo;Fine Gael offers integrity and honesty; they will reduce squandermania&rdquo;. Squandermania at that time was the amount that we were spending each year.  We spent in the year 1947-48 £65,000,000 but instead of reducing the £65,000,000 to £55,000,000 they have driven it up to £93,000,000.  The leader of the Fine Gael Party at that time&mdash;I understand he is still leader in some queer way&mdash;was also speaking in Limerick.  I am referring to Deputy Mulcahy as he was then, the present Minister for Education.  He was complaining in Limerick on this famous 19th January, 1948: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil have taken more power over the people's purse by raising taxation by £17,000,000 <Col N="798" /> since the end of the war&rdquo;.  The present Government have not only continued to raise that £17,000,000, but have added £28,000,000 to it in a couple of years.  Then in his own inimitable, inscrutable type of language, the leader of Fine Gael went on to say that they were fighting in Fine Gael for what he called &ldquo;the strengthening of our Christian conception of human nature&rdquo;.  That fight for &ldquo;the strengthening of the Christian conception of human nature&rdquo; has cost us an extra £28,000,000 of squandermania, as his colleague Deputy Collins would call it.</P>
    <P>Now it is true that out of this £28,000,000 extra that the civil servants are getting 1.6, and that we have more civil servants at higher pay, but what are the people on the whole getting out of this expenditure because that is the final test?  What services are being provided?  To what extent has the position of our people been improved to sustain themselves in peace or war?  There has been some slight increase in industrial development, largely because the Government could not shut down on everything that was in train in the last years of Fianna Fáil.  They shut down as much as they could.  The Minister for Finance boasted of the money he was going to save on the shutting down of the Atlantic air services, and of mineral development; of the saving he was going to make, a few miserable thousands, on the Irish Place Names Commission.  Not only did they shut down, while spending all this increased money, on the developments I have mentioned, but they stayed turf development for almost three years.  In 1947 a scheme had been approved for the building of 2,000 houses for turf workers adjacent to the bogs, but it is only in the last couple of months the Government have announced that they were going to go ahead with that particular scheme.  Everybody knew that if we were going to make progress in house building, in cement road making, we wanted more cement.  Fianna Fáil had plans in train for the extension of our cement factories after the war, but one of the first things the Government did was to stop that development.  They kept the country on edge for a number of years.  You had each district competing <Col N="799" /> with the other as a site for a new cement factory.</P>
    <P>Last year, in order to stop this number of deputations to the Government, as well as letters demanding that an additional cement factory should be put up in one place or the other, the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced that the Government had, in fact, approved of the extension of the cement factories in Drogheda and Limerick, but we found out recently that that was another untruth and that the thing did not go ahead.  The Government stopped it, and that during those years when we should have been adding to our cement and other productive capacities.  During those years the Government were doing nothing in the matter.  In fact, some members of the Government were doing their utmost to stop any development.  Not only did they draw the red pencil through a number of projects which were under active consideration or were being put into train in the last years of Fianna Fáil, but in order, I suppose, to please the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Social Welfare, they set up a definite block against industrial development.  They set up this new industrial development commission or whatever it is called.  It was bad enough for an industrialist to have to look to get what help he could from the public authority and to get agreement from various Government Departments as to what facilities he should get, but the position became almost impossible for him when he found that he was being driven from Billy to Jack.  Not only was he being driven from Billy to Jack, but from Tom to Peter and from Peter to Harry, and to all the rest of them which have now being set up to yet new proposals for starting industry here.  The setting up of the Industrial Development Authority must have stopped, and put an end to for years, when some purchases could have been made, if there was a proper realisation of our external assets, of plant and machinery for the erection of factories here which would give us reasonable security in the supply of essential goods and commodities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> Indeed, not only did the Minister for Agriculture get his way in setting up that block to the development of Irish industry, but he seems to have made converts in strange quarters in the Coalition Government.  The Minister for External Affairs thinks the cure for all our ills is to set up particular industries to produce goods for export. The export of goods, as well as the export of agricultural products, is an excellent thing, but surely to goodness their first and main effort must be to produce, within our own shores, the things that we require in order to keep the life and soul in us in a time of crisis.  In a time of crisis our export trade might get very short shrift, while the imports we bought with our exports might also cease, but what would not cease, and what did not cease even in the crisis of the last war, was that portion of our industrial plant that was producing for the home market, and that was converting our own raw materials.  The drive during the last few years should have been the drive which was started by Fianna Fáil to develop our industries, both agriculture and town industries, and to produce out of our own resources as much as possible of the essentials of life which our people require.</P>
    <P>Not only did we fail in industry to take advantage of the times in 1948 and 1949, but in agriculture we have definitely set our back, in the last few years, to the idea that all sensible men would have for Irish agriculture, and that is to use our agricultural resources to produce for our people a reasonable supply of the essentials of life.  The exigencies of the formation of the Coalition necessitated the giving of a Ministry to Deputy Dillon, but, surely, he should have been given some other Ministry than the Ministry of Agriculture. During his three years he has succeeded in bringing down our total corn and root crops, including flax and fruit, by 546,000 acres, by over half a million acres.  He has succeeded in reducing our wheat crop by 217,000 acres, our oat crop by 140,000 acres, potatoes by 33,000 acres and flax by 7,700 odd acres.  These tillage crops have been reduced by 546,000 acres at a time during which, as the Taoiseach <Col N="801" /> said recently in Waterford, any person with an eye in his head could see that there was no real peace.  He said&mdash; what he said in Wexford has already been quoted&mdash;that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in one aspect or another the spectre of war has been haunting the world since the present uneasy peace began.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that spectre haunting the world, the Coalition not only did not take advantage of their opportunities to develop our industry, but they allowed the Minister for Agriculture to reduce the area under tillage by 546,000 acres. What are we doing, and what has been the alternative to keeping that tillage acreage that we had in 1947, and of adding to its productivity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot deny that during these three years the area under tillage was reduced by 546,000 acres.  One aspect of that is that, instead of the oats, wheat and potatoes which we could have produced here to feed ourselves and our families, we imported wheat at £31 per ton, and maize at £29 per ton.  Indeed, the situation was so bad that we were going to Prince Edward Island for potatoes.  We went to Holland first and then we went off to Prince Edward Island, and the only reason we did not get potatoes there was that the British would not give us the dollars. We also have the spectacle this year that we are getting butter from Denmark and New Zealand.  If that policy goes on, we do not know where we will be importing eggs from next year when the Minister for Agriculture wrings the necks of all the hens and <Col N="802" /> chickens in the country, as he is now advocating.</P>
      <P>We will take the question that the Minister is interested in, in which I am also interested, and in which everybody must be interested&mdash;what is the yield of these crops per acre, and how best can we increase production per acre?  It can be proved to the satisfaction of a normal person, if it is argued out in a reasonable way, that the Government have not used the opportunities they have had during the last three years to increase the yield per acre, the out put per acre.  Let us take the drainage of lands.  There was been great boasting about the £40,000,000 which was to be spent in ten years.  I see that it is now down to £2.5 million of which the farmers are getting about £500,000.  There was great boasting about the great capital development by the new scheme of agricultural drainage.  Does the Minister for Finance remember that in their first year of office they cut out the drainage scheme?  The Land Improvement Vote was cut out to save £500,000.  The Minister asked what about the improvement of the output per acre.  To save £500,000 in 1948-49 they abolished the expenditure under the Land Improvement Vote.  Under Fianna Fáil, it was being met out of taxation.  The Minister for Agriculture explained that they could not raise the money to drain the land; that if we could get Marshall Aid he would make it spin, and he is spinning it at the moment, the most of it on American machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item in relation to the output per acre was the subsidy for fertilisers which Fianna Fáil had in the 1948-49 Estimates, which the Minister also reduced.  Not only that, but there was under the agricultural Department a scheme for the widespread provision of line.  We did not go as far as Clann na Poblachta and advocate that lime and fertilisers should be given free to farmers.  But we did stand for doing all we could to make available all the resources the Government had to help the farmers to increase output per acre.  We provided fertiliser subsidies and lime subsidies, which the present Government have cut out, and we were <Col N="803" /> making available, as quickly as phosphatic and other manures could be got, the credits that were given to the farmers for the production of wheat. Over a number of years there was a credit of 2/6 per barrel given to the farmers for every barrel of wheat delivered to the mills.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in regard to these fertiliser credits?  The farmers could not cash them all in the last couple of years.  The Minister for Agriculture was telling the people about the need for more fertilisers and more lime on their land.  He spent a lot of State money advocating it.  But between the Minister for Finance and himself they kept back the purchase of these fertilisers by refusing to cash the wheat credit vouchers.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Coalition have become more interested in cattle than in the production of food for human beings.  The natural corollary of that has been that fewer people are now employed on the land as compared with the time when there was a reasonable amount of tillage in the country.  The Minister boasted this afternoon that we have the greatest number of cattle in the country since I do not know when&mdash;since the time of Brian Boru, as the Minister for Agriculture would say.  That may be true.  But the chickens are in danger of having their necks wrung, and all the Coalition Deputies who used to weep copious tears about the lovely little calves being slaughtered are now going to cheer when the necks of the lovely little chickens are being wrung.  You would never think that they would be so hard-hearted as to see the chickens' necks wrung, but they are going to wring their necks by the million.  Not only have all the Coalition Members who used to talk about the development of tillage stood idly by, as meek as mice, but they walked as tamely as trained monkeys through the division lobbies in support of that reduction of tillage.  They are also outbidding the Minister for Agriculture for the support of those who want to see nothing on our lands except cattle for John Bull.  Indeed, the Minister for External Affairs boasted to a representative of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i><Col N="804" /> of all the cattle we were producing for Britain and not only that, but boasted that we could get a better price on the Continent but that we would rather sell them to Britain.</P>
    <P>The craziest policy that members of the Coalition agreed to was that which they adopted when the Minister for Agriculture, and whoever else accompanied him, went to London to negotiate the cattle agreement in 1948. They agreed then, for the first time, to restrict the cattle exports of this country to countries other than Great Britain to 10 per cent. of the amount sent to Great Britain.  That was not the first time the British tried that on but that was definitely the first time that they succeeded.  Be it remembered that they did not succeed until Clann na Poblachta, Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan put their heads together to form a Government.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael took the tame Clann na Poblachta and Labour Parties for a ride to England in 1948 and they agreed there, for the first time, that in future we would not send more than 10 per cent. of our cattle to any country other than Great Britain. At the same time the British promised us 1,500,000 tons of coal per year.  They also promised to pay us for our eggs. The British have fallen down on both their promises.  I will deal with coal first.  This year, we have suffered a virtual fuel famine because of the refusal by the British to implement their promise.  With regard to meat, it was obvious for a number of years that a market could be developed in America.  If we were free at the moment we could sell very much more than 10 per cent. of our total meat exports to America alone, not to talk of trade with Western Germany, Holland, Belgium and the other European countries.  But we cannot do that.  We cannot sell our meat to America to get dollars to purchase American coal which we must buy because of the failure on the part of the British to implement their promise in 1948.  We must continue to sell our meat to Britain for pounds, and fish for the dollars.  We must borrow dollars to buy coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another part of that agreement dealt with eggs and egg prices.  When we left office the price the farmer was getting for his eggs on the farm was 3/- per dozen.  It is now 2/- per dozen.  The price of maize when we left office was £17 or £18 a ton.  It is now £30 a ton.  Even as late as 1949 the Minister for Agriculture promised the people that they would get all the maize they wanted at £20 per ton.  He promised the farmer's wife&mdash;you remember the dramatic gesture&mdash;that when she saw a chicken put its break through the shell she could say: &ldquo;If you are a pullet, I know every penny I will get for every egg you lay during your profitable period as a layer&rdquo;, and the price dropped from 3/- a dozen to 2/- per dozen, while the price of feeding-stuffs went up from £17 or £18 a ton to £30 a tone.  Not only did he <Col N="806" /> make those promises in relation to eggs, but he and the Taoiseach came back from London boasting about the magnificent agreement they had made and claiming that in future the farmers would have a sure, certain and profitable market for everything they produced. We were deafened with that, not only here, but from every platform and outside every church gate around the country: for the first time since Brian Boru the farmers were to have a sure, certain and profitable market for everything they could produce. The people who are producing eggs at 2/- a dozen instead of 3/- know now how much truth there was in that, as do the people who are producing flax. Undoubtedly, the grazing farmers are well satisfied and they think Clann na Poblachta and Fine Gael are lovely boys.</P>
    <P>I shall not discuss these matters further, since we will have other opportunities of debating the general financial policy of the Government.  I think the Government should remember that during the remainder of their existence as a Government, be it long or short, they must face up to the responsibilities of their situation.  They are in the saddle.  Nobody can put them out of office, but they will be held responsible by history because of the lack of preparedness of our people to face the very uncertain future.  Let the Cabinet learn to tell the truth. Let them tell the whole truth about our economic situation.  Let them not try to dodge their responsibilities.  Of what use was it for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come in here last December and tell us that there was no increase in the cost of living? Everybody knew that there was an increase but the Government were prepared to dodge that issue until there was such a howl here from both sides of the House that they were compelled to drop their stupid pretence.  In the same debate, we were told that there was no fuel crisis.  They did their utmost to create a fuel crisis because not only did the British fall down on their promises but our own Government was selling at a cut price the stocks of fuel which had been built up during the Fianna Fáil régime.  All <Col N="807" /> the Deputies, including the Deputies O'Higgins, were damning the coal in the Park as dirt.  The Government sold it at £3 5s. a ton up to the end of last November.  Then suddenly they discovered that it was not dirt.  The people are now paying £9 a ton and they soon will be paying £12 a ton for it.  But, of course, according to the Parliamentary Secretary and all the clique, there was no fuel crisis.  No effort had been made to develop our native resources of fuel.</P>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach was at the head of the people who were howling down anybody who asked that reasonable provision should be made for a very uncertain future, denouncing them as warmongers.  He stated on many occasions that the Government's policy was &ldquo;based on the hypothesis of continuing peace&rdquo;.  He shouted that from the first day he came in here as head of the Government until only a month ago when he went down to Wexford and said that all during this time&mdash;when the Government's policy had been based on the hypothesis of peace&mdash;&ldquo;it was clear to anybody that in one aspect or another, the spectre of war has been haunting the world since the present uneasy peace began.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach has great hind sight.  When the war in Korea broke out he could not deny that there was a situation that would have to be faced.  Unfortunately, we cannot do anything about a change of Government.  Neither can the people.  I hope that the Government in this year of crisis, will act up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This is now the end of February, in the year 1951, and the Minister for Agriculture has not asked one single farmer to grow one grain of wheat. Not one advertisement, not one speech, not one word, has issued from the Minister for Agriculture asking the farmers to grow wheat to feed our people.  I do not know how much money he has spent and how many million words he has spoken urging them to grow food for cattle.  I do not object to his urging our farmers to grow food for cattle, but I certainly think it is the height of treachery to our people that the Minister for Agriculture should be supported in the <Col N="808" /> year 1951 in his attitude of discouraging our farmers from growing wheat to feed our people.  I trust that some members of the Government will live up to their responsibilities and give a kick in the appropriate place to the Minister for Agriculture in regard to his wheat policy.</P>
    <P>This particular Book of Estimates is asking the people to face a heavy burden.  It is asking not only the present taxpayers to pay £71,000,000 or so, but it is asking the present taxpayers and all future taxpayers to subscribe towards the £12,000,000 which they propose to borrow and spend.  The people are entitled to get better service for the expenditure of this amount of money than they have been getting.  If the members of the present Government do not pull up their socks and give better service, I hope some Deputies on the Government Benches will waken them up or, if they do not do it, that the people by their demands, public and private, upon Deputies, will force them out of their present attitude of ignoring the real situation and will make them face up to their responsibility to do something which will protect and sustain our people in peace or war.</P>

      <P>It was customary each year on the Vote on Account to have a review of Government policy in so far as it affects the country and a statement from the Opposition of the respects in which they differ from that policy and suggestions for the better government of the country.  It was customary to have such a statement from the Opposition until the year 1948.  Then we had Deputy Aiken as the main spokesman of the Opposition on the Vote on Account.  I congratulate Deputy Aiken on his uniform mediocrity.  This year he has in no way changed his batting average in previous years.  Is Deputy Aiken's speech to-day to be taken by the people as Fianna Fáil's answer to this country's difficulties and as Fianna Fáil's policy for the better government of Ireland?  If that is the position, a very poor future lies before this country should Fianna Fáil ever again be charged with the responsibility of office, because Deputy Aiken, in his <Col N="809" /> speech to-day, has advanced no answer to the constructive proposals contained in the Vote on Account and the constructive proposals contained in the general policy of this Government. There was nothing but cheap sneers at people and personalities, at things of the past, and the argument which is the stock-in-trade of Deputy Aiken and every member of the front bench Opposition.  They find themselves devoid of policy, bankrupt of ideas, and armed with nothing but the venomous tongue of disappointed politicians. They prattle about turf.  They prattle about lack of confidence on the part of the people in this Government.  The thing is easy to say, but let them realise that they are the people who occupied these benches for a longer period than the period for which any Government in Western Europe was in office.  They are the people who had full and plenary opportunity to do for this country everything that the mind of man could conceive.  They are the people responsible for any weakness which we suffer from to-day in our economic well-being.  They are the people who are responsible for any of the difficulties which we face to-day in the event of a possible war.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken's speech might have been an excellent speech if we did not know Deputy Aiken.  Deputy Aiken's speech might have been a powerful speech if Deputy Aiken had not been a Minister in the Fianna Fáil Government. When we hear Deputy Aiken talking about a danger to the food supplies of Ireland, we have to scratch our heads to know on which of Deputy Aiken's cheeks his tongue may be, because Fianna Fáil made a religion of wheat but, like many people who prattle about religion, they forgot to practise it.  Wheat was their doctrine, their religion, the thing they stumped this country about.  We found when they left office that there was not storage space in Ireland for even a 12 months' supply of grain for our people. If they were serious about wheat, would we not have expected that in some of their 16 years they would have provided proper storage space?  The fact is that no real effort was made to carry out the Fianna Fáil policy&mdash;if it ever existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> They tried compulsion, they tried to apply the whip to the backs of the farmers, the whip that Deputy Cogan wants to see wielded again.  They tried to compel our farmers to grow wheat and there was no result.  We can say that the policy of this Government, as administered by our Minister for Agriculture, has had as great a success, at least, as the policy of the former Government in relation to wheat.  I come from a tillage area; I represent one in the Dáil.  I and every farmer Deputy in the House know well that the one trouble for those who grew wheat last harvest was the anxiety that they would not get their grain lifted away to the merchants. Every farmer who grew wheat last year knew well there was a run on the mills, that there was not sufficient storage to house the crop coming from the land, that every available bit of storage was brimful with grain and there was not storage available for another bushel.  That is a fact known to the people, to the farmers.  That being so, it is hard to be patient with caterwauling of Deputy Aiken when he talks about a danger of a shortage of wheat.  We produced as much wheat from Irish land&mdash;and by we I mean the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They produced as much wheat from the land as was ever produced by all the compulsion in which Deputy Aiken delighted.  Let the people test the results of that policy.  If letting the farmer run his own land, sow the crops that he believes his land is capable of producing at a profit, run his land according to his own desires and wishes and giving him an attractive price and a good market&mdash;if that policy produced results as great or greater than the fear of the law which Fianna Fáil delighted in, then surely we are entitled to say it is a better policy in a free Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, would back my view of <Col N="811" /> that policy at any time, in any election, before any electorate, and I have no hesitation or doubt as to the view of the ordinary man with regard to that policy.  I will say to anyone, to any camp follower of Fianna Fáil, that their view to-day is still the same as it was when Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture.  If they were ever returned to office they would practise their lack of trust in the people of Ireland just the same as they practised it before 1948.  If they were ever returned as a Government they would give our farmers no chance to run their land as they wish it to be run.  They would appoint the local big boss with the big stick, as Deputy Smith described it, and the farmers would have to run their land as they were told, irrespective of what their wishes might be.  It is well the people realise it.  It is well the people of Wicklow, Louth, Kerry and Donegal realise that the Fianna Fáil policy is just the same to-day as it was when they were removed, mercifully, by the will of the people from the cares and responsibility of office.</P>
    <P>Let me express my view with regard to this country's ability to feed itself. We are better off to-day than we were at any time under Fianna Fáil.  We have more feeding stuffs for our people to-day than we had at any time under Fianna Fáil and we are not scratching the land of Ireland as Fianna Fáil tried to make us scratch it.  We are expanding our agriculture.  We are increasing our people's ability to feed the bigger population in Ireland.  Our population has increased.  We have a bigger number of different kinds of live stock and we are not as dependent as we were under Fianna Fáil on imported feeding stuffs because in supporting this Government we do not merely prattle about things of this kind.  We practise what we preach and therein lies the difference between the Fianna Fáil approach to fundamental things relating to this country and ours.</P>
    <P>I think when next the people are asked to pass judgment on the policy of this Government and the record of its predecessors, they will have no hesitation in deciding that if the rightness of a policy is to be judged by results, <Col N="812" /> then this Government has been right all along the line.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken talked about many things here to-day.  I would only be putting on myself an onerous burden if I tried to chase each of the red herrings that Deputy Aiken produced here.  I found it hard to be patient when I heard him talking about turf.  I come from a turf constituency and I have no hesitation in stating now what I said in the General Election of 1948, that the turf produced and sent to the Phoenix Park was nothing but sheer dirt.  I hope Deputy Kissane got that.</P>

      <P>It was nothing but dirt, for this reason, that the conveyance of the turf produced from our bogs, to Dublin, was allowed to get into the hands of the get-rich-quick boyos who battened upon the producers and the consumers in the city.  The gentlemen, who were lucky enough to get a commission or a few lorries, operated from the bank to the Phoenix Park, and being paid by weight, knew the turf paid more when it was wet; they did not care twopence as to the quality of the particular commodity they brought in their lorries and put into the dumps in the Phoenix Park.  I have said this in one of the greatest turf-producing areas in Ireland, in Offaly, and I have said it to the primary producers themselves.  I have no hesitation in repeating it here in the Parliament of our country.  If the policy pursued in that particular period of our country's history represented a policy with regard to turf production then God preserve us, and the people who produce turf, from a similar policy in the months that lie ahead.  It is a bit difficult for people living in turf areas to swallow the assertion that the gentlemen who permitted that to take place were those who dearly loved turf because no enemy of turf production could have done as much harm as those responsible for policy in that particular period did to the turf industry. <Col N="813" /> Those who permitted it were very much to blame.  The years from 1940 to 1947 while they had their drawbacks and difficulties for Ireland, presented an opportunity which even the practice of the teachings of Arthur Griffith could not have given to those engaged in the turf industry&mdash;the opportunity to produce and sell turf to the people in the towns and cities, not as an emergency substitute for coal but as a real Irish fuel.</P>
      <P>It was not too much to expect in 1941 or 1942 that the turf produced in Clonsast, Tirraun, Boora and many of the other great bogs in Ireland would have been a welcome fuel in the hearths of Dublin homes.  The fact that seven years later the bellman who hawked turf around the poor parts of the city did so in fear of his life, raises the question as to what sort of mismanagement caused that deplorable situation.  Believe me, the people from the turf areas have not been codded or fooled.  They know well where the responsibility lies.  They know well that those who, with abandoned recklessness, permitted the spoliation of the turf industry for the seven years of the war, have that on their consciences and will never be forgiven by the people from the bogs of Ireland.  In face of that, is it not a bit too much, when Deputy Aiken, in an unctuous speech here, suggests that this Government was to be congratulated in adopting the turf policy of Fianna Fáil?  God between us and all harm, I would cease to be a member of Fine Gael if I thought that were to be the position.  I would no longer support this Government or any Government that endeavoured to put into operation the policy of Fianna Fáil in relation to turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might paraphrase the statement of the Tánaiste, in announcing the plans for the new turf production scheme, he made it clear that the purpose was to produce turf, not occasionally excellent but consistently good.  That that was the purpose and the aim of the new drive, marks its complete difference from what Fianna Fáil called a policy.  Their attitude to turf production was just like the conduct of some megalomaniac.  They did <Col N="814" /> not care what damage they did.  I sincerely hope that the turf produced in the next few months at Boora, Tirraun, Clonsast and on all the other great bogs of this country will be produced with the knowledge that the producers are given within a decade a second great opportunity to make turf the basic Irish fuel, and that they can avail of it by producing only the best at a fair price, quite differently from those who battened on them and on the people of Dublin, Cork and Limerick in the early days of 1940 and 1941. They should cut out middlemen and, with lorries still available, supply direct from the bogs to the markets. I think if that is done we shall find a real move made to further the interests of turf production as a permanent industry here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Tánaiste or whatever member of the Government is in charge of turf production that I sincerely hope we shall have fewer agents and sub-agents parading with tickets around the bogs, directing those who produce the turf as to where it is to be sent and putting into their own pockets a commission of a few shillings per ton on the turf produced in these bogs&mdash;turf production which these people never see.  I hope we shall not find, as we saw in the past, a townsman who never got his boots soiled on a bog appointed a local agent for turf production.  I hope that producers of turf in every bog in the country will band themselves into co-operative societies in an endeavour to provide their own means of transport and their own negotiating machinery so that they will be brought into direct contact with the consumer.  If that is done&mdash;Deputy Briscoe seems to sneer at it&mdash;the people of County Dublin would not have to foot the bill they had to pay in relation to Grangegorman not so long ago.  The board in Grangegorman, if they had any sense, would not have refused that very fair offer from the County of Offaly which was produced by a hand-won turf organisation. The opportunity is there, and I sincerely hope it will be availed of now.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a real effort is now being made to prevent the abuses which Fianna Fáil called a policy in <Col N="815" /> the days before they were booted from office, because those who live in the bogs and produce turf in the Midlands. in the South and West of this country, cannot afford another period such as that which Fianna Fáil visited upon them.  Now I do not want, although I am sorely tempted by what Deputy Aiken has said, to reopen the old question as to who stopped turf production. It is now generally accepted by the people of the country that it was Deputy Lemass, with his English coal, who stopped that in October, 1947, but let what is past be past.  We have to consider the future now, and I wish all speed to the new turf production programme. I hope it will be availed of by the primary producers right through the country to make turf popular this time by preventing abuses, by cutting out the middleman and by producing the best turf at a fair price.  If they do that, therein will lie the difference between the &ldquo;new look&rdquo; and what was practised by our predecessors when they were in office.</P>
    <P>We had the usual sort of talk from Deputy Aiken about taxation and about the imminent approach of war. I think it is true to say that, ever since the day, for the second time in his life, when Deputy de Valera found himself the Leader of the Opposition in this House, the noise and the rattle of war was just around the corner.  In the spring of 1948 the catastrophe was just upon us, and no one could doubt that, certainly, by the summer of 1948, we would find war again upon the world, with ruin and desolation upon our country. That lurid picture was painted as a bit of political propaganda by the unseated mighty who found themselves dispossessed persons in Ireland. Right through the spring of 1949 and the summer of that year the same plaintive cry was wailed upon this country by the Fianna Fáil Opposition. War did not come, nor did it come in 1950, nor has it come yet.  I do not say that it will not come to-morrow.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>But my guess <Col N="816" /> is as good as the guess of Deputy Little, Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Eamon de Valera or of anybody else.  I should like to know this as a taxpayer and as an ordinary citizen of this country: what would I think of a Government which believed that phoney kind of propaganda three years ago and corralled into Irish barracks young men who could be producing in new factories and on the land of the country, and by building up an army and maintaining it for three years endeavoured to run the economy of the country on a war basis?  I say anyone who suggested that was the right course for Ireland was not only wrong but very wrong indeed.  In the last three years, this Government has realised that you do not make a country strong by parading men around in uniform.  The only way to make the country strong is by using the things which the country possesses, by endeavouring to produce more and more from our land and from our factories, by increasing our economic strength so that we can best ensure, in the event of any future economic blizzard, that we are stronger than we were in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the people of this country, if they are asked to decide, and I hope they may be, will decide that a Government which, despite the cries of panic and the caterwauling of the Opposition, consistently built up over three years our various industries by giving more employment to our people and by providing better houses for our people, as well as by increasing production from our own resources, was serving the nation better than a Government which would have blistered the country with taxation and corralled into barracks our youth who could be producing the things the country required. I think it is consoling for the country to know, in relation to the present state of Ireland, that on all points of importance to this country we are stronger now than ever we were under Fianna Fáil.  Our economic strength is far greater.  In industry we are employing more people and producing and exporting more goods than we did at any other time in this country's history.  In agriculture we are producing more from the land and <Col N="817" /> employing more on the land&mdash;I hope Deputy Cogan will take note of that&mdash; than ever before in this country's recent history.  Anyone who takes any interest in these matters is aware that we have to-day far greater stocks of essential raw materials than we ever had before.  Generally, from the point of view of our economic position, Ireland to-day is a far stronger country than she ever was.  Even in regard to the men in the Defence Forces our people will appreciate that we are some eight times better prepared than we were when Fianna Fáil were supposed to be preparing us for war in 1939.</P>
    <P>When we hear talk such as we heard from Deputy Aiken with regard to the danger of war and this country's position in relation to it, we must see what the facts are.  If we do that, we will find that this country, under this Government, is better prepared than it was in a similar dangerous period prior to the last war.  If we, a small country, are going for the rest of our career as a nation to be blighted by fear of war and to shape our economic policy on that basis, afraid to breathe for fear of a bomb, then we are going to perish as a nation.</P>
    <P>The only way we can survive any such possible difficulties is to shape our policy in accordance with our own economic resources and to go our way as a nation so far as we can irrespective of what happens outside.  But, if we are going to do everything we do with one eye on the people living at home and the other on Joe Stalin, then we are going to get nowhere.  We have had far too much of this kind of sob stuff about war.  War has not come and, please God, it will never come.  We can at least take satisfaction from the fact that the last three years have been given to us and have been well used by the people under the direction of this Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what Deputy Aiken said about wheat.  He talked about tillage and then discussed the production of feeding stuffs at home.  I should like to know from him what is wrong with this Government's policy in that connection.  Is there anything wrong with producing more in the way of animal feeding <Col N="818" /> stuffs at home?  Is there anything wrong in increasing the number of live stock, if we can?  Is there anything wrong with the late Patrick Hogan's policy, &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough&rdquo;?  If there is nothing wrong with that policy, the Deputy will find that that policy is being put into operation at present.  The Minister for Agriculture has stated that he is hoping the farmers will produce this year enough feeding stuffs to provide fodder for the increased live stock which we now have in this country.  I want to know what is the reason for Deputy Aiken's sneers in that connection. Does he think it is a wrong policy and, if so, in what way is it wrong?  When Deputy Aiken's Government were in power, they were content to have our farmers dependent on imported maize and feeding stuffs from abroad.  If these feeding stuffs were not there, then they were content to have this country reduce its live stock and destroy its pig industry.</P>
    <P>When this matter is commented upon by spokesmen for the Opposition the country is entitled to know from the Opposition in what way that policy is wrong.  I do not see what possible criticism even the most optimistic Fianna Fáil propagandist can find of a policy which aims at producing more in the way of feeding stuffs from the land, thereby increasing tillage, thereby maintaining a greater live stock population and thereby maintaining greater employment on the land.  Of course, Deputy Aiken says, &ldquo;That is all very well, but what about wheat?&rdquo; I do not know whether that is Deputy Aiken's real criticism of the agricultural policy in relation to tillage.  While I think that, once the price of barley and other crops has been increased and made more attractive, a very strong case is thereby made for an increase in the price of wheat, I cannot understand why, for that reason alone, the production of animal feeding stuffs here should be sneered at in the way in which it has been sneered at by Deputy Aiken.  I hope that the price of wheat will be further increased.  If it were increased, it would be merely consistent with the practice and the <Col N="819" /> policy of this Government to encourage farmers to produce the crop which pays them rather than the crop which does not pay.  But, with that one possible criticism, that the better prices to be obtained for the production of other crops now justifies an increase in the price of wheat, I cannot see why there should be any sneers because of what the Minister for Agriculture has appealed to Irish farmers to do in the coming spring.  I do not think any real importance can be attached to Deputy Aiken's complaint, a complaint we heard earlier from Deputy Cogan, that something terrible will happen to our wheat acreage simply because wheat was not mentioned in the Department of Agriculture advertisement relating to crops.  In point of fact wheat was mentioned.  In point of fact the appeal made was that, in addition to wheat and beet, farmers should now go in in a big way because of the enhanced prices for greater production of the crops necessary for our live stock industry.  What is wrong in that?</P>
    <P>Surely it is the ideal agricultural economy to feed our live stock from the efforts of our tillage farmers and produce as far as we can enough food for our own people.  Irrespective of anything that may have happened in the past and irrespective of any complaints that may be exchanged across the floor of this House, what is wrong with that agricultural policy?  That is the policy at present in operation.  If there is anything wrong in it, where is the use in all these sneers from Deputy Aiken?  We know that it is well-nigh impossible for Deputy Aiken to make a speech without a sneer after every comma, but I would expect a more reasonable approach to this important feature of our economic life from some members of the Opposition.  Our agricultural policy must be carried out by the farmers.  It cannot be carried out by Civic Guards, shopkeepers or anyone else.  Now our farmers have their political affiliations and their political loyalties.  Some of them even still support Fianna Fáil.  The bulk of them support the inter-Party Government. Because of the persistent sneers <Col N="820" /> by the Opposition at the Minister for Agriculture some deluded souls, still so bankrupt of thought as to support Fianna Fáil, may think that that agricultural policy is wrong and may refuse to put it into operation.  In that way a disservice will be done to the country as a whole.  If the Opposition thinks the policy is a bad one, they are quite entitled to say so; but I know that they do not regard the present policy as a bad one.  They know it is a good policy.  Why do they not then prevail upon their few supporters in the country to support that policy by growing more food without compulsion and without the threat of legal sanctions?  I think that is the minimum the country is entitled to expect from the Opposition.  If they believe a policy is harmful they are quite entitled to do all in their power to prevent its being implemented.  I believe they have no fault to find with the present policy and that they should therefore do all they can to ensure support for that policy generally since the success of that policy is tied up with improving the country's economic strength to meet any future economic difficulties that may arise.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Opposition, relieved of the cares of office, have selected different targets from time to time on the Government Benches.  Different Ministers have been attacked.  It is the policy of the Opposition to select a particular Minister and pour upon him the concentrated venom of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Possibly some temporary success may have attended their efforts but the debit side shows a heavier loss because they have only succeeded in &ldquo;making&rdquo; many of these men.  Their principal target is the present Minister for Agriculture.  I think his policy has been completely justified by results.  I think it is perfectly obvious that the Fianna Fáil Party have now no alternative policy to put before the country. Everything the Government proposes is, according to them, wrong.  How rarely do we hear from them what is the right course to follow.  How rarely do we hear from them any constructive criticism of the difficulties which face the country.  We get, as we got from Deputy Dr. Ryan in last Monday's <i>Irish Press</i>, only old stories about old <Col N="821" /> forgotten quarrels and difficulties.  They make no effort to face up to the requirements of Ireland in 1951, and when they say this Government is wrong &mdash; as they are entitled to say &mdash; they do not tell the country, as is their bounden duty, what better policy should be applied in relation to agriculture, in relation to industry generally, in relation to economic difficulties.  Their only contribution is &ldquo;your policy is wrong.&rdquo; When will we get from them in a debate such as this a statement of their policy with regard to the ills and difficulties of this country?</P>
    <P>As I said when I commenced my speech, this debate used to be availed of by the Opposition spokesman to state his policy and the policy of his Party to meet the country's difficulties and problems in connection with the review of Government policy.  We do not get that from the present Opposition.  We are driven to the conclusion that they have no constructive policy to offer the country.  They talk about an election.  Whenever an election takes place, the people will have a free opportunity to decide what sort of Government they want.  Let Fianna Fáil make no mistake about this: they will not slide back into office by default.</P>

If they think seriously of ever being the Government here, they had better put pen to paper and, if there are any wise men in the Party, such as Deputy McGrath, they had better shape out a policy because the only way that they will instil confidence in themselves or their Party in the people of this country is by putting before them a better policy than the policy being pursued by the present Government. It might have been different if Fianna Fáil were a new Party.  It might have been different if they had never been in office.  We know, the people know, that the leopard does not change his spots, and the boyos who blistered this country for 16 years are still the same except that they cannot put <Col N="822" />&ldquo;Minister&rdquo; before their names.

      <P>I once heard it said that it was better to be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and leave no doubt.  It would have been far better for Deputy O'Higgins to have stopped speaking, say, half an hour ago.  In the last half-hour, he left himself open to a lot of answers with which he will not be very pleased.  The Deputy was in this House for only five minutes of Deputy Aiken's speech.  He tried to put across, for the verbatim report, or probably for the purpose of newspaper reports, the idea that he had been staunchly sitting here listening to Deputy Aiken discussing the Vote on Account in relation to Government policy and Government administration and that he was now giving him the works.  I am putting on record now that Deputy O'Higgins was the one member of Fine Gael who was in the House for five minutes of Deputy Aiken's speech and that there was nobody else of the Fine Gael Party on the benches opposite throughout the whole of his speech except one Minister.  That is the test of the sincerity and earnestness with which some Deputies approach this particular matter at this particular moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, in the last part of his speech&mdash;I will deal with the earlier part later on&mdash;said&mdash;I do not know what we have done to deserve such a charge&mdash;that it is Fianna Fáil who have really made the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.

      <Col N="823" /> Deputy O'Higgins said that he wants to hear on this Vote on Account, not our criticism of Government policy, but our policy.  Here is a Deputy of some years' standing, who comes into the House on an occasion such as this and expects us, at his behest, to break all the rules of order and discuss Fianna Fáil electioneering policy.  Surely the Deputy is not serious in that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy used certain phrases in reference to Deputy Aiken.  It comes very strangely from an O'Higgins to accuse anybody of possessing a venomous tongue.  I leave it to the House to judge as to who in this House possesses the most venomous tongue or the more venomous tongue.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said, correctly, that Fianna Fáil were in office for 16 years, that they were longer in office than any Government in Western Europe. He went on to say that all the difficulties we are now facing are due to their 16 years' administration.  Surely he ought to know that in those 16 years there was a number of elections and that the people returned that particular Government on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>Now he says their Party will not make a religion of wheat.  We apparently are making it, and he seems to think that the position with regard to wheat is better to-day than it ever was under the Fianna Fáil administration. He forgets that the idea of growing wheat here, the idea of attempting to make this country as self-sufficient as possible in the growing of wheat, was one of the main items of Fianna Fáil policy.  I hope the Deputy will admit, when it comes to a question of policy as regards wheat, that one of the items of our policy was wheat growing.  Does the Deputy realise that we are paying the native wheat grower approximately £25 a ton for his wheat and we are importing wheat and paying £31 a ton for it?  Does the Deputy think it is a good policy to deny your own people a world market price for what they produce and pay that world market price to somebody who is not within the control of this State?  Is that good policy?</P>

      <P>When we took over, this country was importing practically <Col N="825" /> all of its flour and one of the things Fianna Fáil did as a first step was to see that the milling of wheat would take place in Ireland.  We prohibited the importation of flour and forced the millers to produce our own flour.  That was the first step towards self-sufficiency. We then went on to the growing of wheat.  Subject to correction &mdash; I leave it to other members of the House, because I do not claim to be an expert on agriculture &mdash; I think that when we took over office we were not growing in excess of 50,000 acres of wheat.  When we developed wheat growing as one of the essential items of our policy, we brought the production of wheat up to hundreds of thousands of acres, and it was our intention &mdash; and it still is our intention when we resume office &mdash; to increase that production.  I say quite deliberately that the moment the gentlemen over there give the people of the country an opportunity to choose again, we will resume office and we will put into effect a continuation of our wheat policy.  I say that, not as a boast, nor do I say it as a challenge.  I merely say that I am satisfied as an ordinary, average, intelligent human being and as a member of this House with the contacts I have with different types of people, not only in the City of Dublin but throughout the country, that we will surely be resuming office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy was talking about wheat. He has not told the House that at this moment there is a quantity of 50,000 tons of wheat on the way from Australia to this country, the freight on which alone is 160/- where previously it was 65/-.  Why is that? The Deputy should tell the House, as I am, that the position of the world to-day is rather serious and we have been informed, whether officially or otherwise, that with the development in America of a policy of priorities we will be soon precluded as a country from any share in certain cereals. Already, I believe &mdash; and I say this again subject to correction &mdash; it is now known that as far as a maize supply is concerned we are cut off.  The Deputy spoke about growing wheat and the growing of foodstuffs for our animals. He said: &ldquo;Is it not a good thing to grow all the foodstuffs you require for <Col N="826" /> your animals?&rdquo; Am I to take it that maize was imported for human consumption, because if, according to the Deputy, we are growing all our animal foodstuffs, what was the purpose of bringing in maize? I have yet to be told that we are eating it &mdash; unless it is stored for an eventuality where we may have to eat it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy used very nice phrases, but some of them can be very cutting. He talked about the prattle on this side of the House and the lack of practice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (6) of Section 35 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, is hereby repealed and in lieu thereof it is enacted that every county registrar shall retire on attaining the age of 70 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment to deal with the question of the retiring age of county registrars.  The position at present is that county registrars retire at the age of 65, subject to the fact that the Minister has power to extend their years of service until they reach the age of 70.  I do not know what the Minister's views may be with regard to this matter but I think in relation to county registrars, and to the occupants of other offices also, this power of doling out extensions is very invidious, not merely for the county registrar but also for the Minister for the time being.  It is not the right way of conducting public offices.  You have the Minister put in the position of having to consider whether the service of a particular registrar is to be extended after the age of 65.  I do not intend to delay the House on this amendment but I should like to bring these matters to the notice of the House.  The county registrar at present is not, after all, a civil servant. He is there for the purpose of organising and arranging the business of the court.  His position is rather similar to that of the Master of the High Court or the different taxing masters of the High Court.  Their duties are very similar and all these officers retire at the age of 70.  I would therefore urge that the retiring age of 70, that is already contemplated, since there is power to extend to 70, should be the statutory retiring age for county registrars.  I think that if that were decided by the House it would be more consistent with the settled practice in connection with the holders of similar offices in the High Court and the Taxing Office.  It would also end a practice which I think is objectionable <Col N="829" /> in principle, that it is left in the power of the Minister to extend for a period of five years the service of these officers after they have reached the age of 65.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised to hear Deputy O'Higgins objecting to what he calls this doling out principle because unless I am mistaken, he supported a Bill brought in by the Minister about a year ago doling out extra years to district justices thereby reversing a decision of the whole House here when I brought in a Bill restricting the age to 65.  I know the practice in regard to county registrars and I am quite prepared to agree that it is not a good one, but the present Government has brought in a Bill to continue that practice in the case of district justices.  The very least we might expect from the Government is some consistency in a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember at the time when we had a Bill before the House, the Labour Party, in particular, was very keen in regard to the principle of retiring public servants at 65.  When speaking on this Bill before I threw out the suggestion that as the expectation of life has gone up, there is possibly a case for extending the retiring age in the case of civil servants also to 70, but only last year, not quite six months ago, although it was the practice up to then that a Land Commissioner should hold office up to the age of 72, by the same tenure as a Circuit Court judge, the age was reduced to 65.  That drives me to the conclusion that there is something besides the mere question of principle involved in this amendment, that we are simply legislating for some personal reason. It looks very much like it.  There may be some few particular people whom the Minister has in mind.  I do not think that is a good line for the Government to adopt.  They should have some consistent policy in this matter.  I myself know civil servants who retired at the age of 65 and some of them have got two jobs at present. If civil servants who are quite capable of carrying on their work have to retire at 65, I do not see how the Government want to legislate to extend the retiring <Col N="830" /> age in the case of certain other officials beyond 65.</P>

I have not got used to the other thing yet and I do not know what the Minister's attitude is.  That naturally was a trap into which I fell.  If the Minister did not move this amendment one of his principal supporters did and, if it is carried, the Government will have to implement it.  I do think there should be some consistency in the matter especially in view of the fact that the Government have brought a Bill, in one case in favour of the doling system to which Deputy O'Higgins referred. That was the case of the district justice.  It is only from year to year that this can be done in the case of district justices, and the very same practice has obtained in the case of county registrars.  On the other hand, when the Land Bill was passed, we reduced the retiring age of Land Commissioners from 72 to 65.  Surely that is not consistent.</P>

If the Government accept this amendment they at least should consider applying it in cases of civil servants who are in good health and are capable of carrying on.  They should consider whether it should not be applied to civil servants also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins for slightly different reasons from those envisaged by the Deputy himself.  I think I said on the occasion of the introduction of the legislation which was referred <Col N="831" /> to by Deputy Boland, legislation in connection with district justices, that I objected to the principle of an extension from year to year.  I suggested that a fixed date should be settled on, and that it should be left at that.  I am sure, however, that Deputy Boland will agree with me that county registrars are in a slightly different category, because they are not recruited in the same way as civil servants. In the main, they are not recruited at the early age of civil servants. I should like to address Deputy Boland's mind to the real situation which arises in the case of county registrars.  In the main, they are men of considerable experience.  Usually, they have reached the age of 40 to 45 before they are appointed to what is a semi-judicial office.  That is a particular facet of their case which I would like to press on the Minister.  When they assume office they take upon themselves many activities which are on a parallel, as Deputy O'Higgins himself has suggested, with those discharged by a taxing master or the Master of the High Court.  That is because they have these kind of problems to deal with.  I would urge on the Minister that he should fix the retiring age in this case at 70.  If he does, it will be consistent with the retiring age of Circuit Court judges, and with that odious piece of legislation which allows the retiring age of a district justice to be extended.</P>
      <P>I feel that, in the case of this particular appointment, there is justification for the age limit being higher than the normal retiring age of a civil servant because, as I have said, the age of intake is completely different. The county registrar is the principal officer of the Circuit Court judge. Therefore, I think we ought to be consistent and make his retiring age 70.  I have as deep seated an objection as Deputy Boland has to the making of any man a mendicant for an extension year after year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recollect that, on that occasion, I endeavoured to fix a year for retirement, and not to have this system of <Col N="832" /> extension year after year.  I think we should establish the principle of 70 years for judicial or semi-judicial appointments.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Boland that it is not a pleasant system to have whereby a man has to plead, or show cause, for an extension year after year.  I suggest that we should fix a final date on which a man would have to retire.</P>

      <P>I will consider anything which any Deputy in this House puts up to me, whether it be Deputy Boland or Deputy O'Higgins. It is very important that, on anything like this, Deputies would use their rights to put down amendments.  Even though that may not be the custom with other Parties, Deputy O'Higgins, who is supporting the Government, has exercised his constitutional right in this case to put down this amendment. There has been a case made for <Col N="833" /> the amendment both inside and outside the House.  I have no interest in it except one, and that is that I think it is very unfair, at the moment, that the Minister for Justice is authorised, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to give an extension to a man from year to year.  On the District Court Bill, I pointed out that that was the existing situation then. In the case of the district justices I argue that I thought it would not be a new departure to do it.  When I was arguing that you would do for the district justices what is being done under this, it was said that it was a new departure, and that it was contrary to all precedent to do such a thing.  I think the Opposition was hardly fair.  They challenged us for not doing it for one individual.  I do not think that was fair.  I have no objection to the Opposition using that argument.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment in the circumstances.  I will have it examined and see what I can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister himself is in agreement with the amendment but, for some reason, he has not been fully frank with the House, and says he cannot accept it. That would appear to show a weakness in the form of Government of which he is a member, and that some members of the Government are not inclined to extend the age of retirement generally in the Civil Service to 70.  As Deputy Boland pointed out, it is time we came to a hard-and-fast rule with regard to the retiring age in the Civil Service generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers have pointed out, it is not a pleasant job for a Minister to grant an extra year's service between 65 and 70.  The retiring age of a Circuit Court judge is 70 years.  His job, if anything, is more exacting and takes more toll of a man's expectation of life than the job of a county <Col N="834" /> registrar, even though the county registrar is a man with different titles and degrees.  He is registrar of titles, registration officer for franchise purposes, taxing master and probate officer.  If I had time to think of it, I am sure I could find a few other jobs that he has to do.  Therefore, even though he is not appointed at as early an age as the average civil servant, after a certain number of years he becomes a highly qualified man in his own particular branch of administration. I think it is desirable therefore in the public interest generally that the services of a man of his capabilities and experience should not be dispensed with at the comparatively early age of 65.  It has also been pointed out that, owing no doubt to the health policies of the two preceding Governments, the expectation of life has increased considerably. I think most insurance companies will admit that readily at the present time.  Therefore, it is generally accepted that a man of 70 now is as good as a man of 65 was 15 or 20 years ago &mdash; certainly from the point of view of mental capacity.</P>
    <P>There is another argument in favour of an extension of the age limit for a county registrar when it is compared with that of a judge from the point of view of duties.  The county registrar has not to sit on the Bench, as the judge has, day in day out and come to quick decisions.  He can take his time in his office.  I suggest, therefore, that his expectation of life is thereby extended beyond that of the Circuit Court judge and, for consistency sake, I submit that the county registrar's age limit should be advanced to 70 in common with the age limit of other civil servants, no matter what their capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can agree with the arguments advanced in regard to this amendment, but I think it is high time that we had some general principle governing this matter.  We deal in another section of the Bill with a particular officer, the City Sheriff of Dublin, and we make provisions whereby he may serve to the age of 72.  This amendment deals with county registrars. We have had a lot of talk over <Col N="835" /> a number of years in regard to judges, district justices and land commissioners. No matter whom we are discussing, the argument is always put up that, owing to better health services, people are able to act longer now in responsible positions.  Of course that is all nonsense, because some individuals have always been able to exert their abilities much beyond 70 years of age.  I think, however, that it is high time we discussed this from the general principle point of view.  Are we to have 70 years as the retiring age or are we to have 65 as the retiring age?  There are more people in the courts concerned than judges and county registrars.  There are District Court clerks, chief clerks of the District Court, and many other officials who are as much entitled to have their service extended as a county registrar.</P>
      <P>Instead of considering this amendment by itself, the Minister ought to consider it from the general principle of the court officers and bring in an amendment on the Report Stage which will govern the whole position.  This method of dealing with it from year to year is unfair.  There were some retirements from the position of county registrar not so very long ago. If this amendment had been law, these men might have been able to serve for a longer period.  I do not know whether that is so or not.</P>

There should, however, be no question of just keeping on a man for no other reason than that he should qualify for a bigger pension. That is a bad principle.  I ask the Minister between this and the Report Stage to consider this matter in a general way and perhaps to bring in an amendment which will govern quite a large number of people other than county registrars.  In a small country like this there ought to be a general desire to utilise the services of people as long as possible.  In that way, the pensions bill would be reduced and that is a matter of some consideration for the State.  I ask the Minister, if he is considering this, not to consider it just as an isolated matter affecting county registrars, but to consider it in a general way affecting court officers in all sections of the court service.</P>

But, as Captain Cowan said, it should not be confined to county registrars.  We all know that district justices have to retire at 65, except those who officiate in the Gaeltacht.  In the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, provision was made for the retention of district justices up to the age of 70 in the Gaeltacht.  I understand that two years ago a change was made in the position relating to district justices and it was provided in the Bill then brought in that their service could be extended on a year to year basis.  I think that is very undesirable.  I consider it more or less an interference with the independence of district justices.  It would be far better to have a definite legislative rule for the retention of these services. I would suggest that when the Minister is considering this amendment between now and Report Stage he would also consider the position of district justices.</P>

I thought the Minister was accepting it because it came from the Government Benches in the first instance, and I took it for granted that the Minister would not oppose it.  I was pointing out that the practice in respect of county registrars had been introduced by him in the Courts of Justice Bill in respect of district justices and I thought it a very bad principle indeed because it meant that one <Col N="838" /> could extend the period of service of a district justice if one liked, or put him out if one did not like him.  I think that is a very bad practice particularly in relation to a person acting in a judicial capacity.  It would be much better to fix a definite age limit in all these cases and not leave it to the Minister to decide.  Why the Minister adopted that particular provision I do not know.  I think there was a particular case in point at the time but I do not think the step should have been taken and the Minister ought to amend the provision.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 14, to insert &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; after &ldquo;section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 3 provides for the payment of gratuities to whole-time clerks who may not obtain certificates of qualification or, in other words, may not secure pensionable status.  It is not intended that a clerk should be eligible for a pension and at the same time for a gratuity under sub-section (3).  A certificate of qualification may be obtained under sub-section (2) of the section, but it might also be obtained under the Civil Service Regulation Acts as, for example, in the case of a clerk who is at present part-time but may be successful in a year or two in a competition held by the Civil Service Commissioners for a whole-time post.  As the section stands it is conceivable that such a clerk, being a person to whom in accordance with paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) the section applies, could claim a gratuity under sub-section (3) as he had not obtained his certificate under sub-section (2) and, in order to remove any possible doubt on this point, the amendment proposes to insert the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; in the fourth line of sub-section (3).</P>

      <P>To add the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>(4) As, on and from the passing of this Act, the officer in charge of any District Court office shall be known as the District Court registrar, and all previous enactments shall be deemed to be adapted accordingly.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment which the Minister should have no difficulty in accepting.  The purpose of the amendment might at first sight appear to be vague.  The Minister might say that there is no purpose in it and that it does not matter whether one calls the officer in question a District Court clerk or a registrar.  The word &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; as applied to the person who sits under a judge or a justice, is, in the first instance, a relic of the old British days. For that reason alone, without any other, it is time it was abolished. Secondly, the work of the clerk of a District Court has increased considerably and will increase as a result of the passing of the Criminal Justice Bill.  There is also the suggestion that by the use of the word &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; the position of head of a District Court office, possibly, would be demeaned to some extent.  For these reasons, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a change of title.  I think the case advanced by Deputy Lynch should appeal to the Minister.  &ldquo;Clerk&rdquo; is an invidious title to give a man who, in the District Court, acts in the same capacity as a county court registrar under a county court judge.  I do not see why the court officer should not be known as the District Court registrar.</P>

There is a registrar to the lay commissioners. The only officer that seems to be singled out for the title &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; is the District Court clerk.  From the point of view of uniformity alone, why not call the officer who performs these functions a registrar?</P>

      <P>I do not know that there is this desire on the part of the officials.  I take it, as Deputy Lynch has put down the amendment, that it has been put forward by the court officials.  There may be something to be said for uniformity from the Supreme Court registrar down to the District Court registrar, but I do not think there is anything obnoxious in the title &ldquo;clerk&rdquo;.  I think &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; has a particular distinction of its own and even in this House that particular designation cannot be considered as being objectionable.  I can see simple cases in regard to it.  I can see difficult cases.  In the district courts throughout the country, I do not suppose there need be any difficulty.  I can see some difficulty arising in the Dublin District Court, as there would have to be a chief registrar, a deputy chief registrar and perhaps other degrees of registrar.</P>
      <P>I do not think that District Court clerks have any objection to that title. I do not know that they will be very keen on getting what is considered the more important title of &ldquo;registrar&rdquo;. As I understand, they want their work recognised, not in the title they get, but in the amount of salary that goes into their pockets.  I think that is what they are mainly concerned about. As far as most of us in this House are concerned, I think that, in so far as we can press the Minister, we should press him to put more money into their pockets and not to bother about the title that they are to get.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what Deputy Cowan says with regard to the attitude of District Court clerks to a <Col N="842" /> change of name, I can assure the House and the Minister that the District Court Clerks' Association is keenly interested in a change from &ldquo;District Court clerk&rdquo; to &ldquo;District Court registrar&rdquo;.  In fact, they are rather surprised that the name &ldquo;District Court clerk&rdquo; was ever applied.  Probably it derived from the Petty Sessions clerk, as such officers were called under English rule.  A clerk may be regarded as somebody who is under direct supervision or jurisdiction but, so far as I can see, the District Court clerks are independent of such supervision.  To some extent, they are under the supervision of the Minister, but they are not under the supervision of a district justice. In very many cases the district justice sees the District Court clerk only when he comes to court.  Many district justices live in the City of Dublin.  I think these officers should be given their correct title of registrar and that that title should continue up to the Supreme Court.  I want to assure the Minister and the House that their organisation is keenly interested in a change of name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan has asked us to examine a most important point in reference to this amendment. It is often the case that a change of title is not sufficient to change the duties of the officer concerned.  In some cases&mdash;and it could be in this case &mdash;a change of title might carry with it, in time, if not immediately, an increase in responsibility, an increase in duties, a raising of prestige and, naturally flowing from these, an increase in emoluments.  Personally speaking, I should imagine that the organisation concerned would rather adhere to the good old title &ldquo;clerk&rdquo;.  The title &ldquo;registrar&rdquo; is a very modern innovation. &ldquo;Clerk&rdquo; is an historical title.  It goes back to the early days of our history.  I think it is a more dignified title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assumption of the modern term registrar will enable any additional increment or increase in salary to accrue in time to these officers.  If it makes that desirable state of affairs easier, if, in other words, the Minister or the Department of Finance or the Dáil will look with greater favour upon a body <Col N="843" /> of its servants because they are called registrars than if they are called clerks, then of course we should champion this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, does not think, like Shakespeare, that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet; he prefers to keep the clerks as clerks and thereby carry on the tradition that has obtained from the time of the clerks of the First Dáil, the clerks of these courts under the First Dáil, the clerks of the parish courts, the clerks set up by the Provisional Government, and all the other clerks who were appointed.  Against that argument it has been stated that most of the courts in existence have their officials known as registrars, from the Supreme Court down, and that it is a modern custom. Even when we set up the military tribunal we had a registrar at that tribunal and I am sure his actions and functions did not smell any sweeter because he was called a registrar instead of a clerk.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, while we think the title of clerk is a good and sufficient title for the work and merits as much recognition as any other title, yet if the organisation concerned sees any point in having the name changed to that of registrar, then we would press the Minister to give some cognisance to this desire of the organisation and to read into it whatever they think should be read into it, and we can hear from him about it on a further stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Connolly has said, the use of the word registrar is not as recent as he suggests.  The persons who acted in the capacity of Clerks of the Dáil courts were known as registrars, so if the Minister is looking for a precedent for naming a District Court clerk as registrar he can find it there.  I do not want to go through the various duties of a clerk of the District Court.  I think most Deputies know that the clerk is already a registrar in at least one respect, inasmuch as he is a registrar of clubs.  I ask the Minister to adopt what was recognised under the old Dáil courts and extend the title of the man in charge of the office and let him be known as registrar of the <Col N="844" /> District Court, which will cover all his duties.</P>
      <P>I might add, in reply to Deputy Cowan and Deputy Connolly, that this amendment is put forward with the full approval of the District Court Clerks' Association, the members of which are keenly desirous that the Minister and the House will accept it.  After all, if the men concerned want to be called by this name it is only fair we should listen to them.  I have no desire to belittle the use of the title clerk.  We all know that the Clerk of this House is by name, nature and title a host in himself.</P>

For instance, there was the Clerk of the Crown and Hanover&mdash;but that may be an association people want to get away from and there may be nothing in that.

      <P>When the Second Reading was on I was unaware that the treatment meted out to the Circuit Court clerks is entirely different from what is proposed for the District Court clerks.  I put down an amendment but, as it was imposing a charge, it was ruled out.  The Bill was presented before those concerned got a chance of studying it and therefore they did not make their case.  I was amazed to find in the provisions, which appeared to me to be fairly satisfactory, that serving District Court clerks can have their previous services counted for pension purposes while in the case of the Circuit Court clerks they get it only from the date on which they are established.  That is very bad.  I was told that arrangement was made when I was Minister.  Even so, it is a bad arrangement.  The Minister has made much better provision for these other clerks.  I ask the Minister to place both types of clerks on the same basis. He could do that on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy is aware of the trouble we have had from the clerks on both sides.  As long as I have been here we have been canvassed by these clerks, and I think rightly so, because they have a case.  If we are to have this discrepancy in treatment, it is a very serious matter.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole thing and not have two separate systems.  I was surprised to find such a big discrepancy in the scale of pay.  There are seven grades of District Court clerks and there is only one grade of Circuit Court clerks&mdash;that is, if the information given to us is correct.  What I was shown last week by some Circuit Court clerks was that the maximum they can attain is only equal to the maximum that the lowest grade in the District Court can rise to.  If that is the case there is something wrong.  I am not a legal man, but I imagine the legal people here will agree with me that the Circuit Court clerks are at least as important a body as the District <Col N="846" /> Court clerks.  The Minister should make some effort between this and the Report Stage to settle the whole thing and deal fairly with both sides.</P>

There are a number of clerks in the District Court who might be rightly described as the pioneers of the District Court.  They are the gentlemen who took over from the clerks of the old petty sessions. Apparently their service is rated as part-time service.  When the Minister is considering the issuing of the service of qualification in relation to this limited number who did that pioneer work, I urge him to consider the possibility of having that service, though it was mainly part-time service, regarded as full-time service.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I had come to the point of the reference by Deputy O'Higgins to turf.  It was quite clear to me from the manner in which the Deputy referred to turf production that he was of the opinion that turf production started only in the year 1940.  Apparently he is not aware that the idea of developing turf production and of making our native fuel something of value to the nation, was put into effect in the year 1933.  In the beginning, all the opposition to what was described as the crazy idea of ever using turf, came from these benches when they were occupied by Fine Gael.  One has only to go down to the library and look up the verbatim reports of the Dáil, to see to what extent there was either help from these benches in these days or belief in the idea that turf could be used to any extent, if at all. Under the Fianna Fáil administration turf development was a national scheme.  To-day we have a lot of talk, particularly from the Tánaiste, about getting back to the winning of turf, and abuse of the people who previously <Col N="847" /> produced and delivered it.  He says we are going to use a much better class of turf and that everybody is going to be very happy about it. What is the position so far as the city is concerned?  It is now a responsibility of the local authorities and we, in the Dublin Corporation, are supposed to be able to supply the citizens of Dublin with turf by our own efforts.</P>
      <P>We recently discussed this matter at a meeting of the Dublin Corporation and we were wondering where the turf area was situated to which we could send our workers to win our turf. Obviously the turf will have to be brought to Dublin and storage accommodation will have to be found for it. I do not know that the Dublin Corporation has, first of all, the facilities for storing turf.  The Phoenix Park does not belong to the Dublin Corporation; it belongs to the Board of Works.  In any case, is the responsibility and the cost for supplying turf to the citizens of Dublin now to be put on the rates? We all know that the last Administration spent a considerable amount of money in connection with turf development but to-day the local authorities will have to do it.  The local authorities who have got turf resources in the shape of bogs will be able to do it, but nevertheless it will cast an additional charge on their rates.  We are being pressed to state what is our policy on any given item or series of items and I want to say now that the provision of turf, particularly in these days when there is such a lack of security in regard to supplies from elsewhere, should be a national Government responsibility.  It should not be put on the shoulders of local authorities with a consequent lack of responsibility and a consequent saving for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made all kinds of ridiculous statements about the history of turf development since 1933 and he wound up his statement on that subject with the remark that at this particular juncture Fianna Fáil was booted out of office.  As I said before, when the next election comes, which I hope will be pretty soon, and when as a result of the counting of the votes we shall resume office, we shall be <Col N="848" /> more charitable and we shall not say, when referring to the present Administration, that they were booted out of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins seems to think that the present Government has a policy with regard to the international situation and that the policy which we have is the wrong one.  He says that Deputy de Valera has always held up the bogey of war as a kind of threat to the people so that they would not make any change in the administration. I do not think that Deputy de Valera is the only person in the world who believes that there might be war. Deputy de Valera has always advocated that, so far as we are concerned, it is our obligation to take the responsibility of being able to protect the area over which we have control to the utmost extent to which we can.  It is expected of us that we shall have our manhood trained for the defence of this country to whatever extent it can be done.  Surely Deputy O'Higgins must be aware that if we are, on the one hand, going to accept gifts in the shape of millions of dollars from the American nation and substantial loans under the Marshall Aid scheme, and if they are going to recognise our right to decide the question of our neutrality in any conflict, we must be prepared to defend ourselves?  If we are just to hold our hands out for everything that they can give and expect them to take an interest in this country, we must show that we are prepared to take adequate steps to defend ourselves.  It is all very well to refer to our soldiers in the way the Deputy did but I see nothing to be ashamed of in having our youth trained, disciplined and available to the extent they always were in crises of the past.  I think the Deputy who is sitting on the Front Bench at the moment would be the first to admit that before we were able to put at the disposal of our young men all the resources which the Government of the country should possess, in fact with practically no resources our young men resisted the continued occupation of this country by a foreign Government and succeeded by their efforts in getting rid of the oppressor.  Are we to say that we are doing justice to those <Col N="849" /> of former generations who made the supreme sacrifice for the freedom of our country, if now, when we have that freedom, we neglect to take the necessary steps for the preservation of the independence that was so costly to win?  The Deputy talked about fear of war and about the blood-curdling threats and frightening speeches of Deputy de Valera but then he came along and said it could happen to-morrow. If it can happen to-morrow, what is our position?  Apart from physical defence, there is also the defence of our people from the point of view of providing them with the absolute essentials to maintain life.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent provision is being made.  I have read in the newspapers what I regard as being an inspired headline in connection with this Vote on Account relating to the increase in expenditure this year over last year.  The increase, it is stated, is due to stock piling. Stock piling of what?  I have yet to know what we are stock piling.  I saw in a paper an itemised statement to the effect that stock piling was taking place in the Army.  Everybody knows that there is an increase in the cost of the Army.  The ordinary clothing of the soldiers, even for the small numbers that we have, has gone up so much in cost that there has to be an increase in expenditure on the Army. Is this going to be a smokescreen for the purpose of refusing to admit that, in fact, there has been a substantial increase in the cost of every commodity? If that is the purpose, I think it is going to fail unless one can see the piles of what have been stocked.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins says that we are very much better prepared than ever we were, and that we are getting more and more goods from our factories.  Is it not a fact that a great number of our factories are in a very precarious position for the reason that they are not able to obtain supplies of essential raw materials to enable them to carry on?  Did we not read in the newspapers the other day that a delegation of officials had gone across to the other side to negotiate with the British Administration for the release and delivery of certain commodities to this country?  These commodities are not <Col N="850" /> only coal, cotton and steel, but dozens of others which this country heretofore purchased from England.  In view of that, how can it be suggested that our factories are producing more and more?  The statement I refer to would appear to me to be an expression by someone of wishful thinking rather than a recognition of facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins talked about the new factories which have been established in the last three years.  When Fianna Fáil came into office and started its industrial development policy, questions appeared on the Order Paper every other day asking where were the new factories, and how many of them were what used to be called &ldquo;back street basement workshops.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil started industries and some of them are thriving.  Some, in fact, have improved in size and output.  Why does not someone give us a list of the new factories which Deputy O'Higgins says were started in the last three years?  I would be anxious to see the list and to give credit to the Administration for their establishment if I could be told where the new industries are.</P>
    <P>We are told that agricultural output is higher now than ever it has been in the history of the country, that the building of houses has gone on more rapidly than ever, and that industrial output is up.  I say that when Deputy O'Higgins pointed to these benches earlier to-day, and suggested that there were no representatives of the working farmers of the country on them, he was riding for a fall.  He is going to get a very rude awakening because the test of the agricultural prosperity will be the answer which the population will give when the election that we expect comes.  I have no doubt what the answer will be.  If I am re-elected.  I have no doubt that I will be sitting at the other side, but even if I am not, Fianna Fáil will be over there.</P>

      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and Deputy de Valera, the Leader of this Party.  Deputy O'Higgins talked about this far-fetched cry of war and of the imminence of war being mouthed, as he called it, from this side of the House.  Does he not recollect that recently in this House Deputy Cosgrave, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, admitted that there was a sudden increase in the cost of commodities coming here from abroad because of the Korean war?  We all read the newspapers and we know there is a Korean war.  If, as a result of the Korean war, there is a belief in the minds of the big nations that it can spread, has that not brought about a very big campaign of stock piling, increasing the cost of wool in Australia and causing the almost complete disappearance of tinplate from the markets of the world?  We read in the newspapers that other peoples believe that there is a danger of war.  Whether the war is imminent or not, or whether it is a mythical war or not, we are paying for it in the cost of goods which we are importing.  The belief that it is imminent is shared by practically all the big nations of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the Vote on Account proper.  I have read a lot of explanations about the present position.  I am a very simple individual and I understand only simple things.  When, however, I take up a piece of paper on which I find recorded irrefutable facts in the shape of figures, I am somewhat impressed, and I come to certain conclusions. I find that, in the financial year 1947-48, the total expenditure of this country under Fianna Fáil was £58,918,000&mdash;approximately £60,000,000. May I remind the Deputies who now occupy the Government Benches that that was the year in which they, our political opponents, were most vocal&mdash; almost to the extent of being violently vocal about the squandermania of Fianna Fáil, and about the disastrous waste of public funds by these megalomaniacs.  But, when I turn to the figures for 1951-52, three years after the Coalition Government was <Col N="852" /> formed, what do I find?  I find that expenditure in this year is not going to be £60,000,000.  We have been told, of course, that taxation has been brought down, that the cost of living has been brought down, that the citizens have been protected and that all superfluous civil servants have been weeded out.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Finance coming in here on his first Budget and indicating that roving commissioners had been sent out to weed out the civil servants who were sitting there doing nothing.  Having accomplished all that, we have reduced our figure from £66,000,000 to £83,000,000&mdash;wonderful, magical work!  But, when I went to school, £83,000,000 was always £23,000,000 higher than £60,000,000. Deputies over there believe that they have a accomplished a reduction of £23,000,000, twice as much as they promised&mdash;they only promised a reduction of £10,000,000.</P>
    <P>What is the explanation for that? There is an explanation for it.  First of all, there is the explanation that, when the present Coalition spokesmen were on these benches, they were apparently wrong in their prognostications. They were wrong in the cures they had and in their anticipation of world events.  Not only had the amount gone up very significantly but it was continuing to go up.  Why?  There are obvious reasons for it and reasonable people must see that there are obvious reasons for it.  But there is no use in trying to hoodwink and to mislead people.  Why not face facts?  It is true that the £ was devalued and that the purchasing value of the £ sterling became even less than it was when it was gradually falling after the world war.  The world situation is making the cost of the materials we have to buy much higher.  We have to face that fact.  But we cannot escape the position if we have built up hopes in people on false statements made in the months before the general election of 1948.  The people are going to give the present Coalition Government very scant treatment in the way of excusing them because, if we were wrong in 1947 and 1948, how much more are you going to be judged to be wrong when <Col N="853" /> an account is given to the people in a short time from now?  There are Deputies who are seriously worried about the borrowing of money in the present situation and the liability which falls on the back of the taxpayer not only for the repayment of the loans but for the annual interest charges accruing on them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey is one of the Deputies who constantly worry about this.  What is the position? During the Fianna Fáil period of office of 16 years or 15 years, as some people now say, but I think it is nearer 16, they borrowed altogether £38,000,000, £10,000,000 of which was handed over to Great Britain in connection with what is called local loans.  It was a debt due by this nation to the British Government which was paid off by raising £10,000,000 and the interest charges now flow into our own coffers. Thirty-eight million pounds was the amount borrowed by Fianna Fáil, having got rid of between £90,000,000 and £100,000,000 of land annuities, which is also forgotten.  In three years, the Coalition Government, who were going to save £10,000,000 in the year on national expenditure, have borrowed £39,000,000 and have received a loan under Marshall Aid of $128,000,000 and a gift of $16,000,000, being roughly equivalent to £50,000,000.  The total of £50,000,000 and £39,000,000 is £89,000,000.  We are £89,000,000 worse off in the shape of capital debt.  At the moment we are not paying interest on the Marshall Aid loan, but that may arise in 1952.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <P>Are you suggesting that we should not do some of the things we are doing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. What are our interest charges?  The service of public debt in 1948 when the change of Government took place, high enough and worrying enough as it was, amounted to £3.36 millions.  Without the Marshall Aid interest, what is it to-day?  £6.3 millions per annum is the amount for interest and redemption charges.  Deputy Hickey asked <Col N="854" /> am I going to dispute that the money is being well spent?  He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot argue that he objects to paying interest on borrowed money if he approves of the use that the money is being put to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I pointed out that the service of debt charge was almost double to-day what it was in 1947-48, the Deputy asked did I disapprove of the manner in which the money was being spent.  I say that if I approve of the manner in which the money is being spent, I must approve of the cost of the money because, in order to do it, I have to acquire the money.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  What I do disagree with is this.  We have now a new type of accounting.  I have served for many years on the Public Accounts Committee and I thought I understood the approach of Government to what is called national expenditure.  I thought I could differentiate between expenditure which should be met out of revenue and expenditure which should be met out of borrowing.  I had been taught in the days when I attempted to study mathematics and a little bit about finance that capital expenditure had to be something in the nature of expenditure which was reproductive. In what are called public corporations, on capital expenditure you had to have a charge which was called an amortisation charge.  To-day we borrow and we spend and we say, &ldquo;We are going to call that capital expenditure because it suits us to call it that, whether it is that in fact or not&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the method of approach to-day.  Nobody will object to money being borrowed for a capital project if they know that the project will pay its way and pay off the capital.  But, if you spend money on items which are definitely not capital items and you borrow that money, you will have ultimately to pay that money back out of revenue by clapping it on <Col N="855" /> to the backs of every section of the community in some form or another, whether by direct or indirect taxation. We had a clear view in anticipation shortly after the end of the war.  And, because we were influenced into recognising that there would be a tendency towards inflation and a resultant rise in the cost of living, we decided that the best thing to do would be to make money available to subsidise lavishly.  We, therefore, introduced a Supplementary Budget under which we imposed an additional tax on beer, on spirits, on tobacco and on amusements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait and see.  Recently I saw where one Minister of State announced publicly that too much money was being spent on beer, on gambling and on amusements.  When that is said by a responsible Minister I take it that he is speaking for the entire Cabinet and I conclude, as any average and ordinarily intelligent individual must conclude, that this is the thin end of the wedge, the beginning of the introduction of the excuse for reimposing these taxes, not for the purpose of getting more money but for the purpose of protecting the people from themselves.  They are drinking too much.  They are gambling too much.  They have too many amusements. But the net result will be the same.  We estimated that we would get some £8,000,000 to finance some of those projects which are now being met by borrowing.  We would have paid for them out of revenue and there would not have been this blister on the backs of the people with millions of pounds in interest, apart from redemption charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> A new situation arises.  The machine is running too fast.  It is getting out of control.  Some people refuse to realise what is really happening.  They refuse to consider what is the best thing to do to try to get some form of order and not to head straight for chaos.  What is being done?  Everything is going up.  The Minister for External Affairs promised at one time to reduce everything by 30 per cent. This morning this document containing tables of national income and expenditure arrived with my breakfast mail. I glanced over it and my attention was caught by a few items.  I saw my own point of view practically confirmed or, if you like it better, I almost agreed with what I saw in the morning paper. I think it was the <i>Irish Independent.</i> Output of commodities&mdash;in other words, the volume of goods&mdash;was up by 20 per cent. but the cost of the goods themselves is up by 100 per cent.  We hear people talking about the extra millions we are getting in turnover. Extra millions for the same goods but not extra goods.  Some people when they see these increased figures think that everything is grand.  They think we have doubled our turnover, but that is not the case.  Where will it end? Have we reached the peak of the spiral?  On one occasion the Minister for External Affairs said that he feared inflation; in another speech here he said he did not fear inflation at all. Why?  Because we have not control over it.  That is the reason we have it; if we had control we would not have it.</P>

      <P>I do not think the interjections are being made in any hostile spirit.  I accept them in the <Col N="859" /> spirit of good debate, and I hope that these interjections are being forced by the force of my arguments.  Nobody can suggest that the <i>Irish Times</i> is a pet of mine or that I am a pet of the <i>Irish Times.</i>  I am quoting the <i>Irish Times</i> of 11th November, 1949:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Speaking at a luncheon of the Publicity Club of Ireland in the Metropole, Dublin, yesterday, Mr. MacBride, Minister for External Affairs, said he did not think that the dangers of inflation were likely to exist in Ireland for a considerable time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is not an expression of belief that there was going to be no inflation, then I do not know what words mean.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our own nationals, he said, who at present invested their money in England, would have to show a little more enterprise, initiative and imagination and realise that their money was safer here than in a bank in a country over whose economic future they had no control.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He starts off with the statement that he does not believe that there is going to be any inflation for a considerable time.  I am getting somewhat confused. When maize was being imported for the first time after the war, when questions were being levelled at another Minister as to how constant the price of maize could be regarded, I read a pronouncement that maize would not rise in foreseeable time. Here we have the statement that inflation will not occur for a considerable time.  These statements were made by two Ministers in the same Cabinet. Either we have inflation or we have not.  I believe that there has been a substantial rise in the cost of goods, due mainly, not solely, to the tremendous increase in the cost of raw materials which have to be imported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that we can.  I said before that if I were trying to be reasonably accurate and truthful to the communities that I was addressing, particularly from an election platform, <Col N="860" /> I would have told them, as they were not told, that the £56,000,000 which Fianna Fáil was then spending might have to be doubled soon because of the world situation, instead of telling them that that squandermania, megalomania, Government would have to be got out of office because they were frittering away all the resources of the State.</P>
      <P>Now, the people are faced with the other position and Deputy Thomas O'Higgins suggested to-day that all the difficulties with which the present Government is faced are a consequence of 16 years of Fianna Fáil administration. Later on, of course, he told us he was quite happy; he was prepared to face the jury when the election came because everything in the garden was rosy; there were no difficulties.  Again, even Deputy O'Higgins, in the space of half an hour, sees difficulties and blames us for them, but realises, towards the close of his speech, that we are on the eve of an election and that it is better not to admit that, so he says there are no difficulties at all, and therefore, we have nothing to be blamed for.  Again, I say, you cannot have everything both ways.</P>
      <P>The first serious position that we are faced with is that in this Book of Estimates and in this Vote on Account we are putting up to the public a very heavy expenditure for the full provision of which taxation is not available. As I understand, there is likely to be a deficit on the present method of collecting revenue of some £4,000,000 that will have to be met either by borrowing or by additional taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this an honest statement?  If it is, it should contain everything.  I say it is not.  I tell you why I say it is not: When the Vote on Account was introduced last year, I pointed out to the Minister for Finance that no provision was made in it for the social welfare scheme which was being spoken about at the time but not yet introduced. I concluded that it had been decided not to introduce the social welfare scheme in that financial year and the Minister for Finance answered me across the House: &ldquo;Did the Deputy never hear of a Supplementary Budget?&rdquo; I said that when I saw it I would believe it.  None was introduced. <Col N="861" /> There is no provision in this Vote for the social welfare scheme.  I do not know how many millions it will cost, if it succeeds in passing all stages in this House in this financial year. The Second Stage will be taken on Friday of this week.  Whether it will pass or not, is another matter.  I think that there again the Minister for Justice and myself might not go to an insurance company; we might just go outside and have a little bet on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is seriously contemplated to pass it through all its stages in this financial year, some Estimate will have to be introduced for it.  Whether it will be £4,000,000 on the back of the State in addition to the contributions of the subscribers to the scheme or whether it will be more, I cannot say but, certainly, it will not be much less than £4,000,000 if it is not higher.  That will add another £4,000,000 to your deficit.  The mother and child scheme&mdash;the dowry of the Clann na Poblachta Party&mdash;will cost something also.</P>

      <P>I have been 24 years in this House and I am not going to be drawn out around that little worm on a tuppenny-halfpenny line and hook. I am just trying to tell Deputies that they should face what they are up against.  The present Vote on Account admits that there will be £4,000,000 deficit on the present revenue collection arrangement.  If you are genuine and serious about your social welfare scheme, and it is passed, to that will be added another £4,000,000 and then there will be your mother and child scheme which will cost something, besides other items not yet clearly understood.  Will that be borrowed, or will it be out of taxation, or am I to take it that when I quote lawyers' statements they do not mean to the lawyer what they mean to the layman? Am I to take it that the tenth point of the ten points of the marriage settlement between the Coalition groups is an undertaking to introduce the scheme but not to put it into effect?</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey ought to know what I am getting at.  I am asking the questions at the moment. When I sit down, other Deputies can get up and ask other questions.  I believe I am putting my finger on points which will require further explanation. I am describing it as a dowry under the marriage settlement between these groups.  I do not know which are the husbands and which are the wives, but there are five of them in holy matrimony and everybody has his little demand.  Clann na Poblachta demands child welfare; Labour, social welfare.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, from this morning's paper, it would appear that a much more serious thing is taking place.  If Deputy O'Leary reads this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> he will see that Deputy Flanagan is threatening to take over the Land Commission, free of charge.  He is going to distribute the land because he thinks the present Minister is so incompetent. I think he said he will do it in three years.  As a Deputy near me says, that may mean another marriage settlement among the Independents. There is probably some settlement taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want seriously to suggest that Deputies should recognise what they are doing.  They should recognise that even if they all go into the Lobby and vote for this, the day of reckoning is fast approaching.  I am going to do my&mdash;I will not use the word I was going to use, but I am going to use my most sincere endeavours to influence everybody I can from now until we appear on the hustings and the votes are counted, to put these gentlemen out.  I do not think I will need much effort because they are not playing fair with the public; they are not telling them: &ldquo;You have us here and this is our price; this is what it will cost us as a Government.&rdquo;  You told them you are doing the job cheaper than we were doing it.  They are getting lots of pains and aches.  What do my constituents <Col N="863" /> think of a Government who received £40,000,000 of Marshall Aid money over a period of years for land reclamation &mdash;free gifts?  I understand there was a free gift of 1,000,000 dollars worth of flour given to this country, yet you took away from the poor children in the City of Dublin the subsidised bread they used to get in free meals in the schools.  Do you mean to tell me that these people are impressed?</P>

      <P>Deputy Rooney is on a local authority, and he knows he will have to answer his constituents very soon in this connection.  There are other items of local authority expenditure which were previously met by recoupment from the national Exchequer, but that no longer obtains, with the result that the rates in the counties and the cities have to be increased to make up for the deficiencies. Deputy Rooney need not laugh or tell us that this is a corporation scheme. There has been an attempt to put on the backs of the corporation full responsibility for the fuel situation for next winter.  Does the Deputy think that that is going to be solved without cost?  Does he not realise that it may cost the citizens an additional 10d. in the £ on the rates?</P>
      <P>The Deputy does not know that there was a conference between the Minister for Defence and the county and city managers for the purpose of reintroducing a scheme of A.R.P.  I would remind Deputy T.F. O'Higgins that there is a Minister in the House who also might be somewhat concerned about the imminence of war, because all the county and city managers were called together for the purpose of reinaugurating the A.R.P. scheme.</P>
      <P>This time we have not heard if it is all going to be at our expense, or are we again going to get the 50 per cent. recoupment that we got from the last Administration?  It is easy to save national expenditure by making somebody else pay.  I want Deputy Hickey to recognise, in connection with national expenditure, that one is able to direct as far as possible a great number of the charges on to the backs of those who are probably better able to stand the weight; but when we come to taxation under a corporation or a local authority and we strike an increased rate, we are hitting very severely at a number of people who are not able to bear this extra burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> I suggest to Labour Deputies that they ought to be very careful about agreeing to any further transfer of charges from the national Exchequer to the backs of the ratepayers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have been further cut down if it were not for those extra charges.  So far as Deputy Hickey is concerned, I always understood his approach was that everything would be all right in the garden if we could get hold of the money that is within the control of the State and use it for national and local purposes without the terrific imposition of an interest charge.  That is Deputy Hickey's viewpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as we live within the rules of civilised society we just cannot appropriate our neighbour's goods or property without giving him some reward for the use of them.  Unfortunately, the only reward you can give in connection with the use of money is an interest charge.  I suggest we should be very careful not wildly to borrow those other millions. If we are to borrow at all, let us borrow for the purpose of capital expenditure, where the repayment can be taken care of out of the products of the institution or the articles which are created by the money borrowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to wind up on this note.  We have been asked in our criticism on this Vote on Account to state our policy. Apparently Deputy O'Higgins was not <Col N="866" /> here when the Minister for Finance introduced the Vote on Account.  His introductory speech consisted solely of an itemised indication of what it was all about and he did not state anything about policy.  He did, however, express great apprehension about rising costs.  We all have done so.  I did not yet hear an admission that there was good housekeeping in the past.  We went through 16 years of all kinds of dangers and difficulties, creating all kinds of new things, making our people self-conscious and full of pride as to their capacity and ability to do the things at home that were previously done abroad for them, and all without imposing on the backs of the people great charges or wasteful expenditure.</P>
    <P>The introduction of large-scale housing is not a Coalition policy; it is a Fianna Fáil policy.  The introduction of the beginnings of social welfare is not the thought of the gentlemen over there; it was we who introduced the children's allowances; it was we who introduced the widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>

We introduced a Control of Employment Bill and we pride ourselves on the fact that amongst the vast bulk of the people who support this Party, we count, firstly, the working men and their families and the nationally-minded people of this country, the small farmers.  If Deputy O'Leary were a member of a Labour Party or one of the whips or front bench members of a Labour Party of some 50 members in strength then I would say that they had the worthwhile support of the <Col N="867" /> Labour people of this country.  We have such support.  They believe in us and they are more satisfied than ever that our policy was and is the right policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told by some Deputies here that the cost of administration in this country is much too high.  Well, I listen here frequently to Deputies, the majority of whom look for something all the time&mdash;for higher wages, pensions, subsidies and all the rest of it.  If they want all those benefits, they must be prepared to pay for them and who is going to pay for them except the rank and file of the taxpayers?  I think it makes no difference to the people of the country what Government is in power. Yet one Party view with another to gain power.  Why are they so anxious for so much power?  Are they not all Irishmen and could they not co-operate and work together in harmony for the betterment of the country?  Yet they will not do it.  So far as the grain supplies of the country are concerned, like Deputy Corry I do not agree with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture about the price he is paying to Irish farmers for wheat and other cereals for the feeding of live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheehan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not do that for another nine or ten years.  I say that the Irish farmer should be paid at least the same price as we pay the foreigner for wheat and other feeding stuffs.  I am not appealing to the Minister for Agriculture; I am appealing to the Government to review the position and to pay the Irish farmer at least the same price as we pay the foreigner for grain.  The money would at least be spent in the country and, at present, millions of money are going out of the country to foreign countries for grain.  In so far as fuel is concerned, there has been a good deal of controversy in the papers about fuel during the past month and in regard to the price charged for coal.  I say <Col N="868" /> here and now that the price of £8 5s. in Dublin and £9 in Cork is not high enough for coal, having regard to the places from which it has to come.  If the people of this country want to nationalise the supply of these commodities, they can do so, but they should look at the condition to which nationalisation has reduced Britain and other countries.  You cannot beat private enterprise.  I happen to be in the coal trade, and our main source of supply up to recently was Great Britain. Great Britain fell down on the job, and we had to go further afield, to France, Germany, Poland and America.  We had to pay freight as high as £5 per ton from the United States.  Having regard to the fact that we had to bring it 3,000 miles across the Atlantic from the port of shipment, and that we had to sell it at £9 per ton in Cork and a somewhat lesser figure in Dublin, I say there was no profit to the coal merchants.  The Dublin coal merchants have at present an application before the Prices Advisory Board, and they are prepared to show the losses which they have incurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheehan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might mention it just the same.  With regard to turf production, I am in full agreement with the Tánaiste that the production of turf should be encouraged in every way, but the job should be done properly and not as it was done five, six or seven years ago, when the lorries went down to the bogs and brought rubbish to the dumps in Dublin and Cork.  Some of it is there still. Some Deputies say why not use it, but it could not be used, and was never capable of being used.  There was a bad foundation from the start.  Let the job be done properly this time, whatever it costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Government also to try to do something to develop Irish coal mines.  We are told that we have a certain amount, of coal, bituminous and anthracite in this country. I think that the people who own these mines are rather conservative in their <Col N="869" /> outlook and that they are not prepared to take risks.  The Government should bring some pressure to bear on them to develop these mines, no matter how small they are.  A very considerable amount of money leaves this country to purchase coal in foreign countries and sometimes we have to take very inferior coal.  Some of our native coal may not be 100 per cent. good fuel but I maintain that the product of these mines could be used.  Many Deputies suggest that we should do this, that and the other but I am of opinion that we should first set our own house in order.  There are 147 Deputies in this House each drawing over £600 a year, travelling expenses and other incidentals.  I think it is time that this Government or some Government should pass legislation to sack 100 of them.  Fifty Deputies would be quite enough to run this small miserable country.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that good progress has been made in housing all over the country.  Unfortunately I have the complaint to make in regard to Cork that the same progress has not been made there.  I do not know why, though it is said that we have not enough key-men to do the job.  In conclusion, I think that all Parties should co-operate with the Government in the very critical times which we are now experiencing.  After all, we are better off than any other European country.  It is by co-operation, by putting our minds and our hearts together, that we shall surmount successfully the very difficult times ahead.</P>

      <P>We are faced this year with the biggest expenditure that ever came before this House.  For an hour and a half this evening there was not one member of Fine Gael behind the Minister on those benches.

      <P>Deputy Sheehan was speaking about coal and turf.  A very short time ago we had no coal in Cork.  Deputy Lynch and myself had a letter in the papers, and on the following day we had a letter from a Fine Gael councillor saying that there was plenty of coal, to ring up a 'phone number, and that all that was wanted could be got.  A week after, the retailers in Cork who supply the poor people in the outlying districts put an advertisement in the papers stating that they regretted that they had to close their stores&mdash;that they could get no coal. Some of those people were in the habit of selling 40 tons or 50 tons a week, but they could only get from five to ten tons from the merchants.  At the same time, we had lorries on the quays in Cork lined up and taking coal all over the country to people who were laying in stocks which would last them for two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Minister for Defence, in reply to a question here, telling us that his Department had bought 47,000 tons of coal.  He said that it was more than a year's supply.  While that was so, the people in Cork were shivering and dying from the cold.  No one can dispute that, that more were dying from the cold than from the 'flu. I would point out to Deputy Sheehan, and to other people like him, that during the emergency the Army cut their own turf.  They put up huts on the bogs and cut their own supplies <Col N="871" /> of turf, and so they were not taking the coal that was so badly needed by other people.</P>

      <P>The coal position became so bad a couple of days after that the Tánaiste called up every county engineer and county and city manager, and told them that the people were not getting coal, and yet Deputy Sheehan tells me that no person was ever refused a bag of coal in Cork.  He knows very well that the retailers in Cork closed their doors and put an advertisement in the papers to say that they had to close their doors.  I know very well that wealthy men in Cork were not refused a bag of coal, but I know that there were poor customers and small retailers who were refused a bag or a half-bag of coal.</P>

      <P>It was turf that was out in all sorts of weather, and the <Col N="873" /> pensioners were asked to pay a 1/- and 6d. a bag for it.  That is the management the people are getting from those who have not provided either coal or turf for them.  A fortnight before Christmas the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said that there was no danger of any scarcity of coal this winter.  He was quite sure about it: &ldquo;There is plenty of coal; do not bother your head, we will provide it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think what is troubling the people of the country most at the present time is the increase in the cost of living. It is going beyond all bounds. I hold that the present Government is in a large way responsible for that. In reply to a question last week which was asked by Deputy Derrig, the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;told him that there were 45 commodities the price of which had been decontrolled since February, 1948.  It was not until it was brought home to them by every worker in the country last December, that the Government made any attempt at all to take notice of the increase in the cost of living.  They tried to persuade the people that there was no increase, notwithstanding the fact that both trade union congresses had given notice of their intention to break their wages agreement on account of the increase in the cost of living.  Then early in this year they made a fixed prices Order which has been broken a good many times since.  There is nothing about the rise which took place since they decontrolled the price of 45 commodities, most of which are articles used in the ordinary household. Deputy Sheehan stated that some people are saying that the cost of administration is too great.  Does he think it is not too great?  Does he think a little country like this can afford £93,000,000 for administration?</P>

      <P>These are the people who can cut down expenditure.  They are the people who promised to cut it down by £10,000,000, not to put it up by about £30,000,000.  They are the people who promised to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. and who promised that they would abolish the means test for old age pensioners.  The Taoiseach, in an election address in January, 1948, said: &ldquo;The existing means test for the blind and the old and the afflicted, so costly and irritating to administer and a barrier to thrift, must be abolished.&rdquo; It has not been abolished yet.</P>

      <P>They were even going to let the people stay at home and get their employers to send their wages to them.  What do we find now?  As Deputy Briscoe pointed out, subsidised bread was always used for the school meals for children; that has now been stopped and they are compelled to use unsubsidised bread.  In answer to a question here it was stated that that was to save £50,000.  Before the election, Fine Gael issued a leaflet stating: &ldquo;Vote for Fine Gael for your child's sake.&rdquo;  There is not much sympathy for the children when they are compelling them to use white flour which the county medical officer for Cork and other county medical officers say is not as beneficial for children as the wholemeal flour.  But that does not matter now.  Fine Gael are not looking for votes now&mdash;not for another couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan spoke about farmers getting a better price for wheat.  I thoroughly agree with him.  Why should we be paying £31 per ton for foreign wheat and only giving our own <Col N="875" /> farmers £25?  Why should we be paying more to the foreigners for sugar than we are prepared to pay our own armers for growing beet?  Surely it is about time that was changed.  You have everything going up.  You have bus fares going up and the price of boots and the cost of boot repairs.  In Cork you now have to pay 11/3 to get a pair of men's boots soled and heeled because leather was one of the commodities decontrolled.  You have rationing going on in a country where there is plenty of bread, tea and sugar. Rationing is generally understood to be applied only when there is a scarcity. But rationing is continued here in order to compel anybody who wants to get extra bread or tea or sugar or Danish butter to pay more for it.</P>
    <P>The coal muddle was the biggest muddle that ever happened here.  We had the position in Cork of coal selling at one quay at £9 a ton and at the other quay at £7 a ton.  I am not blaming the merchants for that.  I am blaming the Government for it because the Government should have prescribed a fixed national price as was done in the case of turf during the emergency.  The person near the bog did not get turf cheaper than the person a hundred miles away.  I do not see any reason why that problem could not have been tackled and make the people of Dublin pay as much as the people in other parts of the country.  At present you have gas, electric light, blankets and bus fares, which are a big item in the family budget, going up.  Deputy Sheehan asked where was the price of coal to come from.  It is going to come from the workers' pockets.  Nobody else will pay for it only the people who consume it.  He need not be in doubt as to where the price is to come from.</P>
    <P>All this muddling is going on and nobody seems to worry.  That is the unfortunate thing about it.  Deputies will not come in here and listen to the debate.  Then they come in and make a joke of it.  Every worker in the country has to threaten to go on strike in order to get enough to live.  Some Labour Deputies are laughing at that. They were laughing here last year also until their laughing was stopped by <Col N="876" /> the workers of the country.  As Deputy Briscoe said, we on this side of the House represent more of the workers and of the small farmers than anybody on the other side.</P>

Shortly after the Government came in power, Deputy Larkin said that he was going to get the supertax reimposed.  I do not see any sign of it yet.  Some members of the Government are not so anxious to pay some of their own people.  The post office workers are not too satisfied with what they are getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act was introduced in 1946, and for the past five years, especially since 1947, the cost of living has been increasing.  No one can deny that.  Every pensioner in the State has got an increase, with the exception of these men.  A couple of weeks ago the Minister for Justice said here that this Government did <Col N="877" /> more for the old I.R.A. than any other Government.  I ask him to prove that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take our national income and deal with it principally.  The national income was £254,000,000 in 1944 according to statistics.  Last year, 1950, the national income had increased to £362,000,000, an increase of £118,000,000. Most of that increase took place during the past three years and was the direct result of the policy pursued by the Government because of our having invested in a better manner than that in which the previous Government had invested, particularly in relation to agriculture.</P>
      <P>Listening to Deputy McGrath tonight, one could only conclude that he has a very short memory since he could not remember the days when a wage of 45/- per week was held up as an example of an average weekly wage here.  At the time when that figure of 45/- per week was mentioned, the cost of living was only three points lower than it was in August, 1950.  Deputy McGrath suggested that the price of wheat should be increased.  He hesitated to suggest that we should pay £50 per ton, which was the figure paid by Deputy Lemass for Argentinian wheat just before the change of Government and at a time when it was not necessary to pay that price, as subsequent events proved.</P>
      <P>In North County Dublin there is an institution which is criticised by the farming community and has been criticised for a period of time.  That institution has proved that it made a profit of £15 per statute acre on wheat grown during 1950.  Yet the farmers alleged that that institution is not run as well as they run their own holdings; they think they are able to make a greater profit than £15 per statute acre on an average on wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were criticised by Deputy Briscoe because taxation has increased. Just prior to the change of government the Fine Gael Party said that it would be possible to reduce the cost of living taking into consideration the conditions which existed at the time of the general election.  The standstill Order was in force.  Old <Col N="878" /> age pensioners were only getting 10/- per week.  The teachers, the Civic Guards and the Army were on a certain wage basis, as likewise were civil servants.  We indicated that our policy, if implemented, would succeed in reducing taxation.  We were faced then with the problem of either increasing incomes to enable people to meet the increased cost of living or maintaining conditions as they were and effecting a reduction in the cost of living.  We immediately set out to reduce taxation by close on £7,000,000. We abolished the taxes on beer, tobacco and cigarettes.  That brought in an estimated revenue of £6,000,000. We reduced taxation to that extent. We then set ourselves to improve conditions for those people whom we considered worthy of a better income in relation to the cost of living than they were actually receiving.  The increases given to old age pensioners cost £2,500,000.  We improved conditions for teachers, Civic Guards, the Army and the Civil Service.  Therefore, the reduction of close on £7,000,000 which was effected in the spring of 1948 was nullified.  But we have no reason to regret that because we succeeded in increasing incomes for those very deserving classes who had received nothing commensurate with the increase in price levels over the years. Their incomes were actually stabilised. We also abolished the Constellation air service.  That would probably have cost us £3,000,000 or £4,000,000. By abolishing that service, which was scheduled to come into operation on March 17th, 1948, we saved the taxpayers something in the region of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, since that would have been the loss sustained had this service gone into operation.</P>

The present one is a reasonably comfortable one and we decided that could wait for a later date.  Fianna Fáil could continue to press for that if they wished but, strangely enough, they have not pressed us to proceed with that scheme.  In another direction we decided to invest our money on those things which would give some kind of return in income to the State.</P>

      <P>Taking State factories, and all the other State projects together, over the 16 years of Fianna Fáil, the income is only a very small fraction of the revenue derived from the Electricity Supply Board.  We have proceeded with the electrification of the country. At present, further hydro schemes are being established.  Rural electrification is being extended.  We know that it will increase the national wealth.</P>
      <P>We have received £40,000,000 Marshall Aid.  We have decided to invest it in the land.  I do not think that the Opposition will oppose the investment of that money in the land.  They will agree that that is the best course for the Government to adopt, as the land is the principal source of wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have pursued a vigorous housing programme.  In the last three years, we have succeeded in completing about 30,000 houses, which means that living conditions have been improved for 30,000 families, who were living in shacks, hovels and overcrowded houses, not only during the war years but for years before that.  The housing programme is being continued and a very large amount of capital is being invested in it.  I doubt whether that programme would be opposed by the Opposition.  It is absolutely essential <Col N="880" /> that we should proceed with that programme even more vigorously.  Anybody who knows all the considerations involved in the provision of housing will realise that we cannot proceed as fast as we would wish.  We are doing our best.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission programme has been the subject of a certain amount of criticism.  Those who take the trouble to find out the facts can see for themselves that a very good programme is in progress.  All the preliminary work is being carried out and the allocation of holdings will be proceeded with as quickly as possible.  In the last three years, 2,000 holdings have been raised to an economic level by the Land Commission.  That is a great contribution to the national economy.  It means that we have a further 2,000 economic holdings producing food for the nation and providing for their families.</P>
    <P>There is the afforestation programme. That also takes time.  I believe that it takes from ten to 15 years before a casual observer will see the results of work carried out by the experts and officials in the Forestry Branch.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath referred to the cost of living.  The cost of living is affected by the price of goods produced in this country and by the price of imported goods.  We have control only over the price of goods produced at home.  We cannot say to Great Britain, America or Belgium that, in order to keep our cost of living down, we will not pay the price they demand for their goods. We have to compete in the world markets for non-essential and even for essential goods.  Before the sudden change in the cost of living that has taken place since August, we were paying about £1,000,000 per week for goods that we imported.  The cost of the same goods at the present time is between £1,300,000 and £1,500,000.  That increase comes out of the pockets of our people.  It is in respect of goods which they require and which we import.  That is a clear example of the change in the cost of living over which we have no control.  The general public understand that position, but efforts are made to confuse public <Col N="881" /> opinion, to make the people believe that this is a matter over which the Government has control.</P>
    <P>Possibly, over a long term, we might be able to do something about that position.  It must be remembered that we are a young nation, that we have been less than 30 years managing our own affairs and developing our own resources, providing native industries. Probably in another 30 years' time we will still find it necessary to import commodities which in fact could be manufactured here.  It is a slow process making ourselves self-sufficient. We have done well in the last three years in establishing over 200 new factories and in putting into industrial employment another 50,000 workers.  We are advancing along the right lines towards self-sufficiency.  We will not succeed in achieving that object or securing that purpose merely by striking a wand or by imagining that it will be done to-morrow.  It is a long-term project.  We are going in the right direction.  Our economy will improve as we progress towards the goal of self-sufficiency. It is doubtful whether we can ever be completely self-sufficient. There are non-essential goods which it is not possible to produce here and for which we must always depend on outside sources.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies across the floor have mentioned the cost of living, but they have not tried to fix it at a level; they have not tried to tell us the cost-of-living figure.  I am sorry I cannot tell them either.  The position is that the cost-of-living figure on the last date when it was indicated was three points higher than it was last year.  The present figure is not yet available.  Possibly those who are making so much noise about the cost of living will get a nasty shock when they read the new figure.  They will say: &ldquo;It cannot be possible that the cost of living has gone up only five or seven points,&rdquo; or whatever it might be.  When that is worked down in percentages it is a very small figure of an income.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about the cost of living let us not mix it up with the cost of pleasure.  They are quite different things, but they are both paid for out of our incomes.  It is the income that pays for the cost of living and for <Col N="882" /> the cost of pleasure.  The figures can show that there is more money being spent on dancing, drinking, betting-smoking and other pleasures than ever before.  Does that prove that the cost of living has gone up or that the people have not money to spend?  The taxation that is being subscribed by the people under those headings of dancing, drinking, betting and smoking is higher than ever it was.  The people are spending more money that way.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that that is a good state of affairs.  It is good to see people with money to spend no matter on what they spend it.  If the cost of living was unbearable there is no doubt we would not have people spending more on pleasure this year, on things such as dancing, drinking, betting and smoking.  If the cost of living was unbearable they could not do it.  They would have to stint themselves.  Therefore, our minds should not be confused when we are approaching this problem.</P>
    <P>World prices are soaring and I believe it would be in the interest of the nation for our people who wish to stock-pile to do so while they have the opportunity.  It would be a good economic policy.  I know there is a programme, so far as the Government are concerned, to buy goods which they consider will be required, not immediately, but within the next two or three years or even later.  They propose to buy these things now because they realise that in the outside world these goods are becoming scarcer; in fact, it is nearly impossible to obtain some of them.  Those who can invest and trade in various classes of imported goods will be contributing in a great measure to the economy of the country if they would purchase all the goods they can obtain which they feel may become still more scarce, having regard to the world situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrasting the present Vote on Account with the position of affairs when this Government took over, we have to take into account many things.  One of these is the obligation on the Government to see that the larder is kept well stocked, as well stocked on the day they go out as on the day when they came in.  I want to know why it is at this stage, when the <Col N="883" /> turf cutters are gone, that we have a turf drive.  When this Government took over, according to a Parliamentary Question in the House last week, there was in stock here in February, 1948, 229,925 tons of turf.  You might say it was bad or wet, but it was there, paid for by the people.  At present there are 11,000 tons there.  When those people took over there were 387,593 tons of firewood.  That was in February, 1948.  In February, 1951, there was none left.  That larder is empty.  In February, 1948, there were 440,321 tons of coal. At present there are 189,000 tons.</P>
      <P>In that larder, handed over by the last Minister for Industry and Commerce, there was over £5,000,000 worth of fuel.  It has been sold&mdash;I do not say they gave it away for nothing, but it went anyway, over £4,000,000 worth of it, and the money for it went into the finances of the country, I take it.  There was nothing put in its stead until now when, according to Deputy Sheehan, we can buy very cheap coal at £9 a ton and possibly they will have to get an increase in that price.  They have been over to the price-freezing department to-day and yesterday looking for an increase.</P>
      <P>Can any Deputy say that we could not have bought cheaper fuel at any period during the past three years? Does any Deputy contend that it was not the duty of the Government to see that there was kept in stock at least sufficient to tide us over any emergency? We were, as usual, dependent on the gentleman there in the Front Bench, the gentleman who told us in 1940 that we would get plenty of wheat in American bottoms to supply the Irish people during the last emergency. The Government came along and threw everything under the auctioneers' hammers.  They got 15/- a ton for timber down in Cork, cut up in blocks at that.  Everything was sold out and nothing was put in its stead.  We were told we could get plenty of coal at £3 a ton from our dearly beloved brother across the water, John Bull, who is now getting our eggs at 2/- a dozen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the first charge I have to bring against the Minister, that he extravagantly liquidated £5,000,000 <Col N="884" /> worth of fuel and put nothing in its stead.  Now you have to pay more for the freightage of the coal that is coming in than you would pay for the whole article at any period during 1948 or 1949.  Deputy Sheehan told me last week that the freightage of coal reaching Cork was £5 a ton and that he had a notification that that freightage was going to be increased.  Then we have going out on the bogs this year all the boys of the country, saving turf.  I wish them luck.  That is the first item.</P>
    <P>The next item that I should like to take into account&mdash;Deputy Briscoe referred to it previously&mdash;is the manoeuvring, over on top of the local authorities, of every burden that can be pushed over on them.  This Government, as indicated in replies I received here last week, have collected from the road users of this country a sum of £5,500,000 more per annum than was collected in 1944-45. Motor taxation in the year 1944-45 amounted to £620,000.  In 1949-50 it was £2,600,000. Petrol tax in 1944-45 brought in £782,000 while in 1949-50 the amount was £3,078,000.  Import duties on vehicle and motor parts in 1944-45 amounted to £25,378 and in 1949-50 to £993,000.  Excise duties in 1944-45 amounted to £23,000 and now it is £122,000.  The total shows that the income from road users in 1944-45 was £1,452,000 and in 1949-50 was £6,801,000.  We get £2,000,000 a year less to provide roads than these people are paying.  That, to my mind, is the most serious aspect of the attitude of this Government.</P>
    <P>We know that prices have gone up. We know that the house that a local authority could build for £370 or £350 in 1939 now costs £1,200 or £1,300. What is the attitude of the Government on that?  They tell the private individual: &ldquo;We will give you £275 of a grant for the house.&rdquo;  Then they send down a nice little invitation to the local authority to give him £275 more and let the ratepayers pay half of the expenditure in a matter that was always considered to be a Government responsibility and in which the Government always bore a fair proportion of the total cost of the house. Now times are changing and it is going <Col N="885" /> to come into the ratepayer's bill.  In addition to the 5/- or 5/6 in the £ that the ratepayers have to pay to keep roads from deteriorating for the benefit of the road users, who pay, not the local authority but the State, the Minister comes along and collects taxation of £6,000,000 a year, puts it in his pocket and tells the ratepayer: &ldquo;You go and keep the roads.&rdquo;  That is a condition of affairs that to my mind is just the result of bad government.</P>
    <P>I have listened to many debates here at various times on this issue.  I have been here now for a great number of years, and heard many debates on Votes of Account, but I have never yet, until to-day, come up against a position of affairs, where the Minister comes along and flagrantly switches over the burden of taxation from the ordinary taxpaper on to the back of the ordinary ratepayer.  There is no justification for it.  I want here, as publicly as I can, to tell the road users of this country that if they are not going to compel the Minister, no matter what Government is in office, to disgorge their money, the money they pay and he collects, and hand it back to the people who are responsible for the upkeep of the roads, then they will have a lot of broken springs and they need not blame the unfortunate ratepayer for it.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Rooney telling us about how they were compelled to import. Who compelled this Government last year to go out to Formosa and to pay £12 a ton more to the Chinese or the nigger for sugar than the figure at which it could be produced here by the Irish farmer and the Irish labourer? This Government paid something close on £500,000 more to the foreigner for that sugar than they were prepared to pay to the Irish farmer or the Irish labourer to produce it, for 36,000 tons of it alone.  I notice that the same game is going on this year.  Eight thousand tons were brought in last week, produced by the foreigner, and we are told that there is another cargo on the water.  That is money that we need not send abroad.  That is money that would be very welcome here to the Irish farmer, the Irish labourer, and to the workers in the four beet <Col N="886" /> factories that, thank God, are working here still.  That is item No. 1.</P>
    <P>Item No. 2 was the attempted artificial depression of grain prices here by the importation of foreign grain.  The moment that the Minister for Agriculture found that the Irish farmers' organisation, the Beet Growers' Association, had made a contract with Messrs. Guinness on barley, he went over and purchased over £1,000,000 worth of foreign barley and threw it in here between January and August in order to depress the market here on the farmer.  He did that with his eyes open.  The result was that you had piled up in every haggard stocks of barley and there was no sale for it. He got such a doing over that that he ceased fire on its recently.  We had to go across to Messrs.  Guinness and enter into an arrangement with them through which they pledged their honour that they would not bring it in, and thus we controlled the madcap ideas of the Minister for Agriculture. But over £1,000,000 of the Irish people's money was paid for that in order to depress the market here.</P>
    <P>This time 12 months exactly I appealed to the Minister to fix a price on feeding barley.  The Minister said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It was the shortest answer that he ever gave in this House.  What did we find afterwards?  We found that he went to a place called Iraq and brought in £250,000 worth of foreign barley for feeding purposes at £26 10s. 0d. per ton.  I showed that muck to Deputies down below in the House.  The people's money was paid for that.</P>
    <P>What is going to be the position of the agricultural community and where do they stand, and what is going to be the position of the people of this country in the case of an emergency? The situation to-day is very like what the situation was about August of 1939.  Rural Deputies know that this is the spring of the year, and this is the time the farmer decides on what crop he is going to sow on his land, if he is going to sow any crop at all.  What is the attitude towards seeing that we have here sufficient bread for the people to eat?  I know that there is a change.  I know that we have over there again the same team who told us <Col N="887" /> that we could import plenty of wheat in American bottoms during the last emergency.  You have the same team, with a little mixture, I admit, of the converts to that policy, the policy that it was good business to buy from the foreigner and let your own people starve.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he has an international agreement on wheat.  I am sure when the workers in the various constituencies wake up some morning and find themselves with a war on, presented with Mr. James Dillon's international agreement instead of a loaf of bread, they will be very happy.  It will be just the same as the plenty of coal that we are going to get from Britain. Would not one expect, at a period like this, some lead from a Government and some lead from the gentleman who sits there with £2,550 of the Irish people's money in his pocket.  Would one not expect that he, at least, would tell the people of the country, &ldquo;I am going to see that you have bread, and my advice to the Irish farmers is to go and provide the bread&rdquo;?  At present the worst wheat that could be imported into this country is costing £31 15s. 0d. a ton.  The Minister tells the Irish farmer, &ldquo;You can grow it if you like at £25.  I have an international agreement on wheat, and I am going to give it as a gift to every housewife to put on the table for her breakfast if anything happens.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position as regards some of these matters.  During the last three years we paid 19,000,000 dollars of borrowed money to the foreigner for wheat.  I can tell this House that they are not going to get grain next year. There are 2,000,000 tons of grain required for India which has a priority because of her nearness to Russia. Every advice that the agricultural community have got has worked out completely against their interests.  At all times the attitude of this Government has been this: &ldquo;Whatever happens as regards prices and whatever we have to pay the foreigner for the stuff, we are not going to give it to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have a glaring example of that <Col N="888" /> in the present position with regard to barley.  The Minister for Agriculture knows that he will not be able to get feeding stuffs next year.  What is his attitude?  He paid £76 10s. a ton for &ldquo;muck&rdquo; that he brought into this country called Sorghums, or &ldquo;Sour Gums&rdquo; as people call them, and rotten barley and he paid 26/- a barrel for Argentine oats.  Having brought these in, when he knew he could not get any more from abroad, when he knew that the freightage at present would prevent him bringing them in even if he got them, he told us last week: &ldquo;I want 300,000 acres of barley grown,&rdquo; and having paid £26 10s. per ton to the nigger, he will pay the native £16 per ton.  It was only when we, as representing the Beet Growers' Association, went to him and &ldquo;hammered&rdquo; him on that that we succeeded in extracting another £4 a ton out of him.  I am glad to give him that much credit. Therefore, when Deputy Sheehan talks about individuals who were not worth £10 to their constituents, on that alone I think I am worth a couple of million to my constituents.  The Minister adopts an attitude which is going to leave this country without food for man or beast.</P>
    <P>In May, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture issued a message to the Irish people.  It was published in P.E.P. with his photograph, cigarette holder and all, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;MESSAGE FROM THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE.</P>
    <P>It used to be the rule that when egg supplies increased the price went down.  That is no longer true.  We have made an agreement with the British Ministry of Food that the more eggs we send to the British market the more they will pay for our eggs.</P>
    <P>It is as a result of this agreement that shippers can afford to pay 3/- per dozen for eggs to the producers.</P>
    <P>Indian meal is selling for 28/- a cwt., and it used always to be said that if you could get as much for a hundred (10 dozen) of eggs as a cwt. of Indian meal cost, eggs paid a profit to the producer.  You can get 2/- per cwt. more than the price of Indian meal now, so you can be sure <Col N="889" /> of a good profit on every hundred you sell.</P>
    <P>For the next five years, I believe, you can earn a good profit on every hundred of eggs you sell, and at the same time every quarter of eggs you sell to the eggler is a real and valuable help to the country.</P>
    <P>This is a free country, so you can sell your eggs, eat your eggs, or get rid of your hens altogether if you want to; but if you want to help your own Government to secure steadily improving terms in the British market:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Keep only pure-bred hens.</P>
    <P>(2)  Kill off the common hens (they eat a lot but they lay very little).</P>
    <P>(3)  Sell as many eggs to the eggler as you can.</P>
    <P>Remember that a quarter of clean fresh eggs is better than 100 dirty stale eggs.&mdash;James M. Dillon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the same James M. Dillon who informed me in this House last week, in reply to a question, that every agent he had, every Ambassador in every country in the world was looking for a market for the 2/- a dozen eggs.  At that time you had farmers' wives and other wives bringing their husbands in to buy incubators and telling them they would make plenty of money out of poultry and eggs.  After a bad harvest, the poor old farmer went in and bought an incubator.  The result was that in every farm house you went into you saw an incubator containing chickens hatched from the 3/6 and 4/- eggs.  Then the Minister for Agriculture went to London and told the people over there that he would drown them with eggs.  Now the same Minister, having induced the agricultural community to spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 of their hard-earned money on incubators and chickens, is now scouring France, Italy and Germany in order to sell eggs.  We had his second-in-command leading the way the other day by telling us that there was a great opportunity for the dual purpose hen.  That is the way in which agriculture is being served here, the principal asset which the Irish have to depend on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> We have a somewhat similar position with regard to milk and butter. The price paid to-day for milk at the creamery is the price fixed by Deputy Smith when he was Minister in March, 1947.  That is a pretty long time ago and there have been many changes in world conditions since.  It is a rather extraordinary thing that the Minister who demanded that the Irish farmer should produce milk at the price fixed by Deputy Smith at that time also told him that he would give him a five years' guarantee if he would produce it for 2d. a gallon less.  At the same time we have the Danish Minister of Agriculture selling nearly as much butter as could be produced here in continental markets at an average price of 438/- per cwt. while our Minister for Agriculture wanted the Irish farmer to sell it to John Bull at 271/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I am raising on this matter two very serious questions.  I have just alluded to the first one: that is, our position with <Col N="891" /> regard to wheat.  In reply to a question here, the Minister told us that we had enough wheat until next September, between the quantity we had in stock and what we would import.  We had then the position that the cheapest wheat that can be imported to-day is costing £31 15s. od. per ton at an Irish port, delivered c.i.f.  I have that information from a most reputable miller.  We are paying £31 15s. 0d. a ton to the foreigner from whom we have to borrow the dollars to buy it and we are paying £25 a ton to the Irish farmer.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that the Minister has arrived.  I repeat we are paying £25 per ton to the Irish farmer. That was the price guaranteed for the 1948 crop before the present Minister took up the reins of office.  That works out at 62/6 per barrel.  Many things have happened since that price was fixed.  The cost of seed to-day is over double what it was in 1948.  The cost of agricultural labour has gone up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The same price as he produced it for in 1948 when it was fixed by the Fianna Fáil Government and guaranteed before the present Minister arrived to take office.  What is the position with regard to wheat? Will the Minister give us any guarantee that if anything happens he will get priority in the markets of the world for wheat?  If he cannot get priority what will the position be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The present most urgent need is India and it is quite likely that <Col N="892" /> 2,000,000 tons of grain will be despatched to that country as a priority.  It is quite likely, therefore, that there will be a temporary shortage, and possibly a long-term shortage, of foreign grain, which makes it all the more important to secure that the native wheat supplies will be ample and that they will find their way to the mills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to impress the last sentence on the Minister who is at present grinding good wheat here for pigs and selling it as white pollard.  To-day the Minister was asked if he would state the country of origin of the wheat at present being milled for animal feeding, the total quantity of tons imported in 1950 and the c.i.f. price per ton and the retail price when the pollard is being sold as pollard in lots of one cwt.  The reply was: &ldquo;No wheat has so far been imported especially for animal feeding.&rdquo;  So that the wheat that was brought in and that is now converted to animal feeding was brought in for human consumption.  It may be something like the &ldquo;sour gums&rdquo; that were brought in here.</P>

Judging by native Irish barley and the stuff I showed the Minister for which he had paid £26 10s. per ton, judging by that I am very doubtful as to what kind of wheat he is getting now from abroad. It may be like the Iraquian barley or the Argentinian oats.  One could crush them and practically blow them over to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister is at present grinding wheat for animal feeding. He has not given any account of the quantity he has grown and is selling at 30/- a cwt.  At the same time he tells us that he is importing maize and milo maize; that he imported 348,551 <Col N="893" /> tons at £23 11s. 10d. a ton in 1950 and 64,000 tons of what he called milo maize at £21 0s. 6d. a ton.  That would give an average of £22 a ton.  But if the farmer wants it he will get it at £29 a ton.</P>

      <P>I am basing my arithmetic on the reply given by the Minister and a reply given by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach's reply was that the total imports of maize in 1950 amounted to 348,501 tons at an average price of £23 11s. 10d. per ton, and 64,059 tons of milo maize at £21 0s. 6d. per ton.  What is the arithmetic the Minister complains of?  He says: &ldquo;At present Grain Importers (Éire) Limited is supplying purchasers on the basis of 40 per cent. maize and 60 per cent. milo maize.&rdquo;  The Minister can calculate the cost, taking 40 per cent. at £23 11s. and 60 per cent. at £21 0s. 6d. per ton.</P>

      <P>So that the man with the pig can buy six tons of feeding for him, on the Minister's figures, at £29 per ton, carriage paid, to the purchaser's nearest railway station. That is the Minister's answer.  The Minister can make it up himself.  I am not concerned with that.  I am more concerned with seeing that food is provided for the people for the next 12 months.  I am far more interested in that side of it.  I want to know from the Minister: will he increase the price of wheat in order to cover the increased cost of production or will farmers go out of wheat production, so that the long cherished dream may be realised and we may be compelled to go to other countries with our hat in our hand, if anything happens in the world, saying, &ldquo;give me bread for my people and you can take my children?&rdquo; It is coming to that.  A very plucky attempt was made by certain Deputies not excluding the Minister anyway, from 1939 to 1947, to bring about that situation.</P>

Are we going to make any provision now for wheat or will the example of the Minister be followed?  The Minister's example of grinding wheat and giving it out for animal feeding&mdash;is that the headline to the Irish farmer as to what he is to do with any wheat he grows next harvest? If he sells it, he will get only £25 a ton.  If he buys a bag of bran or pollard he will pay 30/- for it.  If he wants to buy the Minister's mixture of milo-maize he will pay 36/- for it, if it is available&mdash;I do not think it will be.  Of course, he may induce the farmers in the grain-growing belt in this country to produce barley for him.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to help the Minister in that on the day he gives to the Irish farmer the price that he paid the nigger last year, and that is not too much to ask.  The price he paid the Iraquian last year for his barley, let him pay the Irish farmer that price now.  If he does not, I think he will be without it.  He has told the Irish farmer to grow what he pleases. Does he think the Irish farmer who has got, through the work of the Beet Growers' Association, £28 15s. 0d. a ton for malting barley, will grow wheat at £25 a ton or Ymer barley at £20 a ton?  He is not.  Therefore, wheat will be the cheapest grain on the market and the temptation and the inclination will be to use the cheapest grain on the market for animal feeding. I do not wish to proceed in this strain with the Minister.</P>

      <P>The gentleman from whom the Minister gets his funds, Mr. Paul E. Miller, Chief of the E.C.A. mission to Ireland, says that, since 1948, 19,000,000 dollars of the E.C.A. allocation to Ireland has been spent on wheat and wheat flour imported from the United States and Canada, and he believes that more wheat could be grown here.  He is the man who has to say whether the Irish people will get wheat or do without it, and if, in his opinion, wheat can be got or wheat should be produced by the Irish people, then he is not going to give <Col N="896" /> them wheat.  That was stated by Mr. Miller, speaking on the work of the E.C.A. in Ireland, at Jury's Hotel, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 22nd February, 1951.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of this Government, Sir, is to build up in this country 12 months' supply of wheat and to maintain that supply continuously.  That policy would have been given effect to already but for the disgraceful condition of the storage situation which was our inheritance from the ludicrously incompetent administration which burdened this country until January, 1948.  Since we have disembarrassed ourselves of that encumbrance, we have been building storage as fast as we possibly could, and, I am happy to inform the House, are steadily adding to it.  So far as I know, at the present moment every available square foot of storage is being availed of; every bushel of wheat that we can find a safe place of storage for is here or is on its way here or awaiting the arrangement of freight to bring it here.  Any wheat that is drawn from storage now, a corresponding <Col N="897" /> amount of wheat is purchased to replenish the storage.  The only effect of leaving low grade wheat in our stores would be to prevent the introduction of high grade wheat in lieu of the low grade wheat which, for the moment, we elect to use for animal feeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Only a part thereof. There is rubbish grown in this country and there is medium quality wheat and good quality wheat, and if the Deputy will keep quiet for a few moments I will tell him what I propose to do about it.  I think Deputy Corry will agree with me that he was good enough to call on me recently with a deputation.  He put his views very strongly and I explained my position and, having canvassed the matter, I said: &ldquo;Well, Deputy, you and I may agree about price level, but if you cannot recommend the crop...&rdquo;, and he made it clear he had no intention of doing it.  I said: &ldquo;Perhaps I may depend on your goodwill not to make my task more difficult by trying to persuade people not to grow wheat.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Deputy Corry, &ldquo;of course I would not do that.  I must ask to be excused from going out on a campaign to get farmers to grow wheat at the price you are offering.  I deplore your decision, but I will not do any agitating to stop them growing wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was counting the days.  I reckoned Deputy Corry's word has about the same endurance as a snowball in a slow oven.  It does not matter a damn what he says or what he does not say, but I was just intrigued to find out how long the pledge would last.  There is not a pawnbroker in the world who would not grow bankrupt if the pledges he got were not left with him longer than Deputy Corry's word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not give a fiddle-de-dee what Deputy Corry says or does not say; he will do all the damage he can; he will make all the mischief; he will wheedle and snarl at everybody <Col N="898" /> who is damn fool enough to listen to him.  Let us take it for granted that he is hell-bound to do all the damage, to spread all the falsehood and make all the misrepresentations that it is possible for one subtle tongue to do. In despite of that, I depend on the farmers of this country, without compulsion, without intimidation, without threats, to produce from the land of this country a larger cereal product than ever was produced before, and the House may wish to remember that 600,000 Fianna Fáil acres of wheat produced little more than half of what 350,000 acres produced in 1950.</P>
      <P>There are some fools in this country who believe that the important thing is to plough up land and sow it, without any regard to the yield they get. But the farmers who collaborate with this Government&mdash;and they are the majority&mdash;are concerned to make each acre entrusted to their care produce a little more than it ever produced before and leave it a little better in the autumn than they found it in the spring.  And they are doing it and they will do it, despite the Deputy.  I told the Deputy and the deputation that came with him that I was prepared, if they would put forward a proposal from the Beet Growers' Association which purported to represent the best growers, to make a payment of a premium to any farmer who brought good, dry wheat with a substantial bushel weight to the mill, and a corresponding reduction for the farmer who brought dirty wheat, inferior wheat, such as I am now having to abstract from the corpus of what we have in stock to convert it into animal feeding. Under the Fianna Fáil Administration the man who tore the wheat out of the field and brought it wet in the bags to the mill got precisely the same price as the man who sweated blood to try to bring the crop to the mill in as good a condition as possible, in the circumstances in which he had to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that the farmer who does his best will get paid for doing it, and I want to say that the chancer who seeks to live on the bounty of his neighbour and who dumps rubbish into the mill that can be called wheat and demands the full guaranteed price, <Col N="899" /> will be salted and will get no more than his wheat is worth.  I believe that so long as this Government is in office, 85 to 90 per cent. of the wheat will qualify for the premium, and so far as the other 10 per cent. is concerned, the more it is salted the better pleased I will be.  I have told the farmers and on the consequences I stake my political survival, and I stake my political existence on this&mdash;I will cheerfully accept condemnation if I am wrong&mdash;that the farmers will produce more and will produce better crops when they are told the reason and asked to help, than they would ever produce under the lash of bailiffs, emergency men and inspectors or Guards mustered on their fences, as my predecessor announced his intention of doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> Now let us in this cereal year put this matter finally in issue.  If the policy of Deputy Smith, my predecessor, evoked a better return from the farmers than my policy evokes, I pledge myself to stand aside, so far as I am concerned, and make way for Deputy Smith, because he will be proved right and I will be proved to be wrong.  But I know, personally and vicariously, the farmers, and I will back them to do as free men twice as much as they would ever do as slaves.  We lifted the dirty, rotten, political machine of Fianna Fáil off the backs of our people and as free men they will do better in 1951 than they ever did in the 15 accursed years when Fianna Fáil was grinding them down.</P>
