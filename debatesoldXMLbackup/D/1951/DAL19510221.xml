      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimates on the basis indicated by the Deputy have not been made.  For the purpose of arriving at the contributions laid down in the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, the costs of benefits were assessed actuarially in respect of entrants into insurance at the age of 16.  Level rates of contribution were determined in the light of these figures, separate contributions being fixed for males and females, the males meeting&mdash;as pointed out in paragraph 117 of the White Paper on &ldquo;Social Security&rdquo;&mdash;in addition to the cost of their own benefits, the full cost of maternity benefits and the <Col N="385" /> benefits arising in respect of their dependent wives and families, i.e., widows' and orphans' benefits, death grants for wives, widows and children and that portion of retirement pensions received by women during widowhood.</P>
    <P>Subject to these considerations, the allocations, under the heads mentioned in the question, of the ordinary rates of contribution in respect of entrants at the age of 16 are given in the following table:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated numbers of recipients of retirement pensions on which the estimates of cost furnished in the White Paper on &ldquo;Social Security&rdquo; were based are as follows: &mdash;First full year: 25,000; fifth full year: 37,600.  Corresponding figures for the tenth and twentieth years are 52,700 and 74,300 respectively.  No estimate has been made of the number in the thirtieth year nor of the number of recipients of old age pensions in any of the years mentioned.</P>
      <P>Any attempt to relate the numbers of recipients of retirement pensions to reductions in the number of old age pensioners must take into account the fact that whereas, in the latter case, the age from which pensions are payable is 70 years, in the former it is 65 for men and 60 for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> With regard to the estimated number of contributors to the scheme, it was stated in paragraph 109 of the White Paper that the calculations of annual costs were based on the figure of 700,000 contributors and that this figure was not changed to allow for any assumed change or trend in the future. The Deputy will appreciate that if such change or trend reveals itself the figures I have given might need revision.</P>

      <P>As the reply contains a tabular statement, I am, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, having it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The cost of the benefits provided under the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950, cannot be estimated with any precision, in view of the absence of any information as to the extent to which farmers may avail themselves of the provisions of Clause 66 of the Bill, and also in view of Clause 4 (5) which provides that employments may by regulation be either excluded or included in the scheme with or without modifications.</P>
      <P>The estimates furnished in paragraph 113 of the White Paper on &ldquo;Social Security&rdquo; were in respect of the first full year of the scheme.  Similar figures are given in the following table for the fifth, tenth and twentieth years, but no estimate has been made in respect of the thirtieth year.</P>

      <P>Estimates of the cost of non-contributory old age pensions for the years mentioned by the Deputy have not been made.  It was pointed out in paragraph 122 of the White Paper on &ldquo;Social Security&rdquo; that, for various reasons, it is well-nigh impossible to secure anything like accurate estimates of savings on the assistance schemes and the figures there given were furnished, as stated, with the greatest reserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question which the Deputy asked and, if he looks at his question, he will observe that fact.  There is an actuarial cost which is the basis of the White Paper. The White Paper has been arrived at by ascertaining what liabilities will fall on the fund in respect of persons who were in the insured classes.  The Deputy is raising a question now in respect of non-contributory old age pensions which relate to non-insured <Col N="388" /> persons and which have no actuarial foundation whatever, the money being voted annually by Parliament without any regard to any actuarial basis.</P>

It is estimated, however, that the number of members at that date was approximately 667,000.  Information is not available regarding the number of members who, for the year 1949-50, surrendered cards bearing (b) not less than 48 contributions, (c) not less than 30 contributions, and (d) 16 contributions and under.  To compile such information would involve considerable time and labour which would not be justified.  (e) Figures of the numbers of voluntary contributors of the National Health Insurance Society are available as at the end of each year only.  The number of such contributors at 31st December, 1947, was 1,950.  The number at 31st December, 1950, was 2,037.</P>

      <P>The erection of a new boys' school at Malahide is regarded as a very urgent matter and has been so regarded for some time. Before the Department can proceed with final arrangements for the erection of the school it will be necessary to have the site vested in the trustees. Delay has been occasioned up to now by reason of the fact that certain difficulties existed in connection with the provision of evidence of title to the site.  I understand that these have been so far resolved that it is expected that the proof of title required in order to enable the site to be vested in trustees by an official lease will be forthcoming at an early date.  Every effort is being made to have this and other necessary preliminary arrangements completed as soon as possible so that a grant towards the cost of the new school may be sanctioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose a Chinn Chomhairle, with your permission, to <Col N="400" /> take Questions Nos. 43, 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some comment has been made on the issue of the butter ration in the form of imported butter. This butter is first quality Danish butter, and I am glad to avail of this opportunity of extending the common courtesy to our Danish friends of saying that there are no grounds whatever for complaint in regard to its quality, on which it would be hard to improve.</P>
      <P>It is true that the flavour and texture is not quite the same as that to which consumers in Ireland have become accustomed over a period of years and it is gratifying to Irish farmers to learn how keenly appreciated the special quality of Irish butter now is, thus providing an exception to the general rule that none are prophets in their own country. At a time, however, when the butter ration, not to speak of supplementary supplies, is at a higher level in this country than any other country in Europe, I cannot agree that anyone has genuine cause to complain if that ration consists of the highest quality butter obtainable in Europe outside Ireland.  The necessity to import butter arises from the unexpectedly inclement weather which we experienced in the concluding months of 1950 with a consequential diminution in domestic production, combined with the fact that the unprecedented prosperity of our people fortunately enabled them to consume more butter in 1950 than they have ever consumed in recorded history before.  It is noteworthy in this connection, as this fact was present to our minds when making our calculations, that on the only previous occasions when a similar quantity of butter was produced in Ireland, i.e., 1935 and 1936, when over 800,000 cwt. were produced, domestic consumption amounted to no more than 352,000 cwt., and 372,000 cwt., respectively, as compared with 745,000 cwt. in 1950, thus permitting an export in 1935 and 1936 of 473,000 cwt. and 460,000 cwt., respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this, although the quantity of milk supplied to creameries was greater in 1950 than in <Col N="401" /> any previous year, except 1936, an increasing diversion of milk to other industrial processes justified the payment of up to 1/7 per gallon for milk in lieu of 1/2 payable for milk converted into butter and has resulted in the total butter production from a given quantity of milk supplied to creameries diminishing.  It is not proposed to restrict this method of user in the future, so as to reduce the farmer's receipts for his milk by not less than 5d. per gallon of any milk directed into butter production at the expense of other systems of user.</P>

The Kerry Board of Conservators has warned a number of fishermen in the Cromane area against the continued practice of illegal methods of fishing <Col N="409" /> which are detrimental to the livelihood of the fishing community of that area, thereby giving fair notice, which the board is in no way obliged to give, that if illegal methods of fishing continue, the fishing gear being used will be seized and the offending fishermen prosecuted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that the question raised by the Deputy is one of some complexity and difficulty, but I do not think the Deputy can ask me to approve breaches of the statute law, and the law of Oireachtas Eireann provides that you must not use a pusher net, which is, within the meaning of the Act, a fixed engine, and must not fish between certain hours in any given week.  These laws are made for the protection of nobody but the fishermen fishing in these waters, because, if such methods are employed and if constant fishing takes place, the supply of salmon to these waters will simply disappear.  I think the Deputy will realise that it must be a matter of indifference to any Minister for Fisheries how or when men fish, provided it does not result in the ultimate obliteration of the fishery.  This is a matter I shall be glad to discuss with the Deputy, but I assure him that any precautions at present being enforced are being enforced solely for the protection of the livelihood of the fishermen of this Cromane area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) whether he has received representations regarding the flooding of lands adjacent to the Shannon north and south of Athlone; (b) whether he has considered the tentative recommendation of the drainage commission to deepen and widen the river between Athlone and Meelick; (c) what justification there was, in the light of representations made to him, for the refusal of the commission to recommend the building of levees on the ground of expense, and (d) the action, if any, he intends taking to deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been received over many years regarding flooding of lands along the Shannon.  It is evident from the report of the drainage commission that before a decision can be taken on their tentative recommendations, considerable survey work and technical investigation of the whole problem and possibly some experimental treatment will be necessary.  It is also clear from their report that, owing to the physical conditions in the Shannon catchment, the possibility of economic drainage is limited as compared with other catchment areas.  The available staff of the <Col N="414" /> Commissioners of Public Works is fully occupied on the survey, designing and execution of schemes in other areas where flooding is no less serious, and in which remedial measures, capable of adoption within relatively shorter periods, are more likely to produce a greater economic return.</P>
      <P>The natural difficulties presented by the absence of fall in the stretch between Athlone and Meelick, and the unsuitable nature of the soil for the formation of embankments works, render the possibility of a satisfactory scheme exceedingly remote.  It is not possible at present to say when the investigation of the problem can be taken up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 66, 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The poor law valuation of land is not affected by the execution of a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. The entire construction cost of the scheme will be met from State funds. When the time comes for the county council to assume their statutory obligation of meeting the cost of maintenance of the completed works, some increase in poor rates may result, but, being a county-at-large charge, the maintenance cost will be distributed over the ratepayers of the entire county irrespective of whether they have or have not any land improved by the scheme.</P>
      <P>The observations received by the Commissioners of Public Works on the scheme, as exhibited, contain some objections on matters of detail, but no objection to the scheme as a whole.  It is unlikely that any more than a small amount of the current year's provision of £20,000 can be spent before the 31st March, 1951, but a substantial provision is being put forward to finance the work, which will start early in the coming summer.</P>

      <P>A District Court clerk of the class described in the question holds pensionable office under and in accordance with the provisions of the Superannuation Acts, provided he has been granted a certificate of qualification by the Civil Service Commissioners under the Civil Service Regulations Acts or under Section 62 of the Court Officers Act, 1926.  Service in the capacity of Dáil court clerk or registrar does not, however, count for pension purposes as, in no case, has unestablished service prior to the 1st January, 1927, been allowed so to count.</P>
      <P>Only a small number of clerks have, in fact, up to the present obtained certificates of qualification.  It is expected, however, that under Section 3 of the Court Officers Bill, which is at present before the Dáil, a large number of clerks who are still unestablished, including some who had given service in connection with Dáil courts, will be eligible for the grant of certificates of qualification and will be able thereby to acquire pensionable status.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has seen the statement issued by Mr. D.J. O'Donovan and published in the Press with regard to his dismissal from the office of secretary to the Department of Social Welfare and whether he will make a statement to the Dáil on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Donovan was removed from the office of secretary of the Department of Social Welfare for persistent failure to obey instructions properly given to him.  These instructions were given to him by the Minister for Social Welfare twice on the 11th January, 1951, and again on the 6th February.  They were given to him by me on the 3rd February and again on the 10th February.  Finally, the directions were given by the Government as a whole and conveyed to Mr. O'Donovan by me on the 12th February. It was not until Mr. O'Donovan had made his persistence in his attitude clear, in his reply to the directions from the Government as a whole, that the Government decided, later on the 12th February, that his removal from office was unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter had its origin in a question raised by Mr. O'Donovan in regard to an officer of the Department of Social Welfare, towards whom, in <Col N="423" /> Mr. O'Donovan's view, disciplinary action required to be considered. Having previously submitted a report to the Minister for Social Welfare on the circumstances concerning this officer, Mr. O'Donovan, on the evening of Tuesday, the 9th January, 1951, mentioned to the Minister the desirability of an early discussion of the officer's position.  The Minister agreed to have such a discussion.  During the remainder of that evening and on the 10th and 11th January, the Minister was fully occupied in attending to official business of the highest importance, and for most of that time he was in constant consultation, on that business, with me and other members of the Government.  Among the matters engaging his attention were the strike of the bank officials and the discussions with representatives of the Government of the Six Counties on the future of the Great Northern Railway.  Being preoccupied with these important matters, the Minister was unable to find time to discuss with Mr. O'Donovan the matter which concerned the officer to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, the 11th January, Mr. O'Donovan wrote informing his Minister that he proposed to suspend the officer concerned from duty and pay and, immediately, without waiting further for his Minister's decision, he proceeded to take this action with effect from the following day.  On receipt of Mr. O'Donovan's notification, the Minister at once directed Mr. O'Donovan, in writing, that the officer should not be suspended, and on the same day&mdash;that is, on the 11th January, the day proceeding the effective date of the suspension&mdash;Mr. O'Donovan replied in terms implying that he was not prepared to accept this direction. The Minister then repeated&mdash;again on the 11th January&mdash;his direction in writing.  This direction was, likewise, ignored.</P>
    <P>On his return, on the 26th January, from an absence due to illness, Mr. O'Donovan again wrote to the Minister, intimating, in effect, his adherence to his attitude of declining to accept the Minister's direction in <Col N="424" /> regard to the suspension of the officer concerned.  On Saturday, the 3rd February, the Minister informed me of the position and handed me the relevant papers, which I read.  I then addressed to Mr. O'Donovan a letter in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Tánaiste has submitted to me the file relating to directions which he recently gave you in reference to the suspension of an officer of the Department of Social Welfare and with which you have declined to comply.  It is your right and duty to make proper submissions to the Minister within the scope of your functions, but having done so, it is your clear duty loyally to obey directions of the Minister and to carry his decisions into effect promptly and without question.  I now formally direct that you give immediate effect to his decision in this particular case and to do so in all future matters affecting the administration of his Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I received from Mr. O'Donovan a letter dated the 6th February which I could interpret only as a refusal to comply with the directions contained in my letter of the 3rd February.</P>
    <P>On the 6th February, the Tánaiste addressed a minute to Mr. O'Donovan instructing him to arrange for the immediate payment of the full salary for January of the officer concerned. Mr. O'Donovan, in a minute of the same date, stated conditions on which he was prepared to pay the salary, but evaded the main issue, namely, whether or not he was prepared to accept the Minister's directions and those contained in my letter of the 3rd February.</P>
    <P>During the following days, the secretary of the Department of Finance and the secretary to the Government, with my approval, had a number of informal conversations with Mr. O'Donovan, in which they endeavoured to impress on him that the Government would be obliged to take the gravest view of failure on his part to carry out the directions which had been given to him. In those conversations, it was also clearly stated to Mr. O'Donovan that there is not inherent in the secretary of a Department any power or <Col N="425" /> authority which would enable him to override his Minister's directions, even on financial and staff matters and that, even as accounting officer, the secretary of a Department must accept directions from his Minister where the Minister overrules his advice.  Mr. O'Donovan was informed that both the Tánaiste and I were anxious that a collision on this matter should be avoided but that, at the same time, we wished that the unquestionable principle of ministerial authority and responsibility should be preserved.  He was urged to comply with the directions given to him, that is, to remove the suspension of the officer concerned and to give directions for the payment of the balance of the officer's salary for January, which had been withheld, and it was pointed out to him that the way would then be clear for consideration of the matters affecting the officer which he had raised.</P>
    <P>I addressed a further letter to Mr. O'Donovan on Saturday, the 10th February, in which I repeated the previous directions in the most precise terms and asked for an immediate unequivocal reply.  In this letter, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I interpret your letter of the 6th instant to me as being a refusal to comply with the directions contained in my letter of the 3rd instant.  Lest, however, your letter may be capable of another interpretation and you did not wish to convey to me a clear refusal to obey my instructions, I now, having had consultations with the Minister for Social Welfare, direct you (1) to inform Mr. O'Driscoll to-day that his suspension from duty and pay has been removed with effect from the 12th January, 1951, and (2) to arrange for the payment to the officer to-day of any unpaid balance of the salary which, in the normal course, would have been paid to him on the 31st January.</P>
    <P>When you have carried out these directions, please inform me at once, in writing, to that effect.</P>
    <P>If, however, you decline to carry out these directions, please inform me to that effect in unequivocal terms.</P>
    <P>The issue now does not concern whether or not the officer concerned <Col N="426" /> should have been suspended&mdash;your Minister informed you in his first minute of the 11th January of his intention to examine the whole matter personally.  Unfortunately, you have raised graver issues.  You have failed, on three occassions, to comply with clear directions given to you by your Minister and, on one occasion, to comply with equally clear directions given to you by me, as the head of the Government.</P>
    <P>As, no doubt, you fully realise, the Government would be obliged to take the gravest view of failure on your part to carry out the directions conveyed to you in this letter.  I understand that this fact has been made clear to you in the course of informal discussions which the secretary of the Department of Finance and the secretary to the Government have had with you during the past four days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Donovan having replied, again intimating refusal to carry out the directions, the position was considered, on the morning of Monday the 12th instant, by the Government, who decided that directions from themselves, repeating those previously given by the Tánaiste and by me, should immediately be conveyed to Mr. O'Donovan.  I conveyed the Government's directions to Mr. O'Donovan, who replied declining to obey them.  On the evening of the 12th February, the Government removed Mr. O'Donovan from the office of secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and from the Civil Service, deciding, at the same time, that he should be awarded the maximum benefits, by way of superannuation, that were permissible in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>In his statement, Mr. O'Donovan appears to suggest that the secretary of a Department of State has vested in him powers, the precise nature of which he does not attempt to define, entitling him to reject the instructions of his Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government as a whole and to act in accordance with his own judgment, opposed to their, of what is right and proper in the administration of the Department.  If any such suggestion were accepted, the powers of government <Col N="427" /> would, in effect, be transferred to the Civil Service from the public representatives who are selected in accordance with the Constitution to exercise those powers.</P>
    <P>In law and in fact, the secretary of a Department is subordinate to his Minister in every matter pertaining to the administration of the Department. By express statutory provision, the Minister is the head of the Department, while the secretary is the principal officer.  As such, the secretary has the right and duty of making proper submissions to his Minister, within the scope of his functions; but, having done so, he has imposed on him the clear duty of loyalty obeying the Minister's directions and carrying his decisions into effect promptly and without question.  When the secretary of a Department is also the accounting officer for moneys voted by the Dáil, he is, in that capacity, required to answer to the Committee of Public Accounts; but, even then, an express direction from the Minister, to whom, as the head of his Department, he is responsible, is sufficient to relieve him of his responsibility in respect of any particular payment.</P>
    <P>The essential issue, therefore, is the maintenance of the authority of the Government and of the particular member of the Government to whom a Department is assigned by the Taoiseach, as against any assumed authority of the civil servant who is appointed by the Government as the principal officer of that Department. Whether or not the particular officer referred to by Mr. O'Donovan merited suspension or any other disciplinary action is quite beside the point.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Donovan refers to previous suspensions of officers of the Department of Social Welfare, imposed by him or by officers subordinate to him, and states that: &ldquo;In none of those cases was any question raised by the Minister as to the propriety of the action taken or as to the power of the officer to take it.&rdquo;  These, however, were cases in which the Minister's authority could, in the circumstances, be assumed with moral certainty.  The <Col N="428" /> particular case that has been referred to in connection with Mr. O'Donovan's removal from office was in a different category.  This is clear from the facts, mentioned by Mr. O'Donovan himself, that a report on the circumstances concerning this particular officer was submitted by Mr. O'Donovan to the Minister for Social Welfare and that, two days before Mr. O'Donovan suspended the officer, he mentioned to the Minister the desirability of an early discussion of the officer's position. Evidently, therefore, Mr. O'Donovan did not consider, before the 11th January, that he had any power, vested in himself, to take disciplinary action towards the officer, or that he was in a position to assume that any action he might wish to take would have the approval of the Minister. He seems to have realised, until that date, that the matter was one requiring full consideration by the Minister personally and a decision given by the Minister following such consideration.</P>
    <P>At the end of his statement, Mr. O'Donovan refers to a letter which I addressed to him shortly after his removal from office.  I consider it desirable to inform the House of the terms of that letter, which is dated the 14th February.  They are as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An official letter has already been sent to you intimating that, on the 12th instant, the Government decided to remove you from the office of secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and from the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>It was with great regard that the Government found this decision forced upon them by your persistent refusal, during the past month, to carry out directions given to you, first, by your Minister, then by me as the head of the Government and, finally, by the Government themselves. I should like to add that the Government, and I personally, appreciate the services which you rendered during your previous career in the public service.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In reply to the interruption, I want to say, if I may, that we are approaching this in a very different spirit from the spirit shown by a previous Opposition when a matter of this sort came to be dealt with. I simply wanted also to refer to a matter which is disturbing the public mind in this connection.  The Taoiseach may be able to relieve anxiety in regard to it.  It is this: the Minister's telling the officer who was suspended that he was to report for duty, notwithstanding the suspension which had been imposed by his superior officer, was cutting at the root of all discipline.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am afraid this is developing into a debate on the matter, with your permission, I will answer the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition because it would not be proper that the statement that he has made here should go to the public unchallenged.  The Minister for Social Welfare directed the officer concerned to remain on duty because the secretary of the Department had twice on that day refused to obey his directions, and because of this&mdash;that in the first direction that was given by the Minister to the secretary of his Department not to suspend this officer, he had stated specifically his reason for it, that in his view there was no evidence against the officer justifying his suspension and that he would personally go into the whole matter as soon as it was possible to arrive at a time.</P>

It was on the documents before him that the Tánaiste said: &ldquo;I see no evidence to justify it but in any event I will discuss the whole matter with you personally and do not suspend this man.&rdquo;  In the teeth of that, the secretary persisted in suspending the officer and in refusing to pay this married man with five children, who had done the work, the salary the Minister believed he was entitled to, in the absence of any charge being proved against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 10, to delete all words after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 51, to the end of the sub-section and substitute the following: &ldquo;appoint advisory committees consisting of members of the council&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As you have said, a Chinn Chomhairle, this is one of the principal amendments to the Bill in that it deals with the whole question of the appointment of executive committees.  In the course of the debate last week, one of the Deputies of the Government Party made the rather astonishing admission that, if county managers had not exercised excessive authority in the first two or three years of their office, part of the psychological objection to the county managerial idea and to the use of the name &ldquo;county manager&rdquo; might never have arisen.  It was an interesting admission because the same Deputy implied quite clearly that when the Minister for Local Government of that date gave directions, I think, on three occasions to each member&mdash;one was the notice issued to members of local authorities entitled &ldquo;Powers and Functions of Elected Members of Local Bodies, 1945&rdquo;&mdash;he did advise local authorities that, in fact, they possessed more authority than they imagined, that they could make use of the County Management Act to exercise their authority, that they could avail of the county manager's advice on the year to year working of each department of the local authority and, in so doing, exercise what would, in fact, be very wide powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> It was a most valuable admission, on the part of a Deputy from the Government side, that, apparently, the Minister's directions to the local authorities were not given early enough, and that, if they had been given earlier, the objection that arose later might not have occurred.  The facts were that the Government of the day deliberately postponed any action of the kind until the county managers had performed their duties for a few years, until they were properly installed and, above all, until the worst of the emergency was over.  At the time that they were appointed the war was still on, housing was at a low ebb and road maintenance expenditure was at a low ebb.  It was a matter of carrying on from day to day.  There was very little short-term planning to be done except in connection with emergency matters, and it was felt wise to allow the managers to proceed and see how the system worked.  But, from 1944 onwards, as I have said, three different sets of directions, suggestions or proposals were given.  I can hardly call them directions.  They were proposals as to the way in which the Act was to be operated.  The most important was the one which I have cited.  It was issued in 1945.  In that publication, a paragraph occurs which is the underlying factor in the amendment which I have moved.  The paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every local body retains the right to elect persons to be members of another body.  They also can decide on committees to be appointed to exercise reserved functions for supervisory powers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If, for instance, a council decided to appoint a roads committee to consider the roads estimate and to obtain information from time to time about road plans and works, it would be within their power to appoint such a committee. Similarly, a council could appoint a committee to perform reserved functions or exercise supervisory powers in relation to any matter which arose within a particular portion of the county: committees for housing, for town planning, for the estimates, for school meals and for the general purposes <Col N="439" /> existing in a county borough.  In other words, where the county managerial system had been in operation prior to the County Management Act, these committees were in operation, and there was a clear precedent for them to be formed within a county council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>To whom were those proposals circulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>To all the members of local authorities, to the county managers and to the secretaries of county councils.  In other words, what the Minister was proposing was an experiment in revising the operation of the County Management Act, on a voluntary basis, within the law as it stood, to see how far members of local authorities could act in an executive capacity, while at the same time ensuring that the administrative machinery would run smoothly under one single head, namely, the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, from that day onwards the practice varied very widely.  I may be wrong, but I believe there are some councils to-day where there are very few such advisory committees. There are other councils where they have estimate committees, roads committees, public health committees, housing committees and sewerage and water committees.  I can say this, that before this Bill is enacted and at the present time, there are a great many counties where, in connection with housing, for example, the sites of the houses, the cost of them, the design of them, the period of the building of them and any peculiar features in connection with their construction, are considered in great detail by the members of the county council and the county manager, and that in no sense does the county council in that particular area simply vote a given sum of money, to which is added the Government subsidy, and then proceed to tell the county manager to erect so many houses in the county, of which so many shall be in the county area, and so many in the town area.  Nothing of the kind occurs. The plans are discussed in detail at every stage, not only before the <Col N="440" /> tenders are invited for the houses, but after the tenders have been accepted, in connection with the general construction of the houses.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House do not want to prolong this debate unnecessarily because this is a highly technical matter, and the discussion could become very wearisome.  I hope the Minister will accept that from me, because the fact is that we have Deputies on this side of the House who can testify to the work that is being done by members of committees which are, in fact, advisory committees, and which, in fact, do work in connection with all the powers exercised by the county manager which are not scheduled functions, employment functions or tenancy functions. These latter are now to be termed, under a later section of the Act, executive functions.  As I have said, that principle has been adopted by many local authorities.  We, on this side of the House, wish it to be extended.  We have no objection to this Bill in so far as it can extend the working of voluntary advisory committees. If the Minister wishes to make it obligatory to have a number of such advisory committees, we have no objection.  If the Minister wishes to control, in some way or other, even the method by which such committees are elected we have no objection, provided the system is left flexible; but we do feel very strongly that the Government's decision to appoint executive committees, and, with some executive committees, individual health committees raises a very important issue in connection with the whole function of county councils.  It raises the question of how far, in fact, the members are to act as civil servants and how far as elected members of the local authorities: the question of how frequently it is intended they are to meet, and as to how frequently the Minister thinks they will meet, and to what extent it would be possible, after Section 16 is passed and enacted with all the numerous subsequent sections which hang upon it, for the average county councillor to be a part-time worker for his local community, and as to how far, having to attend so many meetings, he will, more or less, <Col N="441" /> become a professional county councillor by being obliged to attend meetings a great many times a week in order to do all this kind of work.  We believe, moreover, that these executive committees should have been given the power and the executive functions which are taken away from the county council.  That is a power which should be theirs.  We believe that ultimately the county council should have the supreme authority in regard to executive functions, and that it should not delegate such functions to the executive committees if it is decided to define by law the powers which county councils have already got under existing legislation, namely, the scheduled functions.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, in this Bill there is no limiting provision in regard to how often these committees can meet.  There is no limiting provision as to how often travelling expenses can be incurred for attendance at meetings of these committees.  Apart from their election, they can, apparently, meet as often as they want to, and do as much or as little work as they want to.  We claim that a great deal of their work, if done wholly by them and not delegated to the county officer who in turn may delegate it to another officer, will be in the nature of Civil Service work which is not their business as it is not the business of this House to be responsible for the day to day working of administration.  As I have said, the advisory committees, such as we propose, can do all the planning they want to.  They can ask the manager any question they want to, and they can question any act of the manager under the existing law. They can direct the manager by special resolution which, if necessary, can be amended, if the Minister so desires, to be more direct and more immediate in character, a special resolution which can be found in the old County Management Act.  But that they should act as civil servants, that they should be given an opportunity of doing the vast amount of work that is done from hour to hour by the county manager and which should be done by him seems to us most illadvised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> We are, therefore, moving this amendment, which is very inadequate in the sense that it would really mean, if adopted, a recasting of Part III of the Bill.  I quite recognise that the amendment could not be taken by itself and the Bill left in the same form.  Part III would have to be entirely withdrawn and re-enacted in a different form once amendment No. 29 was adopted.  The amendment is put down as the best way of describing our view with regard to the situation: that the Minister, having decided what should be the functions reserved to county managers, what should be the functions reserved to what we believe should be the local authority, should then direct the local authorities to appoint advisory committees to the number they wish, have some responsibility in regard to their formation and operation, some responsibility in regard to how soon they should decide which functions they wish to carry out from week to week and month to month, and give them some direction in regard to the amount of expenses in travelling and other costs which can be incurred.  The adoption of the amendment would be a full evolutionary step in the progress of the working of county councils, an actual evolutionary step causing very little trouble to county councils, giving them the opportunity of feeling their way, encouraging those who have not formed those advisory committees to form them, encouraging them to move by gradual stages towards having greater power of supervision over the county manager than they have had in certain cases.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are some county councils where the result of the present proposal will be more expense, more administrative complication, more officials attending those meetings, more officials to record the speeches made at those meetings, more officials to co-ordinate the work of the county manager with the work of the committees, and more time taken. Our amendment allows a gradual process to be evolved which will not immediately result in an enormous complication of administrative red tape which arises inevitably when there are a great number of statutory <Col N="443" /> meetings directed to do certain things in certain ways at certain times in certain manners and to delegate their responsibility according to a prescribed formula to another officer or not to delegate it.</P>
    <P>Our point, therefore, is, as I said, a gradual evolution of this principle of the advisory committee.  It is regrettable that there are some county councils&mdash;I would be unable to name them now because I only know those who have&mdash;who have not gone nearly far enough in the direction of appointing these committees.  There is no reason under the present law why, in advance of the striking of a rate, a county council should not form itself into an estimates committee exactly the same as this House and gradually bring together all the main items of costs, take the costs for the coming year, assemble them together, and consider the whole lot in committee, proceeding finally to the striking of the rate.  The Minister cannot deny that it is entirely possible for county councils to do that at present.  There is nothing to prevent them having this advisory committee for that purpose.  Councils vary widely in regard to that practice. Some of them, more or less, do that, others of them have a rates committee and an estimates committee, but perhaps do not enter in very great detail into a discussion of the estimates.</P>
    <P>Our amendment encourages them to indulge in such activities and, as far as it is possible, to copy the procedure of this House at the time of the Estimates and to do so having regard to the very great difference in the character of the bodies concerned.  I should not make too close a comparison with the central authority because, as I said before, an attempt was made by some Deputies to hoodwink the public in regard to the amount of authority which local authorities have in any event.  So far as I know, 99 per cent. of their money, if not 100 per cent., is spent with the consent of the Minister of the day and on the advice of officers of his Department and the Minister has not made the smallest attempt, so far <Col N="444" /> as I know, in any matter, to alter that principle.  Every penny spent on housing and sewerage and on certain types of roads is subject to ministerial control and approval.  There is a whole mass of regulations and laws in regard to the manner in which even the rate is struck.  County councils are compelled by the Minister to spend enough money on every service to satisfy a standard proclaimed by him as being essential in the public interest.  Under the Public Assistance Act and a number of other enactments, they are bound to spend a sum of money which, in his view, is sufficient to defray the expenses and to maintain a good standard.  Therefore, the powers left to a local authority with regard to a high or low rate and all the calculations leading thereto are limited by ministerial authority.  They are bound to spend a certain amount and, if they spend more than a certain amount, the Minister can catch them in connection with permission to raise loans and in connection with a number of other enactments.  He can prevent them spending too much and he can prevent them spending too little.  It is absurd for Deputies to talk as if local authorities were little Parliaments of their own when everyone knows that that is the position.  As I said, the comparison with this House is limited. I merely mentioned the question of our having a committee on estimates as being one matter in which there could be some parallel in local authorities and our amendment substituting advisory committees enables that to be done to the extent to which it is not being done already.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other sections following upon this upon which, although our amendments have been struck out, it will be necessary for us to say a few words showing how we wish other proposals to follow the main one of forming advisory committees.  I think, however, I have said enough to give some idea to the Minister of our intentions in moving the amendment. It is not done with any idea of attempting to maintain the full strength of the present managers' authority in areas where the local authority has not attempted to adapt it by custom or encouragement from the Minister. <Col N="445" /> There is no attempt on our part to disagree with the Minister that an evolutionary change in the managerial system is overdue, but to encourage him in carrying out that evolutionary change.  Our objection is to the complication that will arise from these executive committees and the number required.  There are other complications, such as the effect of Section 16 in connection with certain counties and so forth.  I can well leave that to other Deputies.  I am trying to give an overall picture of this.  Other Deputies who wish to speak on it in so far as it affects their particular areas can speak more usefully than I can because it is difficult to speak generally on the matter.  This matter requires a great deal of detailed discussion and I ask the Minister to consider it on its merits without prejudice.  As I said, it is an effort to cause an evolutionary change in the county managerial system without creating a great increase in expenditure, a great increase in administrative red tape and without encouraging county councillors to become professionals and to take far too much time in doing county council business.</P>

      <P>We are arriving at what I consider to be a vital stage in the consideration of this whole problem of local administration.  I am particularly worried by one matter.  Local administration and local government are very important from the point of view of the people.  We have had discussions on the County Management Act and on proposals to amend that Act over a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a number of Deputies who have had long experience in local administration and one would imagine that those Deputies would show some interest in this particular Bill; one would imagine that they would at least come into the House and listen to the arguments advanced in relation to it. Apparently they are not even prepared to do that.  Apparently they are only prepared to troop in if a division is challenged and vote on one side or the other.  Obviously they are not prepared to contribute anything towards improving the Bill at this stage.  So far as I am concerned, I shall either continue in my endeavours to improve <Col N="446" /> the Bill or I shall simply throw the whole thing up and ask myself: why waste my time in regard to the Bill? I think in a measure of this kind, which affects the whole country and every local authority in the country, there should at least be a quorum.  I shall not proceed until there is a quorum present.</P>

      <P>I hope the Whips will take note of what I have said, because the division bell will ring very often if Deputies show themselves uninterested in the subject matter of this very important Bill.  Deputy Childers has put forward a very reasonable argument in regard to county administration. So far as I can follow his argument, he suggests that, instead of having those two executive committees, the council should have as many advisory committees as it thinks necessary, that these advisory committees would report back to the council and the council would act on the advice received as they thought fit.  I have one difficulty in regard to his argument. Does the Deputy intend that certain powers previously exercised by the manager, and which are now to be exercised by executive committees under this Bill, should still be exercised by the county officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the difficulty I had.  If these powers are to be exercised by the county council as a whole we get back then to the idea of restoring to democratic councils certain powers which have been exercised by managers up to the present.  A question then arises: in the amendments I have down, following on the amendment of Deputy Childers, I propose to allow these two executive committees to <Col N="447" /> remain but, instead of consisting of a small number of councillors, I propose that they will consist of all the councillors. I think it will be necessary in this connection to discuss the principle of my amendment at the same time as Deputy Childers' amendment is under discussion.  The same point arises.</P>
      <P>Knowing the constitution of a number of county councils throughout the country, knowing what happens when members are elected as representatives of different committees, knowing that they are influenced now and again by political considerations and knowing that now and again a certain section of the council can combine to refuse representation to another section, which is only a little less in strength than they are, I can conceive some difficulty arising in the election of these executive committees.  I have, therefore, an objection to the appointment of small executive committees because, instead of having executive committees really representative of the council, one will have an executive committee, elected as it is under this proportional representation vote, which will to some extent be representative but may nevertheless result in some councillors of outstanding ability being deprived of the opportunity of rendering valuable service to the people who elected them.  Executive functions are very important functions.  They appear to be very important functions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty arises, however, that a particular county councillor may be a most estimable man in his own area; he may have been elected with a very large majority but, under the system proposed in this Bill, that very estimable councillor may be deprived of the right of rendering valuable service as a member of either of these two important executive committees to the people who elected him.  That is a serious defect in the Bill, since a substantial part of the work of a county council will be done in future in these two executive committees, and what I have proposed is that these two executive committees should consist of all the members of the council.  They should have a small quorum.  If a councillor wants or does not want to <Col N="448" /> attend, that is a matter for himself, but if he can attend and is desirous of attending and anxious to render service, then he ought not to be prevented from doing so by the machinery set up in this Bill and by that particular piece of machinery envisaged in this Bill you are, in effect, depriving elected representatives of the people of doing the work of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the Bill and see how difficult it is to keep them apart.  Although there may be mechanical difficulties about discussing them together, it probably would have been better if they were discussed together and the decision taken on them afterwards.  Deputy Childers says that instead of electing two committees, the council should elect small advisory committees as they wish and let the council have full authority to deal with recommendations of the advisory committee.  If there are to be two executive committees they should consist of all the members of the council.  It is pretty difficult to separate and segregate them.  I think that the executive committee idea is a better idea, as the executive committees will consist of all the members of the council and not a selected few.</P>
      <P>As I was saying, when the Minister intervened, we are sent up here as Deputies of the Dáil representing the people and if very essential work of the Dáil was to be done by a small body, say, on financial matters, I think there would be grave objection to it.  I think the same principle of objection should arise as far as local authorities are concerned.  However, there are a number of other points that I should like to put forward in regard to it but, perhaps, I would be able to make them better after hearing the Minister's view in regard to Deputy Childers' amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="449" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I intervene is that I consider there was a very great difference between the two points put forward in Deputy Cowan's amendment and in Deputy Childers' amendment. Deputy Childers spoke very eloquently in support of his amendment, but it is very simple to analyse this matter.  The Bill proposes to have the county council supplied with two executive committees.  Certain functions are transferred to them that were formerly held by the county manager.  That is going to add very much to the work of the county council. The manager has been left just three items, tenancy functions, employment and individual health functions.  That is all that has been left to the manager. All between that and the scheduled functions will be executive functions. It is proposed that the work will be carried out by two executive committees, a health committee and a general committee.  Deputy Childers suggests that there be not executive committees but advisory committees. What will the advisory committees do? In the normal day-to-day executive work of the council I suggest that it would be no help to the council to have advisory committees.  They would not have power to grant home assistance. They would sit solemnly and recommend back to the council that John Blank be paid so-and-so.  They will have a long list of things to do in regard to housing, town planning, sanitation, etc., but if they merely sit down and advise the county council, if they merely make recommendations to them, they will not have done anything.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, the members are entrusted with power to do practical work, and the work they do on a particular day is done and accomplished. When you come to the business proper of the council, the provision of sewers, houses, sanitation schemes, etc., these ought to be done by somebody, and the question is will the whole council do them or a committee who will have power to do so?  Deputy Childers' amendments were, to say the least of it, contradictory.  In some places, he gives to the county officer a continuance of the powers that the county manager had.  The Bill determines what the executive functions are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> I intervened in the discussion because in another amendment Deputies Cowan, Desmond and Kyne admit the principle of the executive committees. That is a different thing entirely&mdash; whether it is to be a whole house committee or a committee of a section of the house.  I could not see eye to eye at all with Deputy Childers.  The council could not work and this Bill would be ineffective, if we were to depend on advisory committees and not executive committees.  The health and general committees will have cleared their respective portions of it, merely reporting back to the council that the work is done and get on with their scheduled functions.  I do not see any force in the appointment of the committees suggested by the Deputy, and I do not know why he should depart from the executive committee to the advisory committee.  Deputy MacEntee, during the Second Reading debate, was in favour of these committees and expressed the view that they were one of the good features of the Bill.  I believe that anybody studying it carefully will see that the executive must have an advantage over the advisory committee, which would have no power except to keep talking and then to go back to the council to get the work done by the council.</P>

      <P>I have a very definite objection to this executive committee business as defined in Section 1 and I say that this Bill, if this principle is embodied, will be completely unworkable, at any rate, in Cork County.  I remind the Minister that Cork County is as big as three counties and I may also say that we have a far higher opinion of the Cork County Council than we have of this Dáil.  It is a superior body in every respect.</P>

      <P>Under this section, the Minister will have 15 working members in Cork County and 31 ornaments.  The members of the elected body of the council are to be cut down and we are to appoint, instead of the one manager whom we had before, 15 managers.  The other 31 members are to stand by and are to have nothing to do.  They will <Col N="451" /> not be allowed to do any business.  Any one of our three separate areas, South Cork, North Cork or West Cork, is as large as any one of the other little counties in the country.  In fact, any one of them would be nearly as big as two counties, but there is a very definite conflict of opinion as between these different portions of Cork County and the way in which we have got over that up to the present is by having the North Cork Board of Health, the South Cork Board of Health and the West Cork Board of Health dealing with housing, sanitary arrangements and so on.  These bodies are practically county councils in themselves.  They do the work and do it most satisfactorily.  All the elected representatives for the particular area are members of that committee. Under this scheme, North Cork, South Cork and West Cork are to be piled in together with 15 representatives for all to do the work, so that the other 31 might as well not be there at all.  It is a nullification of democracy &mdash;instead of having one county manager, we are to have 15 for these executive functions.</P>

I have seen this type of filing down process working already in Cork and that is why I hate it so much.  We have in Cork, a body known as the South Cork Board of Public Assistance. It is a joint body composed of members of the Cork Corporation and members of the county council and I have been the jealousy that arises between the elected representatives of South Cork when they have to select a member from amongst themselves to act on that committee.  I have been a member of that board of assistance for the past 22 or 23 years and it is because I have seen this system working there and have seen, after each county council election, the wretched position in which the representatives of that area were placed, that I have such a hatred of this system of picking out certain members to do certain <Col N="453" /> work and handing over to them all the duties which the other members as well were elected to do.  It is a ridiculous position.</P>

      <P>I am entirely against this idea of handing over administrative functions to a section of the county council.  If we are to have local government, the only sane and sensible way to have it is by the transfer of all the functions which are not reserved to the county officer to the entire council.  It is easy to understand the difficulties that will arise in the election of a small committee.  If a committee were to be elected at all, I would be in favour of the proposition that the committee be elected by proportional representation, and I have consistently advocated that that is the way the Government in this House should be elected.  That is a fair principle enough, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I favour, in certain cases, advisory committees.  There are quite a large number of minor matters which the county council could transfer to a small committee to deal with.  The committee would present a report which would be accepted <i>in globo</i> by the council, and any very long discussion would not be entailed, except where some particular matter might be singled out for discussion.  In general, however, these small committees might transact a certain amount of the minor business of the council.  In addition to that, there is the question of fairly large counties where it might be advisable to transfer to advisory committees certain local matters affecting a particular electoral area or a section of the county.  There again, a local advisory committee would report to the county council, which almost invariably would accept the recommendation unless there was something <Col N="454" /> seriously wrong.  That is being done at present in a number of counties and it is a fairly good idea, but the transfer of business from the council to a smaller body would be quite wrong and would not facilitate business in any way.  The six or seven called upon to transact the business would be ordinary members of the council and they would not be able to devote any more time than the other members.</P>
      <P>If it is desired to get the business transacted quickly, a simple way would be to prepare an agenda in such a manner that the business would be properly segregated, so that on one day the council might deal with roads, on another with health matters, and so on.  Then the members would know in advance what particular section of the whole business would be dealt with and if they could not attend at every meeting they would attend at least for those matters in which they were particularly interested.</P>

      <P>I believe that advisory committees are more desirable than committees consisting of portion of the elected members, with executive powers.  Any Deputy who worked on boards of health long ago will fully appreciate what that means.  Under this Bill, we are to take a small section <Col N="455" /> of the council and give them executive powers, without reference back to the council for any of their actions.  They are to be selected by proportional representation, but still they will be one third of the members.  In County Wexford seven out of 21 will have general executive functions and health functions.  Each of those committees will be far more powerful than the whole council.  It may be one single seven who may be on each committee.</P>

      <P>Some of them may not desire it, as they may not have the time.  Others, even though willing to work, may not be elected by the council.  It may mean that seven men out of 21 will do almost the whole work of the council.  I cannot see what functions are left to the council under this Bill.  They will be the minor body, while each of the executive committees will be a superior body.  That was one of the main reasons why the boards of health had to come to an end.  The Minister must be aware of that.</P>
      <P>This means putting the majority of the elected local representatives into an inferior position.  It means handing over to one-third of the council the determination as to how nine-tenths of the total revenue of the council is to be spent and probably leaving the council as a whole the influence on only a very small fraction of the total revenues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the council will have the right to have advisory committees instead of executive committees.  On the coming into operation of the Management Act in 1942, most councils proceeded there and then to elect advisory committees, to consider certain matters and give them minute attention and to make representations to the council.  Most councils had such committees.  They made recommendations on important financial matters, on important housing and sanitation problems, on many of the important matters that needed detailed examination and discussion before they came to the council in public.  These advisory committees operated quite successfully and gave service to their councils and to the people of the county.  There was no question or doubt about that.  It is far more desirable&mdash;though perhaps not in Cork where there is such a big council&mdash;in the ordinary council of from 21 to 26 members that the whole council should have an equal share in responsibility. The executive functions handed back to the councils are almost nil. They have been given back the function of distributing home assistance which, I believe, 99 per cent. of the councils will immediately delegate to their county officer.  I can assure the Minister that it will work out that way.  Councils with experience are common-sense men and women and realise quite fully that to have these functions performed by <Col N="457" /> the responsible officer of the county is the better way.</P>
      <P>I notice that sub-section (2) of this section provides that an elective body may elect as many committees, in the Act referred to as executive committees, as they think fit.  Most of the elective bodies are composed of nine or ten members.</P>

      <P>I am trying to prove to the House that the executive committee as visualised in this section cannot function properly or to the advantage of the councils of the counties and I cannot do that or discuss the amendment without referring to what is in the section.  An urban council or town commissioners will have nine or ten members and a corporation of a borough about 12.  Take the ten.  They will elect three or possibly four.  They can have a dozen executive committees, but to perform what functions?  It is no harm, I think, to ask that at this stage.  Very few executive functions can be handed back to the elective bodies and performed by them at the moment.  In a further section of the Bill I see where the executive committees can elect sub-committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The advisory committees which have operated for the past eight or nine years under the County Management Act have, I maintain, advised their councils and they have had an opportunity of going into all the details of administration with the county manager and all details of the executive functions performed by him. They went minutely into finances and recommended to their councils whether additional housing was required or whether sanitation schemes &mdash; very large ones sometimes &mdash; or water schemes should be undertaken. <Col N="458" /> Generally speaking, they went into details just as minutely and gave them just as much attention as did formerly the boards of health, plus the county councils.  At this time of the year when the estimates were being prepared the advisory committees which in some counties were called &ldquo;general purposes committees&rdquo;, examined in detail with the manager the estimates under the different headings.  They examined each branch of all the services functioning in the county and made detailed recommendations to their council as to the rate that should be provided under each particular heading of the services.  These executive committees will be a law unto themselves.  They will determine the full spending power, and the council, according to this section, will no longer determine what the rate should be for the county.</P>

      <P>They are minor matters and will be minor matters when this Bill becomes law.  The determination of the taxation to be raised by way of rate in a particular county will be done by a small section.  It may be done by only seven out of a council of 21. It will be determined by two committees which will be composed of the same seven persons.  It can happen that if the members do not attend the meetings of these executive committees, even one member of the council can form a quorum and can make decisions committing the whole council of the county.  Even one member of the council can make decisions as an executive committee and that will be binding in law on the council of the county.  The Bill before the House is an important measure.  It proposes to set up machinery to enable local authorities in this country to function smoothly.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Orders which the Bill confirms relate to five commodities which are in common use. These commodities are drinking glasses, peas, collapsible metal containers <Col N="460" /> for packing tooth paste and similar items, distilled water which is used for medicinal purposes in dissolving drugs such as penicillin, morphia and streptomycin.  All the industries which the Bill is designed to protect provide substantial employment in areas outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Order dealing with glasses refers to the re-establishment of a factory for the production of glass at Water ford.  I am sure Deputies will welcome the re-establishment of the glass industry there.  A new factory is at present in course of construction on another site, and it is expected that the new factory will be completed before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The duty on peas is in substitution for an earlier duty and is, in fact, a duty made by the Minister for Agriculture which is confirmed by this Order.</P>
      <P>The manufacture of collapsible metal containers has been carried on for some considerable time at Nenagh.  This industry was originally protected by a duty on tin containers and prior to the last war &ldquo;squeeze-out&rdquo; tubes were made largely of tin.</P>
      <P>The duty in respect of distilled water applies to a new industry which was recently established.  Distilled water is used in connection with a number of medicinal preparations.  The industry, in this case, is in Roscrea, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The duty on peas applies to peas grown anywhere, but in all the other cases the industries are located outside Dublin.</P>

      <P>I was going to ask the very same question.  I was going to ask about the policy of the Government in discouraging the tomato industry <Col N="461" /> in the Gaeltacht.  Everybody knows that not merely did the Government discourage the building of glasshouses in the Gaeltacht for the purpose of growing tomatoes but that they brought about a position whereby tomatoes were dumped in this country and that there was insufficient or maybe no protection at all for the native industry.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that some of these industries are being established outside Dublin. That, in itself, is welcome.  We all like to see the native industries spread over the country as much as possible.  I remember that, when we were discussing the Industrial Development Authority which was set up by the Government some time ago, I referred to the advisability of starting industries in the Gaeltacht where the population is diminishing day by day.  At that time the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave me and the House to understand that the Industrial Development Authority were fully aware of the necessity of starting industries in the Gaeltacht.  One gathered from the way he spoke that he and his Department were sympathetic towards the idea.  However, I am afraid very little progress has been made in that direction since then.</P>

However, it is for that reason that I now ask if there were some special advantages to be had by locating the factory in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions asked by Deputies Childers and Kissane could more appropriately be addressed to the Minister for Agriculture.  I do <Col N="462" /> not think they are relevant to this Bill which confirms existing Orders.</P>
      <P>I understand there is a duty on imported tomatoes.  With regard to peas, the duty pre-war was at the rate of a halfpenny per pound.  That duty was a revenue duty and it was imposed in 1935.  It did not apply to peas of United Kingdom or Canadian origin. Since the war, and during it, the production of peas in this country was affected by imports and, in order to protect the farmers who grew peas and who found them a valuable cash crop, the Minister for Agriculture raised the duty from a halfpenny per pound to twopence per pound.  The consumption of dried peas is estimated at about 3,000 tons per annum.  In recent years the figures have varied somewhat. Production is roughly 50 per cent. of the demand.  In 1950 there were roughly 1,000 acres and, in order to provide a market or to prevent farmers having to face competition from abroad, it was considered necessary to raise the duty.  It is no longer a revenue duty, which the former duty was, but it is considered that the position arising from changed circumstances requires that the duty be raised from a halfpenny to twopence.</P>
      <P>In the case of the establishment of the glass factory at Waterford, I should correct the impression that Deputy Cogan has that the Minister or the Department in some way establishes a factory in a particular locality.  The decision to establish this factory was taken by the proprietors of the concern, and I assume that the reason Waterford was selected was the historical associations with Waterford glass, which would naturally commend the product, especially to purchasers from abroad.  At present, most of the articles produced are sold in this country, but I understand that when the new factory comes into production it is proposed to extend the range of production&mdash;in fact that has been done&mdash;and to concentrate on higher grade glass, mainly for export. I have no knowledge of the proposal to establish a factory in County Wicklow, to which the Deputy refers, and which he says was originally intended.</P>

As far as I can gather from all the tomato growers' associations, there is no effective duty on tomatoes when it is most required.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary what conditions made the Minister, responsible for this duty on peas, protect the interests of the pea farmer, when the interests of the tomato grower, as admitted by all of them, are not effectively protected. What are the circumstances which prevent the effective protection of the tomato industry but which, apparently, are now going to result in effective protection of the pea industry?

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is a question of advisory committees instead of executive committees.  There is a whole series of amendments dealing with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Childers' view appears to be that they should be advisory rather than executive committees. That may be all right in the case of small counties where the distance to be travelled by members is not very great but I do not think the suggestion is feasible in the case of counties in which the members would have to travel long distances to the meetings. Deputy Corry referred to the advantages being obtained in Cork at present.  I understand that the position there is extremely satisfactory. The kernel of the question referred to by Deputy Childers is the question of a possible reduction in expenses and a possible reduction in the number of officials dealing with these meetings.</P>
      <P>If we are to consider, in connection with this Bill, as in connection with any other Bill, certain advantages that may be gained by making full use of the powers given to members, then above all things, if we are dealing with the question of expense, we must first of all consider the best possible results that can be achieved through a system of full co-operation.  I think it is right to say that if we adopt a system of advisory committees, as suggested in this amendment, we are automatically going back to the time when many sections of the community could not be fully represented by members of county councils who would otherwise be anxious to attend.  It will be realised that many members have to give up their employment.  They lose the full day when they are at these meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot is tied up with the question of <Col N="465" /> whether there will be advisory or executive committees.  I have in mind various dates when we were on sites committees.  They were advisory committees. Many members were not able to attend various important meetings because, financially, they could not stand up to the strain.  I believe if we adopt the system that is suggested we will be going back to the times when local government simply meant the controlling of finances and all the other administrative functions in a county, not by a county manager, but by certain sections representing the people, men who very often were not progressive in their ideas.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputy Childers to realise that in certain small counties it may be suitable for members of committees to attend, but, on the other hand, difficulties arise in different counties and you can realise fully the importance of getting full co-operation and that sense of co-ordination in regard to all services and the need of having the members there.  You achieve that through the system set down here in this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the value of the work done.  I see there that we differ, perhaps, in our views.  I might point out that with the small House at the moment we have this little advantage, that we can discuss these matters in a more simple way than if we had a full House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Childers referred to the value of the work done. I can see the impossibility of working under the system of advisory committees, because it means a considerable amount of time given by a number of members in an advisory capacity.  The officials also will have to be in attendance. The committee will report to the full county council and that means that a lot of work will be duplicated.  That is definitely a point against the idea of advisory committees.  The advantage of having an executive committee is that through their consultations with <Col N="466" /> responsible officers decisions can be arrived at very often at one meeting, whereas if they are attending in an advisory capacity it means extra time and ultimately this will go, as Deputy Corry mentioned, against the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen was extraordinary in his attitude.  He went around in such a way that I thought we would all be found in the Bog of Allen by the time he was finished.  Not alone did he proceed to deal with all the amendments, but he almost covered the whole Bill by himself.  However, we will all have a chance of dealing with the section later.  Deputy Allen said that one danger of an executive committee was that some members might not be available. I think he should clarify that statement.  It could happen that at certain times members would not be available, possibly through illness or prior engagements.  Is Deputy Allen going to suggest that members who stand for election would not make themselves available for committee meetings?  That seems to cut across the whole sense of genuine representation on the various county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not dealing with the section now; we are tied up completely with the amendment.  That is why I asked earlier if we could discuss all the amendments together, but apparently we cannot.  As we go down the list of amendments we may be able to clarify the position.  We cannot discuss certain matters now, but I rose to speak largely because Deputy Childers said the whole section would either stand or fall on this amendment.  He seems to attach considerable importance to it, and perhaps he is justified in so doing.  I believe it is essential to draw attention to the views some people have, and the Deputy and others must realise that while we are speaking on this amendment we are not tied to it; there are other amendments to be considered in connection with the same section, amendments of importance which aim at improving the section.  Even without the amendment debated by Deputy Childers the Bill can be vastly improved.  This object can be achieved, in my opinion, by other amendments that will come to be considered.  They are there <Col N="467" /> quite clearly to be seen.  If they are studied and considered in their full aspects, their advantages will be realised by every member.</P>
    <P>I think there is little more to be said except to refer to a statement by Deputy Allen&mdash;I am glad he is in the House again&mdash;about the question of reference back.  Deputy Corry is fully aware that when we in Cork are dealing with board of health matters and various matters of importance we do not have to refer them back.  We have the advantage of the system at present where we have the members of the council present.  We have split up the work.  We have our committee dealing with the health section and with the assistance work.  We have the advantage of being able to come to a decision on any important question as it arises.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance to realise the difference between the two words and between all the works connected between the two words&mdash;&ldquo;advisory&rdquo; and &ldquo;executive&rdquo;.  On the one hand &ldquo;executive&rdquo; means that the members are entitled to be present. On the other hand as Deputy Corry is aware we have cases where we have advisory committees and it is not fair to expect members to travel long journeys and lose a day's work to come in to attend such committees.  If we adopt that system of advisory committees it means that we are taking a retrograde step and that you will not have genuine, constructive viewpoints expressed in the various county councils by representatives of all sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On this.  Deputy Desmond did not seem to grasp what I had in mind.  For a number of years Deputy Desmond has been a member of the Cork County Council but it was only at the last election that Deputy Desmond became a member of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, which is one of the committees to which reference is made here.  I know that Deputy Desmond must have felt that he was unjustly treated in having been deprived of his right by Act of Parliament to look after the home assistance matters for the people whom he represented in the county council.  That is the whole thing lying behind this executive committee.</P>

      <P>A number of men will come in there and do the whole job and there is nothing left for anybody else.  There is no reference back to the county council or anything else.  It is just the same in working as the board of assistance is at present.  We have, roughly, about 21 members in the South Cork Board of Health.  Of these, only seven or eight can act as members of the board of assistance. The balance of the members are completely knocked out and have no power over assistance matters.  It is the very same thing with this executive committee. Under this system of the <Col N="469" /> executive committee, one-third of the council, 15 members, can form an executive committee.</P>

I should like to see some Deputies standing up in this House and moving, after the election of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, that the rest of the Deputies should go home and stay at home for five years.  This is the same proposal.  It is a proposal that the Minister dare not suggest in regard to the administration of this House but apparently it is good enough for the local authority.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to relate what my experience has been as a member of local bodies.  Take a roads committee.  A number of members are selected to go minutely into the question of road administration.  That is a committee which has only the power to make recommendations.  I have found very keen jealousy amongst the ordinary members of the council who are not on those committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are committees appointed by the county council from amongst the members of the council. As I have said, these committees have the power only of making recommendations. In very rare cases indeed would the council refuse to carry out a committee's recommendation.  The point I want to make is that I have found very keen jealousy amongst the members not on those committees.  I do not blame them for that, because, after all, they were elected to represent the people of their areas.  Under a machine such as we have in this section, they will find themselves cut out from doing the work which the people of their areas elected them to do.  That is why I am so strongly against this executive authority being vested in a portion of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this amendment only because it would prevent what I consider a greater evil arising.  I had not the advantage of hearing Deputy Childers moving his amendment.  My only objection to it at the moment is that it makes it mandatory on a county council to elect those two advisory committees.  I cannot see that any strong case can be made for compelling a county council to appoint an advisory committee.  I think it should have a free discretion in the matter of reserving in its own hands all powers, executive and administrative. A council should have the right, at its own discretion, to elect as many advisory committees as it may think fit from time to time.  I cannot see any <Col N="472" /> case for compelling a county council to appoint two advisory committees to perform two specific functions.  I assume that, if this amendment is carried, it will provide that there will be what is known as a general advisory committee to advise the council generally on a considerable number of matters, and that there will be another committee to advise on health matters. I suppose a case could be made for that arrangement.</P>
      <P>The main argument, I think, in favour of the amendment is that it cuts out completely this idea of delegating functions to an executive committee. The question of numbers has been raised, and I expect will be raised again.  At the moment, I cannot see any advantage in appointing an executive committee if it is to consist of every member of the council.  I think that the whole case for appointing an executive committee is that it would be smaller than the council.  That is why I say that, if we carry this amendment, we will be defeating the idea of executive committees, and so will be leaving it to all the elected representatives to carry out the business which they were elected to do.  I think that is a sound and sensible proposition because the members can hardly be called elected representatives if they are not allowed to take part in the discharge of the important business which they were elected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  I do so because, during the past four years, I have had practical experience as a member of an advisory public health committee.  As a result of that experience, I am satisfied that it is more desirable, and more in the interests of the community as a whole, to have these advisory committees set up than to have what is proposed in the section.  The decisions reached by the advisory committees, whether on housing or any other matter, will eventually come before the council as a whole for decision.  I could not visualise any executive committee as a workable proposition that did not include every member of the council. Deputy Cogan has just stated that he could see no point in having every member of the council as a member of <Col N="473" /> the executive committee.  On the face of it one might be inclined to agree with him, but, occasionally, matters will arise where it would be desirable, if you decide to set up an advisory committee, to have it composed of every member of the council.</P>
      <P>In support of my argument for the setting up of advisory committees, I may cite as an example what happened in the case of the local authority of which I am a member.  About two and a half years ago we started a big housing drive in the County Wicklow. It was initiated in 1946.  In 1948 we had just reached the stage when construction work could be carried out.  The council decided to set up a housing committee which met monthly and dealt with all matters pertaining to housing, even including water and sewerage and applications under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. The findings of that committee came before the council in about a week's time.  The report was discussed and questions were raised by other members of the council with regard to matters in their own particular areas and they disagreed with the findings of the committee.  It was not a question of a few isolated cases; it was happening constantly and, as a result, the council decided to appoint the full council as a housing committee.  The full council meets perhaps a week previous to the ordinary meeting of the county council and they deal with all matters pertaining to housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you had an executive committee in the same category, if I might use the word, as an advisory committee with this difference, that the advisory committee would have to report back to the council but the findings of the executive committee would be final, you would find yourself in the position that our advisory committee were in, that their reports dealing with certain matters would come before the council but, when dealing with an executive committee, the other members of the council would have no redress.  For that reason I think it is more in the interests of the community as a whole and of every member of the council, from the point of view of representing his particular area, that we should <Col N="474" /> have advisory committees as against executive committees.  The question of the personnel of the committees is dealt with in another section and I hope to say something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of whether the committees should be advisory or executive, I feel no difficulty at all in finding in favour of an executive committee.  Advisory committees have their part to play in local government where you select specially qualified members of a council and add to them a number of outside people to deal with subjects such as scholarships, libraries, etc.  But, where you are dealing, as you will be dealing in county councils, with housing, sewerage, water, home assistance and the various day-to-day activities of both committees, surely there is nobody more qualified to speak for the people and to express their wishes than those who were elected by them.  I feel that an advisory committee would be a waste of time because every conclusion they come to would be reexamined at the next county council meeting to which they would report back and another day would be spent discussing, not what was on the agenda, but the report of the advisory committee.  Deputy Allen said that the numbers of the committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to point out to Deputy Allen that, if he feels worried about that, there is an amendment standing in my name and in the name of Deputy Desmond which will give him full scope.  Therefore, he should not allow the question of numbers to worry him.  He also said that one member could come to a decision and that the whole of the council would be tied by his decision.  Is it not correct that at present the county manager, who may not even be as qualified as such a member, can give a decision and the whole council are tied by it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has seen his way to hand back to the elected representatives of the people additional powers to those which they had, and I welcome in particular the <Col N="475" /> fact that the members of one of these committees will have the right to decide on the amount of home assistance which should be given to a person who is in need of it.  If, as Deputy Allen says, any council wishes to delegate certain powers to the county manager or any other official, I feel that they should do the honest thing and not stand for the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are proceeding gradually to outline the distinction between advisory committees and executive committees, but I feel we have reached the stage now where we would like to hear more from the Minister in regard to the suggestion which has been made that a portion of a county council, one-third of it, will have a right to make decisions which affect very often matters of grave importance and that they can only be prevented by the county council from making these decisions in connection with executive functions if they choose to invoke Section 38 of the Bill.  Section 38 is the one in which a county council is given some overriding power over the executive committees.  I remember in connection with the County Management Act that one of the criticisms of the Act was the fact that, although the county councils could require the manager to do a certain thing by calling a meeting in a certain way and moving a resolution, notice of which had been given in advance, that he should do that thing, it was cumbersome and members would not indulge frequently in the practice of invoking that particular section directing the county manager to do certain things.  It seems to me that exactly the same thing applies to Section 38 and that it is not likely to be utilised very frequently&mdash;the section under which the county council can direct an executive committee to carry out an executive function in a particular way.  In other words, it is a section to which county councils will have recourse rather more in desperation than anything else.  Therefore, we get back to the fact that these bodies are going to have important executive functions and that they will consist only of one-third of the members of the council. <Col N="476" /> Further, these committees frequently will not consist of members of minority parties.  Moreover, if they do consist of members of minority parties, they almost certainly in that case will not represent the whole area of the county. Therefore, the executive committee as proposed by the Minister would have definite executive powers to do a number of important things and the committee may not, as I have said, represent the whole area of the county and, on the other hand, they may not represent the parties who are in a small minority.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how he regards that matter and whether he does not feel it desirable to reconsider, before the Report Stage, the whole question of the formation of these executive committees.  Why should a committee of the council decide what type of houses should be erected?  Will the Minister explain that?  Under the arrangement proposed in my amendment the county council will have an overriding power in all these matters.  They can appoint an advisory committee and give that committee definite instructions at the beginning of the financial year which the advisory committee will have to carry out.  They will only refer back if there are matters of a particular kind for discussion or particular problems to decide.  But in this case a section of the council can decide how many houses will be built with a given sum of money.  The council as a whole raises the rates and borrows the money but leaves two-thirds of the council in a matter of that kind, a virtual power, and that two-thirds can only be estopped by virtue of Section 38.  The same thing applies to the maintenance and repair of roads. Having struck a given rate, they will give two-thirds of the council power to do a whole series of road works and the county council as a whole can only override it in a special way by directing a special committee to perform certain things or carry out specified functions in a particular manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall have to discuss that matter when we come to Section 38.  I have to mention Section 38 now because <Col N="477" /> Section 16 obviously relates to it.  If we are to discuss whether or not we will have executive committees we must at the same time discuss what power the county council will have over these committees.  The Minister has not replied to the question I asked him as to how far he thinks this will result in overburdening county councillors who are members of these executive committees with work.  That is a reasonable question.  The proposition is not an unreasonable one.  As will be seen from further sections of the Bill, these executive committees will automatically have all the executive functions until such time as they delegate them to the county officer. They start off with all the trappings of the entire administration.  Will the Minister answer the question as to what will be the burden of work placed upon them?</P>
    <P>I should explain to members of the Labour Party who suggested that our advisory committees would not have travelling expenses that we never proposed that.  We made no suggestion that we would not have travelling expenses.  We did suggest, however, advisory committees which would arrange their own rules of procedure and, if they got into difficulties, they could apply to the Minister to arrange them for them, and the Minister could limit the number of their meetings for which expenses would be paid to prevent these advisory committees becoming a temptation or an attraction to the professional type of local politician. We suggested, too, that these advisory committees would furnish reports to the county councils and that the county councils could act on these reports.  That suggestion was quite a reasonable one, as Deputy Allen has already pointed out in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister's objection that the county council would have too much work to do is overruled by the fact that at this moment there are advisory committees all over the country preparing reports for consideration by county councils and for adoption by them, amendment or reference back.  That is taking place all over the country.  All we ask is that that system should be <Col N="478" /> allowed to develop in its own way and that there should be the least possible interference with the general activities of these committees and that they should be permitted to proceed on an evolutionary basis.</P>
    <P>We did assume in proposing the formation of these advisory committees that in the first instance the county officer would undertake all executive functions until the county council had decided which functions it wished to take unto itself and which it wished to leave to the county officer.  The idea of not overburdening advisory committees with work is based on another amendment later proposing that the county officer in the first instance would be given these executive functions so that the county council would have time slowly and by degrees to decide which functions it wished to take unto itself and the advisory committees would then work in with the county council.  That seems a reasonable proposition designed solely for the purpose of preventing county councillors from becoming professionals and civil servants as well.</P>
    <P>In many cases our advisory committees would settle matters voluntarily with the county manager.  Why should we then have this hard and fast system in local authorities while the Minister himself controls 99 per cent. of the work that is done by them? Why should we have a hard and fast system until such time as we have discovered for ourselves how the voluntary system works?  In 99 per cent. of the work that is done, if advisory committees plan housing, sewerage, water schemes and roads, in the ordinary way they will get their directions from the county council as to how much money will be spent on these schemes and as to the general character of the work; in the ordinary way they will settle the issue voluntarily with the county manager without the necessity of directing him to do a certain thing, and they have not even to make a decision as to what the particular powers of the county manager are in relation to certain aspects of local administration. Putting it in more detail, the county council will decide how much they will spend on housing, work out a general plan as to the number of <Col N="479" /> houses to be built and the housing committee would then decide with the manager the type of houses to be built and the site on which they will be erected, examine the contracts and so forth, and in a great many cases there will be no necessity for any legal routine as to who has what power. There is no necessity at the moment. There are thousands of houses being built to-day in the erection of which no Act of Parliament intervenes in the personal relationship of the county manager with the housing committee. That is the system we would like to continue.  That is the system we would like to see expand.  We would like to encourage these housing committees to do even more work if possible than they have been doing up to this, while at the same time avoiding an excessive number of meetings by encouraging them to appoint advisory committees where they have not so far appointed them, particularly in connection with reports of the work done for the year by the county manager and the work to be done in the following year, and the amount of money to be spent in relation to the work under each section of the Department of Local Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Childers in the opening portion of his speech at least addressed himself to the amendment and to the particular matter under consideration.  He made a reasoned case.  Deputy Corry throughout the whole of his speech did not appear to realise what the problem was, and thought he would substitute an argument on something that was not there for an argument on the amendment on the particular section. May I put one matter clearly to Deputy Childers?  I agree with him that in order to consider this problem one must consider Section 38 at the same time.  I think Deputy Childers' point would be met and the executive committee point would be met if we had executive committees that could act as such and carry out decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one had only the specialised individual case direction to these executive committees that there is in Section 38 and if one handed to these <Col N="480" /> executive committees the power of the council making a general direction, then one would get away from the necessity of having a purely advisory committee and the decision of the executive committee would be much more subject to the general control of the council than it is at present under the provisions of Section 38.  If you have purely executive committees then&mdash;if I may trespass, Sir, on your patience by referring to a meeting of a body of which we sometimes hear something in this House, the Cork County Council&mdash; I am quite sure that what will happen is that you will have Deputy Corry raising the roof at a meeting of the advisory committee and, at the meeting of the county council following, Deputy Corry raising the roof, which has been put back in the meantime, again</P>

I am surprised how he inveigled the Minister into fathering the Bill in this House at all.  Apparently he did.  I know the Minister feels half sorry for himself now.  It is amazing that this Minister of a most democratic Party should come along now and select, as in Deputy Sweetman's county, seven out of the 21 and should tell the other 14 they had no power at all.  In my county, it means picking out 15 of the 46 and telling them they have no power.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the wide field of the discussion on this section the point was more concealed than ever, accidentally sometimes and sometimes not so accidentally. It became much more obscure as a result of the discussions and debates about it.  Let us get back to the point at issue.  The point at issue is whether we are to have advisory committees or executive committees.  Provision is made in the Bill itself to enable the county council to appoint certain advisory committees.  Deputy Corry is a member of a county council; Deputy Allen is a member of a county council; and so is Deputy Harris. Several members of this House are members of councils and I put it to each, considering the matter in a reasonable common sense way, would there be more chance of having the work of the council done by delegating it to an executive committee or by having the work solemnly handed over to a committee called an advisory committee who will sit back and do nothing?  The powers we are handing to the executive committee in this Bill are the powers that up to now were exercised by the manager.  The manager dealt with these executive functions and now these functions are being handed over to the elected representatives. They must be dealt with expeditiously and in a sensible and businesslike way.  This House has accepted the principle of the Bill in departing from the managerial system, <Col N="483" /> but, judging by the discussion, some Deputies seem to have a hankering for a restoration of that system.  The House, however, as I say, has decided that we are not to have managers and something must be put in their place. We do not want to have in their place a system that will be ineffective; we want a system that will do the business in the most efficient way.  I suggest that provision has already been made for advisory committees for such matters as require special advice and in respect of which expert opinion might be called in, but that has nothing to do with the ordinary day to day business of the council, the things that require to be attended to Deputy Corry and several Deputies spoke about them.  You cannot afford to keep these waiting indefinitely.</P>
      <P>The things that were done by the manager formerly without any consultation with the council, the council must do, through executive committees or through the whole council, and I suggest that Deputy Childers' amendment to call these advisory committees in relation to the normal business of the council is going to make the Bill unworkable.  I do not think that is Deputy Childers' intention, but that would be the net effect of it.  A council can appoint advisory committees for such matters as they need to have advice on, but surely not in relation to such matters as applications for home help.  In such circumstances, it would mean that an application would come before the advisory committee and the committee would say: &ldquo;We will report back to the council in due course and you will get your home help next week or whenever the council meets.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers wanted to know what power the council will have.  I do not know that that is very germane to this discussion, but so many irrelevancies have been introduced that I do not know where to get on or get off. The council has all the powers that Deputy Childers and Deputy MacEntee alleged the councils had over the managers, and much more.  They have much more power over the executive committees than they were supposed to have had in respect of the two-thirds <Col N="484" /> majority for a specially convened meeting. If a county council does not approve of the way an executive committee is doing its work, it can indicate the particular way in which it wants the work done and can recall the delegation of the powers to the executive committee by simple resolution.  Furthermore, the committees will be replaced every year.  There is no question of functions being taken from the council.  The council delegates functions to the executive committee to carry out this normal work.  The committee reports back to the council and the council can require the committee to perform these functions in a special way.  The point is that the work is done and recipients of home help will not be kept waiting.  The council retains the very last word of authority in every vestige of the Bill.</P>
    <P>At no stage is there any question about final authority resting with the elected representatives, and Deputy Corry knows that perfectly well.  His talk about committees having more power than the whole council is pure &ldquo;boloney&rdquo;.  The committees have not got overriding power at all.  The council gives them power to perform executive functions.  There are scheduled functions which must be dealt with by the council as a whole.  There are a small number of functions which have been delegated to the county officer, but the executive functions we are dealing with are the functions formerly carried out by the manager and we entrust these to the elected members of the council.  We had no objection when the county managers performed them, but we have all this suspicion now when they are to be performed by members of the council.</P>
    <P>On the next section, we will deal with the question of numbers&mdash;whether or not we should have a committee of the whole House, or, as suggested in the Bill, one-third of the members on each committee; but the principle at issue is advisory as against executive committees and anybody who is anxious and serious about having this Bill a success&mdash;and I believe that every Deputy, irrespective of Party, ought to want to see an effective instrument in the hands of local authorities&mdash;would not favour advisory as <Col N="485" /> against executive committees.  Surely the county officer or county secretary can advise on these matters, but the power to deal with them is given to the elected representatives and under the Bill the county council would say: &ldquo;These are matters calling for urgent attention.  You will do the health side and you will do the general purposes side.  You will report back to us in a general way and if we do not like the way in which you are carrying on, we can amend the way in which the functions are being performed.&rdquo;  As I say, the committee is revised from year to year.  On the other hand, we have a proposal to appoint these people in an advisory capacity, with no power to do anything.</P>
    <P>That is the net effect of the proposal and you are going to make confusion worse confounded by bringing people in from all over the county to discuss an agenda and to make recommendations back to themselves as a council for a meeting the following week.  That means that one day has been wasted, because, if they had executive powers, they could have dealt with the health side and the home assistance side, but they will merely sit down and go through this fatuous business of reporting back to themselves.  I do not think Deputy Childers has given any very serious consideration to the effects that would flow from having advisory instead of executive powers.  If he had, I do not think he would have gone the length of putting down quite a number of these amendments.  I am convinced that having advisory committees would mean cutting right across any hope of success for this measure, which we hope is to be a success.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that election to the committees be made on the basis of proportional representation from the membership of the council in respect of health and general purposes. That, however, is a detail.  I think it is the best way of electing them, but if the House feels it has a better way, I am quite prepared to agree with what the House says.  Deputy Corry spoke about this being a nullification of democracy. How he makes that out, I do not know.  This section is a nullification of democracy, says Deputy Corry.</P>

      <P>The Bill aims at restoring democratic control in local councils and every part of the Bill is designed for the restoration of that control and, at the same time, at the securing of efficiency in its working.  How Deputy Corry got his brainwave about a nullification of democracy, I cannot make out.  Taking powers from the manager and giving them to the elected representatives is a nullification of democracy, according to Deputy Corry.  That, however, is a digression which I should not have made, as I am trying to keep on the line of the principle at issue.</P>
      <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Childers would rob these bodies of the right to have executive committees and give them advisory committees with no power to do anything.  The Bill proposes that they must elect two executive committees.  They may elect as many advisory committees as they like.  The county councils must elect two committees to do the work.  Everything outside the scheduled functions and the three functions reserved to the county officer&mdash;everything else that comes under the description of executive functions, of the functions up to the present done by the manager&mdash;is to be done by these committees.  To do this, it is absolutely essential that they have executive powers if the Bill is not to clog and overload the whole administration. I resist this amendment as making the Bill completely unworkable.</P>

      <Col N="488" /> Previous to the passing of the County Management Act of 1940, we had a system of local government operating in this country from the late years of the previous century.  For almost 50 years, I think, that system was in operation, with slight changes.  There were fairly substantial changes in 1921, when boards of guardians and District Courts were done away with, but the county councils remained.  The system, by and large, served the needs of the community for 50 years.  The Management Act of 1940, based on the experience of the City Management Acts for Dublin, Cork and other cities, which had been in operation for 15 years or more, made the House decide that it was the system of local government best suited to the community. That Management Act came into operation in 1942.</P>

Section 16, as proposed to be amended by amendment No. 29&mdash;will that bring me in order?&mdash;is the point in question.  I was just saying that the duty of this House is to provide a machine that will work and function <Col N="489" /> smoothly and efficiently and give service to the community, one that will enable local representatives to perform their functions with the aid of their officers, so as to operate an efficient machine of local government to serve the community interests and to provide their needs in the matter of social services.  That is what they are concerned with and nothing else.</P>
      <P>Under some recent legislation of this House, the numbers on all the councils were reduced.  They are very limited at the moment and each councillor represents a large area of his county.  I wish to point out that, under Section 16, unless amended in the manner now suggested by Deputy Childers, three-fourths of the people of any particular county may be disfranchised.  It is an important representation.  I am surprised that a Labour Minister backed up by the Labour Party in this House would stand for legislation which disfranchises two-thirds of the elected representatives and gives them no interest or responsibility in the major decisions which may be taken by the executive committees.  That should be kept in mind.  It is quite possible that under the section two-thirds of the representatives will scarcely have any functions.</P>

      <P>If they must, the councils will of course try to work this, but it will clog the wheels of progress.  We do know the main reason for this suggestion. Members of local authorities have had in recent years the experience of knowing that the Department of Health and the Department of Local Government each wanted its own separate officers as officers of county councils, and that each objected on principle to its own officer performing the functions of the other Department.  Now the general executive committee will be the committee of the Minister for Local Government, while the health committee will be responsible only to the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Social Welfare may want another committee.  I wonder why he has been left out of this Bill, and why he has not been given a committee, because home assistance will be administered under the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 52, page 10, to delete &ldquo;elect&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;appoint&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been stated during the course of the discussion on the previous amendment, in effect, this amendment will provide that the executive committees will be appointed and not elected.  As the Minister has agreed, the amendment will decide the principle of whether the executive committee shall consist of the small number provided <Col N="493" /> in the Bill or of all the members of the council.  It is for the purpose of having that matter determined that I move this particular amendment.</P>
    <P>On the previous amendment there has been considerable discussion of this particular principle.  If the Minister accepts, as I believe and hope he will, the principle of appointment rather than election, it will be an indication to the House that he will be prepared to accept the principle in other amendments of appointing the executive committees from all the members of the council and not from a select body of the members.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to mention some matters that have already been pointed out by Deputy Corry, Deputy Allen and others, in the course of the debate, namely, that a county council is elected by the electorate to do the work of the county council; that it is undemocratic to provide that part of that work, such as the general executive functions or the health functions, should be carried out by a section of the elected councillors and not by the whole council, and that, even under the system of proportional representation that has been referred to by Deputy Allen, it is quite possible that the committees elected to carry out the general executive functions and the health functions, conceivably, could consist of members from one part of a county.  It is obvious that in the appointment or election of executive members, there probably will be a very intensive canvass to get particular individuals elected, for one reason or other, perhaps because of their political affiliations and, with a small electorate, say one consisting of 21, there may be not only a very intensive canvass but very detailed instructions to the voters as to how they may exercise the vote so as to make sure that a majority of their particular political persuasion is elected.  Therefore, undoubtedly, having had the election of the council on a political basis we will have sub-elections on a political basis and we may have the undesirable result that has been obtained in certain councils.  I have read about it happening in, I think, two counties&mdash;in one case there was a Government majority; in the other case an Opposition <Col N="494" /> majority.  The majorities exercised their functions so as to prevent the minority having representation.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he has avoided that pitfall by the proposal to have proportional representation.  I say he has not.  I say that all this possibility of intrigue, of canvass, in regard to these particular matters should be eliminated by providing that the general executive committee and the health executive committee shall consist of all the members of the council. Some of them may not attend.  Some of them may not find it convenient to attend.  That is all right.  That can happen.  But, if a member is willing and anxious to attend and anxious to carry out the duties for which he was elected by the people in his area, no junta on the council should be permitted to prevent him carrying out those duties.  That is what may happen under the system envisaged or proposed in the Bill.  On the general principle of democracy, I say that those executive committees should consist of all the members of the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want Deputy MacEntee to understand because I do not want him to start criticising me or to say it does not come into the amendment. The Minister has indicated in the course of the previous discussion that this particular principle will be dealt with on this particular amendment, and it is a matter of convenience that I am linking up the discussion and suggesting that there will not be an election of the executive committees, but appointment, and that they will consist, as is provided in subsequent amendments, of all the members of a council.  In particular, I want Deputy MacEntee, who was not here during the discussions, to understand that the approach I am now making is due to the indication given by the Minister in regard to this particular discussion.  I have moved the amendment for the reasons I have given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained by the Deputy, the amendment deals with the question of the constitution of executive committees.  I was anxious to get <Col N="495" /> down to this point, which is clearly distinct from the discussion on the previous amendment.  In the Bill we have set up two committees, a health committee and a general executive committee, comprised of one-third each, on proportional representation, of the general body of the council.  I do not want Deputies to get the impression that that is the be-all and end-all of the work of the elected members.  There are other duties which members of the council would have.  They may be appointed on various committees.  They may be elected for 12 months and reelected at the end of 12 months.  There are the advisory committees such as the estimates committee, the rates committee, the vocational committee, the agricultural committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention in limiting the size of the committees was with a view to making it more workable for the council.  The ideal would be that if you have a reasonably small working committee you designate powers to them and they will report back to the council in the normal way, unless there is something wrong with the method of operation.  If the council do not like the way they are functioning, they can be directed to do the job in a particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really a question whether a big or a small committee would be the most effective instrument for doing the work of the council.  I heard various expressions of opinion to-day in the discussion of Section 16, certain Deputies favouring the full membership of the council on committees. Some Deputies seem to hold the view that the Bill strikes at a democratic principle in robbing an elected member of a council of some of his rights or powers.  I would like to make it clear that I have no intention of doing that. There are various Deputies in the House who are members of councils throughout the country and they have experience of the working of these councils and on this matter of committees they have formed their own views. I think the small committee is the better one, but if the view of the House <Col N="496" /> is that there is in this any attempt to nullify the rights of elected representatives on councils, then I am not going to press that point.</P>
    <P>I am leaving it to the House to discuss this matter fairly, freely and impartially. I put it to each Deputy: &ldquo;Do you honestly think that the council will be better served by a whole house health committee and a whole house general committee?&rdquo; If the House thinks that, then I am not raising any objection and I am prepared to take the views of the House on it. Personally, I think the council would be better served by a smaller body on the health and on the general committee. Even with that, there will still be functions left to the elected representatives. They can go on to other committees.  Again, there is a swing around from one 12 months to another.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to ignore Deputy Cowan's point.  It is possible that you would have the same seven people getting on committees.  It could be described as a kind of freak, yet it is not outside the bounds of possibility. I admit it could happen.</P>
    <P>My attitude is that as long as I have the acceptance of the principle of executive committees, I am satisfied, because I think that is vital to the success of the Bill.  Having got that, I am not at all adamant as to what the House should do in this matter of committees&mdash;whether they will have the full committee or a reduced one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to enter into the discussion as to whether it is, on the whole, better that the executive committee should consist of the total membership of the council or whether they should be elected in the manner in which the Bill originally proposed.  What I am concerned about is this, that we are considering an amendment which is self-sufficient and which is not linked up in any formal way with amendment No. 40.  The position could be easily created that Deputy Cowan's amendment No. 30 could be carried and then amendment No. 40 could be defeated.  We would then be in the position that, I think, obtains at present, that these committees could be constituted only of a <Col N="497" /> fraction of the total membership of the council; they could be appointed in such a way that sections of the elected body would not be represented on these committees at all.</P>
      <P>I think we ought to be careful to avoid the possibility of that happening. If the principle of this amendment is going to be considered&mdash;and I am not entering into that&mdash;it should be put before the House in a proper way.  If the general feeling was that we should accept the principle which Deputy Cowan has ostensibly submitted to the House&mdash;that is to say, that the committee should consist of all the members of the council&mdash;then there ought to be consequential amendments, which Deputy Cowan has not put down.</P>

      <P>That is quite evident from the text of the amendment.  If Deputy Cowan wants to secure the objective which he has indicated here in the course of the debate, what he ought to do is this: he ought to delete the word &ldquo;elect&rdquo; and, if he likes, substitute the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo;; he should have gone on to say that these <Col N="498" /> executive committees shall consist of the total membership of every council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy O'Higgins' interpretation of the position&mdash;he cannot recognise it over there. However, if he wanted to do this properly, and if the Minister is going to consider this amendment, he will have to draft an additional amendment and incorporate it in one composite amendment to Section 16, because that would be necessary.  The amendment that I think is necessary is an amendment which would specifically declare that these executive committees should consist of every member of the council and then, following that, sub-section (3) might be deleted; that is, if it is proposed that all the executive committees should similarly consist of the total membership of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in having sub-section (3) in if Deputy Cowan's amendment to delete the word &ldquo;elect&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; is carried.  It is necessary that we should have a proper safeguard if we are going to agree to delete the word &ldquo;elect&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo;, and the safeguard is that there should be a specific declaration <Col N="499" /> that these executive committees shall consist of every member of the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the amendments which have been tabled by Deputy Cowan, but I think it is due to Deputy Cowan to say that at any rate he has been very consistent in the amendments he has put down, starting with amendment No. 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the attitude adopted by Deputy MacEntee on this amendment at all.  Deputy MacEntee was unable to be present during the discussion on earlier amendments. Perhaps if he had taken part in these discussions and given the House the benefit of his advice, he might have a better understanding of the situation at present.  At any rate, he might understand that these amendments and the sections were discussed in the spirit of helpfulness, in a rather constructive spirit, before he deigned to grace this chamber with his presence.  So far as amendment No. 30 is concerned Deputy Cowan suggests that the executive committees should be appointed by the council and not elected.  Deputy MacEntee pointed out that if this amendment were adopted, it would be necessary to have a number of consequential amendments and to provide that sub-section (3), Section 16, should be deleted.  Deputy Cowan has tabled such an amendment, amendment No. 34. Amendment No. 34 is to the effect that sub-section (3) of Section 16 dealing with the election of executive committees should be deleted.  Later on, although the Ceann Comhairle may not have ruled that it should be discussed with this amendment, Deputy Cowan perfectly consistently tabled an amendment to Section 17, that instead of having executive committees consisting of a fraction of the total membership of the council, the executive committees should consist of all members of the council.  That is the proposal made in amendment No. 40.  I am not in sympathy myself with the amendments suggested by Deputy Cowan but I think, in fairness to him, Deputy MacEntee should not have made the suggestion which he did regarding the Deputy.  I believe the work of the executive committees will be done very <Col N="500" /> much more expeditiously and efficiently if a smaller number than the entire membership of the council is placed on those committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of people do wonder about it and it is a question on which probably members of local authorities&mdash;and there are a number of them in this House at the moment&mdash;will hold very different views. Although the Dublin Corporation is not, strictly speaking, affected by this measure, I think it might be helpful to Deputies, in considering the various amendments, to know that we have had to a certain extent the same problem here in Dublin in dealing with the committees of the Dublin Corporation which are set up under the standing orders of the corporation.  Originally the various committees used to consist of different numbers of councillors but some time ago it was decided, because of reasons such as those mentioned by Deputy Cowan here to-day, that it was not fair that some members of the corporation should be excluded from taking part in the decisions of the committees.  It was decided then that all committees of the corporation should consist of the entire membership of the corporation, that is to say, of 45 members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a view held by a number of members of the Dublin Corporation that that was a mistake and that that decision should be altered.  That view is not confined to members of any one political group in the corporation.  I feel myself that it is a mistake to have the committees consisting of all members of the corporation.  I gave expression to that view at a meeting of the corporation, and I was supported by two members of the Fianna Fáil group who are members of this House and, who believed with me that the work of the corporation and the work of the committees was carried out more efficiently and more expeditiously when the committees consisted of smaller numbers than the entire membership of the corporation.  Neither of the members to whom I refer is in this House at the moment, but I feel that if they were here, they would <Col N="501" /> corroborate what I am saying and they would support the views expressed by the Minister on this amendment, in relation to the executive committees to be set up under the Act.  I feel that if you have an executive committee, which consists of the entire membership of the council, you might as well call a meeting of that committee a meeting of the county council.  I think it is well known that the larger the number of people collected together in a room around a table, the more tedious and the longer will be the ensuing meeting, and that it will not be possible to discuss matters in a committee atmosphere, as distinct from the council atmosphere which prevails at a meeting of the entire body.</P>
    <P>If the suggestion made by Deputy Cowan is accepted, I would suggest to the Minister that these sections of the Bill should be redrafted in their entirety, that the idea of setting up a group of committees should be dropped and that the authority which is given to local members under this measure should be exercised by the councillors sitting as a council and not by the councillors sitting as an executive committee set up under this Act.</P>

      <P>I do agree that there are a number of different views with regard to this particular matter. I do not think however there is any very substantial objection along the lines argued by Deputy Allen on an earlier section and mentioned in an interruption by Deputy Keane just now, that there is any negation of democracy involved in setting up smaller committees.  Deputy Allen argued that if a small committee, or at any rate a committee that did not consist of the entire council, were set up he could visualize a situation where an entire electoral area might be disfranchised, that they might have no representatives at all on the committee. I suppose it is possible that that might happen but Deputies will appreciate that if that happens, it would happen only because councillors from that particular electoral area themselves decided that they did not want to be on the committee.  If the committee is <Col N="502" /> to be elected by the system of proportional representation&mdash;take a council with a membership of 21 setting up a committee consisting of seven members&mdash;I am certainly not an expert on the working of the proportional representation system but it seems to me that in an election carried out on the system of proportional representation under those conditions, the quota necessary for election to the committee would be something in or about three votes, probably under three votes.</P>
      <P>If the members of a particular electoral division decide that they want representation on the committee they can get it by nominating a candidate and voting for him.  I may not be quite correct as to the quota, I think if Deputies work it out they will find that under those circumstances the quota is in or about three.  Possibly, two votes would be sufficient to elect a member.  Having regard to that, if my facts are correct I think Deputy Allen will agree that it is unlikely, except by a decision of the members in that particular area, that any area is going to find itself bereft of representation on a committee consisting of seven.  However, further to eliminate that danger, it would be possible to increase the membership of the committee. The Minister has indicated that he does not feel tied to the number suggested in the Bill: that, as far as he is concerned, and if the House looks for it, the committee can consist of the entire membership of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak with deference, at any rate, as far as county councillors are concerned because their work varies somewhat from the work of a city councillor.  Nevertheless, I had occasion to visit a rural area in the West last Sunday.  I found that a meeting of the council had been held the night before.  It started sometime during the day and finished at 1.30 the following morning.  I was told by people in the locality, some of them county councillors, that that was by no means unusual: that, in fact, it had been quite a normal practice with that particular county council for meetings to last until the early hours of the following morning.  Some people disagreed as to the reason for that, but <Col N="503" /> to me the reason seemed to be that you had a county council trying to get through a large agenda.  You have a large membership on a council and the meeting is unnecessarily protracted.  I think you would find exactly the same experience with the executive committees. Possibly, the experience would be worse with them if they were sitting as an executive committee and not as a council.  However, the position, as far as I am concerned, is that I honestly believe the work of the executive committees would be unnecessarily protracted and unnecessarily clogged the larger the committee is.</P>
    <P>At the moment, I do not feel there is any danger at all of disfranchising different electoral areas or different sections of the people.  I think that Section 38 gives the necessary overriding authority to the council to review the work done by the committees and to direct the executive committees in any particular direction by means of a simple resolution.  I would suggest to the Minister that rather than alter Section 17 it would be better to give wider powers, as was suggested earlier by Deputy Sweetman, under Section 38 in order that the council, as a council, would have absolute power to review any work done by the executive committees.  Otherwise, you are going to come up against a situation where it might be possible, if Deputy Cowan's view is to prevail, for a committee of the council to be equal in status and in authority with the council, sitting as a council.  I do not think that would be desirable, and for that reason I, personally, am against the suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, very wisely, in my opinion, has decided to leave this matter a bit open.  I can quite understand the viewpoint of Deputy O'Higgins.  I would be satisfied to have an executive committee running the Cork County Council to-morrow morning if it consisted of one, and I was that one.  When a man is elected as a member of a local authority he is elected to look after the interests of the people he represents in the matter of roads, public assistance, health, <Col N="504" /> housing and all the rest.  No member is entitled to divest himself of the right he has got to represent his people in relation to any of these matters. In my opinion the executive committee should consist of the whole council in regard to all matters which are county-at-large charges.  Beyond that, I do not want to have any power or say in what the people in the north Cork area consider would be best for that area as far as health charges are concerned.  I say the same with regard to west Cork and to south Cork.  At present we have three committees looking after the services in those three areas&mdash;housing, sanitary, home assistance and other services of that description.  As far as the area charges are concerned, give those three executive committees full power, but not in regard to county-at-large charges.  Let all the representatives of those areas be on the executive committees for their different areas.  It would be wrong, however, if a man elected by the people on a county council were to find that he was not one of the chosen few selected to act on one of these executive committees and so was deprived of having any voice as regards expenditure on the roads in his area, in relation to housing in his area or health services in his area.  That is how I look at this matter.</P>

      <P>We are anxious to make this Bill as good as we can, and I think it should be the duty of all Deputies, irrespective of Party, to do that.  We are the people down the country who will have to work it, not the boys here in Dublin who very cutely decided to keep the Dublin County Council and the Dublin Corporation out of this Bill and to try it on the dog. We happen to be the dog in this case. As we are the boys who will have to work it, we are entitled to decide on <Col N="506" /> whether we are going to disfranchise as far as most of the work of a county council is concerned one-third of the members altogether, two-thirds of them as regards roads and two-thirds of them as regards health.  Apparently, that is the object of the one-third provision in this.  I admit that there are Deputies like Deputy O'Higgins, and probably myself, who would not be above saying: &ldquo;Very well, we are going to have the chosen few on this.&rdquo;  But that is the position that is being created and that is why I definitely have an objection to it.  I was amused to hear Deputy O'Higgins say that the council should have an overriding authority over the executive committee after voting ten minutes ago in favour of that executive committee being an executive authority and not an advisory one.</P>

However, I agree that a councillor, when elected, should be able to carry out the work which the people elected him to do, that he should have a voice in connection with the expenditure on roads and everything else.  Cork County is different from other counties perhaps. There are three separate areas of charge in County Cork.  If we can fit in these three separate areas so far as the areas of charge are concerned, I am satisfied, but I certainly object to having any executive power vested in any committee smaller than a committee of the whole council.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. As I understand, the matter immediately before the House is Deputy Cowan's amendment No. 30.  If we take a decision on that amendment, how can it possibly determine the principle which is in sub-section (2) of Section 17?  That is what I am concerned about, because we are getting into a state of the utmost confusion. We have been told by Deputy Cowan that the Minister is prepared to consider that a decision on amendment No. 30 is going in some way to affect sub-section (2) of Section 17.  There is an amendment to delete sub-section (2). If that sub-section is deleted, that does not settle the question unless we can in some way take amendment No. 44 before we take Section 17.  I put the point that it would be quite open to the House to accept Deputy Cowan's amendment and that it would then be quite open to the House to reject Deputy Cowan's amendment No. 34. in the first place, then his further amendment No. 40 and then the further amendment No. 44.  If so, what position will we be in?</P>

      <P>Just before Christmas we had a discussion on the Second Stage of this measure and a vote of this House was taken.  Following that, the Bill went to a Select Committee of the House and, though it comes back from that Select Committee somewhat amended, I still think that we are in a situation in which I would not like to let the occasion slip without saying something before the House decides the fate of the Bill as it stands.  We had on a previous stage of the Bill an effort by certain people to wash their hands of their responsibility as members of this House.  They were not prepared to vote either for or against the Bill.  They were not prepared to say whether they believed in the principle of this Bill or whether they did not.  All of us who come to this House have the responsibility, whether we may think what we say is popular or unpopular, at least to have the courage of saying what we think and supporting that statement when a division is called by going into one Division Lobby or the other.  I think that every one of us, whether on this side or that side of the House, ought at <Col N="513" /> least to have the courage of his convictions on any measure that is before us and cast his vote on it.</P>
      <P>When this measure was before the House around Christmas certain people deliberately abstained and walked out of the House and deliberately did not give the House the benefit of their decision.  Those people were on that side of the House.</P>

We have never at any time in the past, as a Government, Opposition or otherwise, been lax and afraid to make up our minds on all important matters.  The reason why we did not vote on the Bill was explained by Deputy Smith.  It was because of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture and the Government of the Republic of Ireland were incapable of making up their mind and were not prepared to take responsibility for a measure that vitally affects the lives and interests of a large section of the community.  There were on that Front Bench 13&mdash;a hoodoo number&mdash;of Ministers who were not prepared to make up their minds as to whether this Bill should be accepted by the country or accepted by the Government, recommended to this House, or opposed, by that Government. That is the reason why we refused to do the work the Government of the country should do.  There were other occasions here in regard to Land Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to pay a tribute to Deputy Dunne, a tribute that is well and richly deserved.  He has the appreciation and the goodwill of every farm worker in the country because of his straightforwardness in coming here and presenting a Bill of this kind.  As he has the goodwill and the support of the agricultural workers, the Minister, for his straightforwardness, for his courage and pluck in saying that he disagreed with it and voting against it, has the support, the co-operation and the goodwill of all the farmers.  That is why Deputy Allen is so sore.  The Deputy always reminds me of Lanamachree's dog who goes a little bit of the way with everybody and the whole road with nobody.  He should at least have told us in part of his attempt to speak that he was either for or against the Bill, but he did not do so.  He must realise that in his constituency there are the holiday resorts of Gorey, Rosslare and Courtown where the majority of County Wexford farmers spend their holidays.  They were never as well off and I am reliably told by hotel owners in these holiday resorts that they were inundated with bookings by farmers, especially from the Gorey district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to convey that, if the farmer is entitled to his holiday, the farm worker is entitled to his.  When we have such a wave of prosperity flowing over the employers of these workers for whom <Col N="518" /> Deputy Dunne seeks to provide, is it not only right that we should all lend a hand in bringing about conditions which will make for a little more prosperity and contentment in the homes of the working class people? This is the type of Bill I have been labouring for and anxious to see law in this country since I left school and I am delighted and proud to-night, even though I differ 100 per cent. from the Minister on it, that Deputy Dunne has had the pluck and the courage to bring it forward.  He has my support, my co-operation and my blessing.  I am glad that the Bill has gone so far and I hope it will achieve the results Deputy Dunne has in mind.  I can assure him that it is highly appreciated by the workers whom he has the honour to represent in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In company with the Minister, I opposed this Bill on the Second Stage.  We opposed it because fundamentally it is a bad Bill.  However, the principle was accepted on Second Reading and the Bill was referred to a Select Committee on which all Parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Independents and Farmers, were represented. They sat around a table and discussed the Bill in a very constructive way and I am satisfied that, with the co-operation of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, we improved the Bill.  I would be an unreasonable person if, now that the amendments put forward on Committee Stage have been accepted by the promoters of the Bill, I were to force a division at this stage.  I think we should as far as possible seek co-operation not only between all Parties but between farmer and worker.  They are the biggest and the most important section in the community.  We may have differences &mdash;some may say that the Bill is good and some may hold that it is bad. Many farmers will find it somewhat irksome but our main idea is to work together, whatever difficulties may beset us, and, if this Bill adds to the farmer's difficulties, he will accept them and try to overcome them to the best of his ability.  I have no sympathy, however, with these people who talk about a wave of prosperity sweeping over the farmers.  There was no <Col N="519" /> wave of prosperity in Leix-Offaly a month or two ago when Deputy Flanagan sought to get relief for the unfortunate farmers there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was a member of the Select Committee on this Bill and I did my best to make my contribution towards its success.  I hope that contribution was in the best interests of those for whom the Bill is meant. What I object to is Deputy Sweetman getting up here to accuse Fianna Fáil Deputies of not taking part in the discussion or voting on the Second Reading. Our reasons are pretty obvious. This is a Private Member's Bill and it was the duty of the Minister to bring in a Bill such as this, if the Government proposed to take responsibility for it.  The Government refused to take that responsibility.  They had not got the backbone to take responsibility for it and that is why it was left to a private Deputy to bring the Bill forward.  We had no other reason than that.  We believed in the principle of giving a half-holiday to agricultural workers, and we still believe in it.  I do not know if Deputy Sweetman believes in it.  How did the Deputy vote on the Second Reading? Did he vote for a half-holiday for agricultural workers?  How is it that he has the audacity to accuse Deputies on this side of being opposed in principle to this Bill?  He got no indication from anybody that we opposed it.</P>

      <P>Well, the Minister and Deputy Sweetman did.  I am glad this Bill has gone through, and I hope that I have contributed something to make it acceptable both to the farmers and to the agricultural workers.  It was high time that the agricultural labourers were recognised and got the amenities available to those in the cities and towns.  At no time during my period in public life have I ever done anything to stop the agricultural <Col N="521" /> labourers from having the same amenities as the industrial workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Fianna Fáil shirked their duty on this particular measure.  It is amazing to hear Deputy Walsh say now that his Party are and always have been in favour of a half-day for agricultural labourers.  They did not indicate that in 16 years, they did not indicate it in the last three years, and certainly they did not indicate it when this measure was presented to the House for Second Reading. On the contrary, when the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture was asked on several occasions to introduce legislation to provide a half-day for the agricultural labourers, he spent a considerable time in telling the House that it could not be done and said it was not feasible.  His Party to a man voted against the Private Members Bill which I think was brought in about five years ago.  Now, Fianna Fáil have found themselves in a spot on this occasion.  If they were to vote according to their past behaviour, the Bill would undoubtedly have been defeated. But they were playing politics and they stood as they were on the plea that the Government would not take responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>There is no point in the wide earthly world in any of the Opposition twitting the Minister for Agriculture about voting one way&mdash;voting on this occasion in the minority&mdash;or twitting me or Deputy Norton, the Tánaiste, with voting in the other Lobby.  I reserve the right to disagree with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As a close colleague of his, as a Front Bench colleague, if you like, a junior colleague, I have disagreed with him and I will disagree with him again.  When it is a Government measure and on the agreed policy of the Government, I will vote with the Government on every occasion; but when it comes, as on this occasion, to a free vote of the House as to whether the agricultural labourer should get a half-day or not, I have not the slightest hesitation in voting against the other 12 or 13 members of the Cabinet, as <Col N="522" /> I believe and always have believed that this holiday was due.  That may make me unpopular to a certain extent with a section of the farmers in County Wexford.  I submit that many of the farmer Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party tried on this occasion to play a double game.  There is no point in saying at a time like this: &ldquo;We would like to see the agricultural labourer get a half-day and we were always for it.&rdquo; There has been no indication of that up to the present.  There is no indication of it now, even though Deputy Walsh gives the assurance that his whole party is in entire agreement with giving that half-day.  There is not the slightest use in anyone talking about splits in the Government merely because, on occasions such as that of the Second Reading of this Bill, half the Cabinet were in one lobby and half in the other.  As I have said, I disagree with the Minister for Agriculture on this measure and I have no apologies to make for voting in a different lobby on this particular Bill.</P>

We have heard a rather discordant trio, the first of whom said nothing, the second of whom said that he was pledged to the principle of a half-holiday for agricultural workers through his whole active public life, and the third of whom advanced the astonishing proposition that there were not any agricultural workers to be pledged to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I only intervened to assure the Opposition that there are agricultural workers in this country&mdash; a growing number.  I intervened to reassure the Opposition that, despite their depredations of 15 years, the tide has begun to turn and, far from declining, for the first time in 40 years, the population of this country is on its way up and has passed the 3,000,000 mark.  It is a country to come back to now and people are coming back. I am prepared to say that it is a country in the rural part of which there is now a labour shortage.  I am prepared to say that if there is a competent agricultural worker in any parish in Ireland, far from having to seek employment he will have a competition among his neighbours to secure his services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum wage for agricultural labourers has gone up by 10/- a week since we came into office, but for the first time in 20 years it is indeed a minimum wage and I do not believe that 10 per cent. of the agricultural workers in rural Ireland are in receipt of that minimum wage.  Certainly in my part of the country if you offered the minimum wage to a man who was a good, trained, skilled agricultural worker, he would laugh in your face and one of the proudest boasts of this Government is that its agricultural policy has created a situation in rural Ireland in which agricultural workers are not constrained to accept the minimum <Col N="525" /> wage and in which farmers in every county can well afford to pay them more.</P>

Perhaps we may be a little more inclined to forget the past and, please God, the men to whom it was denied in the past will now be able to enjoy what they are entitled to and what is long overdue to them.  I was glad to see that the members of the Opposition at least faced the matter in a sensible way.  When I spoke on the Bill in this House before it was referred to Committee, I said that I believed that if it were left to a free vote of the House even the members of the Opposition would have supported a Bill to give a half-day to farm workers.  They have proved by their attitude that they are <Col N="527" /> in favour of it.  Therefore, in fairness to the House and in fairness to the farm workers, the less we have to say about it the better and the sooner we finish it, the sooner the farm workers in Cork and elsewhere will be able to say: &ldquo;Thank God we are to get a half holiday.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I voted against this Bill. I am a farmer.  It is not just a question of whether farm workers ought or ought not get a half-holiday, but we are forgetting the people in the cities and towns who are crying out for butter, for example.</P>
      <P>What will happen to the cows between 12 o'clock on Saturday afternoon and 6 o'clock on Monday morning? There is an all-out effort at present to encourage the farmers to produce more and more but when the farm labourer gets his half-holiday the farmer will decide to produce less. Picture a farmer's place where there are 40 or 50 calves to be fed in addition to the milking of the cows and the looking after of the other animals and the poultry.  Ewes do not drop their lambs to schedule.  The farmer is out Sunday and Monday looking after them.  By the introduction of this legislation we are setting the headline to make the farmers of Ireland ranchers with a dog.  People may say that we are making a slave of the farm labourer but do not forget that the farmer is a slave.  He slaves for you people in the cities and the towns.  It is hard to take the half-holiday from the farm labourer, but it is harder still to take the butter and the potatoes and the wheat from the children in the cities and towns.  That day will come with the passing of this Bill by this House.  Mark my words, you are encouraging the farmers, small and big, to be ranchers.  They will take the easy way.  I know farmers who live in my county.  They rear calves and they breed sheep and cattle.  This House is going to set the headline and the time will come when the people of Dublin will be crying for butter.  I know that Deputy Dunne means well, but the farm labourer is different from a city or an industrial worker.</P>

I heard Deputy Flanagan say that the farmers have their holidays, but did we not give the farm labourers their holidays? We do not object to that.  I am a farmer and an employer and I may say that I would sooner give my men 14 or 21 days holidays than a half-day on a Saturday.  Think of a field of hay down and what the position would be at 12 o'clock on the half-day. The men would lay down their implements. I do not blame the men.  They would see the road men go home at 12 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I know.  However, it is the industrious farmer, the farmer who keeps cows and breeds from them, and who keeps poultry and so forth who will suffer.  Animals do not drop their young to schedule.  They have a certain time to go and it may be that it will happen during the night.  The farmer himself is up all night looking after his animals.  Then the calves must be fed too.  I myself and my sons have to go around the farm Sunday after Sunday because we cannot get a man on a Sunday morning to milk the cows for us.  We have to feed 50 or 60 calves and we can get no man to do that for us on a Sunday morning.  When this Bill becomes law the farm worker will go home at 12 o'clock on Saturday, and I do not blame him.</P>

      <P>This discussion has ranged over a very wide territory. Every conceivable red herring that could be dragged in was dragged in with a view to keeping off what might be looked upon by some as the evil day. Some Deputies spoke with a good intention and others with perhaps not so much of a good intention.  I am at a loss to understand why Deputy Sweetman should, at this juncture, seek by a manæuvre of this kind to bring <Col N="529" /> about a division when obviously the House is practically unanimous that this measure is desirable and that it should be passed.  I hope it will be passed without the discreditable performance of having a division on it before it becomes law.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been rather fully discussed in this House.  In addition, it was closely examined by a Select Committee of the House.  It represents a big advance in so far as agricultural workers are concerned.  To one who has been fighting this issue for six years, since we organised agricultural workers, this measure represents the culmination of much effort&mdash;and the same can be said of the efforts of many Deputies in this House who represent agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry made some surprising statements, not the least of which was the assertion that there was very little use in passing this Bill because farm workers are non-existent.  I can only think that Deputy Corry must have had a trying time on his farm over the past few months doing the necessary work because obviously he must have had to do it on his own.  Farm labourers are probably fewer now.  This Bill will have a lesser application than it might have had during the war because the number of men employed on the land for wages, as distinct from the sons or relatives of farmers, is probably lower now than it was previously, but that is not because of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture.  If that were the reason, I should be the first to state it. The reason why farm labourers are fewer now than they were previously is that they have gone to work in the cities and towns.  They are running into industry, building jobs and so forth, because wages are higher&mdash;and small blame to them.  Under this Bill we seek to do something which is good and constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, with regard to the Select Committee, that Deputies Allen and Walsh, Fianna Fáil Deputies, offered constructive help in company with other members.  Everybody in the country, farmers as well as farm labourers, will now realise that the time has come when this section of our people, who are so essential to our <Col N="530" /> economy, should get this very small consideration of a half-holiday in the week.  For the benefit of those who have doubts, I might say that the amended Bill, as it now appears before the House, provides that if a farmer finds it impossible during certain periods of the year, such as the harvest, to give a half-day in a particular week, he is empowered to give a full day's holiday in the following week.  Further, if it should be necessary for the farmer to ask the farm labourer to work, as he generally has to, on the Saturday afternoon, he may do so provided overtime is paid in respect of that period and provided the farm worker is agreeable and that there is no compulsion.</P>
    <P>This Bill is eminently reasonable.  It is time the House passed it and put it on the Statute Book.  I will not concern myself at this stage of this important issue with the reasons why the Opposition abstained from voting on the Second Reading.  That is past history now.  We will have other opportunities to deal with that matter&mdash;and we all know the reason for it.  The Opposition and the majority of the members of this side of the House have indicated that they wish to see this Bill become law, that they accept the principle of a weekly half-holiday for farm workers, and I do not propose to interfere with their wish or desire except to say that we have gone a certain distance along the road to making the conditions of these workers something better than they were.  We have left them a little better than we found them.  If God gives us the strength and the power, with Deputy Corry's help, I hope with Deputy Sweetman's help, and with the help of others, we will establish for farm labourers a wage of £4 per week throughout the country.  When we have done that, we will have gone a little further along the road towards securing a fair deal for this worst-treated section of the Irish community.</P>

      <P>I think, in view of the history of this Bill, that there is something wrong about sub-section (2) of Section 12.  We have at the moment four very eminent professional men appointed by the present joint <Col N="538" /> committee governing the hospital.  It is proposed in this sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person was, after the sixth day of December, 1950, and before the appointed day, appointed to any office, then, notwithstanding the terms and conditions on which he was appointed, the joint committee may, without assigning any reason therefor, dismiss or remove him from that office.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Should that come to pass, I think it would be a great hardship and it would be absolutely unjust on those very eminent men who were appointed recently to the staff of that hospital. We have amendment No. 5 in opposition to the section by Deputy Cogan.  I do not know if it is the intention of Deputy Cogan to move that amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to associate myself very strongly and very thoroughly with the remarks made by Deputy T. O'Sullivan.  I have received information concerning the grave hardships that are likely to be inflicted on the very able and distinguished doctors who have been appointed to the staff. They have been threatened that immediately on the passing of this Bill their services will be terminated.  I shall have something to say on the Fifth Stage of the Bill, but I believe that if this section is allowed to remain that this House is inflicting very grave hardships on these men.  It is well known that there is a very strange movement at the back of the scenes in this connection.  Only recently one of the men appointed received a communication from the Meath Hospital signed by Cecil W. Robinson, secretary of the Medical Board.  The letter which he received is in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" />&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I am instructed by the Medical Board to forward the enclosed copy of the Meath Hospital Bill, 1950, as amended in Select Committee.  For your information please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 12 is marked with X's and stripes, directing his attention to the fact that when the House passes the section, the door is waiting for him. In other words it says: &ldquo;This is to tell you to clear from the Meath Hospital. Get out.  The moment we get power in our hands you are going to go.&rdquo;  I am satisfied that the moment this threat was passed on from the Secretary of the Medical Board to this well-known doctor, that it was the first intimation that he should leave the Meath Hospital. It is a clear kick in the pants to the board who made that appointment. You have an appointment made on the 15th February and on the 16th February a letter, with a copy of the Bill, on which there are crosses and stripes intended to denote the seriousness of it, is sent to one of these men. I believe this section is very damaging to these good men.  I believe it is a section that, if not deleted, is going to create a lot of disturbance.  It will arouse in the country an interest in the power of secret organisations that will be alarming.  I ask the House to reject this section.  I am glad that Deputy T. O'Sullivan has opposed it, because if he had not risen to oppose it, I would have done so.  I believe that grave hardship will be inflicted on these men by this section.  They were the best qualified and the most highly qualified candidates for the post.  I know that the members of the present committee of management would not have appointed these men if they did not think that they were the most suitable and highly qualified candidates for these positions.  For that reason I join with Deputy T. O'Sullivan in asking the House that this section be deleted from the Bill because otherwise it will be the means of creating disorder and high tension in the minds of certain people who have information at their disposal concerning the whole outfit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel to a certain extent that I have a grievance against the House because, on Second Reading, I did suggest to the House that consideration of the Second Reading should be deferred for a period of 12 months.  I found myself alone in that view and could not get endorsement of the opinions to which I gave expression from any section of the House.  I would gather from some of the observations made by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Flanagan that, perhaps, if they had been in the House they might have taken a similar view of the section to that to which I gave expression. Having said that let me go on to make this case to Deputy Flanagan: I believe that the Bill to which the House gave a Second Reading, was in its then form a bad one, and one which I would feel justified in asking the House at some subsequent stage to reject.  But the Bill that was given into the hands of the Select Committee, over which Deputy McCann presided, is now, having been dealt with by that Select Committee, a very different measure. The main change that has been made in the Bill as will be obvious to Deputies, is that the principle of democratic and popular control of this voluntary hospital has been accepted.  To my mind, it is almost a misnomer in present circumstances to speak of voluntary hospitals because of purely voluntary hospitals we have now practically none, with perhaps one exception.  The principle of democratic and popular control, having been accepted, and unanimously accepted, by the Select Committee, I would suggest to Deputy Flanagan that the Bill now being considered by the Dáil on recommittal is substantially a different Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a good deal of weight and justice in his observations concerning the medical gentlemen recently <Col N="541" /> appointed, but I would suggest to the House that the most useful way to approach this Bill is to approach it objectively, divorced completely from the situation which Deputies know exists outside.  The method which the Select Committee adopted in considering the various amendments, and in bringing the Bill into its present form : the touchstone which they applied was, to what extent can we evolve a Bill which will be a model for the governors in control not only of the Meath hospital, which is in question in this case, but of all other voluntary hospitals. There has been a good deal of partisanship feeling about this Bill.  I repeat that I believe that, as initiated, it was a bad Bill.  I believe that its parentage was open to question, but I think the job done by the Select Committee on the Bill has legitimised it and given it a respectable appearance, and that the Dáil need not now be ashamed of it or be afraid to pass it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only fair to Deputy Flanagan and to Deputy O'Sullivan who have just spoken to say that neither of these Deputies sees anything generally in the Bill.  I think it is fairly well agreed that the Bill, in general, is a good one.  These two Deputies expressed their opposition in particular to sub-section (2) of Section 12.  I do not have to take Deputy Con Lehane's advice, but I will, if he wants me to, divorce my mind entirely from the background which led up to the introduction and to the bringing of this Bill to its present stage.  Suffice it to say that these appointments were recently made by a properly constituted board.  That was so held in a decision given in our High Court of Justice.  These appointments were made as a result of advertisements issued or at least of one advertisement which was inserted in the <i>Irish Medical Journal.</i>  That, in itself, was an indication to those reading the <i>Medical Journal</i> that the advertisement had all the appearance of being a bona fide advertisement with, impliedly, the blessings of the Irish Medical Association and their approval. The 20 surgeons who responded to that advertisement must be taken to have responded to it in good faith.  They <Col N="542" /> responded to the advertisement a long time before this letter, written by this Meath hospital official, was posted to the appointees.</P>

      <P>A good many days subsequent to the advertisement appearing in the <i>Medical Journal</i>, and a good many days subsequent to the response by the 20 applicants to that advertisement.  Therefore, these applicants, many of whom were resident outside this country at the time, getting experience to make themselves better qualified to fulfil their mission whenever they came back home, must be presumed to have acted in good faith in responding to that advertisement.</P>
      <P>Without delving too deeply into the history of this hospital, I think it is generally agreed that this was the first occasion on which any advertisement was inserted or any applicants were called or at least notice of vacancies in the hospital was conveyed generally through any public means to would-be applicants for a post in that hospital. Therefore, it makes the position of the men who were subsequently appointed all the more serious to have this <i>postfactum</i> amendment inserted in the Bill on the Committee Stage.  It is <i>post-factum</i> in so far as that they had applied for the job, that they had gone through their interview and that the best men were selected.</P>
      <P>It should be known, too, that two senior degrees were necessary before a man's application was even considered. As far as I know, it is usual to accept a senior degree before any surgeon is appointed to any voluntary or public hospital in this country, but when two senior degrees are necessary and when each of the men who applied had two senior degrees, it must be presumed, beyond doubt, that the men who got the appointments were well qualified in every way, and were well suited to carry out the duties expected from them as members of the medical staff of the Meath hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> Now, within the last 20 or 25 years the National University of Ireland has sent out graduates to practise in their various professions in this country and outside of it.  I say that it is to the eternal credit of the teaching staffs of the university that these graduates can take their place with the best to be found in any country and in any faculty.  I think that has been exemplified to the full in the case of the medical appointments that have been made in this country of young graduates of the National University of Ireland.  Many of those young men went abroad to get experience in the best hospitals in the world, under the best and most eminent surgeons and medical men, and then came back to their own country ready and willing to bestow their knowledge for the benefit of their own people at home who might be in need of it. Many of those young men were, and are, the sons of poor people.  Their parents had to make tremendous sacrifices to put their sons through their university and medical courses.  It has to be said to the credit of those young men that they did not waste the opportunities they got or the hard-earned money of their parents.</P>
    <P>With regard to the necessity for these appointments, I am informed that, at the time these appointments were advertised, there were in this hospital four surgeons in all, one general surgeon and three specialist surgeons.  The general surgeon, I am informed, was a man of advanced years, while the three specialist surgeons included a man who is internationally famous and whose reputation is second to none in any part of the world in his own sphere.  As regards the other two, one was a specialist in the ear, nose and throat, and the other in gynaecology.  Therefore it is eminently clear to anybody that more appointments were needed for the proper administration of this hospital.  These appointments were advertised by the board because it realised that, and also in the hope that it would get suitable men well qualified to fulfil the duties which apparently were waiting to be fulfilled in this hospital. I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that there will be no harm done by raising the matter.  My anxiety is that the unfortunate smallholders and people who were induced by the Minister's statement to put their money into the rearing of poultry and egg production should not now find themselves thrown on a lee-shore in the same way as the Minister threw the flax growers in 1948. I do not want to see that condition of affairs prevailing.  When the Minister comes along at this stage and says: &ldquo;No money, no eggs,&rdquo; that represents the Minister's attitude.  I have also a very definite objection to the manner in which the Minister is meeting this matter.  Speaking in this House on 14th February last, as reported in column 184 of the Official Reports, the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No. I did not negotiate the eggs agreement.  It was my predecessor, and my predecessor left me in the position of going to England with £5,000,000 worth of eggs on my hands to negotiate an agreement... I will never make an agreement <Col N="545" /> about eggs with such a provision as was in the agreement of 1947 that we would spend £1,350,000 maintaining egg production with no proviso as to what the British would pay for those eggs when produced, and I will not send my successor to London with a vast surplus hanging around his neck to try and make a price agreement for that surplus, as in my case...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have here also the Minister's statement on the 5th August, 1948, as reported in Volume 112, column 2246, of the Official Report, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the agreement made by Deputy Smith was a good agreement. It bound me by contract, when I went to London, but it caused me no uneasiness.  I think it was well negotiated for our people. It provided me when I came into office with a useful instrument for the development of an extremely valuable branch of our agricultural industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's opinion on 5th August, 1948, of the agreement, which he now attacks Deputy Smith for making, after being seven or eight months in office and having time to examine the agreement to see what it was worth.  After he had been over in London and examined matters there he came back to this House and praised the previous Minister.  Then he comes along with this kind of stuff afterwards when he had made as big a mess of the eggs question as he made of the flax question.  As I said, I am only concerned with the position of our unfortunate people.  This is a message which the Minister sent out to the people of this country in May, 1948, with his photograph on it:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;MESSAGE FROM THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE.</P>
    <P>It used to be the rule that when egg supplies increased the price went down.  That is no longer true.  We have made an agreement with the British Ministry of Food that the more eggs we send to the British market the more they will pay for our eggs.</P>
    <P>It is as a result of this agreement that shippers can afford to pay 3/- <Col N="546" /> per dozen for eggs to the producers.</P>
    <P>Indian meal is selling for 28/- a cwt., and it used always to be said that if you could get as much for a hundred (10 dozen) of eggs as a cwt. of Indian meal cost, eggs paid a profit to the producer.  You can get 2/- per cwt. more than the price of Indian meal now, so you can be sure of a good profit on every hundred you sell.</P>
    <P>For the next five years, I believe, you can earn a good profit on every hundred of eggs you sell, and at the same time every quarter of eggs you sell to the eggler is a real and valuable help to the country.</P>
    <P>This is a free country, so you can sell your eggs, eat your eggs, or get rid of your hens altogether if you want to; but if you want to help your own Government to secure steadily improving terms in the British market:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Keep only pure-bred hens.</P>
    <P>(2)  Kill off the common hens (they eat a lot but they lay very little).</P>
    <P>(3)  Sell as many eggs to the eggler as you can.</P>

      <P>I shall not inflict on this House a résumé of all the things that happened after that.  On August <Col N="547" /> 5th, 1948, we have at column 2245 of the Official Report the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I take it that the advantages of the poultry agreement are manifest. In regard to the egg agreement, give credit where credit is due.  The egg agreement was negotiated by my predecessor, Deputy Smith.  For its merits, thank him....  The agreement provides for the farmer of this country a sure and certain market at remunerative prices for any conceivable product that the land of Ireland can produce.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was then a wild campaign waged on eggs.  The unfortunate farmers were induced by their &ldquo;better halves&rdquo; to buy incubators and every kind of machinery that was going.  The county committees of agriculture were inundated with demands for more poultry houses, all of which had to be paid for out of the ratepayers' pockets while the taxpayer paid roughly £250,000 to meet the expenses of this poultry drive, as it was called.  The poultry drive finishes in the position of the Minister standing up here and saying that England would have to pay a better price or we will give her no more eggs. I agree with him entirely in that.  But why come along first and tell the farmers that the more eggs they produce the better the price will be when, instead of the price going up consequential on the price of maize and pollard, which is now 30/- or 33/- a cwt.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the sensible thing would be to give the House as far as I can an objective report of what led up to the present situation.  The story begins in 1947.  During trade talks in London in the Autumn of 1947 the export of eggs to Britain was discussed between the representatives of the Department of Agriculture and the British Ministry of Food.  I ask leave to refer to a copious note on this matter as I want to get this factual material over to the House as simply as I can.  Under the arrangement which was in operation from February, 1944, the scale of prices for eggs payable by the Ministry was related to the quantity exported, the price per great 100 increasing by steps from 24/6 to 29/- according as the volume of exports rose.  The British Ministry of Food officials expressed disappointment that this arrangement had not resulted in a larger flow of exports and that exports of eggs from 1947 were far below what had been anticipated.  The Department of Agriculture officials emphasised <Col N="550" /> that the prices which the Ministry had agreed to pay were not sufficient to induce Irish poultry keepers to increase production.  A further meeting between officials was held on 28th October, 1947, at which the Ministry offered to modify the existing contract by (a) extending its duration by a further year to 31st January, 1951; (b) continuing the existing sliding scale of prices but reducing the minimum quantities necessary to qualify for the top price of 29s. per great 100, and (c) paying an extra bonus price provided the Department were willing to embark on a scheme calculated to expand the production of poultry and eggs and to increase exports.</P>
      <P>At a meeting between British and Irish Ministers on 4th November, 1947, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, indicated that producers were not attracted by the price offered.  He agreed in principle to the spending by the Irish Government of a large sum towards a poultry development scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting between officials of the Department and the Ministry in Dublin on 6th and 7th January, 1948, it was agreed that a satisfactory scheme of development could not be carried through in less than three years.  The cost of the scheme for the three-year period was estimated at £1,350,000.  The Ministry of Food, on their part, agreed to pay a special bonus price of 5/- per great hundred of eggs exported, which, over the three years, 1948-49, 1949-50 and 1950-51, would be equivalent to the sum expended by the Irish Government on the scheme of development.  The quantities of eggs which the Ministry expected to receive during these three years to qualify for the prices agreed to were as follows:&mdash;1948-49, 1,650,000 great hundreds; 1949-50, 1,825,000 great hundreds, and 1950-51, 2,100,000 great hundreds.  The bonus on the price fixed by the Minister was sufficient, with support from the poultry reserve fund to the extent of 1/9 per great hundred, to pay Irish producers 3/- per dozen for eggs during 1948-49.  At that time the 3/- per dozen was payable out of what the British Ministry of Food was paying us, plus a levy on the export of fowl, plus a large levy on the export of turkeys. When I became Minister for Agriculture <Col N="551" /> I stopped the levy on the export of turkeys.</P>
    <P>The effect of the new arrangement was that the target which my predecessor had fixed for his third year of operation was exceeded by me in the first year.  The exports in 1948/49 were 2,231,734 great hundreds; in 1949/50, 3,397,618 great hundreds; and in 1950/51, 3,350,000 great hundreds. This had this embarrassing result that the British undertaking to pay 5/- per long hundred on eggs was subject to an overriding limitation.  I and my colleagues had hit the target after 18 months at the end of which time the British obligation to pay the bonus of 5/- per great hundred had ceased and henceforth the prices of our Irish eggs would have fallen.  I had to go back to London in that situation and say to the British: &ldquo;Look here, I do not accept this business of the British Ministry paying the Irish Government to develop their own poultry industry. What I want is a fair price for the eggs we produce.&rdquo;  We do not want the British or anybody else to subsidise our poultry industry.  I told them to take back the subsidy.  I would not let the British Government subsidise the Irish Department of Agriculture.  I said that I appreciated their offer; that I did not consider it was consistent with the position in this country that we should accept subsidies from a foreign Government.  I said : &ldquo;Let us talk in terms of a fair price for eggs,&rdquo; but appreciative as we are, I release the British from all obligations to pay any further subsidies to the Irish Government.  We would not pay them subsidies and I did not think we had any right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I, therefore, pressed on the British Government that if we were to maintain egg production in this country the only basis on which we could do it would be on the basis of a long-term price.  I said there was no use giving us prices for two or three years.  What I wanted was an agreement with the British Ministry of Food that they would establish a rigid link between the price payable for British eggs and the price paid for Irish eggs. I said to them: &ldquo;When you fix a fair price with me I want that to be linked to whatever prices you are then paying in Great Britain and if your prices go up my prices went up and if your prices go down my prices went down.&rdquo;  The vital flaw was that we were left with £5,000,000 worth of eggs when we were trying to get a price out of the British Ministry of Food for eggs.  That is the truth.</P>
      <P>I said to the British Ministry of Food in London nearly 12 months ago, when I went to meet Mr. Webb&mdash;there is no reason why I should conceal it&mdash;that the only result of bringing down the price of eggs would be that they would get no eggs; that I would not ask our people to produce eggs and sell them to the British for less than the cost of production and that I would not ask the British to pay me a fantastic price simply because they were under pressure for food which was essential. I said to Mr. Webb that there was no use trying to buy eggs for a price less than that which would give the producers a modest margin of profit.  There was a long and vigorous negotiation with the Minister of Food.  Eventually we arrived at an agreement whereby I got a proposition to enable me to pay 2/6 a dozen for eggs all the year round. I think the price is itself sufficient to pay 2/- during summer and 2/6 during winter.  When I paid 2/6; for eggs, not one penny was taken off turkeys, and but for the fact that we had a levy on turkeys they would have got no more than half.</P>

      <P>I will face the consequences of informing the public in this country of the truth and I am not one bit apprehensive of the result.  I told the British Ministry of Food that I wanted to see food produced that we could ship to the British people.  I want to send them what the land of this country is capable of producing and I would be happy to let them have <Col N="554" /> it at a fair price.  I will not ask the British Government for a very big price for anything.  I told the Minister in private and I now say it in public: &ldquo;I will not ask our people to produce one single egg or 1 lb. of meat to sell in Great Britain at less than the cost of production.&rdquo;  I want to get a fair price and then we will expand production and be proud to do it.  I would like Deputies, instead of asking me what I propose to do, with our exportable surplus of eggs to tell me what they suggest that they would do with them.</P>
