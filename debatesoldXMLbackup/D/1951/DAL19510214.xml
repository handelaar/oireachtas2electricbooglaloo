      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is yet in a position to state what, if any, decision has been made by the Government regarding methods of bringing under review by the Dáil the activities and financial operations of State-sponsored bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave in this House to a similar question asked by him on the 15th November last, in which I informed him that the consideration of this matter by the Government had reached an advanced stage and that its outcome would probably entail proposals either for a Resolution of Dáil Éireann amending the Standing Orders of the House or for legislation. I anticipate that a final decision on the matter will shortly be taken by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that at the recent Fine Gael Ard Fheis the Minister for Education, referring to the stationing of Dutch forces in portion of our country, excused the action of Dutch soldiers in what he described as coming to the hem of Europe to prepare for possible dangers and possible threats to their own liberty; further, whether he is aware that the Minister, deploring the protests made by various responsible bodies here in connection therewith, said that it must be seen that the odd unworthy action of a group is not taken as representative of the heart of the people; and, further, if he will state whether the Government approved of the view-point expressed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister for Education referred to the coming of a Netherlands air unit to the Six Counties, for training, in terms somewhat similar to those indicated in the first part of the Deputy's question, but whether his remarks could be described as &ldquo;excusing&rdquo; the action of that unit is a question of inference. The Government's attitude towards the action in this matter of the British Government and that of the Netherlands Government had already been made quite clear, and the Minister did not express any modification of that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also aware that the Minister for Education made a statement substantially to the effect indicated in the second part of the Deputy's question. Whether it is proper or advisable for individuals or groups to take any <Col N="3" /> action, on their own responsibility, by way of protest against the coming of the Netherlands air unit, is a matter of opinion and does not necessarily involve Government policy.  Lest there should be any misunderstanding on this point, however, I think it well to say that I personally agree with the Minister for Education in deprecating any such action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of the interpretation which may be put on the Minister's speech, would the Taoiseach agree that the Minister's statement is anything but a contribution towards the solution of Partition and indeed may have harmful effects in regard thereto?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly entirely disagree with the suggestion put forward by the Deputy in his alleged supplementary question.  I think the statement, speaking for myself personally, was an entirely proper one, with which I personally fully agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether, during the course of the recent bank strike, he had interviews with the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, if it is correct that some members of this committee are not Irish nationals, and if he will say whether he proposes to recommend to the Government the introduction of proposals for legislation which will preclude non-nationals from having a voice in the control of a service so vital to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During the recent bank strike I had no interviews with the Irish Banks' Standing Committee. I had discussions, however, with <Col N="5" /> representatives of the Irish Bankers' Joint Committee, which is concerned entirely with staff matters and is distinct from the Irish Banks' Standing Committee.  Every such representative who was present at any interview with me was an Irishman.</P>
      <P>The answer to the final part of the question is in the negative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make available the relevant statistics concerning the number of non-nationals who are acting as directors of the banking concerns carrying on business within the State, and, further, if he will consider the setting up of a Government commission of inquiry into the influence and activities of non-nationals on the banking services available to members of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From the available information, it appears that, of the 70 directors of the nine Irish commercial banks, 54 are Irish.  All the directors of the Bank of Ireland, the Hibernian Bank, the Munster and Leinster Bank, the Royal Bank of Ireland and the National City Bank are Irish.  Among the directors of the four other banks (namely, the National Bank, the Northern Bank, the Provincial Bank of Ireland and the Ulster Bank), 16 are described as being of British nationality.  Of those 16, however, ten reside in Ireland, nine in Belfast, and one in Dublin.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, banking has already been the subject of two commission of inquiry since the establishment of the State, and I see no reason for setting up a further commission.</P>

      <P>It is not yet possible to estimate accurately the debit balance on current account of the balance of international payments for 1950, but it is believed to have been approximately £30,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state whether any increase in old age pensions is contemplated, and whether he will recommend to the Government such an increase in view of the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Government came into office the rates of old age pensions have been increased and the means test has been modified in favour of claimants, by the Social Welfare Act, 1948.  These changes have involved an increase of approximately £2,250,000 in the yearly cost.</P>
      <P>The matter is being further considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that these aged persons have a greater claim to consideration than other sections of the community who have received increment increases within recent months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to put old age pensioners in competition with other sections of the community.  The difficulties are being examined sympathetically and are understood by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Tomás Ó Deirg Tomás Ó Deirg">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Deirg</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state (a) the total number of old age pension recipients and the number in receipt of the full rate of pension; (b) the total annual cost of old age pension payments, and (c) the estimated additional cost of paying the present full rate of pension without any means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest available figures regarding the numbers of recipients of old age pension are for the last Friday in December, 1950.</P>
      <P>At that date the total number of recipients was 161,232.  Of these 136,509 were in receipt of the maximum rate, 17/6 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of pensions in the year to <Col N="28" /> 31st March, 1950, was £7,077,775.  The estimated cost for the current financial year is £7,150,000.</P>
    <P>To pay the present full rate of pension without any means test to all persons over 70 years of age and to blind persons who could qualify, would, it is estimated, cost an additional £2,541,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be so kind as to tell the House when he proposes to provide this £2,541,500 which this would cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will put down a question instead of picking from other questions, I will reply to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Tomás Ó Deirg Tomás Ó Deirg">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Deirg</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the estimated annual cost of the proposed amendment of Section 4 (3) of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, under Section 82 of the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the annual cost of this proposed amendment would be of the order of £150,000 to £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Tomás Ó Deirg Tomás Ó Deirg">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Deirg</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the number of claimants for old age pensions in 1948-49 and 1949-50 (a) who were in receipt of home assistance, and (b) who were granted the full rate of old age pension in addition to their income from home assistance; and, further, if he will state the present ruling of his Department in such cases and the date from which it took effect and whether retrospective payment will be made to all pensioners who may be affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No statistics are available as to the numbers of persons who have obtained full old age pensions in addition to home assistance.</P>
      <P>Since October, 1949, the ruling in such cases has been that home assistance is not to be included in calculating means for the purposes of the Old Age Pensions Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an old age pensioner considers he is entitled to an increase of pension, <Col N="29" /> whether as a result of this ruling or for any other reason, it is open to him to raise a question for increase by writing to that effect to the local Social Welfare officer.  The question would be investigated and decided in the same manner as an original claim; but if an increase should be granted, the provisions of the Acts do not admit of payment of the increase being allowed from any date earlier than the Friday following the date on which notice of the question was received by the Social Welfare officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister that there is a statutory bar to making retrospective payment in these cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The Act as at present drafted does not permit retrospective payment in such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say under what statutory authority the ruling that he has referred to was made&mdash;will he give the reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost of home assistance payments for the year ended 31st March, 1948, was £578,026 13s. 3d. and the number of persons in receipt of such payments as at 31st March, 1948, was 63,173.  The corresponding figures for the year ended 31st March, 1949, were £621,196 3s. 11d. and 62,163.</P>
      <P>Statistics for the year ended 31st March, 1950, are not yet complete, but the corresponding figures for the period 27th March, 1949, to 25th March, 1950, were £731,585 and 59,979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that home assistance payments are made by local public assistance authorities and estimates of expenditure are not furnished <Col N="30" /> to my Department.  The estimated figures for the year 1950-51 cannot therefore be given.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that the Irish News Agency has contacted English newspapers with the object of supplying them with news and features to the detriment of Irish journalists who are accredited Dublin correspondents of those journals; and, further, whether the taxpayers' money is to be devoted to injuring the livelihood of Irish journalists by permitting the Irish News Agency, which is supported by public funds, to compete <Col N="34" /> with them at reduced rates in the world news markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that the Dublin daily newspapers have frequently been approached by the Irish News Agency for permission to cover important events such as the recent inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Dublin and whether this indicates a departure from the declared object of the agency, which was stated to be established for national propaganda purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>As these questions are closely linked together, I think it will be best if I answer them comprehensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish News Agency is now furnishing almost all newspapers in Britain, and some in other countries, with a news service from Ireland.  In brief the Irish News Agency is supplying an outward service comparable to that supplied by the several non-Irish news agencies which operate in Ireland.  This service includes the reporting of court cases where such reports are requested by a client newspaper, as in the case mentioned in Deputy Byrne's second question. The service is not offered to any newspaper at reduced rates.  The agency is not supplying a service of Irish news to the Irish newspapers and it is not correct that the Dublin daily newspapers have frequently been approached by the agency for permission to cover important events for them.  Only one such approach was made and that was in the first month of the agency's operation. The suggestion that the sending out of news from Ireland to countries abroad is detrimental to Irish journalists is capable of being applied to any of the non-Irish news agencies which operate in Ireland; the fact that an Irish News Agency provides such a service cannot be open to objection.  I do not agree that the agency's activities are detrimental to the interests of Irish journalists and I do not think that this view is taken by the competent journalistic organisations.  The operations of the agency have, in fact, <Col N="35" /> benefited quite a large number of journalists in Ireland, apart altogether from those who are employed on its staff.</P>
    <P>It is true that when I introduced the Bill setting up this agency I did not think it would be possible for it to compete effectively with other news agencies in the field of news.  When, however, the board of the news agency went into this whole question very thoroughly, in the light of the advice received from the skilled agency personnel whom it had appointed, it decided that the agency not only could compete in the field of news with other news agencies, but must do so if it was to achieve the overriding purpose for which it was set up, i.e., to ensure an outward flow of objective news on Ireland.  Since then, and especially since the opening last month of the agency's first full-scale outward service into Britain, the agency has been competing, and successfully competing, in this field. Agency material is now appearing regularly in quite a large number of foreign newspapers, and is already beginning to bring about a more balanced presentation of Irish news.</P>
    <P>I regret that the restricted framework of an answer to a parliamentary question scarcely allows discussion of the complex factors involved in a question of this kind.  I shall be glad, however, at any time to consult with Deputy Byrne or any other Deputy, on matters arising out of the agency's activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that reports covering the Baltinglass post office were furnished to British papers and to American papers also, and that these reports were grossly untrue, misleading and calculated to discredit this country?</P>

      <P>Wheat and beet are remunerative cash crops and farmers are themselves the best judges of the quantities of such crops that they may profitably produce.  Feeding barley, oats, potatoes and silage are crops primarily for conversion into live stock and live-stock products on the farmer's own farm, an alternative for which has been heretofore readily obtainable in the shape of purchased feeding-stuffs. This alternative source of supply is no longer certain and it is urgently necessary to provide against absolute shortage.</P>

Surely, the Minister must admit that he made a serious omission in not referring to an increased acreage for sugar beet, and, if he made a mistake with regard to sugar beet, is it not open to us to suspect, at least, that he may have made a greater mistake in regard to wheat?</P>

      <P>With permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 84, 85, 86 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of the appointment of the members of the Prices Advisory Body are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The members have been appointed for the period 2nd January, 1951, to 31st December, 1951, inclusive, and hold office subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the Prices Advisory Body Order, 1951.  The chairman of the body continues to act as a judge of the Supreme Court.  He is paid a motorcar allowance at the rate of £100 per annum.  The vice-chairman is paid an allowance at the rate of £500 per annum in addition to his Civil Service salary.  Two of the ordinary members are remunerated at the rate of £1,000 per annum each.  The other two members are paid fees at the rate of £500 per annum each.</P>
      <P>From 12th January to 12th February, 1951, inclusive, the Prices Advisory Body has held 22 meetings; in addition, individual members of the body have taken part on a number of occasions in discussions with the representatives of traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to and including 12th February, 1951, the number of applications for price revision received by my Department or the Prices Advisory Body was 172; the body has considered 46 of <Col N="62" /> these applications and has made recommendations in 27 cases, 13 of which have been put into operation by directions made under the standstill Order. The remaining recommendations are still under consideration.  In the case of two applications, the consideration of which was very far advanced before the body was set up, price increases have been sanctioned by me without reference to the body.</P>
    <P>It is not practicable to publish in respect of all or some of the main classes of goods and services to which the Prices and Charges (Standstill) Order, 1950, relates, the lowest prices obtaining in the week ended December 2nd, 1950.  The Order is enforced by visits of inspection carried out by officers of my Department.  Provision has been made for the employment of not less than 50 officers on outdoor duties. Twenty-five have already been recruited and the remainder will take up duty shortly.  Meantime, assistance in enforcement is also being given by the general inspectorate, of whom there are 28 employed at present.  In addition, any officer of Customs and Excise and any member of the Garda Síochána are authorised officers for the purpose of enforcement of the Order.  The decision to make the Prices and Charges (Standstill) Order was taken without consultation with organisations representating manufacturing or commercial interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply to this question is somewhat lengthy and detailed, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The reply is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  691 retailers have been prosecuted for overcharging or other offences under Price Control Orders or Regulations since 19th February, 1948, to date.</P>
      <P>(b)  Of these prosecutions, 690 have been brought to conclusion; fines ranging from 1/- to £590 were imposed in 472 cases, together with sentences of imprisonment in two of these cases. The Probation of Offenders Act was applied in 168 cases, 46 cases were dismissed and four cases were adjourned generally.  The offences charged consisted of contraventions of the Prices Orders relating to the following commodities:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>Bacon, bananas, bicycles, binder twine, biscuits, Bovril, bran, bread, bread soda, butter, cheese, candles, cigarettes, cloth and clothing, coffee, condensed milk, cooked ham, corn-flour, currants, dripping, eggs, Erinox, fish (canned and fresh), flour, footwear, fresh meat, horse-shoe nails, jam, kerosene, knitting wool, lard, margarine, maize meal, marmalade, milk (fresh), oatmeal, onions, oranges, Oxo, Ozene, petrol, Persil, pollard, pork, pork sausages, potatoes, pottery, prunes, puddings, Rinso, raisins, semolina, second-hand agricultural machinery, soap, sole leather, suet, sultanas, sulphate of copper, sugar, sweets, and chocolates, tea, tobacco, tomatoes, turf, washing soda, wheatenmeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prosecutions were also brought in some of these cases for contraventions of the Retail Prices (Display) (No. 1) Order, 1938, the Particulars of Sales Order, 1943, and the Retail Prices of <Col N="64" /> Tobacco and Cigarettes (Display) Order, 1943.</P>
    <P>The businesses carried on by the persons or firms prosecuted were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Boot and shoe retailers, chandler, confectioners, co-operative societies, cycle agents, drapers, egg merchants, farmers, fishmongers, fuel vendors, greengrocers and fruiterers, grocers and general merchants, hardware, merchants, hawkers, hucksters and street traders, leather merchant, milk vendors and dairies, outfitters, pork butchers, publicans, tobacconists and victuallers.</P>
    <P>In view of the very large number of prosecution cases involved, the time and labour involved in giving in each individual case the detailed particulars required by the Deputy would not, in my opinion, be justified.  The particulars are, therefore, furnished in summarised form.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="65" /> for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he has received reports that the price of meat has been increased in Dublin recently; and, if so, whether he has had the reports investigated: and, further, if meat prices have been increased, the steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to a report which appeared in a Dublin morning newspaper on the 30th January, 1951, that the price of meat had been increased by 2d. per lb. by a number of Dublin victuallers.  In connection with the report, I would draw the Deputy's attention to a statement by the Prices Advisory Body published in the Press on the 31st January, 1951, to the effect that no application had been made to that body for any increase in the prices specified in the Fresh Meat (Maximum) Prices Order, 1948, and, accordingly, that body has made no recommendation, and no alteration had been made in these prices.</P>
      <P>It was further stated that any case in which higher prices are charged for meat than those fixed by the meat prices Order should be reported.</P>
      <P>In any case of contravention of the meat prices Order, in which adequate evidence is available, I propose to have legal proceedings instituted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that this Order was made in January and fixed maximum prices prevailing in the week ending 2nd December, 1950.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill provides that the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, shall apply to the local financial year, ending on 31st March, 1952.  No new principle is involved; this Bill merely proposes to continue the agricultural grant on its present basis for a further year.  The 1946 Act applied to the two financial years 1946-47 and 1947-48.  Continuing Acts on the lines of the present Bill have continued it in operation until the 31st March, 1951.</P>
      <P>I am sure that deputies are familiar with the history of the agricultural grant.  However, I will run briefly through that history again.  Legislation dealing with the grant dates back to the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.  This Act fixed the grant at the sum of £599,011.  For 27 years the grant remained at the same figure until the year 1925, when it was doubled.  Between 1925 and 1946 the basis of distribution of the grant and its amount have been altered on a number of occasions.  Originally a flat rate of relief was given on all agricultural land but two new principles had been introduced prior to the enactment of the 1946 Act.  A higher rate of relief was given on valuations not exceeding £20 and on the first £20 of higher valuations, and extra relief was granted to farmers in respect of men at work on the holdings.  The amount of the grant was fixed at £1,870,000 in respect of the year 1935-36 and it remained at that figure for 11 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1946 the amount of the grant was always a fixed sum specified in each successive Act.  The 1946 Act made the fundamental change that a grant of a fixed amount <Col N="70" /> was no longer provided.  Instead it provided that the grant would be the sum needed to give relief on the following basis:</P>
    <P>(1)  A primary allowance at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate on land valuations not exceeding £20, and the first £20 of higher valuations.</P>
    <P>(2)  A supplementary allowance at the rate of one-fifth of the general rate on the whole of the land valuation above £20.</P>
    <P>(3)  An employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation above £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance does not exceed £6 10s. in respect of each man at work.</P>
    <P>The effect of the new method of calculation was that the grant which had been fixed at £1,870,000 for the previous 11 years increased by over £1,000,000 to £2,910,378 for the year 1946-47 and increased further to £3,175,726 for 1947-48, to £3,624,035 in 1948-49 and to £3,971,722 for 1949-50.  Figures for the current year are not yet available, but as the average general rate struck by county councils for this year is much the same as for last year, there should be no appreciable change in the amount of the grant.  The grant for the year 1949-50 shows an increase of 112 per cent.  Over the figure for 1945-46, the last year before the coming into operation of the 1946 Act.</P>
    <P>The fact that the grant varies with changes in the general rate has helped to shield farmers in recent years from the full consequences of the general, but unavoidable, increases in rates which have taken place.  Thus in the year 1949-50, while the average gross rate in county health districts was 22/7¾d., the average net rate assessed on agricultural land was 11/3½d.  The grant, in other words, afforded the farmer relief to the extent of 50 per cent. of the general rate in respect of any agricultural land in his possession.</P>
    <P>The total sum of £3,971,722 paid in 1949-50 was divided as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Primary allowances, £2,667,760; supplementary allowances, £708,842; employment allowances, £583,565; amount paid to urban councils, £11,555.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> As I have already stated no change in the method of distribution of the agricultural grant is contemplated by this measure.  It is merely a continuing Bill.  The principle that the incidence of rating should fall less heavily on agricultural land than on other hereditaments has been accepted for a long time, and I feel there is no need for me to go more deeply into the matter at this stage.  Deputies may ask why it is necessary to bring in annually a Bill which continues the grant on its present basis.  The answer is that changes in economic conditions might necessitate amendments in the present legislation, so it is thought advisable that the period covered by each continuing Bill should be short, so that an examination of the amount and form of the grant can be made at frequent intervals in the light of prevailing conditions.</P>
    <P>The principles on which this measure is based have been accepted by the House on many previous occassions. Accordingly, I feel that I can confidently ask the House to give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very normal example of how far the promises made by the Parties who now constitute the Government of this country are unfilled in their realisation.  When the general election of 1948 was fought, we were told that there was going to be a general relief of the burdens which were imposed upon agriculture and that the position of the worker on the land was going to be improved. The Coalition Government has been in office for three years; how long it is going to remain in office is of course a matter of doubtful conjecture.  But it has been in office for three years and, during that period, it has not done anything, so far as the burden of local administration upon the farmers is concerned, to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures which the Parliamentary Secretary has given to the House are worth pondering on. Deputies will remember, of course, that it was the plea of the predecessors of Fine Gael&mdash;the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;when they were in office, that they represented the <Col N="72" /> interest of the thrifty, hardworking, industrious people, particularly exemplified by those who were engaged in agricultural pursuits.  We have been told by the Parliamentary Secretary, without undue emphasis upon the period of time, that the grant in relief of rates upon agricultural land was originally £599,000, that it was increased to £1,198,000 in 1925, and that it remained virtually unchanged until some unspecified date, when it was brought to £1,700,000 in the year 1935.  The relevant point here is that the increase was made, not by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, not by any Fine Gael Administration which professed to be the friend of the farmers, but by the Fianna Fáil Administration which, at least so far as the Opposition could stigmatise it, was regarded by the then Opposition as not being unduly friendly to the agricultural interests.  Of course, that was like many of the Opposition statements then, without foundation.</P>
    <P>However, what do we find following that?  In the year 1946 new principles, completely new principles, were applied to this problem of rates upon agricultural land.  Already we had introduced, in previous legislation, the principle of adjusting the relief to be given to agricultural land to the amount of employment which the landholder would give to agricultural labourers.  We did introduce that in, perhaps, a restricted form, because we imposed a global figure which fixed the aggregate amount of relief which would be given to agriculturists as a whole, yet providing at the same time that the landowner who gave a greater amount of employment would receive a proportionately greater amount of relief in the rates on his agricultural land.  In the year 1946, this restriction upon the total amount of relief which might be given was removed and, instead of that, we introduced a new principle whereby the amount of relief given as a whole would depend, first of all, on the number of holdings which did not exceed £20 in valuation, and then upon a proportion of those holdings which exceeded £20 in valuation.</P>
    <P>It is not so easy to express this.  I <Col N="73" /> should say that, first of all, we adopted the principle that the maximum amount of relief would be given to holdings which did not exceed £20 in valuation and that simultaneously a similar amount of relief would be given in respect of the first £20 of valuation of all agricultural holdings.  Then we introduced the employment allowance, related to the number of individuals employed upon a farm for a wage, and we fixed it that that would amount to £6 10s. per person employed upon the farm.  Over and above that we gave a supplementary relief based on what had been the preceding rate.  In consequence of that&mdash;and this is the point I wish to bring home&mdash;whereas up to 1945 the aggregate amount of relief in respect of the rates on agricultural land amounted to £1,700,000, in the year past this amount has been increased to £3,900,000.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I was rather sorry that Deputy MacEntee, while he was speaking, did not occasionally look round to see Deputy Aiken because if he did he would realise the uncomfortable position Deputy Aiken occupies remembering a speech which he delivered in 1946.  Deputy MacEntee who is always so keen on the question of the collective responsibility of the Government is now leaving the House because he does not wish to hear a statement in reference to this matter that was made by Fianna Fáil when Deputy Aiken introduced his Budget in 1946.  I want to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government on not taking the line in regard to relief of rates on agricultural land, that Deputy Aiken promised was going to be taken when he spoke in this House on the <Col N="76" /> 8th May, 1946, as reported in column 2357 of Volume 100.  Deputy Aiken on that occasion was dealing with this principle of giving relief from rates on agricultural land in respect to the employment given, the grant not to exceed £6 10s. od. for each man employed. I confess freely that that was a good scheme, but Deputy Aiken nevertheless made it absolutely crystal clear and positive that that scheme was introduced for two years only and that it was to come to an end on the 5th April, 1948.  As reported in the column to which I have referred Deputy Aiken said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to make it clear that the wage-subsidy part of the new scheme is intended to last only for this year and next year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That meant that it was to last only for two years.  I want to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and this Government on having paid last year something over £500,000 in relief of rates on agricultural land, because of the employment given on such land, although Deputy Aiken forewarned us that it was not going to be paid after the 5th April, 1948.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy MacEntee is rather disingenuous.  He rather twitted the Government on not having done anything to improve the position so far as the relief of rates on agricultural land is concerned.  He more or less suggested that the Government had failed to do better in this respect for the farmer than Fianna Fáil when they were in power.  I think the Deputy completely forgot that when a private member's motion was introduced last year which provided for a very substantial improvement in the relief of rates on agricultural land and which provided for limiting rates on agricultural land to a maximum of 7/6 in the £, on a division the entire Fianna Fáil Party voted with the Government <Col N="77" /> against the motion.  I have a distinct recollection of what happened on that occasion and I think I saw Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Norton walking into the same division lobby to vote against that proposal which would have substantially improved the amount of relief given to farmers.  I am not at all satisfied with the position as it is.  Deputy MacEntee may claim a lot of credit for having improved the position in 1946.  I think he will admit that that concession was made rather grudgingly.  The references to that concession made by the Minister for Finance on that occasion would tend to show that he laboured under the impression that the farmers in this country were getting rather too much. The actual fact is that the burden of rates, notwithstanding the concession given in the Agricultural Relief of Rates Bill in 1946, has increased considerably. Notwithstanding that relief, the farmers have to pay very much more in actual cash in rates than they were paying in 1946.  They are worried because the net rate which they have got to pay is much higher than it was three or four years ago.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would consult any farmer on that point and look at his rates receipts for the past three or four years, he will find that the rates have been mounting steadily year by year.  I should not like anybody to get away with the suggestion that the general taxpayer, through this Bill, is making some generous provision for the farmers in the matter of rates.  I think the burden of rates is altogether too high and that general policy should be directed towards reducing agricultural costs so as to bring down the cost of food and the cost of living generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts which the Parliamentary Secretary has put before the House are worthy of serious notice not only by the Dáil but by the country.  The relief of agricultural land is related to the total rate struck on agricultural land throughout the country.  Three-fifths of the rates on agricultural land, up to valuations of £20, are borne by the Government under the 1946 Act and one-fifth above the £20 valuation.  Therefore, if the burden on the State has gone up by <Col N="78" /> £1,000,000 or more, it has gone up very much more on the farmers.  I have not the figures with me, but the Parliamentary Secretary might tell the House what is the amount of the increase which the farmers are paying now as against what they were paying in 1946 and 1947, which was the last year for which Fianna Fáil had responsibility. That would be an interesting figure, because the Government have been steadfast in their endeavour to throw every burden they can on the ratepayers as against the Central Exchequer.  For example, if the Minister for Agriculture wants some money for agricultural education, he tries to get it on to the backs of the farmers and ratepayers.  We have the same story in regard to a thousand and one schemes which the Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers have introduced in recent years.  Every effort is made to throw back on the farmers costs which, if the people opposite were on these benches, they would be advocating should be borne by the Central Government.</P>
      <P>It is true that, on the introduction of this particular measure in 1946&mdash;when I was announcing it in the Budget&mdash;a limitation of two years was put on that portion of the scheme relating to employment on farms above a £20 valuation.  That, as I say, was limited for two years; but many schemes announced by Fianna Fáil with a limitation of commitment forward were carried on when the commitment had become exhausted.  In a thousand cases Fianna Fáil was better than its word: it was better than its promise, which is a little bit different from the present Government, since, in many cases, it has failed to live up to its promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take one aspect of rates which is bearing very hardly on the farming community and on the rural population and which is an increased burden on them.  I refer to grants towards the roads.  When we started in 1946 to give increased grants to the Road Fund so as to put the roads into a proper state after the damage that had been done to them during the war, we did not promise that, for any number of years ahead, we would give increased road grants, but in fact we <Col N="79" /> did.  When the Fine Gael Coalition came along one of their first acts was to cut, from £4,000,000 to about £2,000,000, the amount of money that was being spent on putting the roads into a proper state of repair.  That cut of from £4,000,000 to £2,000,000 put a greatly increased burden on the farming community and on all the ratepayers.  The gentlemen opposite, who were going to give everything free&mdash;free artificial manures to farmers&mdash;are supporting a Government which is putting increased burdens on the farmers.  Even the subsidy that was in the Fianna Fáil Estimates for 1948-49 for artificial manures was cut out by the present Government, and, although they speak about free artificial manures in this year, the farmers this year cannot even cash certain credits for artificial manures which were given during the Fianna Fáil régime.</P>

      <P>Not any wider than Deputy Sweetman did, but I do not propose to follow him out to the end. I want to say this, that I am glad the Fine Gael Government and Coalition were committed to bearing at least three-fifths of the burden of rates up to £20 valuation, and of one-fifth over it. If they had not been committed to that, I doubt whether they would be accepting even that much of the burden so far as it concerns the ratepayers of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Aiken that the terms of the 1946 Act were mainly brought in as a result of the pressure from Fine Gael and farmers concerning these abatements.  The figures show that 1946 was taken as the basis for the agitation carried on by Fine Gael and by the farmers of that time for this abatement.  Reference was made by Deputy MacEntee&mdash;I thought he would refrain from doing so&mdash;to the early 30's.  He referred to 1935, and tried to make a comparison as between the conditions which existed then with conditions in 1946 or at the <Col N="80" /> present time.  We all know the level of poverty which existed amongst the farmers in 1935, and the need there was at that time to give them reliefs and rebates as far as possible. Deputy MacEntee appears to labour under the mistaken belief that farmers would prefer charity and rebates to a reasonable measure of prosperity.  I want to tell him that they would much prefer a policy which would give them a measure of prosperity rather than be in the position of having to ask anybody for either reliefs or rebates.</P>

      <P>We can all remember when farmers were getting a smaller rebate than they are at the present time&mdash;when they were selling cows at 50/- each and could not sell calves, and when, in fact, farmers were being paid to slaughter calves.  I believe that, as long as we can give the farmers a decent measure of prosperity, they will not agitate for greater reliefs.  They will not ask any other section of the community to bear heavier burdens than they should be called upon to bear. The year 1946 seems to be taken, more or less, as the basis for argument here this evening, but may I point out that, in the last few years, agricultural export levels have increased to a very considerable extent?  It is not just a question of a couple of million pounds that have gone into the farmers' pockets in the last few years.  I believe that the agricultural exports from this country to Great Britain in the last three years have increased by something like £40,000,000.  That is an indication of the prosperity enjoyed by them now.  That is what the majority of the farmers want and not a policy of rebatement or any kind of charity <Col N="81" /> from anybody.  Similarly the price of wheat, beet, sheep, pigs, cattle, etc.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sorry if I have gone out of order, but I feel that this rebatement should be continued for the present because I believe that, with the improved productive capacity of the land in future years, the farmers may not be asking us to bear this burden of £4,000,000 as they did formerly.</P>

      <P>My function this evening is a very small one but, owing to some of the speeches delivered, I rather imagine that the Minister for Agriculture might have been a better person to put the Bill through the House.  Many interesting points have been raised.  With all due respect to him, I do not think that Deputy MacEntee made any real contribution at all to the debate.  His speech was merely a rehash of the 1945-46 Bill. He did twit the Government Benches with the fact that it was the Fianna Fáil Government who introduced this.  I am not concerned with what Government introduced it.  If there is any credit to be given to Fianna Fáil for the introduction of this, I would be the first to give it. I do not believe there was any opposition when the Bill was introduced in the House in 1945 or 1946.  The fact that Fianna Fáil introduced it does not make it any better or worse.  We are still operating Acts of Parliament passed in the time of Queen Victoria. Fianna Fáil worked under Acts passed by a Cumann na nGaedheal Government. I do not think that is an issue which should be debated at length in this House.  The main thing about this Bill is that, even though the principle was introduced in 1946, it is being continued and the Government are prepared to foot the bill, no matter what it is, in respect of rates on agricultural <Col N="82" /> land.  It has increased considerably since 1946.  I do not believe either that there is much use in twitting Deputy Aiken with a speech made by him in 1946 when he proposed to discontinue it after two years because, as he rightly said himself, that probably was the position at that particular time which was to be reviewed in two years.</P>
      <P>I do not, however, agree with some of the statements made by Deputy MacEntee with regard to what he described as the Government's determined policy to try to shove the greater burden on to the ratepayers. I should like to quote for the Deputy some figures to show that, since this Government came into office, the reverse has been the case.  From 1939 to 1948, when Fianna Fáil went out of office, State grants were far less than the amount of money collected by way of rates.  In 1939-40, the total amount collected in rates was £6,500,000 and State grants amounted to £4,700,000. In 1947-48, the total amount collected in rates was a little over £9,000,000 and the State grants were a little over £8,000,000.  In 1948-49, the rates collected amounted to £9,500,000 and the State grants amounted to £10,749,000. In 1949-50, the total rates collected were £11,000,000 and the State grants amounted to £13,000,000.  On these figures, I do not think that anybody can say that the policy of this Government is to try to increase the burden on the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>A lot has been said about the plight of the farmer.  I do not pretend to have any detailed knowledge about agriculture, but I do know this, and I think everybody in the country will subscribe to it, that in the last three years the farmer has enjoyed a degree of prosperity which he did not visualise some years ago.  If rates are a burden on the farmer, I submit that they are a far greater burden on other sections of the community.  I do not think the farmer has had anything to grumble about for the last three years.  He may not be satisfied with the price of this or that particular commodity, but he has received prices and State assistance in the last three years that he never thought he would get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Aiken who alleged that the burden on the farmer as far as rates are concerned has increased substantially and that the State aid had not increased to the same extent.  He asked for some figures.  The net rates assessed on agricultural land increased by £900,000 between 1946 and 1950, but the agricultural grant increased by over £2,000,000.  Perhaps that will answer that portion of Deputy Aiken's question. I should also like to quote these figures for the information of the Deputy and the Opposition generally. The amount of rates the farmers paid on agricultural land in 1938-39 was 5.6 of the agricultural income.  That had decreased in 1949-50 to 3.8 per cent.  It is significant that on this occasion nobody has advocated that there should be absolute derating.  As a matter of fact, as far as any increase in assistance, apart from what is given in this Bill, is concerned, I do not think anybody advocated that to-day.  It has been tested very well in the last two years, because we all remember a motion put down by a Deputy from the independent farmers group in November, 1949, asking for total derating. That was rejected in this House by 79 votes to eight.  That expressed the view of the House that there is not much point in advocating it and I do not think there will be much point in <Col N="84" /> advocating it.  There was also an amendment that the rate in the £ on land should not exceed 7/6, which was also rejected.  I submit, therefore, that this measure is the most equitable and the fairest type of support that can be given to the agricultural community, because it merely means that when the rates increase the State assistance increases also as far as relief is concerned.</P>
      <P>I was also interested to hear Deputy Aiken talk about road grants and saying how generous the Fianna Fáil Government were in 1945-46.  He knows in his heart and soul that it was not a question of generosity because there again the Minister for Local Government in the Fianna Fáil régime at that time merely gave to the local authorities the amount of the moneys accumulated in the road fund less £1,000,000.  Those were the moneys which had accumulated during the war years.  Deputy Aiken and his colleagues also appear to overlook the fact that at the present time substantial financial assistance is being given to farmers by way of drainage.  In the present year there is a sum of £1,750,000 being spent by local authorities on drainage and on the cleaning of streams under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  These are reliefs which the local authorities and the farmers well appreciate.  In any case I would not consider that the matters raised were absolutely relevant, but perhaps it is just as well that some members of the Opposition should get them off their chests.  The important point is that this Bill merely asks that the principle of granting this type of relief to farmers be accepted.</P>

      <P>If any Deputy can think of a better term than this, nobody will appreciate it more than I will.  I think the time has come when we should try to introduce Irish terms as much as possible into matters like this. It has been done before to a certain extent.  We have had the title &ldquo;Córas Iompair Eireann&rdquo;, for instance.  We adopted that title in connection with our transport legislation and it has been accepted and used by the general public.  If we are in earnest in our endeavour to revive the Irish language and if we want to set a good example to the public, we have an easy way of showing our sincerity and our earnestness by doing things like this.  They may be regarded as little things, but they are, nevertheless, an indication of the trend of affairs and they show that we are sincere in our anxiety to revive our native language.  I, therefore, commend this amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with the principle enunciated by Deputy Kissane, but I think the words he used, which seem to me to be a literal translation of the English title, would be somewhat difficult in application.  I am not an authority on terms of this kind, but it is conceivable that a term might be suggested which would not be the correct translation into Irish of assistant county officer.  Perhaps the House would agree to defer this until we reach the next stage in order to give the experts an opportunity of finding a more suitable term.  I can see difficulty in the use of this term.  I can see difficulty in its pronunciation.  I do not think it is <Col N="87" /> the correct term to use and I would prefer to leave it to the experts to decide what is the correct term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably amendment No. 2 will be taken with this.  As I explained on the Second Reading, the title is of a purely temporary character and we hope eventually to base it on the more homely &ldquo;runaí contae&rdquo; which is at present used by county secretaries.  The measure indicates here that in the transition period, we are going to have a temporary officer.  I do not think any better can be done.  Its equivalent in Irish, &ldquo;oifigeach contae&rdquo;, has been utilised here.  It is a temporary provision that we hope will pass speedily in some cases.  I would suggest to the Deputy that there is no question of getting the Irish language out of it, but it is a question of what Irish should be used. &ldquo;County officer&rdquo;, as literally translated, is what we are using.  We prefer to see this nondescript English title replaced by a corresponding type of Irish title so that it would become popular among the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am not satisfied with the statement of the Minister in this connection because it is no argument to say that this is just a temporary measure and that we could do nothing about the question of introducing Irish terms until such time as a permanent measure is introduced here.  The sooner we start introducing Irish terms into legislation of this kind the better.  I think the Minister mentioned that he had in mind the final introduction of the term &ldquo;runaí contae&rdquo;, &ldquo;county secretary&rdquo;, but the fact of the Minister having that in mind need not prevent us from adopting the suggestion, because all that need be done afterwards if we have to have permanent legislation, is to change one word in the terminology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan suggested that this matter should be left over until the Report Stage to give an opportunity to the language experts to have the question of terminology examined.  I think that is not a bad suggestion and <Col N="88" /> I would be prepared to agree, if the Minister would give an undertaking as between now and Report Stage the matter would be submitted to the language experts in the House for the adoption of the proper terminology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to agree to that.  He will probably find a very euphonious description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any justification for departing from a proposal to give the position its Irish equivalent to the English as already suggested in the Bill for the temporary position which will be there, but will not be there for very long. It is a question of what is the more suitable Irish.  I suggest &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; rather than giving a glorified title.  We want the title to be familiarised among the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken up a very unreasonable attitude in this matter.  It should be the function of this House, as far as it can, to popularise Irish terms of important officers either in the State service, or in the local authority service.  This officer will, in the future, even when this Bill is passed, be the county administrator.  There is no doubt about that.  The Minister is just fooling himself in thinking he will not.  He knows quite well that this officer will be the county administrator.  He will be administering in the absence of a council of a county or of an urban authority the affairs of that council or urban authority.  He will be actually responsible for 90 per cent. of the expenditure and for determining 90 per cent. of the expenditure in those particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that no opportunity should be lost by this House in their legislation in putting a name in Irish and Irish only that will be used in ordinary everyday work.  Nobody ever refers to the Taoiseach here as the Prime Minister.  He is referred to as the Taoiseach by everybody.  It is a name that has been learned by the whole community.  He is known as the Taoiseach.  The Uachtarán is known as the Uachtarán.  The Ceann <Col N="89" /> Comhairle is never called the Chairman of the Dáil.  He is known as the Ceann Comhairle.  We want to see here that the higher officer in each county will be known by an Irish term and an Irish term only and that there will be no other term used except the Irish term.  I think that the House should be unanimous on this matter.  I am surprised that everybody is not unanimous on it.  I have no doubt that every individual member of this House is anxious to have and to promote the use of Irish terms in every respect.  Definitely, we should get a permanent Irish term at this stage.  I believe the Minister should have accepted Deputy Cowan's suggestion and agreed to refer this question to the translation officers of the Oireachtas to get a better term than the one here if it is possible.  We are not tied to this general term in respect of this officer and we will definitely press if we do not get the Minister's assurance that he will have this matter examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>All the corresponding titles will be given for every officer. In this particular Bill, there are several officers.  What about the other officers? Why particularly select this man. There is an Irish equivalent being given for this officer as well as every other officer in the Bill.  What is wrong with &ldquo;oifigeach contae&rdquo; as against &ldquo;runaí contae&rdquo;?  That is the only difference.  I suggest that &ldquo;oifigeach contae&rdquo; is a term which would pass as would &ldquo;riarthóir contae&rdquo;, quite apart from Deputy Allen's point with regard to the 90 per cent.  If that is at the back of the amendment, it would seem to pose a different proposition entirely and we ought to continue the manager if his argument about 90 per cent. is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that this is a very minor question, as to what is the more suitable equivalent or translation of &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; for a temporary and transient position.  We suggest that &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; translated into Irish is the proper equivalent to use for the time being.  It is a matter of &ldquo;riarthóir&rdquo; as against &ldquo;oifigeach&rdquo; and which is the more suitable.  If we are to defer it for the purpose of asking <Col N="90" /> the translation staff to give us some other title&mdash;they have probably been consulted already, but I cannot say definitely&mdash;we will probably get one of these terms back.  It is really a trivial matter and there is nothing fundamental about it.  The point of view I hold is that we do not want to entrench this man behind a title which may become popular and familiar.  We prefer to wait for the time when we will have &ldquo;runaí contae&rdquo; which is in use at present in the case of many county secretaries and will be in use as the term &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; passes into oblivion, through retirement or death.</P>

      <P>I want to save the Minister from making a very serious mistake.  What is suggested here may appear to be minor, but there is a very big principle involved.  We will have it bruited round the country to-morrow that the Minister is opposed to the use of the Irish language.  I want to save the Minister from that blunder. Other people are making blunders and we are getting into trouble because of these blunders.  We do not want any more blunders in regard to this matter. There is a very big element in the country who want to see Irish terms used and there is no difficulty in putting the Irish term into this Bill.  There is no principle on which it can be opposed and I want the Minister to agree to the suggestion that it be allowed to go to the translation department, to the experts whom we have.  They will find a suitable term and put it into the Bill, but let him not make a tragic mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very hard to follow the Minister's line of argument. He said that there are other officers mentioned in this measure, and, if we are to be consistent, these should also be in the Irish language.  But let us make a start with the principal officer. The principal officer will be the person in charge of the county.  Whether he is called &ldquo;bainisteor contae&rdquo; or &ldquo;riarthóir contae&rdquo;, he is the principal officer and surely we should be prepared to give him his Irish title.  He will be the one officer standing out in the affairs of the county and for the Minister to say that it is only a minor <Col N="91" /> matter is carrying the argument a little too far.</P>
      <P>The question is whether we are sincere about the revival of the Irish language or not.  If we are sincere about its revival, we will start right now adopting the proper Irish terminology. We had a debate here before Christmas on the position of the universities, and several Deputies made references to the lack of provision in these educational institutions for the promotion of the Irish language.  We expect everybody else to toe the line in connection with the language and are inclined to do nothing ourselves. Here is an opportunity for us to show an example.  Let us show that example and not expect others to put themselves out and expose themselves to difficulties and inconveniences which we are not prepared to face.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister again to reconsider the whole question.  It is a question of vital importance in relation to the language.  There are many people watching us here from that point of view, and, as Deputy Cowan has said, we will be judged on the basis of what we say and do in this House as regards the revival of the language.  It is a serious matter and I ask the Minister to reconsider the position.  I ask him to give an undertaking that, between now and Report Stage, if there is any objection to the terminology proposed here, he will consult the translation staff and have the best possible term adopted.</P>

    <P>My purpose in submitting this and the following amendment &mdash;&ldquo;leas-riarthóir contae&rdquo; in ionad &ldquo;assistant county officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;riarthóir contae&rdquo; in ionad &ldquo;county officer&rdquo;&mdash;was to have the position accepted in regard to these posts that we have generally accepted in regard to the head of the Government being known as Taoiseach, the second in command being known as <Col N="92" /> Tánaiste, the presiding Chairman in the Dáil being known as Ceann Comhairle and his next in command as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We have Córas Iompair Eireann generally accepted now&mdash;the term C.I.E. is probably more often used&mdash;and with the progress that Irish is making all over the country, there is no reason why this term should not be accepted and accepted solely for describing these officials in future.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment is one that should commend itself to the Minister, to the Government, and to the whole Dáil, irrespective of Party, and I did not expect that there would be any objection to it on the part of the Minister. I am surprised that there is.  The words are simple.  I took the best advice I could get in regard to the terms I have used before putting down the amendments.  I think the words I have selected, &ldquo;leas-riarthóir&rdquo;, will describe competently in Irish the position that the new official will occupy. I add my voice to that of Deputy Eamon Ó Ciosáin asking the Minister to accept this amendment.  I would be satisfied if he were agreeable to examine the term.  If he is advised that the term is unsatisfactory and that a better one can be suggested, I will be perfectly satisfied.  I ask him to accept the spirit in which the amendment is put down, that it will be a step forward in the use of Irish generally all over the country.  He should have no difficulty whatever in accepting this amendment.</P>

I made it perfectly clear that it was a question as between two titles for this particular officer, whether he should be called &ldquo;oifigeach chontae&rdquo; or &ldquo;riarthóir chontae&rdquo;.

The question of taking Deputy Ó Briain's version or another one is the point.  It is an office which I hope will be a transient one.  The words &ldquo;riarthóir chontae&rdquo; might be interpreted as &ldquo;county administrator&rdquo;, when we want to keep it as insignificant as possible.  We describe him as &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; and use that only for the temporary period he is there.  He will disappear in time and the permanent officer will not be &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; or &ldquo;riarthóir&rdquo; or &ldquo;oifigeach&rdquo;.  He will be &ldquo;rúnaí chontae&rdquo;.  My reference was to the fact that we are dealing with a temporary office and a dispute as between one term or another does not seem <Col N="94" /> worth the candle.  However, if the movers are very insistent, I am not tied to it and it is purely a minor point to me.

      <P>(a)  the Local Appointments Commissioners recommend a person for appointment as county officer for a county, and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has happened in the past that officers have been selected on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners and for one reason or another have not been appointed by the local authority and there was considerable difficulty, considerable delay and considerable interference with local administration.  It is clear that it is the Local Appointments Commissioners who, in fact, make the appointment although theoretically they only make a recommendation. The object of the amendment is to deal with the situation and provide that where the commissioners recommend a person he shall be deemed to be appointed as county officer as from the date of the recommendation. The fact is that the commissioners recommend a person who must, according to the law, be appointed, but the Bill provides that there may be a period of three months <Col N="97" /> during which there can be a lot of propaganda and considerable waste of time.  It is just as well that we should face up to the situation now.  Where there is a vacancy and a person is recommended by the commissioners he should be deemed to be appointed as from the date of the recommendation. That, in my view, would obviate a lot of the difficulties and delays that have occurred in the past and may occur in the future and it is for that reason that I have put down this amendment.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to delete sub-section (2) (b) of Section 9 and to substitute a new section.  Many objections will be apparent to the House to this procedure. One is that it gives the appointment to the Local Appointments Commissioners whereas it was and is the intention of the Bill to return appointment and removal from office to the elected representatives on the county council.  If this is given effect to the commissioners will make an appointment; the county council meet monthly or bi-monthly and they will find the new county officer installed when they arrive.  He is sent down with instructions to take up duty and I think that is discourteous and bad business.  The county council should at least have an opportunity to receive the recommendation of the commissioners and by a resolution accept their nominee.  If this were accepted nobody would know anything about it until he arrived.  Also he would be paid from the moment of appointment but usually he would be working in another position and would have to give notice.  The county council are entitled at least to the courtesy and respect of getting a recommendation and having the opportunity to accept it.  There is no justification for the amendment; it would make for more confusion than the Deputy thinks and would create awkward situations.</P>

      <P>As far as this amendment is concerned the Minister has offered two arguments, one of which seems reasonable: that there may be difficulties so far as the nominee is concerned.  As far as the county council are concerned they cannot <Col N="98" /> refuse to make the appointment.  They are bound to accept whoever is appointed by the commissioners and the passing of a resolution accepting the appointment of the new county officer is purely a formality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  But there is an interim period, whereas the amendment says that when the commissioners recommend a person as county officer he shall be deemed to be appointed as from the date of recommendation and he is entitled to take up duty at once. I am not questioning the county council's acceptance of the nomination, but in courtesy and as a matter of business we are bound to give the council an opportunity of meeting and accepting the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>I think that the Minister in (b) of Section 9, sub-section (2), suggested to Deputy Cowan to put down an amendment.  This sub-section is unusual, to my mind.  The council have no option whatever.  I cannot see any reason for paragraph (b).  The Minister did not explain why he saw fit to introduce it into the section, as other legislation has made it mandatory on the council to make the appointment. Otherwise, councils would never make some of these appointments, as they would not agree.  I do not agree that Deputy Cowan's amendment improves the position, but I suggest that the Minister himself might well delete paragraph (b), as it is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well to face facts, and the fact is that when a man is recommended by the commission the county council have no say in the matter.  You may talk about courtesy, but to tell the council that the commission have recommended a certain person and that they are bound to appoint him by passing a resolution does not seem to me to be treating the council very courteously at all.  They have no option; they must appoint the person who is recommended and they are called upon to pass a formal resolution of appointment, although they have no say in the matter.  That procedure, in my view, is not facing up to the facts at all.  What I want to do in <Col N="99" /> the amendment is simply to say that a particular person is appointed on the recommendation of the commission and, therefore, he is appointed from the date they recommended him.  I do see that the Minister has made a point that there might probably be some little difficulty about it if he has to take up duty on that day.  In actual fact, I do not think there would be any great difficulty about that.  It is only a small matter of machinery whereby the Local Appointments Commission can send down the recommendation at the time they are asked to send it down.  It may be that the amendment as I put it down is capable of being improved somewhat. However, I think it would avoid a lot of trouble in the future if county councils who have no function in the appointment of their county officers simply received the county officers that are recommended or appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is much better to face the situation squarely than to provide that the council are bound by law to appoint the person recommended by the Local Appointments Commission.  The Bill states that if you do not do it within three months, then, whether you do it or not, the particular individual nominated is deemed to have been appointed.  Where is the justification for that?  Where is the justification for suggesting to the county council that they may hold up the appointment for three months?  Three months is a very important part of a year.  It is one quarter of a year.  This Bill suggests that they may hold it up for three months&mdash;that the county may be deprived of the services of the person who is, in fact, nominated as their particular county officer.  The individual in question may be an officer in another county, doing other work, and he may be waiting from day to day to know whether this county council are going to appoint him or not or whether he is just deemed to be appointed at the expiration of the three months' period.  Is it not better to face the facts once and for all so that, when the request is made to the Local Appointments <Col N="100" /> Commission, the person they select is appointed as from the day they recommend his appointment to the local authority?  The only reason for using the word &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; in that sense was simply to follow the law as it applies to the Local Appointments Commission.  I would rather face the situation instead of suggesting that the county councils can hold up the matter for three months, and at the end of the three months' period the person is deemed to be appointed whether they wish it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see, from Deputy Cowan's argument, how this procedure will shorten the three months.  I may say that there is a precedent for the three months' period. If the council does not move inside the three months' period, the Minister may take action.  In this amendment the person selected by the Local Appointments Commission, without any further discussion with or notification to the county council, is an officer from the moment he is appointed.  Deputy Cowan's argument is not about the three months' period at all.  Deputy Cowan seeks to provide that whether the appointee is working or not, and is appointed by the Local Appointments Commission, he will be deemed to have been appointed as county officer for the county as and from the date of the recommendation.  In my opinion that amendment, if carried, would create chaos and confusion.  The point in connection with the three months' period is already covered.  If the council should prove to be recalcitrant and does not move, the Minister may take certain steps in connection with the matter.  I feel that the same courtesy which is extended at present to the county manager and the county <Col N="101" /> officer should be extended to the county council.  The Local Appointments Commissioners should notify them and say: &ldquo;We have appointed X.&rdquo; They can then proceed to install him in office and at the next meeting of the council he can be introduced to the members.  That would be better than that a man should just come down and that the members should find him sitting in the office before the assembly of the council.  I suggest that the matter is covered already.</P>

      <P>I do not know everything about local government law but I should imagine that there is some provision in connection with officials of local authorities.  I am quite sure that, within the Department, there are regulations that he would hardly draw pay from two county councils: certainly, he would hardly draw pay from one county council for which he was not working. However, that is a matter which I need not go into.  When you are dealing with a Bill there is no question of talking about courtesy.  The county council have no function.  They apply and say that they want a county officer and they ask the Local Appointments Commission to appoint him. When they appoint him, the county council are bound to appoint him whether they like it or not.  Even though they delay, in my opinion, they cannot hold it up three months, at the end of which period he is automatically deemed to be appointed under the Bill. I urge the Minister to take the county councils out of pain.  I urge him not to suggest to them that they have any powers when in fact they have not got them.  I submit that it is no courtesy to them to suggest to them that they have powers when in fact they have not got these powers.  However, if my amendment does not commend itself to the House I shall not push it any further.  I say again that it would be much better if we faced realities&mdash;it would be much better for the county councils and for everybody concerned &mdash;rather than suggest that local authorities have powers when in fact they have not got them.  That is anything but courtesy to them.</P>

Is it courtesy when they will not reply to the county council who have asked them to appoint a man to go down and take up duty?  I suggest that it is most discourteous to the county council who have asked the Appointments Commissioners to do the job for them.  The Appointments Commissioners ought at least to report to the people who have asked them to make the appointment.  They could send a letter saying: &ldquo;We have carried out your request and appointed X.&rdquo; Do you think it courteous to send a man down to the job without thinking it worth your while to notify the county council?  I suggest that notification should be sent to the chairman or the secretary of the county council to the effect that the Local Appointments Commission have appointed a certain person who is eligible to take up duty on behalf of the county council.  He could then get in touch with the county council and arrange a date for a meeting.</P>

Therefore, no difficulty really arises.  I do not think anybody else would be appointed but a person who was serving in local government.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but I think as time goes on nobody will be appointed as county officer except a person who is in the service of a local authority.  Perhaps my amendment might have been better if, instead of using the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; in the last line, I used the words &ldquo;set out in&rdquo;, in other words, that he would be appointed as from the date set out in the recommendation.  That would get over all the Minister's difficulties about it.  If there was a recommendation to <Col N="104" /> appoint a certain person, the Local Appointments Commissioners would say he was appointed county officer as from a particular date and that would get over the difficulty about his reporting to the council.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 20, to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;council of the county.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there can be any objection to this amendment.  Whenever the office of a county officer is vacant, the Minister shall appoint a person until an appointment is made.  That is what the Bill provides.  My amendment is simply to provide that the council of the county will appoint the temporary county officer.  I think there could be no objection to that.  If there is a vacancy a person is to act for a period while the Local Appointments Commissioners are considering the appointment of a permanent county officer, or for some other reason.  There is no reason in the world why that should be referred to the Minister.  That should be done by the local authority and I would ask Deputies who are conversant with local government to insist on the right of the local authority to make that kind of appointment for a temporary period.  If we are talking about rights <Col N="106" /> of local authorities, democracy, and all that sort of thing, this is the place where we ought to apply it.  I ask the House to agree to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this particular function would confer any great power on the county councils that they would be anxious to receive. The Deputy has suggested that they have not very much power.  This would not give them much power and I think anyone who has experience of working on a local council would be anxious to avoid having to make a temporary appointment.  There would be the usual influences brought to bear and there would be a tendency, when the man would be appointed, to prolong the temporary appointment unduly, or there might be.  Whereas, the amendment that I have put down &mdash;amendment No. 7, which I have put down in order to try to meet the point made by the Deputy&mdash;provides for the insertion of the words &ldquo;after consultation with the chairman of the council of the county.&rdquo;  Before making the appointment the Minister would consult with the chairman about the appointment of a temporary officer. There is no overriding of the council there.  Finally, the Minister has the control and sanction in respect of this office and there is nothing very wrong about that.  I am not trying to introduce myself, as the Minister, unduly into this matter but, in the interest of the effectiveness of the Bill, it would be better to have the Minister and chairman consult about this temporary appointment before it is made and thus obviate the general spate of canvassing of the various members that would otherwise be done by candidates and the tendency on the part of the members to prolong the temporary appointment unduly and to postpone a permanent appointment. I do not think there is any intention in the section to interfere with the powers of local authorities.  The power that would be conferred on them by Deputy Cowan's amendment is one that would not be desired by the ordinary members who have experience of working on county councils.  Amendment No. 7 goes a fair distance to meet Deputy Cowan in providing that the Minister must <Col N="107" /> consult with the chairman of the county council before making a temporary appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is one that the Minister should accept.  I cannot see anything very revolutionary in it.  This is a temporary appointment. If the office becomes vacant, the council of a county would, if Deputy Cowan's amendment were accepted, be given power to make a temporary appointment of a county officer.  I can assure the Minister that councils will have no heart-burning whatever about it.  What the ordinary council and, I suppose, what every council in Ireland would do, would be to appoint the senior officer of their own county, the secretary, if there is one, or the accountant or the senior officer attached to the local authority.  That is whom they would appoint as temporary county officer.  There would be no question of doubt about it.  I think the Minister should definitely accept Deputy Cowan's amendment.  It is most unusual to have a Minister of State appointing a temporary officer to a local authority.  It is undignified, and I suggest that the Minister should not lower the dignity of his ministerial office by taking on the job of making temporary appointments to this, as he described it, minor office.  He should allow the council of a county to act.  After all, they are sensible people, fully competent, and I have no doubt they will make less mistakes than, possibly, the Minister's Department might make.  They will have more knowledge of the competency of the officer they put into the position.  They will be on trial in selecting an existing officer in the service&mdash;he must be an existing officer in the service.  Probably it would be better if Deputy Cowan would add words such as &ldquo;subject to the Minister's sanction&rdquo;.  After appointment by the council, he must be sanctioned by the Minister.  That should satisfy the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am in entire agreement with Deputy Cowan and Deputy Allen.  I think it would be very undesirable to have these appointments made otherwise than by the council.  I think the point the Minister made could be met quite easily by an amendment something along the lines of amendment No. 9, in the name of Deputy Childers, but I would bring forward the time because I think three months would be too long for them to decide to apply.  They could apply within a month of the temporary appointment being made and it would be then a matter for the Appointments Commissioners as to how long the temporary officer would remain there.  I suggest the Minister should accept this amendment. Of course, any temporary officer is automatically subject to sanction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear experienced members of local authorities supporting my view.  When you have a temporary vacancy it is most desirable that it should be filled by the local authority and that it should be filled by one of their own officers.  If the Minister appoints, he might not appoint from the officers of that council; he could send in a person from Wexford to Kildare.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is what I consider objectionable.  County councils have performed very responsible duties.  Taking them by and large, they carry out their duties in a responsible way.  They are responsible for the expenditure of very big sums.  They do their work very efficiently, and I would have more trust in the judgment of local councils than I would in the officials of the Department in the Custom House when they would be considering this matter.  In the consideration of it the Minister is only a pure formality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about influence. When we are dealing with a Bill of this kind the less we say about influence the better.  This Bill is <Col N="109" /> designed to give powers to the local authorities because we are satisfied that they will not be improperly influenced in the exercise of their duties.  That was the old criticism of local authorities when they were deprived of many of their powers&mdash; that they were subject to undue influence.  I have a little experience of a local authority and I must say I have been very favourably impressed by the efficient way in which the members of the Dublin Corporation carry out their duties&mdash;the very responsible way in which they carry them out.</P>
    <P>I think there has been too much of a tendency in local government to tie up local authorities with the red tape of the Department.  Everything must go to the Department for sanction, for approval; nothing can be done without the Minister's approval or sanction.  As a matter of fact, if all these duties were carried out by the Minister he would have time to deal with the affairs of only a couple of local authorities; he would have no time to deal with all the manifold duties of his Department.  In actual fact, the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; do not mean the Minister; they mean a very experienced official in his Department. Local authorities should, as far as possible, be free from this, hamstringing red tape that we have in the Department of Local Government. For that reason I am very glad to find that this amendment has received approval from people who are experienced in local administration.</P>

      <P>I am in complete sympathy with the ideas expressed by Deputy Cowan in order to disabuse the minds of people in the country that there will be any infliction from above or that there will be any undue importation of officers from outside places. I thought that consultation with the chairman of the county council would obviate the danger of anyone being brought in from outside as long as there was a man in the council's service suitable for the position.  I am proposing to continue what was set out in the 1940 Act.  Sanction has to be given to the appointment of temporary <Col N="110" /> managers.  What is here is the same as what was in the 1940 Act.  Provision is made for consultation.</P>
      <P>There is this point to be considered. A vacancy takes place in a particular county and the council is not meeting and may not meet for three weeks. Through sudden death or for some other reason the office becomes vacant. What is going to happen?  Do you want an immediate or a temporary appointment made?  I suppose there could be a hastily convened meeting of the council.  I ask you not to leave the county without an officer for any length of time.  I suggest that the speediest method and the best way to protect local interests would be for the Minister to get in touch with the county manager or the county council chairman and proceed to make the appointment.</P>
      <P>I have not any fundamental objections to the proposal made by Deputy Cowan.  I am merely anxious to get the most effective and the speediest way to deal with an emergency, to be prepared for an emergency.  You have no guarantee that the procedure will be normal every time.  Subject to that, I would not be averse to accepting the amendment.  I am merely pointing out certain difficulties.  The council might not meet for a month.  Even then sanction will have to come from the Minister.  You cannot keep him out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a rather novel way of getting at it&mdash;going in reverse. Under the County Management Act, 1940, the Dublin City Manager was also made County Manager for Dublin County.  The Dublin County Council was dissolved in 1941 and a commissioner was acting in place of the council.  In June, 1942, that is two months before the 1940 Act came into operation, the County Management (Amendment) Act, 1942, was passed. This provided that the commissioner for the County of Dublin shall, during the suspension of the council perform the executive&mdash;that is the managerial &mdash;functions of the council as well as the reserved functions.  The Dublin Board of Assistance was dissolved in 1942 and commissioners were also appointed, who similarly discharged the executive functions of that body. The Dublin County Council remained dissolved until 1948; when it was reconstituted the Dublin City Manager became County Manager for Dublin County.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Temporary) Act, 1948, dealt with the position arising out of the re-constitution of the Dublin Board of Assistance.  It provided that the person who was commissioner should, under the title of chief executive officer, discharge the executive functions of the board.  The <Col N="113" /> position in Dublin City and County in 1948 was that the Dublin City Manager was county manager and he had the assistance of the assistant city manager who acted as borough manager for Dún Laoghaire and as manager for Grangegorman.  The managerial functions of the Dublin Board of Assistance were being performed by the chief executive officer of that board.  The need to concentrate and co-ordinate the housing efforts of the four housing authorities in Dublin City and County and to get the housing drive in these areas under way led in 1948 to the creation of a new job of housing director.  This post was filled by transferring the assistant city manager, Mr. O'Mahoney, from Dún Laoghaire and Grangegorman, and appointing Mr. Keane, deputy city manager, Dublin Corporation, as assistant city and county manager in place of Mr. O'Mahoney.  The success of the experiment of having one assistant manager for housing clearly demonstrated the value of the functional approach in the discharge of the business of the city and county.  The experiment was carried a step further by appointing Mr. Keane as temporary assistant manager in charge of the health services of the city and county and by appointing the secretary of the Dublin County Council as temporary manager to discharge certain functions other than housing and health and some other functions reserved by the city manager to himself.</P>
    <P>This Bill will repeal the Local Government (Dublin) (Temporary) Act, 1948, and the chief executive officer of the Dublin Board of Assistance will become an assistant city manager.  The administration of Dublin City and County will then be fully integrated and it is intended that generally each of the assistants shall, under the city manager, discharge a block of functions in the whole area.  This will make for more efficient administration.  Administration on a functional basis in Dublin City and County is now all the more necessary since the setting up of separate Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  I am satisfied that if the system of local government is to function efficiently in the Dublin area <Col N="114" /> and to cater in a relatively small area for about 20 per cent. of the country's population then there must be an integration of administration such as is envisaged in this Bill.  The point is to have all these matters in a single Bill.  The county area is very small, while the metropolitan area is very big, and the present arrangement has been working very satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put down these amendments I considered that the responsibilities of the Dublin City Manager were really too many.  The city manager has an enormous job as Manager of the City of Dublin.  I must say that he carries out his duties exceptionally well; there is no doubt whatever about that, but I do think that if you have a Dublin County Council, that county council should have its own county officer and let the city be managed by the city manager and as many assistant managers as are necessary.  You have the position at present that the city manager is Manager of Dublin City, Manager of Dublin County, Manager of Dún Laoghaire Borough and he has also responsibilities in connection with Grangegorman, the Dublin Board of Assistance and other functions of that nature.  No one individual can carry all these responsibilities and I was anxious that, when this Bill was passed, Dublin County could claim some independence and be considered a complete county with its own county officer just the same as any other county.  At the moment it has not its own county officer.  I think it would make for better administration if Dublin County had its own county manager.  For that reason, I put down these amendments to delete the three sub-sections which deal in a different way with Dublin County than with any other county. I am sorry that, apparently, there is nobody in the House who is a member of the Dublin County Council, but, if there was, I think he would agree with me that it is desirable that Dublin County Council should have its own county officer the same as any other council.</P>

I am not going to say that his ignorance has been very much enlightened by the explanation which the Minister for Local Government gave him; but surely it was open to the Deputy, with all the resources of the Library in this House at his disposal, to have ascertained what was the origin of this proposal to co-ordinate in some way, under one responsible executive officer, the administrative services of Dublin City and County.  Any person who knows anything about the intimate relations which exist between the people who live and work in Dublin and the people who live in the county, and the way in which these services are inter-linked and have, in fact, become interdependent, will realise that there was a great deal of good sense and wisdom in the proposal which emanated not from any political head of a Department, and not from any Minister for Local Government, whether the present Minister or his predecessor or my predecessor, because this principle was enunciated in a report which was made by a tribunal, I think, of three persons, one being the eminent lawyer who is now the President of the High Court.  Another member of that tribunal was, I think, the gentleman who has since been nominated as chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, with the support, of course, of Deputy Cowan, while the third member was a person well versed in local administration whose name at the moment escapes me.  They reported that some such co-ordinating arrangement as this would be desirable, and that recommendation was, I think, embodied in the County Management Act, 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is the genesis of the thing, and here is Deputy Cowan coming into this House and, without bothering to satisy himself as to the reason for this arrangement, putting down an amendment of this sort.  It is an amendment which, I think, will not appeal to that bulwark of his quondam Party&mdash;the <i>Irish Times.</i>  The <i>Irish Times</i>  has been always breast-high <Col N="116" /> advocating that there should be closer co-ordination between the administration of the local services in Dublin City and Dublin County.  Everybody who knows the intimate relations which exist, not merely between the two administrative bodies but between the people who live and work in Dublin City and in Dublin County, will agree that there is a very strong case indeed for this.  I am surprised that a Deputy who is actually responsible for a private army to undo the partition of this country should seek to partition the country further by isolating Dublin County from Dublin City.</P>

      <P>Very well, then, what is the justification for the Deputy's proposal?  Here are two administrative units which are so closely associated with each other that they have to have, in fact, a common water supply.  With their many embarrassing problems is associated the question of housing the people in the two administrative units, and yet the Deputy wants to disassociate them from each other and have them completely independent as if Dublin County were situated down somewhere in West Cork.  Of course, it is <Col N="117" /> not.  It forms part really of the Dublin metropolitan area, and if the Deputy had any sense of organisation, instead of putting down such an amendment, he would allow the section to go through as it stands.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that Deputy MacEntee has entered into this debate at all because we were getting along nicely in trying to make this Bill a good Bill as far as local administration is concerned.  I happen to have put down this amendment because I am a member of the Dublin Corporation, because I have some experience of the working of the Dublin Corporation and because I can talk with a knowledge that Deputy MacEntee was unable to obtain during his long ministerial reign.  It may be that certain people recommended, some years ago, that there should be such co-ordination as he speaks about.  But why are we dealing with this Bill at all?  Why are we discussing this Bill?  Because the County Management Bills which were introduced and strongly supported&mdash; they were introduced, I think, by Deputy MacEntee as Minister&mdash;have been found to be a failure, and now we are trying to correct them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with this Bill on the basis that they have not been a success.  I have discovered that, although you may have the one man as city manager of Dublin and county manager of Dublin County, such an arrangement does not make for co-ordination between the Dublin County Council and the Dublin City Council.  In the Dublin City Council we do our own business relating to the city.  We have nothing to do with county matters.  When our city manager is with us, he deals with city matters.  When he goes to the county council he deals entirely with county council matters.  He may worry perhaps at night when he goes to bed about some of his difficulties.  The water supply has been mentioned.  The City of Dublin supplies water to parts of the Dublin County Council area and the county council pays us for that <Col N="118" /> water.  It is arranged under the regional water supply which has been projected, and which I hope, at some time, will become law, that water may be sent from Dublin as far as Wexford. Does that mean then that the county manager of Dublin will have to be the county manager of Wicklow and Wexford as well?  There is no sense in that argument.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee got into this discussion to say a few offensive things about me and about Partition.  I do not know what good that is to Deputy MacEntee.  Whether he can sleep better after having made an observation like that, I do not know.  I am only concerned to have this Bill improved as best we can, and I am very sorry that we have not some member of the Dublin County Council here to talk of the system from his experience.  The system does not lead to any co-ordination.  It imposes unnecessary work on the Dublin County Manager and we have reached a position now that when the Dublin County Manager goes from the City Hall to Parnell Square he changes his title on the way.  He is city manager in the City Hall and until he reaches the county council headquarters in Parnell Square and then he becomes county officer.  From Deputy MacEntee's point of view there may be something wonderful to be said for that, but in actual fact there is no co-ordination, except theoretical co-ordination by this arrangement.  The Dublin City Manager as county manager deals with county affairs only and not with city affairs.  These two things are kept just as much apart as they always were.  When he moves up to Parnell Square he has the county council staff to advise him on county council matters such as the housing of people in Coolock or the provision of water or sewerage in Balbriggan and he deals with them.  He has to forget everything about the city when in the county council office in Parnell Square, and yet I am told that is co-ordination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down these amendments deliberately, having thought the matter over, believing that the city manager is overworked, that there is an enormous amount of work in Dublin City for the city manager and that there is a <Col N="119" /> big amount of work, if we want county officers at all, that can be done in the County Dublin by a county officer and I say to the Minister that he should provide a county officer for the County Dublin.  It is for that purpose that I have put down these amendments&mdash; not for that precise purpose, because that purpose would not be achieved by the amendments.  The amendments only relate in the first instance to temporary appointments.  That is as far as Section 9 (5) is concerned which deals with temporary appointments when there is a vacancy.  Sub-section (4) of Section 10 deals with the first county officers and it provides that the City Manager of Dublin shall be the first county officer for the County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that we gave County Dublin a county officer of its own and, if we did, he would have work enough to do and he would relieve the Dublin City Manager of the enormous burden of responsibility placed upon him.  No one individual can do all the work that the Dublin City Manager is called upon to do as Manager of Dublin, Manager of County Dublin and Manager of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  If he can do all that work efficiently, and apparently he is doing all that enormous amount of work efficiently, then we could have one county officer to do the duties of about ten counties elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Cowan has confused the question of whether there are enough executive officers for Dublin City with the question of co-ordination between the two authorities. Wherever the physical boundary of Dublin City meets that of the Dublin County Council and wherever the legal boundary, which is a very different thing, in certain circumstances meets it, there are tremendous co-ordination problems.  Deputy MacEntee referred to the necessity for having one executive officer who would understand the problems of the two areas.  In regard to sewerage, water and every other aspect of local administration it is absolutely essential at the present time to have such a person if there is to be efficiency in <Col N="120" /> administration.  As the Minister knows, there are a number of vital fundamental matters still arising for decision by him in relation to an inquiry instituted into the whole question of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council administration, fundamental matters for his decision based on evidence which is already becoming out-of-date owing to the fact that Dublin City is spreading so quickly.  The whole question of how far Dublin County Council can be detached from Dublin Corporation in regard to administration was involved in that inquiry.  I think it is most irresponsible to suggest that because the Dublin City Manager may be overworked there should not still be one person who will have a general view of the administration of the two areas.</P>
      <P>So far as the observations made by Deputy Cowan in regard to the work of the councils are concerned, it would be very difficult for the Dublin County Council and the Dublin City Council to start doing the work of determining the matters which require co-ordination.  A lot of what Deputy Cowan said underlies the whole psychology in connection with the Bill.  There are a great many sections in the Bill which are trying to make civil servants of the members of local authorities.  It would be ridiculous to suppose that it would be possible very often for members of the Dublin County Council or the Dublin City Council to sit and debate one way or another on the complicated matters that arise in connection with the co-ordination of the two services.  The most they can do is to determine general principles and to avoid as far as possible the creation of anomalies or scandals and to remedy grievances. The idea that a manager can go from one body to another and listen to a whole series of detailed grievances is to my mind fantastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan's speech might have passed unanswered if in the last couple of minutes he had not shown that he did not understand his own amendment.  He said that amendment No. 10, which we are discussing with amendments Nos. 11 and 12, related only to temporary officers. Amendment No. 10 is to delete sub-section <Col N="121" /> (5) of Section 9.  Let us see what sub-section (5) says.  I do not know whether Deputy Cowan bothered to read it.  Let me read it for him:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Save as otherwise expressly provided thereby, the foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply in relation to the County of Dublin and, in lieu thereof, it is hereby enacted that every person who is duly appointed (whether permanently or temporarily) to the office of Dublin City Manager shall, by virtue of this sub-section, stand appointed (permanently or temporarily, as the case may require) to the office of Dublin County Officer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan, who proposes to delete that sub-section without any reservation or qualification whatever, says that his amendment is intended to apply only to temporary appointments. Is it not absurd that a Deputy who does not know what he intends to do by an amendment, should put it down on the Order Paper?  That is precisely the position in which the House finds itself, thanks to Deputy Cowan. I do not want to traverse the ground already covered by Deputy Childers. I am glad, in order that we may understand the working of Deputy Cowan's mind, that my intervention in the debate evoked from him some reasons in support of this amendment.  The only reason which he did adduce was that there was a Dublin City Council, of which he is a member, dealing with problems relating to Dublin and dealing only with those problems within the narrow confines of the Dublin City boundaries, and that outside Dublin we had the Dublin County Council dealing similarly, with narrow vision, with the problems of Dublin County. He said that one body was concerned only with its own domestic problems and the other body was similarly concerned with the problems peculiar to it.  The trouble is that these problems overlap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has admitted it.  He has talked about the water supply for years.  County Dublin was trying to conceive a scheme <Col N="122" /> for the supply of water to North County Dublin and could not do it unless it could come to some arrangement with the Dublin Corporation. Whatever we may say about the burdens which are undoubtedly imposed upon the individual who has to fill the post at one and the same time of Dublin City Manager and Dublin County Officer, at least he has this advantage over the members of the Dublin County Council and even omniscient members of the Dublin Corporation like Deputy Cowan, that he knows both problems and when acting in his capacity as Dublin City Manager, advising to the best of his ability the members of Dublin Corporation, at least he will be aware of the problems with which the members of the Dublin County Council have to deal, and when, conversely, he is dealing with Dublin County affairs, he will be aware how these affairs entrench upon the Corporation of the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Surely a person of his competence and knowledge will not act, as apparently Deputy Cowan seems to think would be the ideal situation, as if both these councils were in closed compartments.  The advantage in having one person as Dublin City Manager and Dublin County Officer is that he has full knowledge of both problems and he can co-ordinate them. He has power to recommend to his council or corporation a scheme which will co-ordinate the services of Dublin City and County and so bring about, by reason of that co-ordination, greater efficiency in the services which are common to both the city and the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is the only alternative to setting up one body which would be responsible for local government in Dublin City and County.  I think it would be undesirable to have the affairs of these two separate administrative areas administered by one local authority.  If we are to have separate local authorities for Dublin City, for the County Borough of Dún Laoghaire and for the County of Dublin, then we must have some co-ordinating link.  I cannot see any better co-ordinating link than that <Col N="123" /> which was provided in the County Management Act and which is being continued in the present Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often wondered why, when matters were referred to a Department of State, certain decisions were taken.  Deputy MacEntee, who has had long experience as a Minister, has clearly shown, in the contribution he has made to the debate, how wrong people can go when they are basing their decisions on theory and not on practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let me say briefly what the position is with regard to Dublin City and Dublin County Council.  In Dublin City we have a complete administrative machine.  We have a city engineer, a city medical officer of health and other city officers.  In Dublin County Council we have the same.  We have the county medical officer of health, the county engineer and the different county officers.  Each body has its own statutory functions. When the city manager is sitting with the Corporation of Dublin; he takes their advice.  He is guided by them, and if there is an application from the Dublin County Council for a supply of water, say to Coolock, the City Manager of Dublin will say: &ldquo;I can give a supply of water.  The cost of putting in 10-inch or 12-inch pipes will be so much.  Provided the county council pay, I will give it to them.&rdquo;  The city council agrees to give it to them, saying: &ldquo;We will give water to any individual who wants an extra supply of water, so long as he pays for it.&rdquo;  He writes to the Dublin County Council to that effect, that is to say, the city manager writes to the Dublin County Council saying he is directed by the city council to say that the county council can have water if they pay so much.  Then he goes up to the Dublin County Council, which considers the charge excessive and which instructs the county manager to write back to the city manager and say that they consider the price excessive.  Then the county manager writes back to himself as city manager, saying that he considers the price charged to Dublin County Council to be excessive.  It is <Col N="124" /> said that that is co-ordination.  There is no co-ordination.  There is no more co-ordination between Dublin City and Dublin County than there is between Dublin and Kildare.  The city manager, when he is acting as city manager, does the job of the city and when acting as county manager he does the business of the county; and he is guided in his decisions in each case by the elected representatives of the people here, either in the city council or in the Dublin County Council.  I think that Deputy MacEntee was on sound grounds when he said it may be that Dublin County and City will have to be brought under the one control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were done and if there were one engineer for the city and county, there could be co-ordination; and if there were one medical officer of health to co-ordinate all health services there would be co-ordination.  These two&mdash;and the Minister knows it well&mdash;act in absolutely water-tight compartments and no amount of theory can get away from the hard facts of the situation.  I happen to be dealing with the facts as they exist and not with theories formed in Deputy MacEntee's mind during the period he was Minister for Local Government.  That is why local government has been a complete failure&mdash; because we had Ministers who knew nothing about local administration. Thank God, we now have a Minister who knows local administration from the very bottom up, who knows it for many years and who, when he talks in this House, talks with full understanding and knowledge and does not talk the raméis that Deputy MacEntee talks about co-ordination when there is no co-ordination.  Deputy MacEntee may be flippant and abusive about me personally. I do not mind that.  I want to deal only with what is in the Bill and with the contributions made by Deputy MacEntee.  He will, no doubt, come back and have another attack on me, but that is not very much good from the point of view of the public or of the Dáil.  I certainly do not intend to indulge in any slanging match with <Col N="125" /> him.  He is welcome to that, and, when the appropriate occasion for slanging comes, we will have it out.</P>

These are my reasons for putting down the amendment&mdash;to give the Dublin County Council its own county officer until such time as provision is made for better co-ordination, but I want to assure the Minister that if he were to ask the city manager, the city manager would tell him that the very fact of his acting in two capacities cannot lead to any co-ordination.  In theory, it may seem to do so, but, in actual practice, it does not.  He will tell him that he very often has to write to himself, as county manager, refusing to agree to a suggestion he made as city manager to himself as county manager &mdash;and that is co-ordination.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan's amendments has led to a good deal of discussion, although it refers to Dublin City and County, about which some of us do not know very much.  He castigated the former Minister's lack of knowledge of local administration and drew a contrast between the present Minister's experience and Deputy MacEntee's lack of experience.  It is a remarkable thing that, with the Minister's experience as a member of the Limerick Corporation, he is not interfering in this Bill or in any other measure with the present Management Act in operation in Limerick City.  That, as I say, is <Col N="127" /> a remarkable thing in the light of the Minister's experience of local administration. It would be just as well for local administration if we had not had this Bill foisted on us to waste our time, but when it is before us, we have to discuss it and do the best we can with it.  With regard to the amendment, perhaps the present arrangement is not absolutely ideal, but I do not know that Deputy Cowan's new arrangement would be anything better. It might be just as well, as in the case of another amendment we discussed to-day, to leave very well alone and allow things to work as they are working.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly satisfied that Deputy Cowan is out to do the best he can for the improvement of this Bill and to make it as efficient and satisfactory as possible, but notwithstanding that he speaks as a member of the corporation, I suggest to him that his proposal would not meet with anything like general approval and certainly would not make for any improvement. Notwithstanding all he says about there being no co-ordination, I find it difficult to accept that suggestion in view of the undoubted success which has attended the housing officers' efforts and the health assistance officer, and, even if Dr. Hernon has to proceed from one office to another, if there is, as the Deputy suggests, a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde aspect involved, could anyone better than the same individual be suggested as a go-between in relation to two bodies?  If he is transacting some business as between the county council and the corporation and he is actuated by a desire to do justice to both sides, it makes for harmonious working to have the same negotiator working through himself.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggests that there is no co-ordination except in theory.  I do not think you could possibly make a comparison of Dublin with any other county.  In Dublin, <Col N="128" /> with its teeming population, overflowing into the county and with its institutions hinging on each other, it is almost impossible to avoid having integration and consequent success.  Since becoming Minister, I have had abundant evidence of the satisfactory working and close integration of this functional approach for the County and City of Dublin and it would be a very serious matter to attempt to disturb that position.  I personally would be very slow to do it.  I have no evidence except evidence of harmonious and satisfactory working and we ought to leave very well alone. The city manager and county officer is well supported by four assistants who have been delegated their functions, and each and every element of their functional duties are fairly and properly covered without the imposition of any undue strain on the county and city manager or on any of the assistants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned officers and staff in the county council.  That is correct.  They are all working in coordinated fashion under one head, and, having regard to the contiguity of the metropolis to the small county of Dublin, it would be unthinkable to upset the arrangement.  It would be a disadvantageous and retrograde step if we were to attempt to do that, and I suggest the Deputy should leave the Bill as it is.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister does not see the point involved. We have a very excellent housing director in Dublin City, Mr. O'Mahoney, who is also housing director for the County of Dublin.  The city manager is also county manager, and one of them is here to-day and there to-morrow, out to Dún Laoghaire and back again, When the housing director is dealing with his contracts for sites and so on in the City of Dublin, he devotes all the time he can spare to it.  When he has finished with that, he goes up to the county council and has to change his functions completely.  I know that he works as many as 16 hours on some days.  There is no co-ordination between the two bodies. That is what I wanted the Minister to <Col N="129" /> understand, whether he accepts the amendment or not.  When Dr. Hernon is acting as county manager of Dublin County, he is cribbed, cabined and confined as county manager, and can carry out no other functions.  Similarly, when he is acting as city manager, he can carry out no other duties.  We are in the fortunate position that in Dr. Hernon, Mr. O'Mahoney, Mr. Keane and others we have excellent officials.  I am sure the Minister will find, and find very soon, that it would be a more satisfactory arrangement if we had a county officer in Dublin County who would deal with the portion Dr. Hernon deals with and also the portion Mr. O'Mahoney deals with, leaving us in the city&mdash;where we have such an enormous population and such tremendous responsibilities&mdash;with the full services of these two, the city manager and assistant city manager.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that people cannot see the facts, but I cannot do more than try to make them be seen.  The Minister is quite right when he says it is working satisfactorily.  That is so because of the competence and efficiency of the people concerned, because they are working long hours, as many as 16 a day.  That is why it is satisfactory. It is not satisfactory because the system is satisfactory but because the particular officials are excellent men. This is like many other matters I advocate: it takes a long time for ordinary men to understand them. Perhaps in a year or two we will have the Minister introducing the particular amendment I am trying to get him to accept to-night and when he does that I am sure that his principal supporter will be Deputy MacEntee.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity that all Deputies are not gifted with the vivid imagination of Deputy Cowan. We have listened to him while he detailed at length how the city manager acted as city manager and how he dealt with the business of the Dublin County Council.  I am not aware that Deputy Cowan has been a sort of &ldquo;doppelgänger&rdquo; of the person who occupies the dual post of Dublin County Manager and Dublin City Manager.  I do not know if the <Col N="130" /> Deputy has had the privilege of sitting upon that gentleman's shoulder when he was sitting in the Dublin City Hall or when he was exercising his functions in Parnell Square.  In fact, I doubt very much whether Deputy Cowan was there on any occasion when the Dublin City Manager was in the City Hall acting as city manager or in the Dublin County Council offices in Parnell Square acting as Dublin County Manager.  I doubt whether Deputy Cowan will now aver that he was.  So all this argument is merely a figment of Deputy Cowan's fertile imagination and there is no substance whatever in it.</P>
      <P>The only realistic argument I heard the Deputy advance in support of his amendment was that the Dublin City Manager would write a letter to the Dublin County Manager which would be received by the gentleman who had written it, when he was acting in his capacity as county manager.  The change that Deputy Cowan proposes to make is that the letter will be written by one individual in the City Hall and received by a different individual in Parnell Square.</P>

      <P>The amendment I propose is simply that the Minister shall by Order direct that the said person shall become the first county officer for one of the said counties that the said person himself selects.  Where you have a county manager in a place like Longford-Westmeath the county officer should himself have the right to say for which of the two counties he will act.  It is a very simple amendment and one which should, I think, appeal to the Minister.  It gives a reasonable discretion to the county officer.  If you have a man who has been carrying out the duties of county manager for two adjoining counties the Minister may appoint him as the county officer for the county to which he does not want to go.  It would be reasonable to give him his choice and let him select the county, leaving a vacancy in the other.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Deputy has looked at the other side of the picture?  What is proposed is that the Minister must consult the councils of the counties which have been served by the county manager; they also must be consulted.  He must also consult with the manager so as to be satisfied as to his acceptance.  The amendment would hand the appointment over to the officer himself and allow him to make a selection.  You may find that where he has been dealing with two counties one county may be anxious to retain his services and he may not be anxious to remain there.  Another county may be anxious to get an outside man and I suggest in justice to the man himself and to the council he is going to serve that it would make for a more harmonious atmosphere if there were consultations between the Minister, the council and the officer himself and get them to agree. According to the amendment the officer could say he was going to one particular place and no one would have control over him, neither the Minister nor the council nor anyone else. It would mean more harmonious working if the councils and the officer himself discussed the matter before the appointment was made rather than to give the officer <i>carte blanche</i> to go into a county that might not perhaps have a very great welcome for him.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the Minister's approach to this matter is a reasonable and practical one, and I am surprised that Deputy Cowan should put down an amendment of the kind which now appears on the Order Paper.  Let us consider what the section which he proposes to amend prescribes.  It prescribes that in respect of a county which is one of a group of two counties the Minister, before appointing a county officer, shall consult with the councils of the county. Mark that the practical effect of Deputy Cowan's amendment would be to delete the words &ldquo;consult the councils of the counties&rdquo;.  That is what Deputy Cowan proposes to do, but that is what Deputy Cowan is afraid to say he is proposing to do, and all this verbiage we have on the Order Paper is to conceal the fact that <Col N="133" /> this sea-green incorruptible democrat, who is supporting the Bill because it will restore democratic control and limit the power of bureaucracy, seeks in an amendment to prevent the Minister from consulting the councils and to give him power to appoint a person to the most important post in their administration without consulting them by the old Ministerial <i>fiat.</i>  That is what Deputy Cowan proposes to do and he cannot put any gloss on it.  I know that he will get up and drag a red herring across the trail and that he will refer to myself in terms quite as cogent as those in which I have referred to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked at this Bill as a whole and it provides that where there is a county manager he becomes county officer for the county when the Bill is passed.  Where you have the position that you have in three or four cases and you have one county manager for two counties, the Bill provides that the Minister will consult with the councils and appoint him county officer of one or other of the two counties.  It is not a case of sending him anywhere.  Let us see what may happen: the County Management Act was passed in 1940 and a man may have been county manager for ten years of two counties and carrying out his functions there.  Like any other man he may have a home and family and may have a family attending school.  To send that man from the county in which he lives, as can be done by the Minister, to another county may have very serious repercussions on him and on his family life.  It may mean that he must dispose of the home he has built up and make alterations in the education <Col N="134" /> of his children.  I think that these are material and important matters and if a man has been a good official as manager of two counties then the least he ought to get under this Bill is the right to say in which county he prefers to stop.  I am prepared to argue with anyone that that conflicts in no way with the principles of democracy.  I do not think that he should be a chattel to be ordered from one county to another by the Minister. The Minister has no right to do that. There has been a lot of talk about the homes of the people and the fundamental right of individuals, but in this amendment I am trying to preserve the homes and fundamental right of individuals.  I am going to press this amendment and I would ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>I think that it will be agreed that while Deputy Cowan started as super-democratically as we would all like, he turned into rather a dictator in this debate.  The object of the Bill as it was introduced, we were told by the Minister, was to give more power to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that Deputy Cowan should be the first member of the House to set out to restrict the rights of local authorities.  He proposes to delete certain words but, for some extraordinary reason he wants to delete the words &ldquo;consult the councils of the counties.&rdquo;  I am surprised that Deputy Cowan will not allow the councils of the counties, where this manager or county officer has been functioning, to be consulted.  I doubt if Deputy Cowan fully considered this amendment before he put it down or fully understood its meaning.  We should like to see the councils of the counties consulted by the Minister before he makes the county officer or county manager for either one of the counties.  We should like the Minister to consult both counties in respect of such an officer.  The Minister is also going to consult the person, who will be involved.  He is not going to act as a dictator in this respect.  He is going to consult the person, whose future he is determining as to which county he should serve in.  The local authorities under and with whom he served will <Col N="135" /> be consulted.  I think there is nothing undemocratic in that procedure.  However, there is a most undemocratic viewpoint expressed in Deputy Cowan's amendment or proposed amendment.  I believe the Deputy would be wise, before this debate goes any further, and before the undemocratic nature of this amendment is exposed any further, to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well if we had some glossary of terms, some dictionary, some common understanding of what terms mean.  As I understand democracy, it means the giving of rights to an individual, and in this amendment I want to give rights to an individual.  He may be only a county manager but to me he is a human being with the rights of a human being, with a family and with a home to be considered.  Let us see where the democracy is in the Bill or where it is in regard to the appointment of county officers.  We have 26 counties: I do not know how many county officers we have.  With the exception, probably, of four, the remaining county officers are automatically appointed by the Bill and the county councils have no right or say in the matter.  There are four exceptions.  We will take it that four is the correct number of dual counties and that, therefore, eight counties are involved.  In these eight counties&mdash;or seven counties if we count North and South Tipperary as one county&mdash;there are four managers. These four managers will be appointed to four counties and there will be four vacancies.  The four vacancies in question will be referred to the Local Appointments Commission. The four managers will be appointed for the four counties in question and the four counties will have no say, good, bad or indifferent, in regard to the appointment of these men. We are left, then, with four individuals &mdash;and the alleged democrats say: &ldquo;Let these four individuals be bundled around.  Let their homes be upset, if needs be.  Let their arrangements in regard to their family be upset, so long as the Minister consults the two councils.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The manager may not want to go to the county where he is not wanted.  Some managers have not been wanted in particular counties for a short period.  There may be some little &ldquo;nark&rdquo; that passes over after a very short time.  However, under the Bill the manager may be sent into a county to which he does not wish to go.  In other words, he has not even the same rights which he would have if he were not a manager because, for instance, if the county officership of the County Meath arose, a particular individual may not apply for it, but under this Bill these four people may be sent into a county to which they may not wish to go.  There is some talk about democracy.  Is it democratic to break up a man's home against his will?  I do not think it is. I think that where you have a county officer acting in both counties the Minister will probably find himself in the position that both counties may want the particular individual concerned. That situation may well arise. If such a situation should arise and if the county manager says that he <Col N="137" /> wants to go to one particular county, will his view prevail?</P>

      <P>That is something. I feel, at any rate, that it is wrong to talk about the democratic rights of local authorities in regard to that matter because, as far as this Bill is concerned, it is simply a matter of four individuals.  It may be that there will be no trouble.  However, what I want to ensure is that the county officer will go to the county which he is serving at the moment and in which he desires to remain.  A principle which has been accepted in a very wide field is the principle that, in the event of conflict, the rights of the individual shall prevail.  It is for the purpose of insisting that these rights shall prevail that I put down the amendment.</P>

      <P>He will not, therefore, be going into any foreign country at all no matter which one he may go into. The only thing is that he will be de-grouped now and that a new appointment will be made.  The method suggested is that of consultation with the two county councils and with the manager himself.  The Deputy has posed the question of what would be likely to happen where both councils are anxious to have the services of the particular individual concerned.  The Minister could determine where the manager wants to stay, and that would be that. Then again, a council might be averse from letting him go and there might be a conflict.  The most reasonable solution is that which is suggested&mdash;and there is not the least danger of the inviolability of democracy being tinged or tainted either against the county council or the individual.  There are only four group counties altogether.  I can visualise no difficulty whatever in the carrying out of the terms of transfer <Col N="138" /> as set out in the Bill.  However, the Minister has to have regard to the wishes of the two county councils and to the wishes of the manager concerned. He has to have regard to the question of the subordinate officer, as to his suitability to take up the position.  It does not follow, as Deputies suggest, that they will have to have appointments made by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  That is not automatic either.  There is the other point of the suitability or willingness of the assistant county officer or county secretary to take up the position also.  These are points that would have to be gone into in consultation with the county councils. The manager himself will be helpful in advising the Minister and the council.  I do not think there will be, any difficulty in making that arrangement. It would make for friction and trouble if the manager were to be imposed upon a council without consultation with the councils.  I suggest that what is being done is in the best interests of all and in the interests of the working of the future county officer. There will no hardship inflicted upon anybody, I can assure the House of that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple thing.  Where you have a county manager appointed county officer, the Bill provides that the remuneration to be paid to him by the county council shall be not less than the remuneration paid to him as manager by the county council immediately before the commencement of this part of the Act, or, if he was then manager for two counties, than the aggregate of the remunerations then paid to him by the councils of those counties.  The amendment is simply to delete the words &ldquo;not less than&rdquo;. I do not know what reason the Minister had for saying that the remuneration <Col N="139" /> was to be &ldquo;not less than&rdquo;.  I take it that if a man is acting as manager and becomes county officer, under the Bill, it would be reasonable that he should be continued at the same salary.  The Minister says that he will be paid not less than the salary, which would leave it open for him to get an increase in salary immediately, but I do not think it is intended to give him an immediate increase in salary in the case where a man has been county manager for a county and is appointed county officer.  The only meaning of my amendment is that he would be paid the remuneration that he was receiving as county manager. If the Minister thinks there is any reason for inserting the words &ldquo;not less than&rdquo; I would like to hear what it is.</P>

He is assured of getting what he has had as manager for one or both counties but, if you delete &ldquo;not less than&rdquo;, it would not be possible for that man, unless by a special Act of Parliament, to get an increase of salary, if wage increases took place.

      <P>Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order (after consultation with the local authority concerned) create the office of city officer in respect of the council of a borough, and the duties and functions of such city officer shall be the same as the duties and functions of a county officer as defined in this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this new section is to permit borough councils to have a city officer of their own, to carry out the executive functions now carried out by the county managers.  As many people know, there are some large urban areas which are not county boroughs but which are very close to that position in population and valuation and which have immense difficulties which require the attention of a whole-time officer who would carry out the executive functions of that area.  Such is the case, for example, in Galway, which led me to put down this amendment. There you have a large growing city and also a very large county. It has very many difficult local problems, which require the attention of a full-time officer.  The present system which allows that work to be done by the county manager, who is an official of the county council, is not, in my opinion, satisfactory.  I think anyone would agree that in a large county like that it is nearly impossible for one individual to give sufficient attention to the problems that arise.  The county manager has to look after the county council, Ballinasloe Mental Hospital, the Central Hospital, Loughrea <Col N="141" /> Children's Home, Ballinasloe Urban Council, Tuam and Loughrea Town Commissioners.  It is a physical impossibility for that person to give attention to a town like Galway when he has so many other particular duties on his hands.</P>
    <P>There is one very important feature of the whole matter.  As many people must know, the relationship that exists between urban councils, borough councils and county councils is sometimes rather difficult because borough councils contribute to the county-at-large charges, not on services rendered but on a fractional basis which is the valuation of the county health district divided by the borough valuation.  I am sure the Minister knows that there are many urban areas and borough areas which find this a great burden. They have to pay on the gross valuation, not on the collectable valuation.</P>
    <P>Take a manager for both bodies. Every action of the manager for the county council becomes a burden on the borough council of which he is also manager.  The result is that when the borough council meets to discuss matters which are inter-related between the borough council and the county council, they have to deal with a manager who is also acting for the county council and it is practically impossible for him, unless he is a person of split mind, to dissociate himself from his main employers, the county council. I believe that many of the urban areas, and particularly the borough areas, could be more efficiently run if they had an officer of their own carrying out these executive functions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House on this matter, but I think the Minister will agree, particularly as regards the large borough areas, in view of the fact that the relations sometimes&mdash; more especially the financial relations between the counties and boroughs&mdash; are of a rather difficult nature, that it would be better if the borough council had a particular officer advising them so that they will be better protected and they will get better value for their money and that the county council contribution will be as they think fit.</P>

      <P>This proposal is cutting <Col N="142" /> right across the general principle of the Bill, which is really an effort at integration.  We were dealing earlier with the Dublin County Council and the city manager and this matter was then argued.  This proposal is to set up a city officer, evidently with the same powers as the county officer.  The county manager is the officer for the county and all the institutions therein. The county officer will have the same functions and if you set up a city officer in the boroughs I do not believe you will make for harmonious working. I think you will be making for friction rather than for integration.</P>
      <P>The case made for the boroughs could equally be made for some provincial towns that have not become boroughs.  The boroughs are Dún Laoghaire, with a population of 44,674; Galway, 20,370; Drogheda, 15,715; Sligo, 12,920; Wexford, 12,296; Kilkenny, 10,291, and Clonmel, 9,857. There are certain urban districts with a pretty high population, such as Dundalk, 18,562; Bray, 11,085, and Tralee, 9,990.  The case that can be made, if there is a case made, for the appointment of a city officer, could also be made for those towns with such a big population, with a population quite as big and perhaps bigger than in some of the boroughs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what necessity there is for the appointment of a city officer. The county officer will be there.  If he is overloaded there is provision made so that we can appoint an assistant county officer.  This particular proposal will not, in my opinion, make for harmonious working but will lead inevitably to friction.  I do not see that there is any point to be met at all.  If there is too much work for the county officer an assistant county officer can be appointed.  I do not see the need for a city officer who would not be a help but who would be rather the reverse.  They would be working against rather than with each other. It could not be confined to the boroughs and for that reason you would ultimately have additional costs imposed on the ratepayers.  These officers would be appointed on top of such officials as town clerks, and that will lead to more burdens on the rates.  I <Col N="143" /> think the Deputy ought not to press this amendment because his point is already sufficiently covered.</P>

      <P>There is a big difference between what I am trying to get at and the point in the discussion about the Dublin City Manager and the Dublin County Council.  They are autonomous bodies; they are not inter-contributing.  The difficulty about most large urban areas is that they have to contribute to the county council on a purely fractional basis and at times there is a tremendous amount of disagreement as between the two bodies and the one manager.</P>

      <P>The proposal in the amendment is that, at the request of the council of the county, the Minister may, by Order, increase the number of assistant county officers for the County of Cork, create one or more than one office of assistant county officer of the county, and amend or revoke an Order.

      <P>As the Minister knows, there is a whole mass of legislation by which it is left to the Minister finally to provide equally good standards in respect of administration throughout the country.  He has any number of Acts by which he can make quite sure that there is equally good administration. A whole hierarchy of officers and minor officers is provided, all with the object of having a high standard maintained. The suggestion originally was <Col N="144" /> that the Minister shall have the final word.  That is not with the view of preventing the Cork County Council or any other body from deciding the number of its officers, but with the view of maintaining a good and proper standard.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister's amendment is a little bit illogical, because he can provide by other Acts for officers of every kind, arrange for their numbers and make regulations in regard to their appointment.  There is a whole series of Acts going back some 20 years on that subject.  I think, as local authorities are ultimately bodies delegated to do their work by the Oireachtas, the Minister should have the final say as to the preservation of a standard of administration.  It is not always possible to imagine that a particular authority would be right in its decision.  It might think it is right, but from the point of view of preserving a good standard I am not sure that the Minister ought not to have the final say.</P>
      <P>The suggestion here is that, after consultation with the council of the county, he could appoint assistant county officers for Cork, and for other counties.  I have no objection to any method adopted by the Minister to ensure that every county council would be entitled to express its point of view, but if a county council has to have its a county medical officer of health or other officers, I think the Minister should have the final word.</P>

      <P>One of the differences between this Bill and the procedure which operated under Deputy Childers before is that, under sub-section 2 of Section 29, the council are now given a chance of determining whether they want an increased number of permanent officers.  Before this, and even as the law now stands, the situation was that the council had no say in the matter.  As I say, under sub-section 2 of Section 29, the council are now given the absolute power of determining whether there is to be an increase in the number of permanent officers.  The amendment which the Minister has introduced in this section is merely bringing the position of <Col N="145" /> additional county officer into line with the procedure the Minister has laid down in sub-section 2 of Section 29, under which the county officer cannot ask the Minister to increase the number of permanent officers without the permission of the council.  It seems to me that, far from attacking this proposal as being illogical, the Deputy should give the Minister credit for correcting one of the worst tendencies of the present system which was to give us, in local authorities, too many officers and too much approach to Government Department instead of more work being done across the table by the various officers concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other amendments, amendments Nos. 23 and 26, which deal with the same principle as this <Col N="146" /> amendment.  I think the Minister should accept this amendment as he has already agreed to the principle in the amendment accepted in regard to the appointment of temporary county officers to fill a vacancy.  This section deals with the transfer of functions to a county secretary.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the office of county officer for a county is vacant at the commencement of this part of this Act by reason of no person becoming appointed to the office by virtue of Section 10 of this Act, or where the office of county officer for a county becomes vacant after such commencement, the Minister may, by order made after consultation with the council of the county, transfer the functions of the county officer to the county secretary....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has already agreed to the principle of the amendment which I moved, that where there is to be a temporary appointment, the council may make the temporary appointment and it will be sanctioned by the Minister. The very same principle arises here.  The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;the Minister may, by Order made after consultation with the council of the county&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;the council of the county shall by Order&rdquo;.  In other words, there is the principle already accepted by the Minister, that temporary appointments will be made by the council and not by the Minister. Obviously, of course, they must be sanctioned by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to amend Section 16 (1) by providing that the council of the county and not the Minister shall make an order transferring the functions of the county officer for the county to the county secretary.  The amendment is objectionable for a variety of reasons. <Col N="147" /> It puts the members of the county council in the invidious position of being open to canvassing on behalf of a county secretary or an assistant county officer who, when the post of county officer becomes vacant, wants to get the post.  It is better that the Minister should be in a position to decide the issue as to whether or not the county secretary should be appointed county officer.  An Order made under the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 15 is equivalent to an Order for the amalgamation of the offices of county secretary and county officer. Provisions enabling amalgamation of offices to be made were included in the 1941 Local Government Act and were repeated, with some slight amendments, in the 1946 Act.  These provisions in the 1946 Act, Section 36, give the power to amalgamate offices to the Minister.  The effect of the amendments proposed by the Deputy would be to give the county council power to amalgamate the offices of county officer and county secretary while the Minister would have power to amalgamate all other offices.  The section provides for consultation with the county council.  If the county council holds strong views they will not be slow in conveying them to the Minister.  The Minister cannot disregard the views of the county council, except in face of very compelling reasons.</P>
      <P>The point is that consultation should take place between the Minister and the county council when any proposal of this kind is contemplated.  That would be more effective, seeing that the Minister has responsibilities for amalgamation in regard to other offices.  There may be contenders for the offices and it would be much better to have the matter decided in the manner outlined in the section than under the proposal of the Deputy.  It is being done in consultation all the time with the county council.  There is no infliction of the Minister on top of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make my mind clear on this point.  It is intended gradually to abolish county officers and to have the functions carried out by the county secretary. Where the office of county officer is vacant at the commencement of this part of this Act, the Minister may transfer the functions to the county secretary.  In view of what I have proposed already, and what the Minister has agreed to, I think that what he ought to agree to here is that the council may transfer those functions if there is a vacancy.  I am not worried at all about the question of a canvass because I think we have agreed that there will be no improper canvass in regard to matters of this kind under our local authorities as now constructed.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say if this section is intended to be part of the machinery for the abolition of the county officers? In other words, is it part of the machinery to change county officers into county secretaries under this particular section?  I think once you have that principle established, that is what is to be done.  I think that the councils themselves ought to do it.  I can see that there will be a difficulty in a case where there is an assistant county officer.  I do not know of many counties in which you will have an assistant county officer.  There may be one or two.  The machinery that is going to operate, as I understand it is, that once a county officer dies, resigns or retires and there is a county secretary there, to transfer the functions to him.  That is what is intended. Therefore you may not have any more county officers.  In such cases, I think the councils should make the order themselves.  That is why I deliberately put in the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; into the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister could meet Deputy Cowan by telling us a lot more about Section 15.  It is a very fundamental section of the Bill. I should like to know, for instance, in what circumstance the Appointments Commission will deal with these vacancies.  The Minister, I think, said that in certain cases the Appointments Commission will appoint the county secretary.  In certain other cases it would appear that they are to be automatically appointed.  I think, in order to clear up the matter, it would be well if the Minister would give us some more information on the section.  If we had that information I think we would be able to proceed further with Deputy Cowan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of Section 15 is to enable the offices of county officer and county secretary to be amalgamated under the latter title according as vacancies arise.  In the case of existing managers and county secretaries the amalgamation will not take place without their consent.  The local authority will be consulted in each case before an amalgamation takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first five sub-sections of this section deal with the case where the office of county officer is vacant at the commencement of this part of the Act.  They enable the duties of county officer in certain circumstances to be transferred to the county secretary or an assistant county officer.  The simple case will be in counties which have no assistant county officer.  If the county secretary was appointed before the commencement of this part of the Act, his consent will have to be obtained before amalgamation takes place.  If the county secretary was appointed after the commencement of this part of the Act, it will not be necessary to obtain his consent. <Col N="150" /> If both posts are vacant at the commencement, then the Minister can make an Order under sub-section (1) amalgamating the posts of county officer and county secretary, and the new appointee will hold both offices under the title of county secretary.</P>
    <P>In counties where there are, say, two assistant county officers and a county secretary the Minister may, instead of transferring the duties of county officer to the county secretary, transfer them to one of the assistant county officers. If the post of county secretary becomes vacant subsequently, the assistant county officer will assume the duties of county secretary as well as county officer, and his title will be county secretary.  The Order made by the Minister can, by virtue of sub-section (8), include a provision that the other remaining assistant county officer will then be known as assistant county secretary.  Sub-section (5) provides that an Order cannot be made transferring the duties of county officer to an existing assistant county manager without his consent.  You cannot load on to him an additional job without his consent if he has been there before the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (6) and (7) deal with the opposite case, that is, where the office of county secretary is vacant at the commencement of this part of the Act or becomes vacant thereafter.  The Minister may, by Order, after consultation with the council of the county, transfer the functions of the county secretary to the county officer and change his title to that of county secretary.  If the county officer was previously a county manager, then, by virtue of sub-section (7), the Order cannot be made unless he consents thereto.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (9) links with sub-section (3) of Section 9.  It enables the Minister, whenever there is a vacancy in the office of county officer, to appoint a person to hold temporarily the office of county officer until a permanent county officer is appointed or until an order is made under this section amalgamating the office of county secretary with that of county officer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> Sub-section (10) provides that the provisions made by or under this section shall have effect notwithstanding any other provision of this or of any other Act.  This is necessary because, by virtue of Section 9 of this Act and the 1926 Act, a permanent county officer would have to be appointed through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I think we are getting into a fog as somebody says.  We are certainly getting into pretty deep water in regard to this particular section, and so I think it is well that we ought to understand where we are and try to get some foothold at the moment.  At present we have county managers.  When this Bill is passed they will all become county officers. That is the first step.  It is intended by the Minister that we will reach another stage of development when the county officers disappear, because then all the work will be done by the county secretaries.  I think we need some guidance from the Minister as to when that second stage of development is to take place.  Let me admit at once that it is some time since I read the Bill completely.  It has been before us for quite a good while now, but as I see it, under this section you can start the process of changing a county secretary almost at once.</P>

We can make it by law now and the county council, the moment they have a vacancy, shall make the order declaring that the functions are to be transferred to the county secretary of that county.  That is why I think this is an important section in which we can deal now with the vital problems involved in the section.</P>

      <P>I can see very little use in either the section or the amendment. I do not know what work this county officer and his assistants are going to do while they are waiting to step into a dead man's shoes or waiting until the secretary resigns or retires or waiting to know which of the two will peg out first.  We are roughly spending £8,000 in County Cork on a county manager and three assistant county managers who are now to become county officer and assistant county officers.  What are going to be their functions?  I want to know what work these four men are going to do during the period which will elapse before the county secretary retires or resigns which will make room for the county officer or before any one of the assistant county managers retires or resigns to make room <Col N="153" /> for his assistant.  What are these men going to do for the £8,000 they are going to get if the Minister is rendering these officers redundant, as apparently he is?  I admit they do not become redundant until a vacancy is created for them.  What work will they do in the meantime?  If they have work to do in the meantime, who is going to do that particular job after the county secretary retires or when the county officer disappears?  Are we going to pay two men for doing one man's work?  Is that the respect the Minister or the Government has for the ratepayers?  I want to know where we stand.  Is this man to have no work to do from the date this Bill becomes law until such time as the county secretary gets out and makes room for him to get work to do?  If he has work to do and if the Minister holds that he is to be a fully employed man until such time as either the county secretary gets out or the county manager himself drops out and both functions are vested in one man, does the Minister expect one man is going to do two men's work?</P>
      <P>Let us take a case in point.  Supposing the Secretary of Cork County Council retires or resigns three months after this Bill becomes law.  So far as I understand it, the county manager, or the county officer as he will then be, would take over the county secretary's work.  Who would take over the work that the county officer was supposed to be doing in these three months?  Are you going to create another county officer or are you not?  That is what is puzzling me about this matter.  Apparently, there is so little respect for the ratepayer's money, as has been amply proved during the past couple of years by that Party over there, that now we have come to the position that, no matter how many of these boys are paid, you are creating a bunch of redundant officials.</P>

I want to know from the Minister if that is the way in which he considers the ratepayers should be treated.  If the Minister and the Government are genuine in their argument that the county managers are not required and that this Bill should be passed to abolish them or remove them or call them by another name, then give the men whatever is coming to them and let them go.  Do not hold these men there drawing full salary from the ratepayers and waiting until the county secretary goes in order to take his job.  Apparently, whichever of the two goes first the other is to take his place and one man will then be able to do the work of two.  It is about the craziest thing I have seen in legislation yet.  We have an open public admission that these men are redundant, that there is no work for them to do, but that they are to remain there and draw a full salary and wait until the county secretary moves out of their way or until they go and the county secretary takes up their functions as well as his own.  I have seen many crazy things done during the past three years in legislation but this is the craziest yet.  I would like to have the Minister explain to us what this officer will do until the county secretary goes and who will do that job when he takes over the county secretary's position.</P>

What this Bill proposes to do is to cut them down more quickly than Deputy Corry would have them cut down.

      <P>Deputy Cowan suggests that when a county officer resigns, the position should automatically be filled by the county secretary.  I think that was one of the points he made&mdash;that if the county secretary goes out of office, the county officer shall become county secretary automatically without any provision by way of ministerial Order or consultation with the council. That might work to some extent, but I would like to submit this.  It might not always be suitable or appropriate that the present county secretary should be the county officer in the event of the county officer resigning or, if you put it the other way, it may not be desirable that a county officer would assume the rôle of county secretary.  I think there would be an objection in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the <Col N="156" /> House have always been prepared to make some alteration regarding the conduct of local administration by county managers.  We have always considered that there was a great deal in this Bill that was pure hypocrisy designed for political purposes and designed to satisfy certain members of the Coalition.  There is a great deal in this Bill which can be construed as a deliberate effort to demean the position and reputation of county managers. That is our fundamental view. We are opposing Section 15, the principle of Section 15, but we want to look at it in a different way from Deputy Corry.  What Deputy Corry said was that if the Government do not really consider that the county officers are necessary, they certainly ought to abolish them now and only have county secretaries in the smaller counties.  That is a reasonable proposition but he cannot have read the rest of the Bill.  When you go to the end of the Bill and see the Minister appointing a fantastic number of committees, turning county councillors into professional civil servants, having so many committees that will require the attendance of the county officer, it is our view that it is ridiculous at this stage to presuppose that you can do without a county manager and that only a county secretary is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in view of those sections of the Bill which deal with the appointment of these committees, how often he thinks that the executive committees, the individual health committees and the sub-committees appointed by them and the advisory committees appointed by them are going to meet; how often he thinks the attendance of one of the chief executive officers or county secretaries or county officers will be required at these meetings; how long he thinks the county officer or county secretary is going to take to arrange for the administration of the work of those committees&mdash;to read the minutes, to get everything into order, to provide all the information for members of the local bodies.  Has he made up his mind regarding Section 15?  To what extent will executive committees or individual health committees transfer <Col N="157" /> their functions to the county officers? I would like to know what he thinks is likely to be the practice in respect to the placing of draft orders before the committees.</P>

      <P>I am relating the decision of the Minister in advance of viewing the effect of this Bill on local administration to abolish each county officership since he can conveniently do it in single counties and to amalgamate that with the office of county secretary; in other words, that there will be one officer instead of two.  I have asked the Minister what he thinks the effect of the administrative work will be when they all get the work; whether he thinks he can have only one officer instead of two at any time, when the full effect of this Bill is felt, when it is fully in operation and when all these committees are working. From what I learn from discussing the matter with members of local bodies and with officers of local bodies, the work of the county officer is going to increase enormously, or the work of the person who will replace the county officer is going to increase enormously, as a result of the provisions of this Bill, and he will have far more to do than before.  I should like to hear from the Minister the circumstances in which he believes he can make one person do the work of two in the future, when this Bill is fully in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no fear that the county councils will be unable to carry on.  If the work is too heavy for the county secretary, it is optional to get an assistant county secretary appointed, but, with the proposal in this measure of handing back to the elected members and executive committees the functions formerly discharged by the county manager, I have no fear that they will be unable to carry on with a reduced number of officers.  If, however, the county council feel that they are unable to do so, there is nothing to prevent them appointing an assistant to him. <Col N="158" /> If they want to make a reduction in the staff and feel that they can make that reduction, they are at liberty to do so. It is not mandatory and, as I say, if they feel that the work cannot be done adequately and efficiently, they can appoint an assistant to the secretary. There is a huge volume of work done by the manager which is being handed back to the elected representatives and the Deputy has an amendment further down the list, the purpose of which is to call these committees advisory committees. If that were to be so, I would agree that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the one officer or two officers, to carry on, but with these executive committees having executive power to deal with day-to-day important matters formerly dealt with by the manager, there will be no difficulty. Where an assistant is appointed, that appointment, coupled with the work done by the committees, will distribute the load so as to have the business efficiently and easily carried on.</P>

      <P>I propose to relate what I am about to say to the section.  I am concerned with Section 15, but I have to make some opening remarks before relating what I have to say to it.  Section 15 is fundamental in what is proposed in the Bill, that is, eventually, within 30 years at least and probably longer in some counties, to have the principal officer in these counties county secretary.  It may take 30 years to reach a position in which there will be no county officer in the entire Twenty-Six Counties.  That is not impossible. In future, we are to have the principal officer in County Wexford as the secretary of the county council and we will have in the neighbouring County of Carlow the principal officer as county officer.  In Waterford, he may be the county officer and, in Tipperary, the county secretary.  That is the type of local <Col N="159" /> government law we are to have in the future.  At the moment, every county manager performs somewhat similar functions and he has the same name in every county.  The principal officer in each county is the county manager and the next is the county secretary, but it will not be so in future under Section 15, because one county will have a county officer, while the neighbouring county will have a county secretary as principal officer.  If this legislation is not altered, and it will definitely be the duty of Fianna Fáil in a very short few months, when they become the Government of the country again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>To lower the status of the principal officers functioning in each county.  The county secretary of the future will be asked to perform the functions of a county council, the executive functions or such executive functions as the committees to be set up under the Bill may ask him to perform, and I have no doubt that in most counties they will be asked to perform almost all the functions that the county manager is performing at present.  Members of local authorities at the moment, and the majority of those who will be members of local <Col N="160" /> authorities in future, have to earn their livelihoods in some way.  They will not be whole-time officers of local authorities, as they will need to be under the Bill.  The only types that will be able to give full attendance at all the meetings of the committees to be set up when this Bill becomes law are those who are so wealthy that they can retire and devote their whole time to local authority administration. Desirable people who could give portion of their time&mdash;a small portion, I agree&mdash;to helping to administer the affairs of local authorities will not in future be enabled to offer themselves as members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The complaint is often made at present that the most desirable and best persons in the community cannot see their way to become members of local authorities, mainly for the reason that they have not got the time, but it will be found in future, when the Bill becomes law, that such members must be whole-time members of local authorities. In addition to performing all the functions of the county council, this secretary of the future will also have to perform functions as chief officer of the other local authorities, urban authorities and town commissioners, of which there may be four or even six in some counties.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said just now that the council can appoint assistant secretaries. Two or three may be required, but the chief officer will be absent from his principal office dealing with other duties, with local authorities in the area, for a good portion of his time and will leave in the office a junior official to deal with very important work.  That work may be performed over the phone with the Department or with citizens of that particular county.  The chief officer will be going around the county.  At the present time, in the absence of the manager you have the secretary, but when Section 15 becomes law the manager will become secretary and will have junior officials under him to take responsibility for many important matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister, the Government and those who support it should at this stage shed the hypocrisy of this whole thing.  This Bill was <Col N="161" /> brought before the House and this section was embodied in it in a fit of pique.  It is unworthy of any Government to set out to demean and belittle a set of officers who have served this country well for a number of years. During the recent emergency, the county managers, as we had them then, performed very important functions.  At that time, in the event of a major emergency they were entrusted with the full functions of government in their respective counties.</P>

This Parliament, on behalf of the people, is being asked now, in legislation introduced by a Minister, to lower the status of those officers and to belittle them in the eyes of the community. The Minister admitted that in his Second Reading speech.  That is the object of this Bill and that alone.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make clear my own position in relation to the remarks made by Deputy Allen.  I am sorry he could not substantiate the allegation he made, that not only was it the deliberate purpose of the Minister and the Government and those <Col N="162" /> supporting it to demean and belittle the personnel now filling the posts of county managers, but that that had been made clear as the object of the Government by the Minister in his Second.  Reading speech.  I do not believe that charge can be substantiated. I sincerely hope the Minister made no such utterance and I do not for a moment believe that he did.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local body, acquainted with many members of local bodies in the City of Dublin and throughout the country, I would like to make it quite clear that there is no animosity personally against those holding these particular posts, as far as members of our Party are concerned and, I think, as far as the Government as a whole is concerned.  It is one thing to look on the post: it is another to consider, as Deputy Allen and Deputy Childers endeavour to do, in discussing this section, the particular occupants of the posts.  I think it is quite improper&mdash;subject to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;to indulge in a debate on this section along those lines.  Possibly, both Deputy Childers and Deputy Allen are aware of that and aware that the Minister would not propose to follow them along that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the grievance is against the Minister and the Government for seeking to abolish the office of county manager, I believe it is the right thing to do.  It was one of the major blunders of the Fianna Fáil régime and I think Deputy MacEntee was responsible for extending this particular managerial system to the counties. It was unfortunate that the first Government&mdash;I think the present Minister for Education was in charge of local government at the time&mdash;ever hit on the particular phrase &ldquo;city manager&rdquo; to describe these particular officers.  It was an unfortunate description and one which certainly should not have been perpetuated.  If this Bill did nothing but alter the title of the principal officer, it would be well worth putting through the House.  The whole theory of local administration, as it is known here and in Great Britain, is that representatives are elected locally to carry out the administration of local affairs.  The alteration of this system, so that the officer became a manager <Col N="163" /> rather than a servant, is one which every member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and particularly Deputies MacEntee and Childers, who had close connection with local administration&mdash; knows very well was resented not only by local representatives but by a big body of public opinion throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned&mdash;and I think I can speak for nearly everyone occupying these benches, on this point &mdash;we are not approaching this Bill or Section 15 in any spirit or desire to insult or demean any of the present occupants of these posts.  I would like to make that clear, because that has been the suggestion made by Deputy Childers, followed immediately by Deputy Allen, in their remarks on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Deputy Cowan has moved amendments Nos. 24, 25, 27 and 28, and that we are entitled to discuss these amendments on the section.  I propose just to say a few words in comment upon the starting change in attitude on the part of Deputy Cowan which these amendments suggest when they are contrasted with amendment No. 11. All of us who recall Deputy Cowan's performance on amendment No. 11 will undoubtedly have called up to their minds the image of the walrus who, after he had repleted himself with a feast of oysters, took out his handkerchief and wiped his streaming eyes. That, you all will remember, was the precise way in which Deputy Cowan painted the luckless position of county managers under sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Minister's Bill.  He told us what was going to happen if the Minister consulted with the councils of the counties before deciding to which county he would appoint the county manager: all considerations of justice and humanitarianism would be wiped away.  He was thinking of the man who had established a home and whose family were being educated in certain schools; he pointed out what a hardship it would be to him to be appointed to a certain position, a very lucrative position, I may say.  What <Col N="164" /> has Deputy Cowan proposed to do under the amendment which proposes to delete sub-section (4) of Section 15? Under the Bill as it stands the Minister proposes to make an Order under the principal sub-section of the section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Transferring functions to the county secretary of a county and such county secretary was appointed to that office before the commencement of this part of this Act, the Order shall not be made save with the consent of such county secretary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One would think that that was a very harmless proposal, an equitable and just provision to have included in the section, but Deputy Cowan proposes in his amendment to delete the sub-section so that the Minister may make any Order he likes in respect of the officer without even consulting the officer concerned.</P>

      <P>Oh, I have read amendment No. 22, but I do not see that they are related to each other; they stand separately.  If the Deputy wanted to amend the section substantially he could have proposed to delete the section and substitute another.  I am not responsible if the Deputy was too indolent to draft an amendment that would have disclosed this intention. When he put amendment No. 11 on the Order Paper he put it in such a way as to conceal his intention; I do not say he is doing that now, but merely through indolence he drafted these amendments or perhaps they were given to him and he flung them at the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us leave that aspect and come to another one.  I notice that Deputy O'Higgins has left the House.  If there is one thing that has characterised the manifestations of political unity which we have been experiencing from the Government Parties during the last few months it is the way they stick to one another and occasionally they try to stick knives in one another, but I have not heard any dagger and cloak attack upon any Minister such as we have listened to to-night from Deputy O'Higgins. <Col N="165" /> Deputy O'Higgins got up here and ascribed all the follies, all the misfortunes, all the evils, of the managerial system to that bright particular self-described star of the present Government, the present Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Deputies who were present at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis will know that I am not in any way exaggerating the opinion the Minister for Education has of himself in the political firmament of Ireland.  Here we had Deputy O'Higgins blaming Deputy Mulcahy because it was the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration that introduced the managerial principle into Irish local administration.  I am not going to say that merely because Cumann na nGaedheal introduced that principle it was a bad principle.  On the contrary, we approached this problem in an objective way and decided that it was a good principle and that if it were good enough for Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford it could equally be applied to County Dublin, County Cork, County Limerick, County Waterford&mdash; yes, and all the other counties in Ireland. That was done in 1940 and it is merely a manifestation of the utter ignorance that characterises the pronouncements of Deputies who support this Bill that Deputy O'Higgins did not even know what Deputy was Minister for Local Government when that Bill was introduced.  I do not say that with any idea of refusing to accept responsibility for the County Management Bill when it was introduced by Deputy Ruttledge who was then Minister for Local Government.  I do not refuse to accept responsibility, and full responsibility, for the fact that the Bill was introduced because, when Fianna Fáil was governing this country we had a Government which honoured the Constitution and which accepted collective responsibility for everything a Minister did and for everything a Minister said.  The doctrine of constitutional responsibility has long been thrown over but the mere fact that it has been thrown over does not excuse Deputy O'Higgins for getting up here and making a statement which, if not deliberately misleading, was founded on ignorance.</P>

I unfortunately had not the advantage of being in the House when the Minister for Local Government was introducing it, explaining it to the House and disclosing the purpose behind it, but it seems to me to be a curious section and quite an unnecessary section unless, of course, there is an ulterior motive in the minds of the Minister and the disunited Government of which he is a member. Why is it necessary, first of all, to declare in the Bill that the county manager will now be called &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; and, in the second place, to take power under Section 15 to turn him into something else?  Surely that is a procedure which should be explained at some length so that we may see precisely what is the purpose behind the Bill, because I do not think the purpose is being disclosed.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the loans and grants provided for farmers under existing schemes are inadequate and suggests to the Government that, in order to be effective for the purpose for which they are intended, loans for the erection or improvement of farm buildings, the betterment of land, the improvement of live stock and the purchase of machines and equipment should be made available to whatever extent is required at low rates of interest.&mdash; (Patrick Cogan, Patrick O'Reilly.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this matter was before the House and on which I was speaking, the Minister did not deem it worth his while to come in and listen to me. To-night I am not in a condition to say very much as I am suffering from a heavy cold.  However, I believe I have covered as much of the ground as I need cover in connection with the matter of the availability of grants and loans to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke on this motion I did not mention the matter of a subsidy for manures. On one occasion I think the Minister challenged me on that subject to the effect that when the manures were available they were not used.  I pointed out on that occasion that they could not be used because they were not available.  Now, however, that the Minister has gone to the ends of the earth and has been able to get an ample supply of manures for the farmers of this country I suggest he should go a little further and make them cheap enough to enable the farmers to buy them.  I suggest that the Minister should try to inveigle or induce the Minister for Finance to give a sum of money that will enable the Minister for Agriculture to offer a decent subsidy to the farmers to enable them to purchase those manures. That is one of the ways in which land development can be helped.  Another way in which it can be helped is the making available of a certain sum of money to enable farmers who are living in remote rural districts to provide decent avenues or roadways to their farmhouses.  In many parts of the country we have laneways and <i>culs-de-sac</i> where modern machinery cannot be taken.  Even in County Kilkenny, which is a fairly modern county, I know that there are places where tractors cannot travel.  If grants were made available to enable farmers to widen the laneways and <i>culs-de-sac</i> and to put a decent surface on them it might help in furthering the agricultural production of that particular area.  I understand that in parts of the country&mdash;particularly in the West, where beet is brought to the factory&mdash; there are many small farmers who have <Col N="168" /> to cart their produce three, four and five miles to a pick-up point.  Very little encouragement is given to people living in remote districts, and who are in such a bad way in regard to reaching the public roadways, to increase production.  I think that more production in agriculture is one of the Minister's pet subjects and I agree with him on that, provided he goes the right way about giving us more production.</P>
    <P>Those are the things I wish to mention and those are the ways in which I think the Minister can help, if he is anxious to help, the people who are living in the more remote parts of the country.  If he does help them as I have suggested, it will facilitate greater production and it will be an inducement to our young people to remain on the land because they will have better conditions there.  The Minister should give some consideration to the argument which I put forward&mdash;especially if he has, as he claims to have, a genuine sympathy with the farmers of this country&mdash;to induce the Minister for Finance to give the money which he should make available in order to help those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  I regret that I was unavoidably absent from the House when the motion was proposed.  However, I am glad that the Minister is here to consider it and I am grateful to Deputy T. Walsh who proposed the motion, as it will enable us to hear the Minister express his views on this very important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is worded very much the same as a motion which was moved by the Labour Party in the Seanad some time ago.  I intentionally followed the wording of that particular motion because I was anxious that this motion should have the support of the Labour Party, for whom I have a great respect. It will be admitted that this motion raises an important issue.  It points out that the existing schemes of loans and grants are inadequate and that loans for the erection and improvement of farm buildings, the betterment of land, the improvement of live stock and the purchase of machinery and equipment should be made available to whatever <Col N="169" /> extent is required at low rates of interest.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that very elaborate details of existing Government schemes in regard to agricultural loans and grants are just now being circulated to Deputies of the House, I have a sort of suspicion that the Minister may attempt to rest upon his laurels, or those of his predecessors, in so far as grants and loans are concerned. There is no doubt that we have a multitude of schemes of various shapes and sizes to promote the development of agriculture in different ways.  Notwithstanding the existence of these schemes, we find that there is a great variety of agricultural development work which farmers desire to undertake but which, because they are handicapped for the want of finance, they are unable to carry out.</P>
    <P>When a motion similar to this motion was being debated in the Seanad, the Minister made great play on the fiction that a credit-worthy farmer need never be without the capital to develop his farm.  However, when he was asked to define what was meant by &ldquo;a credit-worthy farmer&rdquo; he said that a credit-worthy farmer was any farmer who brings in two Deputies to sign his promissory note.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will find <Col N="170" /> that the remarks which I attributed to him are correct.  I have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Minister will put up the same proposition here&mdash;that he will suggest that anybody who can bring two Deputies to sign his promissory note can get all the credit he wants.  I do not think that either Deputies or farmers desire that particular type of credit facilities. It can be clearly demonstrated that credit facilities are inadequate and that the rate of interest is far too high.  For the last year for which figures were quoted in this House, of the total number of applications made to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for loans, two-thirds were rejected. That means that of every three farmers who applied to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for credit facilities, two were refused.  A departmental credit organisation which rejects two-thirds of the applications made to it can scarcely be said to be fulfilling the function of capitalising agriculture.  I am quite sure that anyone who considers the matter will acknowledge that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are not to blame.  They have to pay a substantial rate of interest for the money they use.  They have only a narrow margin of interest on which to work and they are expected to make a profit on their transactions.  Within the narrow sphere in which they are compelled to work they are doing their best but they are failing completely to satisfy the needs of agriculture.  The fact that agricultural production has remained static since the establishment of the State is a clear indication that the necessary capital is not being put into the agricultural industry in order to make it as productive as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter was under discussion in the Seanad, the Minister, on the question of interest, also made a remarkable statement.  He said that he did not see any reason why interest rate should be charged on loans.  That is a very sweeping statement.  Personally, I would hardly be inclined to go as far as that but I would say that nobody has ever given reasonable grounds for the State paying interest on money required for national development. <Col N="171" /> There may be a case for an individual or a firm that lends money to charge interest to cover the possibility of loss or the possibility of default on the part of the borrower, but no case has ever been made for the State being required to pay interest on money required for national development.  No one has ever attempted to make that case for such a levy.  That is what it amounts to.  It is a levy on industry, a levy on enterprise, a levy on the worker engaged in industry.  We have a State bank here and I do not see how, with some addition to their powers, they would not be able to finance works of national development on the security of the country's credit, which is as good, if not better, than the security of any nation on the face of the earth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise the burden which the existing rates of interest place on the agricultural industry.  I will give one demonstration.  Under the land project, if a farmer decides to avail of the credit facilities provided, for the £12 per acre borrowed, he or his children will repay £29.  I do not know who gets the balance over and above the £12 but the farmer who borrows £12 in order to drain a statute acre will repay £29.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind the case of a farmer who borrowed £500 in 1921 and he repaid no less than £1,500 within a period of 35 years.  It is this high rate of interest which frequently deters farmers from availing of any credit facilities that are available, if they can otherwise secure the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A farmer who has money on deposit gets a maximum of 1 per cent. on the money he lends to the bank.  Surely, that should be the maximum that an ordinary farmer should be asked to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="173" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One per cent.&mdash;well, that is a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>And there is nothing unreasonable about it.  If the banks think they are justified in paying 1 per cent. for the loan of the farmer's money, I do not see any reason why a farmer anxious to get money for the purpose of agricultural development should not be able to secure it at the same rate.  The existing rate of interest puts a severe burden on the primary producers; it puts an excessively severe burden on agricultural production; it adds to the cost of production and ultimately to the cost of living because it affects the cost of food, the cost of the essentials of life.</P>
      <P>These are important considerations, and I am sure that the Minister, having listened to the expression of these views on usury and interest, will give them his careful consideration.  There is no use in the Minister saying: &ldquo;I believe the interest charges are unjust,&rdquo; and at the same time doing nothing whatever to remedy that injustice.</P>
      <P>I have indicated how easy it is for a farmer who needs credit to obtain it. If a man can bring two solvent sureties to the Agricultural Credit Corporation or to the banks, he will get a considerable amount of credit; but that is not a task that any farmer likes. There are very few farmers who wish to go to their neighbours and ask them to go security for a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can see all around us evidence of the under-capitalisation of agriculture. I use that phrase because it is the phrase that is used very extensively by one of our Ministers, Mr. MacBride, the Minister for External Affairs.  We can see ample evidence in a soil that is deficient in lime and fertilisers.  We can also see evidence in out-offices and farm buildings that are altogether unsuitable for progressive and efficient farming.  We can see evidence, too, in the farmers' houses, though to a certain extent an effort is being made to remedy that.  We can also see evidence in the fact that many farmers have to use out-of-date equipment.  There are many farms of a fair size which would be better cultivated if the farmer could <Col N="174" /> use a tractor, but the initial cost is too high.</P>
    <P>In addition to all that, we know that there are dairy herds in the country which are under-productive; they are not producing what they should and the unprofitable cows require to be replaced. There, again, capital is necessary. These are all things to which capital could be usefully applied.  I am sure it is only necessary to mention these things to arouse the Minister's sympathy, although he did not show so very much sympathy to a similar proposal when it was before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that soil deficiency is one aspect of agriculture that deserves to be rectified.  There are also deficiencies of lime and phosphates.  I raised this matter in the debate on agriculture last year and, when concluding that debate, the Minister indicated that he intended to extend the land rehabilitation scheme so as to provide a scheme of loans for the purchase of fertilisers.  In due course the scheme was introduced but it was implemented in a manner which would appear to me to be calculated to deter any farmer who required these facilities from availing of them.</P>
    <P>In the first place, a farmer making an application for a loan is required to pay a fee of 1/- per acre for every acre in his possession.  That means that a man with 100 acres has to send along a fee of £5.  Does the Minister consider he is encouraging the ordinary farmer to avail of the scheme by imposing this fee?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Minister's opinion, but 100 acres of poor land subject to a high rateable valuation, subject to a very high rate, does not make the farmer a very wealthy man.  I know farmers with 100 statute acres who would find a fee of £5 an <Col N="175" /> important consideration.  Farmers do not find £5 notes on the roads in Wicklow or in Carlow.  Why was this fee imposed?  In the Agricultural Credit Corporation there is a fee of 1/- for each application, but that is a reasonable thing.  One would consider that desirable for the purpose of stopping frivolous applications.  In this case you have a levy of 1/- per acre.</P>
      <P>There is a more serious drawback.  A farmer who desires to improve one field, say ten acres&mdash;let us assume he has 50 acres&mdash;is compelled under this scheme to have his entire holding taken into the calculation.  That is to say that the farmer is required to go into debt to the extent perhaps of five or 10 times the amount he wishes to borrow.  It is just the same as if the farmer went to a bank for £10 and the manager said: &ldquo;I will not give you £10, but I will give you £50 or £100.&rdquo; That is the principle embodied in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the measure of my sinning, that I make them borrow too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer, who is the best judge of what he can repay, the farmer who is an honest man, should not be penalised in this fashion.  He will know how much he can repay and it is wrong to dictate to him what amount he should be given and the extent to which he ought to go into debt.  The Minister, when he considers this matter, will admit that that is a reasonable point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No attempt should be made to coerce a man to accept more credit than he thinks he can reasonably repay. I think that is a consideration which would operate against the success of this scheme.  The Minister may say, in justification for bringing an entire holding, rather than portion of it, under the scheme that it is better from a purely administrative point of view and perhaps also from the agricultural point of view, that the entire holding should be dealt with.  I should like to submit this consideration to the Minister, if that is his answer to the point I have made.  Would it not <Col N="176" /> be reasonable to meet the farmer in this way: &ldquo;If you do not feel that you would like to undertake the liability for borrowing an amount sufficient to provide for the liming and fertilising of your entire holding, it would be sufficient if you avail of this scheme to apply the necessary lime to your entire holding.&rdquo;  The application of lime effects a more permanent improvement than the correction of phosphate deficiency.  Once the acidity due to the absence of lime is corrected, there is a prospect that a considerable number of years will elapse before the lime content is exhausted in that land.  That, I suggest, would be a reasonable compromise.  I have tried to meet the Minister in a reasonable way.  Such a compromise would make the scheme more acceptable to a great many farmers.  In addition, it would enable something to be done which should be done right now.  That is, to correct the acidity in every acre of acid soil in this country as soon as possible.  We have available in this country limestone to produce all the lime that this country requires.  The sooner that lime is applied to every acre of soil that needs it, the better for the productivity of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to phosphates, there are limiting factors, not alone because of its cost but due to the fact that it has to be imported.  If we were to avail of phosphates to the extent that the soil requires, it is doubtful that even the Minister with all his powers would be able to supply the necessary quantity.  We know that in the last year for which figures were available, less than four stone of fertilisers per statute acre were applied to the agricultural land of this country on the average.  That is merely insulting the soil of this country.  I am sure that if we were to attempt to provide all the phosphatic and potassic manures the soil requires, we would find considerable difficulty in importing it, but there is no difficulty in regard to lime as far as I can see.  There is no reason why we should not make a tremendous effort to get lime applied as quickly as possible to the soil.  We want increased output; we want it urgently and even in regard to crops which are urgently needed, such as <Col N="177" /> barley and wheat, lime is an absolute essential.  I want in connection with this whole question of credit to pay a tribute to the good work done by the Irish Sugar Company.  There is no doubt that they have provided beet-growers with very substantial credit facilities both in regard to lime and fertilisers and I believe the results forthcoming have justified their progressive approach in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will have no hesitation in accepting this motion. I think that the improvement of farm buildings occupies a very high priority in agricultural rehabilitation at the moment.  You can if you like divide capital requirements of agriculture into two classes.  You have first the kind of capital, which once applied to a farm directly raises the market value of that farm.  The point I want to impress on the Minister is that under this particular heading you have loans for the improvement of the soil, for reclamation of land, for building and loans for the improvement of fences, carways and approaches to farm buildings.  All the money expended on these improvements creates immediately a permanent asset and for that reason there should be no hesitation in providing credit for these requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown under one particular heading I have mentioned that he accepts my view and he is providing long-term loans for the reclamation of land.  The same should apply in regard to buildings.  He will say, of course, that loans for buildings can be obtained through the Agricultural Credit Corporation but, as I pointed out, two farmers out of every three, who apply for these loans, have their applications rejected.  I think we should aim at having every farm properly equipped so far as accommodation for live stock and the storing of grain and crops are concerned.  We would, in that way, make farming more efficient and more attractive to the farmer and members of his family. That is a very important consideration at the present time when we have so many attractions for young people to get away from the farm.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would refrain from interrupting, and if he is so desperately anxious to intervene in the debate, I shall try to give way to him very speedily, but I would ask him not to inflict on the house a rigmarole such as he has issued to us in typed form, showing all the things that he and his predecessors have done in regard to loans, grants and various other things.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that these things, while good in themselves, are inadequate. I have made two points: (1) that the farmers who really require credit find it almost impossible to obtain it; and (2) that the cost of credit for agricultural purposes is altogether too high.  I think that the interest rates are based, to a great extent, on the profits obtainable in commerce and in operations other than agriculture.  They are not based on the earning capacity of agriculture.  I should like the Minister to consider these two aspects of the question.  I did not put down the motion in any spirit of criticism.  It is similar to a motion which was tabled by the Labour Party in the Seanad.  I think it is a fair one, and that it should be met in a reasonable way by the Minister.</P>

      <P>He will take half an hour at the end of this debate to repeat it at interminable length.  He led off to-day by trusting his bacac memory, and Deputy Corry was off like a scalded cat to the library for confirmation, but I noticed that the scalded cat did not come back because he is a cute old warrior.  He knew when he sent down for the Official Report that I, too, would send for the Official Report, and that if he tried any of the tricks of his bacac memory he would get his two ears nailed to the post, so he has gone home with his two ears safe to North Cork.  But Deputy Cogan, being a dull, stupid <Col N="180" /> man, imagines that he can get up here and attempt to misquote me without being exposed.  The Deputy in the rôle of galloper for broken down major-generals in this country, may present a desirable appearance in his native county, but he is not in the company of bailiffs or emergency men now.</P>
      <P>What I did say on this credit motion as reported at column 578 and the ensuing columns&mdash;Volume 36, Seanad Debates, 9th December, 28th July, 1949&mdash;when dealing with this question of credit worthiness, was this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it is a mistake for Senators to suggest that there is any ground for the suggestion, or even for the impression, that only large farmers can get loans, and that small farmers cannot.  There is not a farmer in this country, large or small, if he has 10 acres or 1,000 acres, who, if he corresponds with the ordinary test as to the capacity to meet his debt when it falls due, cannot get to-morrow morning all the credit he can possibly want. Here is a problem I would ask the Senators to help me to solve.  Is there any device that can be offered which would effectively segregate the sheep from the goats in applicants for credit?  I may say that a ready and simple test would be to challenge Senator Quirke and Senator Hearne to put their names on the back of a man's bill.  Neither I nor Senator Quirke nor Senator Hearne can in practice accept responsibility for putting our names on the back of a bill for every man we believe to be credit-worthy in rural Ireland.  It is just not practicable politics, and we would not be honest men if we did because if any substantial number of them defaulted we would be unable to meet our guarantee.  Putting the dilemma&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I see the scalded cat is coming back.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;in that way is an easy way to demonstrate the impracticability of such a test; but it would be ridiculous to suggest that it really belongs to the sphere of practical politics.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is described by Deputy Cogan as a declaration by me that the <Col N="181" /> only test of credit worthiness is that a man could bring in two guarantors to back his bill, and he is ablaze with indignation when I use the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; in this context.  I have read every word&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish you would stay where you are because I have a little more to say to you.  Any Minister for Agriculture, confronted with this resolution on the Order Paper, must of its very nature, accept it.  I, certainly, accept the proposition that there should be made available to the farmers of this country all the credit they require.  I assert that, for the first time since this State was established, there is no amenity requisite or accommodation, that any farmer in any part of Ireland requires for the fullest utilisation of his land that he has not now accessible to him on credit terms within the reach of the smallest, or the largest, holder of land in Ireland.  I issue this challenge to the House, that if there is any single amenity calculated to increase the earning capacity of any farmer in any part of Ireland which at the present moment he is obliged to forgo for want of credit, then let him name it, and he will have credit to get to-morrow morning.</P>
      <P>The object of this Government is to put within the reach of every farmer, on every acre of land in Ireland, the means to utilise that land to the greatest possible advantage, measuring the advantage by the test of the excellence of the living that he can get from the land for himself, his wife and his family, always provided that he leaves the land in the autumn a little better than he found it in the spring.  If there is any amenity now lacking, or facilities which the farmer must forgo for the want of credit calculated to produce that result for him, let it be named, and the facilities will be provided forthwith.</P>

I agree with that view still; I adhere to it.  But Deputy Davin and I have reached a time of life when we realise that so little time is left to us that we may not, with propriety, spend it couching chivalrous lances to overthrow the windmills of adversity.  We have to do the best we can with the instruments we have got and leave it to our children and our children's children to reform posterity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to put his hands to the task of abolishing the lending of money at interest, I invite him to start his operations on the executive of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and invite them to invest their funds by providing credit for their neighbours free of interest and I think he will get a very chily reception.  If he succeeds with them, he can then turn to the National Union of Railwaymen and invite them to invest their funds on a similar basis and I think he will get a very chilly reception.  He may then turn to his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, who is about to amplify and extend the entire horizon of social services in this country on a basis of 4½ per cent., and tell him that that whole element of the financing of his scheme is to be swept away and, while I have no doubt that my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, will agree with him that the abolition of interest on money would be a most desirable reform, I think he will say to Deputy Davin and to me: &ldquo;Look, what I am concerned to do is to carry the social security scheme now so that the people who are waiting and longing for the reforms incorporated in that code may enjoy them and <Col N="183" /> leave it to posterity to produce perfection.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and feel very virtuous as a result thereof, but that they were able to do it because the balance is, as are all other trust funds in the hands of any trustees, as by law required, invested by those trustees at remunerative rates of interest.  Is not that true?  Why do we attempt to turn our backs to it? Is there a Deputy who ever set out to save a portion for his child or family or who insured his life who did not do it on the basis of the social system in which he lived, founded on rates of interest?  The difference between those who effect worth-while reforms and those who do nothing except bask in the sunshine of their own self-esteem is that these are cranks who spend their lives in the latter happy occupation, who rejoice that they are not as other men, scorn interest and all things associated therewith, while the poor despised publicans put their hands to the imperfect plough available to them and, with its blunted edge, attempt to make some step forward towards a better state of society than that in which they find themselves for the time being.  It is true that the idealists get the praise of weekly periodicals, but it is the mundane politician who does the job. For my part&mdash;I suppose it is middle age&mdash;I have ceased to long for the approbation of the sophisticated weekly and shall be well content if I can look back on a furrow, however irregularly ploughed, which in the spring bears a crop however inadequate and however unlovely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I want to make it possible under the system in which we live for those who hold our land in stewardship, not for the State but for God, to make it produce two blades of grass where heretofore only one grew, and I am not ashamed to formulate that in <Col N="184" /> an aphorism which I borrow from a better man: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  I am glad to tell the House that I believe I shall shortly succeed in negotiating an agreement with the British Government whereupon I shall sell to the British people, to feed the British people, as many pigs as our people will be able to produce and at a price guaranteed for five years of from 200/- to 210/- per cwt. dead weight, with an understanding that, if the price of pigs is raised in Great Britain during that time, it will rise in Ireland too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I did not negotiate the eggs agreement.  It was my predecessor, and my predecessor left me in the position of going to England with £5,000,000 worth of eggs on my hands to negotiate an agreement.  There will be no agreement about pigs which does not provide that, if the price goes up in Great Britain, it goes up in Ireland too.  I will never make an agreement about eggs, with such a provision as was in the agreement of 1947, that we would spend £1,350,000 maintaining egg production with no proviso as to what the British would pay for those eggs when produced, and I will not send my successor to London with a vast surplus hanging around his neck to try and make a price agreement for that surplus, as in my case, when the other parties to the agreement knew that if I did not take their price I would have to throw them away.  I fix them with notice that after this year a low price for Irish, eggs does not mean cheap eggs for England; it means no eggs and they have got full notice of that fact and they know I mean it.  I want the land of this country to produce more eggs, fowl, meat, cattle and sheep to feed the British people, and I am proud to do that, provided they pay our people a fair price for their produce. Any agreement they make with me, so long as I speak for the Irish people, will contain a proviso that when the agreement is made, and thereafter so long as the agreement <Col N="185" /> operates, they will continue to pay a fair price.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee's disease is getting infectious.  Everybody is getting so tender and delicate in this deliberative.  Assembly that we will have to serve out cotton wool before a debate starts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said with deliberation, Deputy.  There is no test of a policy more effective than results.  I appeal to that test and to none other. Good intentions constitute the pavement to hell and they are not alibis for a statesman or a politician.  There is only one justification for a Government remaining in office and a politician, which I proudly claim to be, claiming the suffrages of the people, and that is, the results of his continued activities in the public life in this country.  I quote from a leading article in the <i>Donegal Vindicator</i> on the 10th February, appropriately headed: &ldquo;Why the Barometer Burst.&rdquo; That leading article refers to speeches made by Deputy Vivion de Valera and my distinguished and prescient predecessor, Deputy Smith.  They both went to Bailieboro and with that hospitality characteristic of that distinguished son of Cavan on that occasion he elected to play second fiddle to Deputy Vivion de Valera.  Deputy Vivion de Valera worked himself up into quite a passion, because he said that during the last three years we should have aimed at greater independence of foreign grain and fuel, but Deputy de Valera had overlooked the <Col N="187" /> enduring quality of the printed word and he had forgotten that Deputy Smith had gone on record in 1947 as to what acreage and quantity of grain should be grown in Ireland in 1950. That is, unfortunate for poor Deputy Vivion de Valera, that we are now in a position to compare Deputy Smith's anticipation with the performance of your insignificant humble servant. Deputy Smith, in 1947, as reported in the kept newspaper of the Fianna Fáil Party on the 22nd October, 1947, prognosticated that in 1950 or 1951 we should have £257,000 acres under wheat. Your insignificant humble servant managed to return 350,000 acres under wheat with a larger yield of grain from that 350,000 acres than Deputy Smith had been able to extract from 600,000 acres which he had under wheat during his ministry.</P>
      <P>The Deputy forecast that in respect of almost every other product of the land we should have a lesser quantity as tillage in 1950 than we had in 1947. On live-stock he set his targets high, and although I understood it was somewhat disreputable to encourage farmers by credit or otherwise to expand their live-stock production Deputy Smith in 1947 declared that the apex of his aspirations target was for the cattle to increase in number from £3,961,000 in 1947-48 to £4,200,000 in 1950-51.  I know that his colleagues in the front bench of Fianna Fáil will be glad to know that though I was obliged to take over the agriculture of this country at a time when the cattle population stood at the lowest recorded figures since 1847, that we have far outstripped Deputy Smith's most optimistic anticipation and have nearer £4,500,000 than the £4,200,000 which he foresaw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pigs we have not achieved the £1,000,000 that he hoped to realise by 1950, but I think we shortly will.  In sheep there were £2,095,000 in 1947-48. He hoped in 1950-51 to see 3,000,000. We will not be far short of that either. Poultry&mdash;I would ask Deputy's Killilea's special attention on this as I know he is troubled about the price of eggs.  His colleague, Deputy Smith, set as his aim 25,000,000 hens in 1950. <Col N="188" /> We have not got quite that far, and, if we do not get more for eggs, we never will, but fortunately, if the need for decimation matures, we have made a provident arrangement whereunder every fowl slaughtered and trussed in the holocaust will bring 14/- to her proprietor, if she will take reasonable precautions to turn it out as she should.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to think that our people's programme of protection, facilitated by the credit schemes outlined here to-day, imperfect though they be, will bring to them a further expansion of that which they at present enjoy, a higher standard of living on their own homes, no matter who tried to take that from them, in dignity and peace, by their own unaided efforts.  It sickens me to hear <Col N="189" /> Deputies like Deputy Cogan, who consider it their mission in life to paint the farmers of this country as grovelling beggars for charity.  I and those associated with me have concerned ourselves for many generations to make the tenant farmers of the country independent men, able to earn their own living and rear their families beholden to no one, landlord, agent, emergency man or Fianna Fáil hatchet man, and I saw grow up in my own time a fouler system of intimidation, built on the poverty of our people, than ever Clanrickarde attempted to operate and that was the rotten, corrupt Fianna Fáil machine which battened on our people because they were poor.  The aim and object of Fianna Fáil to-day and of people like Deputy Cogan is to see our people poor again, so that they can swagger around and threaten to deny them the right to earn their own living in their own country if they do not grovel before the ward heelers of a rotten, corrupt political organisation.</P>
      <P>They will not be the first gang that hoped to get our people down in the dirt and to keep them there, but they ought to remember&mdash;and if they do not know, let them learn&mdash;no gang, whatever their power and whatever their resources, ever kept our people down for long.  I do not deny that Fianna Fáil brought our people very low, brought them to a depth of poverty, frustration and misery unlike anything I ever believed I would see.  Thanks be to God, we have swept it away.  We have put within the reach of those who live upon the land the means to earn their living on the land and the means to tell any rotten and corrupt hatchet man who comes to threaten them across the half-door to get to blazes before he is thrown out.</P>

It was by being too proud to grovel and it was by being proud to be seen beside our own people when they were in opposition to the major-generals and the rubbish that begot them that our people acquired, not perhaps the title of respectability, but the claim to be respected wherever they were in Ireland or outside it, rich or poor, and God grant that they will always retain it.

      <P>I am just wondering what it has to do with farm benefits and the betterment of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to credit. Deputy Moran cannot think of providing benefits or credit for farmers on the land for any other purpose than to enable Fianna Fáil to get back to dispense it.  I take the view that they should be independent of Fianna Fáil, independent of Fine Gael, of the Labour Party, the Independents, and so on.  It is for that reason that I wish to see every variety of credit that our people require to enhance that independence, to enable them to get a better living from their land; and I bind myself in anticipation to make it readily available to those who want to have it and to all on equal terms, without being beholden to me or to anyone else in Ireland in the full knowledge that it is their own, and that they are entitled to expect those who are its stewards to use it primarily for the benefit of those to whom it belongs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> I want the farmers to be faced with the fact that in the conditions where God made this country and put our people in it, it is the farmers of Ireland who must carry all the rest on their backs.  The farmers of Ireland given the means, have the resources and the ability to do it&mdash;and trot at the same time.  But I want to say to others, whether they be trade unionists, professional men, shopkeepers, traders or public servants&mdash;let them remember that in the last analysis the living of them all comes out of the land.</P>
    <P>So long as I am Minister for Agriculture, the agricultural policy of this country will be founded on the assumption that provided the farmers get a fair living&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they have the land and the capital and will be glad and happy to see their neighbours share their prosperity.  I have never been afraid to say to the farmers that if this credit is made available to them for a variety of purposes it is provided on condition that the man who works for him gets his fair share of the profit. It is not in Leinster House that I have said that but at farmers' meetings up and down the country&mdash;and I will say it again.</P>

This is the way God made me and he will have to take me as I am.  I now assert that the farmers to-day are better off than they have been at any time since the famine of 1847.  I now assert that it is the duty of the Minister <Col N="193" /> for Agriculture and the Government to which he belongs to keep progress in so far as it is capable of affecting affairs, in that direction and when no longer able to do it to get out and make way for better men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We wish to give credit where credit is necessary to our farmers. I met a deputation recently consisting of Deputy P.D. Lehane, Deputy Corry, Deputy Walsh and some four or five others from the Beet Growers' Association and I discussed the price of beet and other things with them.  Amongst the other things we were discussing were how best to increase the output of cereal production. I was emphasising to the deputation how vital it was to do that, and I think it was Deputy Corry who said: &ldquo;If you want to increase Ymer barley&mdash; you have guaranteed a minimum price, not a fixed price, of 16/- a cwt.&mdash;but if you want to do the thing rightly, make that more than 16/- and even though none of the barley is sold to you but is used by the farmers themselves, the knowledge that that increased price is ultimately there will encourage it.&rdquo; Very well.  I am a great believer in going half-way to meet somebody whom I believe in good faith and Deputy Corry, I confess, on a deputation, is a very different creature from Deputy Corry in the House.  He can be a rational man in a discussion then, but when he comes in here he is like a lepping lunatic.  I would like to say in public that, largely as a result of the discussion I had with that deputation, I have directed Grain Importers Limited to announce their preparedness to accept any quantity of Ymer barley grown by farmers, at the end of the harvest, at 20/-.  That is only the price of last resort.  I hope they will not be able to buy a barrel of it, that every farmer will use it for feeding <Col N="194" /> on his own holding.  But I want him to know that, if circumstances do not permit him to use it, he will have a means of getting rid of it for a cash price.</P>

I have learned the lesson well before this, that one might as well try to talk to Deputy Corry as a reasonable man in this House as go up and put one's finger in the cage of the chimpanzee in the Zoo.  I would like to give credit where credit is due, and certainly he was one of the members of the deputation who made that suggestion to me and, wisely or foolishly, I am prepared to adopt it, to try to give as much encouragement as I can to individual farmers to grow barley&mdash;not for sale, but for use on their own land.</P>

      <P>If, by any chance I should unwittingly stray outside the rules of order, I hope that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be forbearing and remember that I have nothing to guide me in the matter except the communication I received this afternoon from the Ceann Comhairle. Deputy Maguire put down a question on to-day's Order Paper asking the Taoiseach whether he was aware that at the recent Fine Gael Ard Fheis the Minister for Education made certain remarks which, in the view of the Deputy, seemed to be in conflict with the policy of the Government in so far as that policy was expressed by the Minister for External Affairs.  It is undoubtedly very difficult for members of the general public or for Deputies to know what is the policy of the Government in relation to any particular matter because they speak with so many voices, but, in any event, I assume we may take in that the Minister for External Affairs did speak for the Government as a whole and that when he spoke he carried with him the collective responsibility of the Government for the conduct of this country's relations with other States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of that question the Taoiseach gave a reply which I think I shall read in part, because the first part of the reply is not one to which I would take any exception.  Having stated that the Government had made its attitude quite clear regarding the <Col N="199" /> arrival of the Netherlands air unit to our territory in the Six Counties, the Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am also aware that the Minister for Education made a statement substantially to the effect indicated in the second part of the Deputy's question.  Whether it is proper or advisable for individuals or groups to take any action, on their own responsibility, by way of protest against the coming of the Netherlands air unit, is a matter of opinion and does not necessarily involve Government policy.  Lest there should be any misunderstanding on this point, however, I think it well to say that I personally agree with the Minister for Education in deprecating any such action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to address myself to the implications contained in the last two sentences I have read.  The Taoiseach said it was a matter of opinion and did not necessarily involve Government policy.  I think it does involve Government policy and that the Government ought at least to have made it clear what their general attitude was in relation to this question.</P>
    <P>We have agreements with other countries.  We have entered into a trade agreement with the Netherlands. Surely if other people outside, rightly or wrongly&mdash;and I am not criticising what has been done outside: what I am criticising is the attitude of the Government as expressed by the Taoiseach&mdash;as a matter of private policy, decide to try to nullify the Netherlands Trade Agreement, the Government has some responsibility in the matter, and it is not sufficient for the Taoiseach to wash his hands of this problem by saying, as he has said, that it does not necessarily involve Government policy.  If the Minister for External Affairs tries to knit the bonds between this country and the Netherlands closer by entering into trade agreements with them, by trying to establish good relations with them, surely the Minister for Justice has some responsibility for seeing that the efforts of the Minister for External Affairs are not going to be nullified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the big stick but about two members of the Government who are bound by the doctrine of collective responsibility which is written into our Constitution.  How does the Taoiseach reconcile the efforts of the Minister for External Affairs to do what he has been trying to do with, shall we say, the inaction or inertia of the Minister for Justice?  I ask that question not because I agree or disagree with what has been going on outside but because I hold very strongly that the Government of this country cannot be conducted in a proper manner unless the doctrine of collective responsibility is enforced.</P>
      <P>I go on from that to read the last sentence of the Taoiseach's reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Lest there should be any misunderstanding on this point, however, I think it well to say that I personally agree with the Minister for Education in deprecating any such action.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Taoiseach speaks as the head of the Government, and not as a mere independent unit in that Government or a mere independent unit in this House, when he speaks in this House as Taoiseach.  When the Taoiseach answered that question to-day he did not speak as Deputy Costello, he did not speak as plain Mr. John Costello: he spoke as head of the Government.  Are we to take it from what the Taoiseach has said that when he stated that he, personally, agreed with the Minister for Education, there were members of his Government who did not agree with the Minister for Education?  That, I suggest, is the only conclusion that can be drawn from the expressions used by the Taoiseach in his reply this afternoon.  Is the Government united in opinion with the Taoiseach in relation to this matter or are there members of the Government who disagree with the view?  If there are, then surely, in the circumstances of to-day&mdash;with grave crises confronting us, as they may, during the next few months&mdash;we ought to have a united Government and a Taoiseach who speaks here on a question, not for himself personally, but who is able to <Col N="201" /> speak for every member of his Cabinet and for those who sit behind him on the Government Benches and who give him a majority in this House.  Is that not the vital principle involved in this reply by the Taoiseach to-day?  I know, of course, that outside this House people are saying that we have no Government&mdash;that, as I said somewhere else, we have six Taoiseachs and no Government.  It is time that that were ended.  Ireland cannot face the perils of the future unless we have one Taoiseach and a united Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and also implies Government sanction of the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Education on that occasion.  Does the Taoiseach approve of the principle which permits a country, with a view to ensuring its own liberty, to violate the liberty and the territory of a hitherto friendly nation&mdash;because that is exactly what the Minister for Education's sentiments, to my view, implied? At least, that is my interpretation of his statement.  I admit and agree with the Taoiseach that the speech was capable of other inference.  Indeed, I am wondering if the Minister for Education on that occasion did know himself the import of what he was <Col N="202" /> saying.  The Taoiseach described my supplementary question to-day as an alleged supplementary question.  I do not agree that it was an alleged supplementary question: in fact, I think it was very pertinent to the main question. That was my only reason for asking the question at all.  If it is a thing that the Minister for Education, in expressing approval of the Dutch invasion of Derry, expressed the opinion of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee came in this afternoon bubbling over like a naughty schoolboy, determined at all costs to have himself heard and to get himself into the newspapers to-morrow.  He was oppressed by the two months' silence that had been enforced upon him.  Listening to him to-night, you would think that he was fired with indignation at the breach of the highest principles, constitutional or otherwise, that he had witnessed to-day in the Dáil when I was answering questions.  I deduce from what he says, not so much expressly as by inference, that something extraordinary has happened in the last few weeks in connection with the conduct of certain people, the boycott of Dutch goods and things of that kind, which are breaches of the law.  He brings in his old friend, the doctrine of collective responsibility.  If Deputy MacEntee was so worried about all this matter, so desirous that the Minister for Justice should uphold the law, and so anxious that the present Government should in every way adhere to the doctrine of collective responsibility, it seems rather extraordinary that he did not put down the question himself but that he should have muscled in, so to speak, upon his colleague's question by way of supplementary, without leaving it to Deputy Maguire to deal <Col N="203" /> with his own supplementary questions.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat amusing to note the difference in attitude between Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Maguire in connection with the subject-matter that is raised in this question, because Deputy MacEntee&mdash;we infer from his reference to the Minister for Justice&mdash;thinks that the Dutch boycott is against the law, whereas Deputy Maguire thinks that we are, or that my colleague, the Minister for Education, was condoning what he, in my opinion very insufferably in this House, calls &ldquo;the Dutch invasion of our country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have to give Deputy MacEntee disappointing intelligence. Contrary to what he alleges, we are a most united Government, fully conscious of the doctrine of collective responsibility and entirely aware that when Government policy is in issue we speak with one voice.  The Minister for External Affairs spoke Government policy in reference to this matter of the Dutch visit to the six north eastern counties when he gave his statement to the Press on 8th January, 1951.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee knows full well that every proper step was taken, in strict accordance with diplomatic practice, to make our protest known in connection with this matter.  The Minister also took occasion to make it clear to the Dutch Government and the Dutch people that we had for that Government and people nothing but highest esteem and affectionate regard.  That statement expressed our attitude towards the Dutch Government and the Dutch people.  We sympathise with them in the difficulty that they were placed in by the British Government in connection with all this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither Deputy Maguire nor Deputy MacEntee, apparently, understands the difference between what is Government policy, for which there is collective responsibility, and matters which are in no way Government responsibility or in reference to which <Col N="204" /> in no way the doctrine of collective responsibility emerges or arises at all.</P>
    <P>I made it clear to-day, in answering the question, that I approve of what my colleague, the Minister for Education, had said at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis, because I anticipated that had I not done so it would have been said, when I did not make it clear in answer to the question, that I had not the courage to come out and say that what my colleague was saying at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis was my view as well as his.  It is my view as well as his. It is a mere matter of personal opinion on a matter that is not Government policy.</P>
    <P>I asked myself, when I heard Deputy MacEntee referring to the Minister for Justice, where is the breach of law that we ignored?  He did not deign to tell this House to what he was referring, merely threw out some suggestion of that kind without making any definite charge against any single individual in this State, whether they were connected with the Dutch boycott or the pickets, or anything else.  This Government has stood and will stand for the enforcement of the law.  Equally, it stands for the liberty of the citizen of this country and, if Deputy MacEntee will ask any lawyer of his acquaintance, he will be told that any persons may gather together and agree together to do a lawful act in a lawful way and that is not Government policy. If a number of people, however misguided we may think them to be, agree together to boycott Dutch tomatoes or to try to prevent the entry into this country of much needed fertilisers from Holland, they have a legal right to do it, provided they carry out their agreement by legal means, in accordance with legal methods.</P>
    <P>Where does Deputy MacEntee say there has been any breach of the law by any of these people?  I disapprove, personally, of their action, which appears to me to be in accordance with the law.  There is no question of Government policy involved in that.  We have made it clear that we have, as Deputy MacEntee has pointed out, a trade agreement with Holland and, as the Minister for External Affairs made <Col N="205" /> abundantly clear in his statement to the Press on this matter on 8th January, that we have nothing for the Government and the people of the Netherlands but the highest esteem and affectionate regard.</P>
    <P>I express my personal view again here to-night, that it is something which cuts across our affection and esteem and regard for the Dutch people when our own citizens, even though they are acting in accordance with legal right, decide upon a boycott of Dutch goods.  I think that that is not proper, however legal it may be, but that is not a matter of Government policy not can it be a matter in which the Government can intervene except there is a breach of the law and, if there is a breach of the law, then we will intervene.</P>
    <P>I would like to teach Deputy MacEntee some little matters about the doctrine of collective responsibility, which he likes to roll trippingly off his tongue so frequently in this House&mdash; the difference between what is Government policy and what is a matter that is not necessarily Government policy but which may in certain circumstances become a matter of Government policy.  If this matter of the Dutch boycott ever does become a <Col N="206" /> matter within the ambit of Government policy, then we will deal with it as a unified Government and as a united Government, as we have done in every case and every aspect of policy that has come before this House.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy again.  When he brings forth again the taunt that is so frequently on his lips and on the lips of other people, and which has been in the <i>Irish Press</i> from time to time by Dáil Reporter about five, six, seven or 13 Taoiseachs, if you like, that may be his taunt, but the fact is that we have lasted now for three years, when he and his colleagues said we would last only for three months.  We have brought great benefit to this country and I can repeat here what I have said frequently in the last four or five weeks, reviewing the disturbed conditions of the world and the miseries that are being suffered by so many peoples throughout the world, that this country, under the auspices of this Government during the last three years, is now, relatively speaking, the best off and happiest country in the world.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 15th February.</P>
