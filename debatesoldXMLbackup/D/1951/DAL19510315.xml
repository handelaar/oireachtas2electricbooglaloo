    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in order to ensure that only good class dry fuel is distributed to old age and blind pensioners, unemployed and others who benefit under the free and cheap fuel schemes, he will take steps to have such fuel protected from the elements by the roofing over of all fuel depots by the authorities administering the scheme and, further, if he will have the selling of wet turf and wet wood blocks made an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cheap fuel schemes are operated by the local authorities and any question in regard to the protection of the fuel from inclement weather is primarily a matter for them.  The Dublin Board of Assistance is being asked to take all possible steps to protect the turf from inclement weather.</P>
      <P>If the latter part of the Deputy's question relates to the sale of fuel in the ordinary course of business by private firms or individuals, the position is that I have no function in the matter.  Turf issued under the fuel scheme is issued free or at a fraction of the cost and the best turf available is supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if ten tons of turf are brought into a depôt dry and are then left out for a night in the rain they are 11 tons the next day with the added water?  That is the certificate which I have got.  I ask the Minister is it fair that people should be given turf with 40 per cent., 50 per cent. and 60 per cent. added water due to moisture content.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Deputy would convey the technical knowledge about the expansion qualities of turf to the local authority concerned in this matter.  It is the local authority that gets the fuel and is responsible for protecting it.  There is no reason why ten tons of turf should become 11 tons by exposure if the local authority would cover the fuel.  The Deputy is really in the wrong street by addressing this question to me.  The body responsible is the local authority concerned.  I have already suggested that the Deputy might tender his technical advice in this matter to the local authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to help in the matter and with his approval and maybe with his instructions it will be seen to.</P>

      <P>The grant of established status to foresters is bound up with consideration of the grant of similar status to unestablished officers generally in the Civil Service, and the whole matter is the subject of actuarial investigation by the Department of Finance.  Pending completion of this investigation, I am advised that the claims of any individual group of officers, such as foresters, cannot receive priority from the Minister for Finance, who is the governing authority in superannuation matters.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether his Department has received offers of waste land for planting from farmers in the districts alongside the Dungarvan to Youghal main road; whether they have been accepted, and, if not, whether they are likely to be accepted and the areas planted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is aware that in recent years the forestry division acquired two blocks <Col N="2018" /> totalling 330 acres approximately at Monameen and Reangullee along this road.  Two further blocks of seven acres and 20 acres are likely to be acquired in the near future and a survey of the Reangullee district will be made shortly to ascertain if any other areas are available.  It would be very helpful if the Deputy could supply me with the names and addresses of owners who are willing to sell.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Forestry Division has successfully concluded negotiations for the purchase of 377 acres near Beeing and 295 acres at Ballyhilloge and Ballyknockane near Burnfort. Title investigations are still proceeding for all of the Beeing areas and possession of the lands will be taken when title has been cleared and the sales closed.  Possession has been taken or is about to be taken of 171 of the 295 acres at Ballyhilloge and a new forest centre is being started there.  The title investigations for the remaining area of 124 acres are still proceeding.</P>
      <P>Negotiations for the purchase of a further block of 190 acres offered by seven tenants in the Beeing area will be opened shortly.</P>
      <P>Pre-planting operations will, I hope, commence shortly so that planting can be undertaken next winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>The consistent practice over a long number of years has been not to make the scripts of broadcasting news bulletins available outside the broadcasting service.  I do not see any reason for a modification of that practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there has been great dissatisfaction in regard to the manner in which news items are distorted and in some cases suppressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a different question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this, would he give Deputies an opportunity of reviewing these bulletins, particularly in regard to the incidents at Baltinglass Post Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member of the Dáil cannot, when a bulletin has been broadcast, examine it and then proceed to analyse it with a view to setting himself up as censor as to what kind of news should or should not go over the wireless.  No directions as to the news to be transmitted is given by the Minister.  The news service is perfectly free and independent.  If, however, Deputies have any remarks or criticism to offer, an opportunity is provided on the Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting to enable Deputies to raise the matter, but even then the matter can never be fruitfully discussed if Deputies indulge in generalities and do not specify particular complaints.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not meet the case if the Minister put on the file in the Dáil Library a copy of the news bulletin each day so that the information would be available to Deputies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter had been considered by both the last Government and the present Government and, <Col N="2020" /> though they approached it from different angles, they arrived at the same conclusion.  I might mention that, prior to 1927, copies of the bulletin were deposited in the Library. That practice continued for years, and so little interest was taken in them that nobody thought fit to call attention to the fact when the bulletins were no longer deposited there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister inquire into the news bulletin concerning the Baltinglass situation, because that is the specific complaint made by Deputy Cogan as an alternative to putting the bulletins in the Dáil Library in regard to which I see certain difficulties arising?  Would he inquire specially into this specific case in order to satisfy Deputies that there was no partiality shown in giving out the news?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will consider the installation of a public telephone at Knockraha Post Office, County Cork, as one is urgently required in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Department to install a telephone in every post office.  As there are still about 700 post offices to be dealt with &mdash;most of them in remote areas&mdash;the work will have to be spread over a number of years.  So that the best progress may be made, the order in which call offices are installed is determined mainly on engineering considerations.</P>
      <P>Knockraha is not one of the call offices included in the programme for the coming year which was announced in reply to a question put yesterday by Deputy Spring.  It is not, I regret, possible to say when a call office will be provided there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that answer any different from an answer to a question of a similar nature yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies insist on putting down the one question, obviously they have to get the one <Col N="2021" /> answer.  Yesterday, in reply to a question put by Deputy Spring, who asked what was the programme of new call office installations in County Kerry, I gave a list of the call offices which would be erected in the next 12 months.  I did that, hoping that Deputies would take note of the programme and if they did not see an office on the list in which they were interested, they would realise that it would not be provided in the next year.  I had also hoped that they would bear that in mind and that they would not continue to ask questions about offices which they knew would not be undertaken within the last 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he will consider the provision of a second trunk line to Castlelyons Post Office, Fermoy, as there is considerable delay in obtaining telephone calls to outside areas at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay to calls from Castlelyons is due to insufficiency of trunk lines between Fermoy and Rathcormac (with which Castlelyons is connected) and between Fermoy and Cork. It is hoped to provide additional lines on both routes within the next few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Lime is of great importance to all farmers.  As has been announced <Col N="2028" /> in the Press, a new scheme is now in operation under which any farmer will be able to have ground limestone delivered in six-ton lots to his premises, or as near as possible thereto, at a price not exceeding 16/- per ton.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, as I have already stated recently in this House, I am not prepared to approve the continuance by committees of agriculture of a scheme for subsidising the distribution of burned lime.

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the practice in Kerry, and particularly in the congested areas, to utilise burned lime, and that heretofore a substantial subsidy was allowed in respect of that burned lime?  A lesser subsidy was given last year, and I make this representation now with a view to having that subsidy restored in respect of burned lime, because in these areas the people are not anxious to avail of the ground limestone scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that last year we made special provision for applicants in the remoter areas of Kerry in respect of the subsidy payable for burned lime, but allowing for the maximum subsidy allowable on burned lime, the lime delivered costs substantially more than will the lime under this scheme which brings the lime to their doors, no matter how remote their place of residence may be. I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that, whatever understandable prejudice may exist, it would be wrong of the Department of Agriculture to persuade people in West Kerry to spend money on burned lime, when in fact they get better agricultural value out of the ground limestone delivered to their homes at 16/- per ton.</P>

      <P>I understand that four trial borings have been made out of the total of 13.  The consulting engineer to the Cork County Council has submitted a report to that body on the progress made; it is primarily for the county council to consider that report and decide whether any action on their part is necessary to expedite the work.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate at this stage when construction of the bridge is likely to commence.  The Cork County Council have been asked to submit a preliminary report on various matters which require to be investigated before a local inquiry could be held, and the borings are being carried out as part of these investigations.  The local inquiry is an essential legal preliminary to the making of a bridge order.</P>

I would not be prepared to give a direct opinion at this stage until the opinion of the Cork County Council is sought. I am informed that the contract provides for a period of six months.  Five months of that period have elapsed, and only four borings out of 13 have been carried out.  I propose to get in touch with the Cork County Council to see what plans they have to speed up these borings and complete the other nine.  When the borings have been completed, it will then be possible to have the local inquiry held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was quoting an extract from the speech made by the Minister on Thursday last.  It was in connection with the Minister's explanation of sub-head M (9)&mdash;Potato Reserve Scheme.  I shall continue the quotation which I was reading last night.  It will be found at columns 1636 and 1637 of the Official Report, Volume 124, No. 10. The Minister continued:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereupon, the lorries began to roll and the scarce potatoes, the nonexistent potatoes, began to arrive from the famine-stricken areas where <Col N="2046" /> men and beasts were dying from want of food, by night, and were hawked around the greengrocers of Dublin at any price they would fetch.  If I am not mistaken, some fingers were burned in the transaction.  I must say that I never smelt burning substance with greater joy.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: Would the Minister say how he came to lose this amount of money?</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Because I broke the market.  I had to bring in the potatoes to break the market, and the measure of my success was the loss I made, because the gangsters held me up when I went to get potatoes, but, when I got the potatoes, I held them up, and the holding I did was much longer than the holding they did.  I saved the citizens of this city, by the outlay of £5,000, probably £100,000.  The only difference was that that £5,000 went into the pockets of relatively honest potato growers, whereas the £100,000 would have gone into the pockets of the racketeers who thought they could get away with murder but learned, by night, that they could not.  I can assure the Deputy that if I lost £5,000, the racketeers lost 20 times as much, and I know that it will console him to know that the public were saved that exploitation by the expenditure of so modest a sum and he will be further consoled to know that the racketeers who sought to rob their neighbours were so sternly punished by the outlay of so modest a sum of public money, so prudently employed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My principal reason for referring to that particular part of the Minister's speech was for the purpose of indicating that, contrary to what Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dunne had to say in his defence last night, the Minister is capable of using all types of terms to describe people who are not in a position to defend themselves in this House&mdash;as will be seen from this extract of his speech.  I think we can infer that the &ldquo;gangsters and racketeers&rdquo; to whom he refers were principally Donegal people.  I objected <Col N="2047" /> to that when I heard it in the House and I now make an emphatic protest about it.  Is it not a fact that not only did the potatoes come in at that time from Donegal but that they came in from other parts of the country, too? Is it not a fact that not only did Donegal truck owners bring in potatoes at that time, but that trucks were scurrying from Dublin to Donegal trying to collect any potatoes they could collect and at any price?  Is it not also a fact that this sum of £5,000 which we have to pay in respect of the scarcity at that time is purely to cover up the Minister's incompetence in dealing with the export market earlier in the year when he over-sold our potato stocks and left us in the same position as that in which he has left us recently in regard to Irish butter when we were without our full supply?</P>
    <P>I want to apologise for misleading the House in regard to a certain matter last night.  I said that the Minister referred some time ago to Deputy Cogan as a &ldquo;scalded cat.&rdquo;  He referred to Deputy Corry as a &ldquo;scalded cat.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He used other terms at that time in reference to Deputy Cogan which were not meant to be complimentary to the Deputy.  We have come to know the Minister, apart from his incompetence and irresponsibility, for his mud-slinging tactics in this House and outside, if for nothing else.  A loss of £5,000, under sub-head M (9), was incurred as a result of the Minister's over-sale of our potatoes.  As a result, he had to try to buy potatoes elsewhere to import into this country or to import into Britain in lieu of the contracted amount which we were to supply to those people. That is in keeping with the Minister's more recent effort in salesmanship, and it is surprising that a man who in his private capacity has apparently done quite well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is unable when it comes to making a sale on behalf of the Government and the country to do so without incurring a financial loss and not only a financial loss but also severe hardship on our people by leaving us short of potatoes a year ago and short of butter more recently. It was pointed out in this House&mdash;and I believe it to be a plausible explanation&mdash;that the reason our butter was sold some time ago was to give us the idea that there was an over-supply of that commodity so as to keep down the price of milk and to bluff the farmers into the idea that, when there was an over-supply, they need not look for an increase, irrespective of the merit of that increase.</P>
      <P>While the sale of our butter was objectionable, a more objectionable feature came to light more recently when we found that butter being replaced by Danish butter and later by New Zealand butter.  I am absolutely amazed at Deputies on the Government side of the House, particularly those representing Dublin City who, by their silence on this question, apparently agree with the Minister's statement a short time ago that the quality of that butter could not be beaten.  I heard the comment on that statement that undoubtedly that butter could not be beaten, as we say in the country, with a big stick. The fact of the matter is that the Danish butter supplied to us in Dublin a short time ago was not fit for human consumption.</P>

If, due to his irresponsibility, he sees fit to do certain things with which we totally disagree, which cause grave and severe hardship to our people and injure our agricultural community as a whole, we should remember that in the last analysis it is the Government of the day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Honest to God, a man's patience would get exhausted.  I very rarely speak in the House, but my patience has become exhausted during the last two days listening to the speeches of the people on the far side of the House.  What has taken me to my feet, really, is to compliment Deputy Cowan on the speech he made last night and to endorse every word he said.  He spoke the truth fairly and honestly as a man, as he said himself, having an interest in neither one side nor the other.  He is neither a farmer nor a great severe critic of agriculture, but he knows the difference.  The people on the far side of the House should not waste public time, public money and public patience on expressing their attitude towards the Minister. The Minister's policy is a sound one, a sensible one, a policy that has produced results.  Can we have better proof than facts and figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we not the facts before us? Has not bacon production gone up, has not butter and milk production gone up?  When were the farmers of Ireland ever as prosperous as they are to-day?  Not in my lifetime have I known such a spirit of contentment amongst the farming community as during the last three years.  When there is talk about improvident purchases <Col N="2052" /> and sales, do we forget the improvident purchase of wheat by Fianna Fáil on the eve of the 1948 election?</P>

Do we remember the improvident purchase made on the eve of the General Election in 1948, when the country lost millions of money?  There is talk about the Minister being hostile to wheat.  Has he done anything else but encourage the farmers to grow wheat?  Has he prevented the farmers from doing so?  He is not coercing them.  Thanks be to God, the day of the coercion of the farmers has ended. I stand up as a farmers' representative to compliment the Minister on every action and every step he has taken to put the farmers in the proud place they now occupy, of being the happiest, most prosperous and most contented people in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would add my voice to that of other Deputies who have appealed to the Minister to consider seriously the claims submitted legitimately by milk producers for an increase in price, on the grounds that the cost of production has increased considerably since the price of milk was fixed in 1947.  Amongst the items which have not been and which cannot be challenged are the following: Rates have increased considerably, wages have increased and so has insurance, the cost of implements, fertilisers and seeds has gone up; and, later, bran and pollard have jumped from 14/- to 36/- a cwt.  These enter into the cost of the production and, therefore, the Minister should consider seriously the reasonable claim put forward by the producers of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of wheat, I would appeal to the Minister to forget his prejudices.  We are importing wheat at present at a cost of approximately £4 per barrel.  Surely it would not be unreasonable to expect that the producer would get the world market price. If that is not done, the farmer instead <Col N="2053" /> of getting the subsidy about which he hears so much, is actually subsidising the cost of living by the difference between the world market price and what the farmer is getting.  With the advance in the cost of production, when every other section of the community has applied and been granted increases in salary, wages and other sources of remuneration, one section alone should not be singled out and kept bound to the prices fixed four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>In the minds of certain people, of which I suppose the Minister might be regarded as the leader, there seems to be a prejudice against the growing of wheat.  I should like to quote, if I might do so, for the information of the Minister, the opinion of one of the most progressive farmers in Ireland, Mr. Robert McCulloch.  Writing in <i>Agricultural Ireland</i> in June, 1947, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will surprise many farmers to know that a wheat crop makes no greater demands on the soil as regards nutrients than a crop of oats, as regards phosphates and potash, but wheat does demand more nitrogen and will not yield without it.  In practice, wheat is the only cereal suitable for sowing when a properly managed wild white pasture is ploughed up.  Oats or barley will certainly lodge.</P>
    <P>If our farmers as a whole understood the care and management of wild white pastures, it would not be necessary for us to import any wheat at all.  Further, economy yields of &lsquo;Yeoman&rsquo;wheat would be possible, so that the loaf made from home grown wheat would compare favourably with the loaf made from Manitoba No. 1 mixed with our ordinary Irish varieties, which are all so-called weak wheats.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote the opinion of that man, who may be regarded as an expert in his line, showing that a man who has practical experience held a view directly contrary to that so frequently expressed by the Minister.  If the Minister is wise, he would forget his <Col N="2054" /> prejudices and encourage the people to produce more wheat, to produce everything they possibly can, so as to avoid a situation in which we have to subsidise the importation of foreign wheat and foreign butter.</P>

      <P>To deal with the specific matters raised, I have always admired the brazen-faced audacity of Fianna Fáil.  They have rigidly cloven to the policy that if you give a good lie a good start no one can ever catch up on you. I have been upbraided for miscalculating the capacity of our people to consume butter.  I made a mistake in underestimating the capacity of our people in the year 1950 to buy, pay for and consume 745,307 cwt. of butter.  I made that mistake because in trying to form an intelligent estimate of what our likely consumption was to be.  I referred back to the previous years in which butter production had reached the level that it reached in 1950.  That brought me back to the years 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938.  I think the Dáil will hear with open-eyed amazement the situation that then obtained and which Fianna Fáil has the effrontery to compare favourably with the mistake I made in 1950.  In 1934, we produced 769,293 cwt. of butter.</P>

In 1938 we exported 327,636 cwt. of butter.  The British paid us 118/- and we gave them 19/11 to eat it.  Instead of paying the British 82/10 per cwt. to eat butter at 52/10, giving them the butter at 30/- for taking it, am I blameworthy for leaving it here in Ireland for our own people to eat and, as our own people eat more than I anticipated, bringing in more so that they would not go short?

      <P>Making the mistake of believing that our people would not be able to buy and consume 575,307 cwt. of butter, I shipped some abroad in the autumn.  I discovered in the spring that our people were better off than I anticipated.  I could have cut the ration or I could buy butter.  I bought butter and they ate it.  I have no apology to make for that to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deprecate most strongly the statement in this House that Danish butter brought into this country was unfit for human consumption.  That statement is not true.  That statement is made by irresponsible individuals who are <Col N="2057" /> not considering the significance of the words they use and who by their own neighbours are regarded as unreliable and unimportant persons.  Lest word should go forth that this Parliament was guilty of gross and unforgivable discourtesy to the Danish people by describing their exports as being unfit for human consumption, I want to say, with the full authority of the Department of Agriculture behind me, that the Danish butter was of excellent quality, that no reasonable person could fault it on the ground of quality, but, as our Danish neighbours will fully understand, their process of butter-making differing slightly from ours, some people found the flavour and texture of Danish butter strange, and for that reason had difficulty in adapting themselves to it.</P>
    <P>There are three processes for manufacturing butter, one employed in Ireland, one in Denmark and another in New Zealand.  Those accustomed to the product of any one of these processes find a certain strangeness in the product of the other two.  Certainly, no responsible persons in this country will ever lend their names to the disgraceful allegation that the butter of New Zealand or Denmark is unfit for human consumption.  They find themselves glad to acknowledge its excellent quality, in the assurance that both Denmark and New Zealand have, not infrequently, paid tribute to the quality of our own butter, which is in every respect equal to the Danish and New Zealand product, but which we have no valid right to claim is in any sense superior.</P>

      <P>The next point is one to which people have returned repeatedly, and that is the cost of milk and the price properly payable for creamery milk.  There is not the least use in any Minister for Agriculture turning his back to facts.  One of my predecessors, Deputy Dr. Ryan, in the Square at Ennis, said shortly before the 1939-45 war, that in his considered judgment the dairy industry of this country, as <Col N="2058" /> an exporting industry, was finished for all time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not hold with that view, but I am prepared to say that unless we face the task, which we are eminently well equipped to discharge if we want to, of making the dairying industry here highly efficient, there is not the least use our attempting to compete with the highly efficient dairying industries of other countries.  If we are prepared to do what, in my opinion, we are well able to do, Ireland is so situated and circumstanced that we can produce butter the equal of any butter in the world and in competition with any other producer whencesoever he comes.  But if we have to produce milk for conversion into butter for sale in the markets of the world, I suggest to the House that there are certain fundamentals which must be accepted. One is that the milk must be produced from growing grass; that the cattle must be in large measure sustained during the winter from grass silage or other ensiled green crops and the produce of the land of the farmer to whom the herd belongs; and that in the cow byre and in the creamery every device designed to reduce the cost of production must be available to the farmer and scrupulously employed by him and the creamery manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a single one of these <i>desiderata</i> which cannot be attained to-morrow morning, but there remains this consideration: if Dáil Éireann wants to build a creamery industry on the 300 gallon cow they may make up their minds to the fact that they will be subsidising the butter industry for evermore.  Our aim, indeed, should be to attain a minimum 400 gallon cow and an optimum 800 gallon cow in the mercantile herd and I am certain that we must ultimately raise the minimum to 500 gallons.  I do not want to press on the dairy farmers here a maximum in excess of 800 gallons.  I believe the 1,000 and the 1,200 gallon cow may be a very desirable beast to have in the pedigree herd from which one is breeding pedigree stock in order to improve the general level all over the country; but, for the mercantile herd, <Col N="2059" /> the 800 gallon cow is probably the most economic bearing in mind the extra feeding the 900, 1,000, 1,100 and 1,200 must get if she is to maintain her health and continue to produce when reaching this very much higher bracket.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that caterwauling about our deplorable circumstances helps anyone.  I believe the proper course is to find out what we must do and go and do it.  There is no farmer here who, if he has six cows or 100 cows, cannot install the most modern milking machine money will buy to-morrow morning and pay for it out of his creamery cheque as he goes along.  There is no farmer here need have a bad cow byre.  He will get a handsome grant to build a new one; he will get an ample loan repayable over 15 years and he can arrange with the creamery manager to pay the instalments out of his milk cheque as he delivers his milk to the creamery. There is no creamery need stand one day unequipped with the best that money can buy.  All the creamery has to do is to formulate its scheme, satisfy the Agricultural Credit Corporation that reliable authority is on its side for the proposed reforms and the money will be in its hands the following morning, to be paid back over ten, 20 or 30 years in so far as circumstances will allow.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to the cow.  Admittedly we cannot metamorphose all the cows of the country overnight, but we are starting in East Limerick and West Tipperary, I hope on Monday week, with this proposal to every farmer: show us your uneconomic cow, we will buy her, and we will give you the cash value into your hand to go and use your own judgment on the fair green to buy a replacement, or go up to the Department's farms and there are there 800 inseminated heifers, inseminated from a 2,000 guinea bull; they have been tested for tuberculosis and inoculated against contagious abortion; take your pick of any beast you like; and, next year, if you find yourselves in the same plight with uneconomic cows, ask us to come back and we will take them out again and make you the same offer.</P>

      <P>The uneconomic cow yields a very substantial proportion of eminently saleable beef.  The fact that she will not give enough milk to justify her existence in the herd is very often an indication that she is too beefy.  If the farmer gives her to the cannery and they bone her and roll her up and send her out as the best of good cow beef, or put her in a can, very often she makes the full price of the heifer. Now, is that a mistaken policy?  If there is anything any Deputy can suggest to me that will help further to expedite the establishment generally of the 400 to the 800-gallon cow, ultimately the 500 to the 800-gallon cow, that will help to improve the methods available to the farmer, or help to cut down the cost on the farm or in the creamery, will he tell me what it is, because I want to implement all the recommendations I can, if resources will permit, and I see no reason whatsoever to apprehend that anything necessary to be done will overtax the resources at our disposal at the present time.</P>

      <P>It may seem indelicate to dwell unduly on these technical matters, but if one finds a bull which begets heifers that show a bigger milk yield than their dam, there is some advantage in inseminating 1,500 cows per annum from that bull instead of allowing him naturally to inseminate 80.  It is not a rapid process.  It takes years to get the full results, but it is progress in the right direction.  As Deputy Ó Briain knows, Kerry will be covered shortly with insemination centres.  I hope that Limerick will, Tipperary, Cork, the Dublin milk supply area, Cavan, North Leitrim and East Sligo. It is not bad cracking for 12 months.</P>

      <P>I will stay with the people who consider it my duty to be with them continually, helping the individual farmer to weed out the lowyielding milch cow, not to his detriment or loss, because circumstances, temporarily, in any event, I believe, make it possible for us to dispose of healthy but inadequately milking cattle on the manufacturing beef market at prices which enable us to make a good stab at the replacing of cattle which will yield far better in time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often warned farmers to walk warily in the matter of costings.  I have repeatedly expressed in this House a <Col N="2062" /> profound reluctance to bind myself in anticipation in respect of farm costings. The fact is that costings were done at the request of a group of Cork farmers by one of the best authorities in this country on agricultural costings.  He divided the year into two halves, the summer half from May to October and the winter half from October to May. No sane man can attempt to produce creamery milk for conversion into butter from October to May.  From May to October, while you have the growing grass, is the period when you should make butter.  October to May is the period when you should have it in the cold store and sell it out as the demand occurs.</P>
    <P>The costings in that connection, dealing with the cow, the average yield of which, between May and October, was 260 gallons and from November to April, 258 gallons, giving an annual milk yield of 518 gallons, were reckoned at 8.36d. per gallon in 1947, gross.  Note the word &ldquo;gross&rdquo;, because in the cost account it was then requisite to deduct from the gross cost the yield that the farmer secured by selling the dropped calf, and the manure of the cow, which he used in the improvement of his land. In 1947, the average price of a dropped calf in February, March and April, when most calves are born, certainly in the category of dropped calves for sale, was £2 1s. 6d., £1 16s. 6d. and £1 17s. 9d. respectively.  In the year 1950, for the same months, the same calves realised £6 5s. 6d., £6 4s. 0d. and £6 9s. 6d.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The three months, February, March and April, which are the three months in which ordinarily the dairy farmers' calves are born.  Allow, according to the argument of the people who urge that a higher price for milk should be made available, that the cost of producing a gallon of milk has gone up materially&mdash;and I am taking the figures roughly.  Allow that the costs have gone up from 8.10d. to 13d.; allow that they have gone up by 50 per cent. to 12d., and deduct the price of the calf, which Professor Murphy valued at <Col N="2063" /> £1 for the purpose of his costings.  I think he deducted. 98d. for the calf and the manure.  Allow 4½d. as being the value per gallon of the farmyard manure and the calf to-day, and add to that costing 1½d. per gallon for delivery to the creamery.  I doubt if it would be easy to establish that the net cost of producing a gallon of milk to-day is substantially higher than it was three years ago.</P>
      <P>Bear in mind that the grass has been materially improved and bear in mind that the land is considerably improved. I know that people will make references to the rates, but do not forget that three-fifths of the rates are remitted.  That amount is paid through the agricultural grant and, therefore, if the rates go up by 1/- they only go up by 1/- on two-fifths of the farmer's valuation in so far as the agricultural land is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I must confess to the Dáil that this is what irritates me.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he is defending the interests of trade and industry, will find on every side of the House those interested in trade and industry vigorously backing him up and he is never pressed to the point of making the case that trade and industry are charging too much or have too high a protection.  On the contrary, all who are concerned with trade and industry of that character are up in arms to say, whatever Party they belong to, that at any rate they are glad to see what he is doing for them all.  If there is a matter relating to social services, the Leader of the Labour Party is guaranteed not condemnation for failure but because he is not doing enough.  Why is it that the Minister for Agriculture is pushed into a position by Deputies representing the agricultural industry in this House of making a case against the farmers?  Why is it that Deputies representing farmers think it is good policy to gang up on the Minister for, Agriculture to press him to the point of making the case against the farmers? I think that is a deplorable and obscurantist attitude.  The farmers of this country are not highly organised. Traditionally they have been passionately <Col N="2064" /> loyal to their respective political Parties.  Time and again it has been sought to organise them on a vocational or occupational basis and time and again they have broken away. For that I have the greatest sympathy. That is the tradition they were reared in.  They never put their pockets nor their own interests in front of their traditional loyalty to a political Party.</P>
    <P>I remember, during the economic war, farmers in rural Ireland having their attention drawn to the fact that they were selling the cattle for half nothing and they said that if they had to sell them for half again they would vote for de Valera in the morning. That is a sentiment for which I have the profoundest sympathy.  Why is it that that quality in our people is exploited by Deputies represented in this House to their detriment when the other organised vested interests in this country are prepared to desert leaders, country and everything else provided their pocket is not at issue and only the farmer is victimised when it comes to the last pinch and it is his own pocket or the political faith that he has publicly avowed?  It is the leader to whom he pledges his loyalty who prevails in this case.</P>
    <P>I would urge Deputies in this House, whatever their animadversions may be on the individual who may for the time being be Minister for Agriculture to try and emulate the example of those whom they are elected to represent in this House and lay aside their personal prejudice at least when the interests of the agricultural community are under discussion and, instead of literally forcing the Minister for Agriculture for the time being to argue the case against the farmer, to get round him and give him a hand to make the relative position of the farmers of this country equal or, perhaps, a little superior to other sections of the community all of which ultimately depend upon the farmers and on the land they live on for their living wherever they may happen to work.</P>

      <P>A decent man but when I came into office the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society was the organising authority of the co-operative movement. As Deputy Ó Briain well knows, attempts have been made repeatedly to <Col N="2066" /> oust the co-operative movement from the exclusive operation of the dairy industry.  It has been the policy of Oireachtas Eireann to commit the dairy industry exclusively to the co-operative movement to supply creamery milk to a creamery for conversion into butter. You must be a member of the co-operative with a right to vote in the committee.  The committee of the creameries send up representatives who control the I.A.O.S. and they operate the organisation here.  If the chairman and secretary think it necessary to come and see me they are heartily welcome. If it is thought desirable that a delegation should come to see me arrangements will be made to meet them.  I have not the slightest doubt that the new organisation to which the Deputy refers have in mind two things. one, to smash up and grab control itself and the other is to make a wider bid to get a lot of decent men who trade about their loyalties to the farming industry to join in an organisation which will be made to appear in public as bitterly antagonistic to the present Government.  It is an interesting thing that although I know Deputies are as solicitous about the farmers and are anxious and more anxious than I am about the price of milk, there has been very little talk about the recent association from this side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody from Fianna Fáil will get up and say: &ldquo;Are you going to meet the creamery milk suppliers?&rdquo; They are not a bit interested when I say I am going to meet the I.A.O.S. to-morrow morning and that we are going to have a full discussion. They say: &ldquo;We don't care about that, are you going to meet the new association?&rdquo; The answer is: &ldquo;I am not; I would not be seen dead with them, I do not believe it is a genuine body concerned with the best interests of the creamery industry.&rdquo;  I am going to meet the I.A.O.S., a deputation of their choosing. I shall meet them as often as they <Col N="2067" /> want me to meet them and I shall discuss any topic they want me to discuss with them because I believe they represent the real milk suppliers of the creameries of this country.  When they cease to represent them, they will disappear and make way for some other body that will do their job and I shall meet them, but I am not going to meet a jumped-up body, the sources of which I know too blooming well, which wants to supplant a body that has done its work, so far as I know, conscientiously and well for the last 50 years. If Deputies on the far side want me to repudiate the chairman, secretary and the executive of the I.A.O.S., and throw them overboard in order to supplant them with the tulips who are stumping round the country collecting money to run their great publicity campaign, my answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If they do not like that, let them take their £30,000 and plaster it where they want. I am not a bit scared and their names will be forgotten very shortly after the £30,000 is gone.  They would be a damn sight better employed raising £30,000 for doing useful work, instead of announcing their intention to run a publicity campaign calculated to supplant Fr. Coyne and Harry Kennedy with Fletcher and the rest of them.</P>
    <P>Let me come now peacefully to wheat.  My advice to every farmer in this country is to grow more of every cereal crop his land is capable of producing, to grow more of every other tillage crop from which he can get for himself, his wife and family, a good profit, always provided that he leaves his land a little better in the autumn than he found it in the spring.  I solemnly warn every farmer in this country that every acre he is in a position to cultivate this year under cereal crops it is his solemn duty to cultivate.  I now announce that if the farmers of this country are not prepared to do voluntarily better than compulsion can ever make them do, once they are fully seized with the gravity of the situation, I shall cheerfully get out of office and make way for somebody who will approach them with a whip to flog them into doing <Col N="2068" /> that which intelligent request failed to persuade them to do.  If the farmers in this country have to be flogged into doing their work, as Fianna Fáil apparently thinks necessary, I am not fit to be Minister for Agriculture and I shall get out and make way for another man.</P>
    <P>I think, however, the farmers of this country should be notified, as I most solemnly notify them now, that every acre of land they have, which is suitable for the production of tillage crops, should be most fully employed this year more than any other year, owing to the situation rapidly developing as a result of the concatenation of circumstances arising from the Korean war, the Indian famine and the bad prospects of the winter wheat crop on the American continent.  All these circumstances combine to give one identical warning, and that is, that every acre of tillage land in this country should be used to the best possible advantage for the farmer who owns it.  He is the judge.  I can claim for myself the credit that I brought in 100,000 tons of superphosphate of lime in the course of the last three months, cheaper than any other &ldquo;super&rdquo; sold in Europe this year and added it to the total supply available from our domestic resources.  The fertilisers are there, the seed is there.  There were more tractors purchased in the last three months than the entire number of tractors in this country in the year 1939.  There are more tractors in use to-day than ever there were in Ireland before and we are trying to get as many more as money will buy abroad. The means are there, the seed is there, the fertilisers are there, the land is there, the farmers are there and I tell them now the need is there.  If that does not produce results next autumn, I will most willingly make way for a better man for my policy will have failed and the policy of coercion should begin.  If that be necessary in Ireland I have misjudged the Irish farmer and I would be ashamed to be his servant. To be the servant of a free man is to be glorious but to be the servant of a whipped slave is a degradation which I would not wish to experience.</P>
    <P>People are worried about what the <Col N="2069" /> supplementary sum is required for.  It is really quite simple.  We are paying the subsidy in respect of flour to the millers quarterly.  In 1948, when we came into office we had to meet the charge that came in course of payment for the purchase of the now-famous Argentine wheat by Deputy Lemass, the night before he went out of office, in respect of which wheat he paid £50 a ton which was, at that time, about £20 a ton above the world price.  God knows why he did it.  I have never found out and I do not think anybody else has, but he did it and we had to foot the bill.  The Minister for Finance announced in his Budget that he proposed to spread the cost of the flour wheat subsidy over five years and to pay an average sum in each of the five years, not directly related to the demand in any one given year or the liability of that year.  In the course of the last three years, we met the full charge which came in course of payment for the 1948-49 period, which was £9,000,000, out of current revenue; but between 1948 and now, we fell one quarter behind, that is to say, we paid the subsidy in respect of the period up to 28th February only up to 1st January.  All that this Supplementary Estimate means is that, in this financial year, circumstances are such that we can pay five quarters instead of four quarters of subsidy, thus catching up on the quarter we fell behind on in the past three years.  That, in substance, is what the whole business means.</P>
    <P>What hare Deputy Aiken was chasing, I do not know, but if Deputy Aiken wants to make headlines in the <i>Irish Times</i> and in his own kept newspaper, he ought to have some regard to the significance of the language he is using. If Deputy Aiken wants to get up here and talk nonsense about subsidising wheat for animal feeding, he ought to realise that he was for a long time a Minister of this State, and that, when people abroad read that he has made up his mind from a study of the accounts that we are subsidising wheat to be used as animal feeding, it evokes a query from certain international authorities, and it is extremely difficult to convince them that Deputy Aiken is talking through his hat, because they say that he was Minister <Col N="2070" /> for Finance and studied these accounts and should know.</P>
    <P>There is not a scintilla of truth in the suggestion that we are subsidising wheat for animal feeding.  The wheat feed at present being sold in this country is being sold for its full value and, as we draw low-grade wheat from our accumulated stocks, we buy replacements. There are three cargoes of Manitoba No. 5 at present approaching this country.  Nobody but a lunatic would sit on top of considerable accumulated stores of wheat of suitable quality for use in wheat feed and wait till the three cargoes of Manitoba No. 5 reached him from Vancouver, when, by a simple process of exchange, he could maintain continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>May I remind the House that last September the welkin was made to ring in this House about the prospect of all the live stock of the country lying down and dying of starvation because there would be no feeding stuffs?  Deputy Cogan was clapping his hands and saying that the cattle were being brought out and sold for half nothing, while other Deputies were telling me that you could not sell them at all, that people would not take a present of them for fear they would eat them out of house and home. The very self-same Deputies are now up clapping their hands, crying panic and saying that the mills are all packed with feeding stuffs they cannot sell.</P>
    <P>Is there any shame in some people? There is none.  The number of seedy politicians in this country who survive on their confidence in the shortness of public memory is always a source of admiring amazement to me.  They can sing that black is white most melodiously in October and then get up and curse us solemnly, with bell, book and candle, for suggesting that black is not black the following March and shroud themselves in a mantle of outraged virtue because you find fault with them for being the hypocritical frauds you know them to be.  I am a long time on the road now and I ought not to worry about that kind of thing&mdash;it is just that I feel amazed.  It is like going up to look at the red-bottomed orang-outang, <Col N="2071" /> or whatever you call it, in the zoo.  It does not matter how often you go up there, you are astonished by the blueness of its countenance and the redness of its posterior.  I cannot remember exactly the name of the beast, but for years I never went to the zoo without going in to see whether its countenance could be as blue as I remembered it and its other end as red as it is. There are politicians in this country who fill me with a sentiment for which awe is not too strong a word by the courage they have&mdash;and they are right, because, if their faces are brazen enough and their hides tough enough, you can quote them from the printed word and it does not knock a feather out of them.  They shake their heads and say: &ldquo;Oh, nobody will read it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would rebuke myself if I failed to reply to the only decent reasonable intervention in this debate made from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  Deputy Major de Valera had representations made to him and he raised them in a decent, civil way and asked for an explanation. I should be lacking in duty and in courtesy if I did not try to answer him in the same spirit.  He gathered that a certain group of traders known as wholesalers had been ruthlessly deprived of certain trading profits to which they were normally entitled.  I should like the Deputy to know what the facts are.  In these trades&mdash;the milling trade and other monopolies and quasi-monopolies&mdash;a practice grew up at the time when the monopoly crystallised of a number of individuals enjoying certain privileges. Their identity is determined, and, as from the date of monopoly, everything becomes rigid, and it just so happened that there were, I think, 261 persons who managed to persuade the mills with which they deal to allow a wholesale discount of 10/- per ton on flour and offals, or flour or offals.  In any case, there was this list of persons who enjoyed what they were pleased to describe as a wholesale discount of 10/- per ton.  As from 1939, the door slammed.  There were no additions to and no subtractions from that list. Membership of that list became a valuable asset and you would nearly <Col N="2072" /> dower your daughter with the right to be known as a member of that list.  It was worth 10/- per ton on every ton of cereal products you handled.</P>
    <P>Comes 1950, and I inquire why there are 261 people with this privilege and I am told: &ldquo;That is the list we got when controls came into force&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Is there anybody else trading in these commodities on lines similar to these gentlemen?&rdquo; I asked, and was told: &ldquo;Oh, yes, plenty, but they are not on the list&rdquo;.  I asked if this constituted the sole occupation of these gentlemen and was told: &ldquo;No; they are all trading in a variety of things and they happen to be what are called flour wholesalers&rdquo;.  Here is the evil of the system.</P>
    <P>If you once acknowledge, in building up the price of a controlled commodity, that there is the cost of production, plus the wholesalers' allowance, plus the wholesalers' retailers' allowance, plus the retailers' allowance, plus the retailers' profit, you build up a price structure about five feet high.  But when you go to one of the stages and ask: &ldquo;What is this wholesalers' allowance?&rdquo; you are told: &ldquo;It is 10/- and they always got it.&rdquo;  When you ask what they do for it you are told: &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;&mdash;what heaps of other people do, nothing.  Why did they get it?  They managed to wangle it and they were there in 1939 and we have not changed anything since then.  Some people think it is a terrible hardship on them but I do not think they should wangle it any more because, in order to accommodate them, you have got to put 10/- into the price structure which would not be there if they did not get it.  So, I said, simply, close the melodeon; take out the 10/-, and let them work for the same margin of profit as all the other people who do the same thing work for.  I was a shopkeeper all my life.  I was as anxious to get discount as my neighbour. I was as anxious to get in on any softness or advantage that could be got.  If I wangled something, I would feel grievously aggrieved to see the wangle fold up on me, but I did not go forth to protest that divine justice had been violated.  I simply <Col N="2073" /> shrugged my shoulders and said that it was grand while we had it but now that we have not got it, we will have to do without it.</P>
    <P>If Deputy de Valera investigates this matter, he will find that a group of perfectly respectable citizens had managed to get themselves weighed in with the flour and wheat offal costings to the tune of 10/- a ton; that we took out that; that we closed the melodeon that much, with the result that the instrument's notes got that much sweeter for the consumer and, I suppose, that much less euphonious to the 261 gentlemen who heretofore have been known as flour wholesalers.</P>
    <P>That is the story, as I know it.  I can imagine all sorts of disturbed public servants, with their heart missing three beats at my general description of the general circumstances surrounding that situation, saying: &ldquo;He has left out some vital aspect of this problem.&rdquo;  All I can say to Deputy de Valera, in that event, is that any time, without exposing himself to the embarrassment of calling personally upon his humble servant, the Minister, my Department is open and available to him.  Here is Deputy de Valera now.  If, on perusing the explanation that I have been trying to provide him with in reply to his polite and gracious inquiry made during this debate, he finds that I have not covered the points fully, I will be most grateful to him if he would get in touch with the flour and cereals section of my Department directly for any further information he requires. I venture to prophesy that, when fully seized of the facts, his judgment in this matter will approximate more closely to mine than it has done heretofore. If at any time he would wish to discuss the merits of the matter with me, in the light of that information, I shall be most happy to do so. I am only trying to do what is fair, just and reasonable but, if it is carried home to me that I have done anything wrong, I will be most happy to put it right.</P>

      <P>If any shopkeeper fails to secure supplies, I will be grateful if the Deputy will inform me of it. I had a remarkable experience of having a man coming to me this morning saying that he could get only one ton of white pollard from a named mill. On my desk in front of me was a letter from that named mill saying that pollard was now flowing out of the mill, that they had no place to put pollard and where would I dispose of it for them.  I was very happy to introduce the querist and the miller and to leave them to fight it out between themselves. I will be very happy to perform a similar function for any small shopkeeper who experiences the possible <Col N="2075" /> embarrassment envisaged by Deputy Beirne.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister leaves that point, will he say if the cost of feeding stuffs to the consumer will be reduced by the 10/- that is cut out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the proposal was that the cost of the material would have had to be reduced by 10/- or, if I wanted to provide the 10/-, I would either have had to provide the money from the public purse to do it or pass it on to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens is, instead of charging the wholesalers, <i>soi disant</i>, £28 10s. Od., they will be charged £29, the same as everybody else.  If that were not done, and the 10/- had to be made available to these wholesale accounts, it would have resulted in a corresponding diminution in the return to Grain Importers, Limited, which would have finally found its way back to the wheat subsidy account.  What we tried to do with Grain Importers, Limited, is, over a period, to make them trade on a line ball.  Sometimes they will be in deficit, and then they will go trading on a surplus until the deficit is extinguished.  Then they will often trade on a line ball and may run into a surplus, when they will reduce prices, perhaps, lower than current market rates, to restore equilibrium. It is impossible, as the Deputy will readily understand, to keep following prices from day to day and I think it is undesirable.  It is better over a month or two months to keep a flat <Col N="2076" /> price and, if you come out too high at the end of that period, to fix the price for the next two months a bit too low, or vice-versa.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The price of feeding stuffs now is so high that, though they may go higher, I cannot conceive of their going much higher.</P>
      <P>I do not know that I am in a position to add any more on this Supplementary Estimate.  I hope the House will excuse my inadequacy, if inadequacy there be, bearing in mind that the main Estimate for the Department of Agriculture will be before the House within the course of the next couple of months, when Deputies can talk till the cows come home and raise any subject they like. Before I conclude I would like to say a special word to Deputy Cowan and Deputy Beirne.  I am not in a position to command either one or the other of them in any matter.  As Deputy Cowan says, he not infrequently finds himself at serious variance with me. Sometimes I imagine that Deputy Beirne looks upon me with a disillusioned eye.  Nevertheless, to both of them I want to express my profound appreciation that they thought it proper to take the trouble to give expression to the gracious sentiments they did express.  In public life one so often finds one's critics invariably vocal, while those who approve, silently approve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question that I want to put to the Minister, by way of personal explanation.  I raised the question of the milling of Irish wheat into feeding stuffs because the Minister, within the last two weeks, announced it in the Dáil, and I maintain that this Estimate is in fact being devoted, not to the subsidisation of human food, but to the subsidisation of animal food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy there is no element of subsidy in this Estimate for the grinding of wheat <Col N="2077" /> into wheat feed.  I cannot do more than assure the Deputy of that.  There is not, really.</P>
      <P>I was a little puzzled at Deputy Smith being shouldered out of this debate by Deputy Lemass, and I thought it was a matter of substance that was troubling Deputy Aiken.  I can assure him that there is no intention now, or at any future date, of subsidising wheat for grinding into wheat feed.  There may be this element in it perhaps.  We had incorporated into white pollard the pollard and bran which come off the flour milled for human consumption.  That pollard and bran were arbitrarily valued, for the purposes of costings, at, I think, £11 10s. or £12 10s. a ton.  In so far as they are incorporated into what we call a white pollard mixture, ground wheat and pollard, they are charged at £11 10s. or whatever the price was at which they used to be sold.  In so far as that is an element of subsidy it is there, but it is nothing in addition to what was already there.  If the pollard and bran were not put in the white pollard, they would be sold at £11 10s. As a result of putting them in the white pollard, it is possible to sell the white pollard without control, whereas, in respect of the ordinary pollard or bran, there never was enough to provide everyone with their needs.  Only a small minority of farmers had access to it.</P>

      <P>In rising to reply to the debate on this Supplementary Estimate and the sub-heads governing a number of the different services, I should like now, in case I might forget it, to reply to some of the insinuations and some of the suggestions contained in the speech of Deputy MacEntee. Deputy MacEntee, in speaking on this debate the other evening, stated that the policy and the outlook of the Government <Col N="2078" /> here for the time being was opposed to private enterprise, that they had adopted the outlook and the principles of those living behind the Iron Curtain.  The clearest way to state a matter of this kind is to state it simply. I cannot state too clearly that that particular innuendo or charge is far, far removed from the truth of the situation. It is not only a free but it is a licentious translation of truncated extracts from the speeches of people over here. I never saw a speech of any public man, Deputy or Minister, so abused and so distorted in translation and interpretation as the speech made here by the Tánaiste was by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
      <P>I would like to say this, and I would like to say it without challenge, that, irrespective of geographical positions around this carpet, every one of us, those sitting opposite as well as those sitting here, are genuinely and sincerely interested in Irish prosperity, in employment for the Irish people, in industrial advancement and in the industrial development of the country.  There is no great point in 1951 in washing in public my old blue shirt or Deputy MacEntee's old red shirt.  The position that matters is the attitude and the outlook of the people generally and of the Parliament generally in conditions at the moment, in conditions to-morrow and the day after.  Naturally and obviously, any Government in this country will be more interested than anyone in Opposition in the continuation, expansion and development of Irish industries both from the point of the material strength, trade and employment of this country, as well as just the other point of industrial development as far as it affects private individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe absolutely in private enterprise.  Where private enterprise fails, then there is an obligation on the State to step in.  Great services affecting the lives and the homes of everybody in the country, such as water, sewerage and electricity and, in modern life, transport are too huge and too vast to be undertaken by private capital, or by the capital of the private individual, or group of individuals, to face or risk the loss that might be entailed from time to <Col N="2079" /> time in ventures such as these.  When slump periods come, bankruptcy is threatened and there is the closure of essential services such as we had not only in our railways down here but recently in the case of the railways in the North.  In such a situation, the State steps in.  It must step in and is entitled to step in; but in other respects the policy, the outlook and the view of this Government is that industrial development must, as far as possible, be undertaken by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>We have done our utmost, and the Deputies sitting opposite know it, from the time of the change of Government to continue the programme already there, to encourage it, and to invite Irish capital, and inviting Irish capital means inviting Irish confidence in the building up of Irish industry in this country.  That has been the attitude.  Then we had that speech from Deputy MacEntee the other evening to say to industrialists outside: &ldquo;These fellows sitting opposite do not believe in Irish enterprise. They have translated into their minds and into their policy the outlook of Stalin and the people behind the Iron Curtain.&rdquo;  Translate that. What does it mean to the man with money banked up and lying idle? What does it mean from the point of view of the town or village anywhere from here to Kerry looking for an Irish industry?  This is an ex-Minister for Finance and not only an ex-Minister for Finance but an ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce and an ex-Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  He is saying to that man with idle capital: &ldquo;Keep your money in your bank.  Do not invest it in Irish industrial development.  The Government of this country is against private enterprise.  They are out against profits.&rdquo;  Anything more damaging to the outlook and possible prosperity of this State I have never heard from the mouth of even an irresponsible Deputy.  It would not be worth replying to except that it comes from the mouth of a man who was for 16 years a Minister in this country.  I ask the leaders of the Party opposite&mdash;<Col N="2080" /> those of them who are sincerely concerned and anxious to advance the prosperity of this country and to expand industrial development in this country&mdash;from within their own Party to discourage that kind of propaganda. It may be a slick point in debate.  In the national sense, however, it is genuinely and extensively damaging not only to capitalists inside the country but to capitalists outside the country.  I heard that speech quoted back to myself, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, this morning. I am sure it can be heard in the stock exchanges inside and outside this country to-day.  These kinds of irresponsible utterances by a Deputy opposite&mdash;an ex-Minister&mdash;just anxious to prod but unthinking of the damage he may do should be discouraged by both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Provided we stand for private enterprise, what is the next logical step? Philanthropists of financial standing are very rare birds.  You do not get people to sink their money in any venture purely for the sake of helping the neighbour, helping the lad around the corner, doing something for a country. You do not get them sinking their money in Irish industry as a hobby, merely for the sake of a pastime.  Provided you stand for private enterprise then you must stand also for the profit incentive.  The profit incentive, the profit inducement, is the only bait to attract capital.  Provided the profit is reasonable, provided the quality of the material turned out is a good quality material, and provided the conditions under which it is produced are good and sound, then every member of this Government and every member on this side of the House is lined up behind that particular enterprise. Reasonable profit, good quality goods and good working conditions. Since the time of the change of Government, through the mouth of the head of this Government, these conditions were laid down.  Subject to these conditions, every help the Government can give will be given. You have, here and there, departures from these three conditions.  They are few, but the few frequently damage the many.  You have either bad <Col N="2081" /> quality or bad conditions or excessive profits.  Genuine Irish industrialists condemn that kind of thing as loudly as any of us.  The one can get a bad name for the many.  I met representatives of Irish industry: I met representatives of Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I pointed out the black sheep here and the black sheep there and they agreed that that was so and they deplored it.  I suggested that it would be much better to have that kind of thing dealt with from within their own body than for the State to intervene and deal with them.  That kind of thing could get a bad name for all, not only by being accepted as an example of the whole lot but by any references to these very few being distorted as references to the whole body.  That is exactly what Deputy MacEntee did.</P>

He behaves like a mud-squirt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to interpret in my own way the views of the Chair.  The Chair, in reference to the Deputy, pointed out that certain of his actions were within the rules of order but that it was a matter of taste whether to indulge in those activities or not.  I leave it, in deference to the <Col N="2082" /> Chair, as being a matter of taste for the Deputy and the Deputy's colleagues. However, in his particular anxiety to attack the Government, I would ask him to discriminate between when he is damaging the country rather than damaging the Government.  It appears to me that the kind of regimented vocal unanimity that used to be a characteristic of the Party opposite has completely broken down against the rock of Government success not only in this field but in many other fields as well.</P>
      <P>To-day the Opposition is like an unorganised or disorganised jazz band, every one of them walloping a different kettledrum with a different note. Anyone listening to the debate here the other evening could see that, though mind you, for once I will exempt Deputy Major de Valera; whether it was due to some kind of aberration I do not know, but he happened to stick to something that was before him. What was Deputy MacEntee's contention? That the policy of this Government had not only stopped any industrial progress in the country, but had completely paralysed the pre-existing industries.  From immediately behind his back we heard Deputy Briscoe. What was his line?  That he, Deputy Briscoe, a man who did not command a whole lot of capital, was putting it into an Irish enterprise together with a partner.  He had confidence that the Administration was not Red; he had sufficient confidence to sink his bit of capital here.  On the same day we had a query from Deputy Lemass as to why one of the wealthiest mining companies in the Transvaal were allowed to come and sink their capital here to develop the mineral resources of this country. Deputy Lemass deplored the fact that the financial stability of the country was such and the future of Irish industry so solid that we could attract capital not only from within the State, but from the wealthiest syndicate in South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a complete misrepresentation.  Deputy Lemass did not say any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe sinks his own little capital here; <Col N="2083" /> Deputy MacEntee has said that there was a complete loss of confidence and that Irish industry was not only checked but completely paralysed.  I will leave it to Deputy de Valera.  He is only a junior in the ranks opposite, but as a junior he may have some influence. He may have enough to make those contradictory points of view compatible.  I hate to see a Party going into smithereens, a Party that at one time was great, but remember that one, two or three lunatics can destroy a whole Party.  Control your lunatics and then in the course of the next 16 years you may get somewhere.</P>
      <P>We had a further contradiction on the prices freeze and the de-frosting operation which followed.  When, after very full consideration, the Government decided on the prices freeze we were denounced by the Deputies opposite.  We were denounced by the tied organ, the controlled organ, the political organ of the Party opposite.  It was said that this idea of freezing prices would paralyse not only industry but commerce as well.  They were standing somewhere for some length of time and were campaigning with some degree of consistency.  Then the Government decided to de-frost a number of items and we were attacked more bitterly by the gentlemen opposite for that operation than ever we were for the freeze, with the result that even many old-time wealthy industrialists who would battle as men of backbone told us that the gentlemen opposite were only spineless political weathercocks whose political outlook was that anything this Government did must of necessity be wrong, and whether it was right or wrong their mission in life was to denounce, criticise and oppose.</P>

That is the difference between the policy on that side and on this.  We start by taking a date, taking the prices on that date and saying we will freeze them as on that date and then we will look into it.  We look into them and we see that there is a fair case for removing the prices freeze from certain groups of commodities, and we do that. Then we have the Deputies opposite throwing bouquets at the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That was an excellent body, highly trained, expert, most proficient at their work.  Blab, hypocrisy, transparent dishonesty.

      <P>The Vote which has just been moved is for financial assistance for Córas Iompair Éireann.  The sum which it is proposed to provide&mdash; as a non-repayable grant&mdash;is £980,000. The entire sum is in respect of revenue losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deficiency of £980,000 for the year ending 31st March, 1951, is made up as follows: Loss on working, £32,700.  Fixed charges: Interest on transport stock, £433,000; pension trust funds, £180,000; Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company interest, £44,522; making a total of £657,522.  Depreciation, £1,000,000; making a total of £1,690,222.  Less credits: Rents, fees, etc., £30,934; road tax paid in advance, £135,000; other adjustments, £76,752; total, <Col N="2088" /> £242,686.  That gives the net deficiency, £1,447,536; less interest on transport stock already paid, £433,000; bringing the total amount to £1,014,536.</P>
    <P>Making allowance for over-estimation, it is proposed that the sum to be provided should be £980,000.</P>
    <P>The interest on guaranteed transport stock payable by the board has already been advanced out of the Central Fund.  The amount so advanced was £433,000.  The total amount of assistance being provided for the board in the year is, therefore: (1) £980,000 non-repayable grant; (2) £433,000 interest on transport stock already advanced by the State; making a total of £1,413,000.</P>
    <P>No provision is being made in the Supplementary Estimate for payments to Córas Iompair Éireann for capital purposes.  It will be recalled that, of the sum of £4,091,000 voted in November, 1949, a sum of £2,464,000 was in respect of capital works.  Construction work was, however, held up as a result of labour disputes and difficulties in procuring supplies of materials, with the result that there remained unexpended at the 31st March, 1950, a balance of £172,800. This sum met almost entirely the company's need for capital works up to the date of the establishment of the new board on the 1st June, 1950. During the year, certain payments of a capital nature accrued to the board as follows: Proceeds of sale of Store Street premises, £369,534; sale of chassis shop machinery, £48,344; miscellaneous credits, £47,251; making a total of £465,129.</P>
    <P>New capital expenditure by the board during the year is estimated to amount to £263,200.  This expenditure will be met out of these capital credits. The balance of the capital receipts is being retained to meet future capital expenditure; it cannot properly be used for any other purpose.  Further capital outlay will fall to be met by the board by the issue of guaranteed transport stock in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Transport Act, 1950.  Under the terms of the Act the board is authorised to issue transport <Col N="2089" /> stock to an amount of £7,000,000 for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in moving the Supplementary Estimate for the sum of £4,091,000 for Córas Iompair Éireann in November, 1949, it was indicated that there seemed to be no likelihood that the undertaking would be able in the early years of its existence to make ends meet; the financial position of the board at that stage was so serious that such a spectacular improvement did not seem to be possible. This view has, unfortunately, been borne out by events.</P>
    <P>During 1950-51 the board have had serious and unforeseen difficulties to contend with.  Leaving out of account fixed charges and depreciation, it had been hoped that there would have been a net profit on actual operations in the year.  Events in the past few months have, however, killed this hope. In the first place there was the strike of a number of Córas Iompair Éireann employees.  The board maintained skeleton services, but the losses arising out of the strike were considerable; they are estimated to be not less than £500,000.  The full effects are likely to be more far-reaching.  I am afraid there is little doubt but that a certain amount of the traffic lost to the board during this period may not be recovered.  It is, perhaps, only to be expected that traders who are forced by circumstances to provide their own transport at short notice will continue to avail of their own transport, even after the restoration of public services.</P>
    <P>As in the case of other industries, Córas Iompair Éireann have been affected by the recent world-wide rise in the prices of materials of all kinds. I am informed by the board that the increased cost of materials will involve them in additional expenditure amounting to £400,000 in a full year; half of this increase is attributable to coal.</P>
    <P>A third factor largely affecting the board's financial position has been the increase in wages as a result of awards made by the Joint Industrial Council and by the Labour Court to a large number of the board's employees.  To the already heavy wages bill (amounting to some £6,800,000 a year) will be <Col N="2090" /> added as a result of these awards a further sum of about £350,000 in a full year.  Nor, unfortunately, is this the end of the story; there are still more claims on behalf of other grades in the board's service waiting to be considered which may involve the board in still further expense.</P>
    <P>Deputies are already aware that Córas Iompair Éireann propose to raise passenger and freight charges to meet increases in operating costs.  The board is now faced with the problem of recouping not only the annual loss of approximately £1,000,000 inherited from its predecessor, but also the considerable additional sum arising from increased costs of materials and wages.  The only source of additional revenue open to the board is its rates and charges, but there is a limit to increased revenue which can be expected from this source; beyond a certain level increases may have the effect of diverting traffic away from the board.</P>
    <P>In submitting the Supplementary Estimate in November, 1949, an undertaking was given that in so far as capital expenditure was concerned no capital works would be undertaken except in so far as they were essential to the maintenance of the undertaking or were of an unquestionably remunerative nature.  This policy has been followed. Expenditure during the past year has been devoted in the main to the replacement of rolling stock and to the improvement of passenger facilities. New coaches have been built at the board's engineering works to replace obsolescent stock.  These coaches embody many improvements in design and equipment.  They are being fitted for use on the &ldquo;radio train&rdquo;, which has proved a popular innovation.  Diesel rail cars, both narrow and broad gauge, have been ordered, and it is hoped to have the first in service this summer.  The narrow-gauge cars are for use on the West Clare section and this experiment will be watched with interest.</P>
    <P>The bus tours operated by the board have proved popular and remunerative. These have been extended and new coaches have been constructed at the <Col N="2091" /> board's works specifically for these tours.  A full programme of replacement of old buses on the ordinary services has also been undertaken.</P>
    <P>While I can assure the House that every endeavour will be made by the board to secure economies and increase revenue, I feel that it would be too much to hope that this is the last occasion on which it would be necessary to come to the Dáil for assistance.  The prospect must be faced that, for at least the first few years of the board's existence, their revenues will not be sufficient to meet all the charges properly chargeable to revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the financial year.  This subsidy is for loss incurred in working, notwithstanding the substantial provisions made some time ago to set this company, as it was alleged, on its feet and, as I understand the Parliamentary Secretary, there is very little hope, apparently, that this state of affairs will not continue.  The expenditure has been of an ordinary working nature.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been at pains to remark that there has been very little capital expenditure, and I infer from that that very little has been spent or, apparently, is contemplated in the way of expansion or adjustment of this concern to meet the requirements of the day.  Apart from the urgent necessity of getting our transport organisation into proper working trim for ordinary purposes, there is always looming over us at present the figure of what, I think, the Taoiseach called the doubtful future. This sum is, apparently, just to subsidise or wipe out the loss which has occurred through the company running on without any such adjustments. That is disquieting in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to indicate that very little effort is being made to deal with the problem that may have to be faced in the future, a problem involving all sorts of shortages, difficulties of <Col N="2092" /> supply, and, perhaps, the maintenance and running of transport services under emergency conditions.  On the other hand, looking at the other side we find there is a sum of £48,344 taken as a credit for the sale of certain machinery.  To-day I endeavoured to elicit from the Parliamentary Secretary some information in relation to this sale.  I regret to say that he apparently was not in a position to-day, at any rate, to give the information sought.  This much is at least clear: this concern to which was entrusted almost the entire transport of the country had purchased and available to it a supply of equipment and machinery which would leave both it and the country relatively independent in relation to certain supplies essential to its operation.  I am referring now to the chassis factory at Inchicore where it was envisaged a progressive development towards producing vehicles here would take place. The circumstances under which that machinery was acquired were as follows: we were deficient, for reasons which are somewhat immaterial to-day since they go back far in our history, in certain industrial potentials.  The country was very short of machinery. It lacked an industry that could be classed in the heavy or semi-heavy category.  It could not carry out such operations as the cutting of gear wheels, and similar operations involved in the making of vehicles were beyond our capacity.  For machinery of any complexity, whether for transport or for anything else, we had heretofore to look abroad except in so far as limited facilities were afforded to us by the existing railway workshops.</P>
    <P>Now this firm acquired machinery which vastly increased its industrial potential.  Let me take Deputies back over the war years.  Deputies will remember that in those straitened days the railway workshops were called upon to meet a need much deeper and wider than the mere transport need.  They provided then the only semblance we had of a heavy industry, but, even there, we were deficient.  I can remember the Department of Defence and other Departments, the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, and <Col N="2093" /> all these others, that wanted engineering work done during the war, having to fall back on such shops and, even then, there did not exist the necessary capacity to deal with all the work that should have been dealt with.  That lesson was taken to heart and forthwith as soon as the emergency had ceased provision was made for this chassis shop which was designed ultimately as the industry developed with a view to producing the complete machine.  Certain essential machine tools and machinery were imported for that purpose. That machinery and these valuable tools were on hand in Inchicore. They were in their packing cases, but they were there for use.  What has been done?  The machinery and the machine tools have been sold in part. The Parliamentary Secretary has not told me exactly what has happened but, if the ordinary information floating around is correct, certain valuable, irreplaceable items have been sold.  If I interpret aright the rather scanty answer, which I received to-day, some have also been exported.  The position is that these machine tools and that machinery cannot be replaced.  Anybody who has experience of importing machinery knows what the position is. One may succeed in getting one's order placed, but there is no certainty as to the date of delivery.  The outlook so far as our industrial needs are concerned is not, to say the least of it, optimistic, because of the armaments drive, which this Government is so fond of invoking as an excuse for its deficiencies.  It is now practically impossible for a country like ours to obtain its needs in relation to machinery and tools.  Within the past three years even a blind man would have seen the position we would have to face in the future.  Yet, we have exported that material and we have taken its sale into account as a credit item in this Vote.</P>
    <P>We are asked to vote in this Estimate a sum of £800,000, more than half a million.  That apparently takes into account as a credit, first of all, the value of the Store Street premises, if I understand the Parliamentary Secretary aright, and also takes into account as a credit the sale and the loss of <Col N="2094" /> this irreplaceable machinery.  It is quite obvious, of course, what the House is being asked to vote for now; this sum is in itself substantial.  Not only is it substantial but we are also asked to vote a sum to make up the losses of a concern which we were promised would be put speedily on a paying basis and which received a subsidy as I understand it, of £4,000,000 some time ago also with that end in view.  I know that, as the Parliamentary Secretary has told us, that subsidy has not been completely expended and that there has been a reduction in capital works; but, not only are we asked to do that, but we are asked here to take into account as a saving this sum in relation to the disposal of the Store Street premises. I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary will tell me that I have not misinterpreted him in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the position is, this sum is apparently for the purpose of making up the loss on this concern, a concern we were led to believe would be put on a profitable basis.  As against that we also have disclosed that not only is the loss on this concern involved in this sum of £800,000 but there must also be taken into account the loss involved through the sale of this chassis shop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, my remarks still hold good whatever way they are taken.  The loss incurred on the chassis shop is both irretrievable and irreparable.  It involves a loss to the country generally, a loss to the concern itself and a loss to the industrial potential of the country.  I think it represents a somewhat sad but very serious reflection on the attitude of the Government to such matters, an <Col N="2095" /> attitude dominant in Government quarters during the last three years.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the matters which could be invoked from what was mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary are, perhaps, matters more for the general Estimate. The only remark I will make about it is that it may be necessary to vote such a sum, to continue to vote such a sum, to subsidise this loss which, I understand, is largely due to the rail transactions of the company.  But in view of the assurances and all that was said from the Government Benches at the time that this matter was gone into some time ago, as to how this concern was to be handled, it is, to say the least of it, disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it what the Parliamentary Secretary has just said means that the Milne Report is completely discarded.  As a matter of historical interest, I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us if a single recommendation made by Sir James Milne, the greatest transport expert in the world, has, in fact, been acted upon.  Sir James Milne thought this company could be put on a paying basis.  He made a number of recommendations directed towards securing that result.  It is true his estimate was based upon various assumptions which were not realised, but he stressed that if the reorganisation of the company was effected, and a capital expenditure of £10,000,000 on re-equipment was made in a period of five years, at the end of that time it would pay its way.</P>
      <P>No capital expenditure at all has been effected.  We went through the formality of passing a Bill through the Oireachtas authorising the Minister for Finance to give his guarantee in respect of money raised by this board for capital purposes to a limit of £7,000,000. The board have not raised 1d.  The Parliamentary Secretary, as I understood his remarks of a few minutes ago, is now making a virtue out of the board's failure to begin the reorganisation of the company, or the re-equipment of its railway undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any hope at all for this undertaking, unless the capital outlay which was considered necessary by Sir James <Col N="2096" /> Milne, and which was, roughly, the equivalent of that considered necessary by the previous board and its chairman, is not proceeded with?  If there is to be no such reorganisation as was then contemplated, the only hope of avoiding recurring annual losses is a substantial reduction in expenditure on the railway undertaking.  Has there been any reduction in expenditure?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when introducing the Transport Bill, stated that he anticipated the new board would find many ways of achieving economy.  Have they found one way of achieving economy?  Is it not reasonable for us to ask, when we are presented with a Bill for practically £1,000,000 to make good losses by the board during the past year, if the Parliamentary Secretary will name one single item of cost in the accounts of that company in respect of which any economy has been made or any economy has been attempted?</P>
    <P>The Dáil was asked to pass the Bill on the assurance of the Minister that many ways of achieving economies were available to the board and they would find them.  Have they done so? Perhaps they have, and I am led to the consideration of that possibility by the fact that when the Minister was presenting the Bill he told us that shortly after he became a Minister the members of the old board, led by Mr. Reynolds, came to him and asked his permission to increase rail and road charges, stating that if they did not get his permission to increase the charges the only possible way of balancing their accounts was to carry out drastic and uneconomic curtailments of expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister rolled off his tongue, with considerable pleasure, the proposals which the board had stated would be necessary if the accounts were to be balanced and if the permission to increase charges was not given.  Surely, Deputies here can well remember them?  We were told 2,500 men were to be dismissed by reason of reductions in maintenance and that branch lines were to be closed and, as well as that, fares were to be increased.  The Minister represented these as the proposals of the board <Col N="2097" /> and he used them to make that board unpopular, both with the railway workers who were threatened with dismissal and the people in areas in the country which had been promised the reopening of closed branch lines.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister been converted to the proposals which, he alleges, were made to him by the old board in March, 1948?  I asked a Parliamentary Question this week as to the number of people now employed in railway maintenance.  Remember that in March, 1948, one of the proposals under consideration by the old board, according to the Minister, was the dismissal of 2,500 men engaged in railway maintenance.  I do not know what number was then engaged in railway maintenance, but by 1st January, 1949, the total number employed on permanent way maintenance had gone down to 2,064.  It would have been difficult to dismiss 2,500 men from the railway maintenance staff if there were not that number on it, so presumably when discussions were proceeding in March, 1948, the number was larger than the number proposed to be dismissed, or at least equal to it.  By 1st January, 1949, the staff was 2,064 and on 4th March, this year, it had gone down further&mdash;it went down to 1,910.</P>
    <P>What about the closed branch lines? Not one has been reopened.  The rails must be fairly rusty by this; the signalling equipment must be difficult to operate; the crows are nesting in the stations and in the warehouses.  They have been closed for a fair time now. There must be some Deputies on the benches opposite who remember their promises to reopen them; there must be some Deputies who remember how in 1948 they denounced the old company because they had closed the branch lines.  Is it not about time that at least one of them was reopened, even as a gesture?  Despite the fact that we got this reduction in the number of workers employed on permanent way maintenance, and not a single branch line was reopened, we still got the increase in fares, the increase that the old board was refused in 1948.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said <Col N="2098" /> that he got a legacy of a loss of £1,000,000 a year from the old board. That loss was realised in 1948 because the Minister for Industry and Commerce refused the board permission to increase the fares.  If he had given them, in March, 1948, permission to increase the fares by one half the extent they have increased since, there would have been no loss of £1,000,000 in 1948.  And fares are going to be increased still further.  This process of shoving up the cost of transport has not stopped.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, this position to reckon with, that Sir James Milne was employed at considerable expense to produce a report which was considerably publicised but not a single recommendation made by him has been accepted.  We have the position also that, of the economies which the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us in introducing the Transport Bill it would achieve, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot mention a single one.  He did not point to one single item of cost which has gone down since that date; and of the capital expenditure which was then deemed necessary to put the company in the position in which it could pay its way in the future, not a penny has been effected.  Of the branch lines which were closed, not a single yard, much less a mile, has been reopened. Despite all that, we have this mounting cost of transport services and this increase in rates from 50 per cent. in some cases down to one-sixth in others.  I think that when the Dáil is asked to vote this substantial sum to meet these losses, we should get from the Parliamentary Secretary not merely a series of figures telling us how the losses mounted up, but some explanation of the failure of the famous transport plan, fathered by Sir James Milne and foster-fathered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I take it that if one were to search the waste paper baskets in Kildare Street, one might find an occasional copy of Sir James Milne's report lying round but nowhere else.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that this loss of £1,000,000 in 1950 does not reveal the whole picture because the Minister for <Col N="2099" /> Industry and Commerce came to the Dáil at the end of 1949 and asked for a Supplementary Estimate of £4,000,000. He was concerned to represent it as the loss achieved by Córas Iompair Éireann up to that date but it was nothing of the kind.  It was mainly a subsidy for the new board in its first year.  We even paid their motor taxation in advance last year.  We went through the solemn farce of asking the taxpayers to cough up £150,000 to give to Córas Iompair Éireann to give back to the Exchequer in the form of motor taxation.  Other of the charges which the company would have had to bear in 1950 were paid in advance out of Government subsidy in 1949.  Then there was £2,500,000 provided for capital expenditure.  What it went for we do not quite know.  I assume that we shall see at some stage the accounts of the new board for the first year&mdash; I mean the financial accounts.  Normally, we would have the finance accounts of Córas Iompair Éireann in our hands by this.  The new board is not so expeditious in publishing the financial results of its operations as the old board was.  That is understandable. Is it possible to get from the Parliamentary Secretary a more accurate account of the actual deficiency in revenue last year over expenditure, leaving out of account the subsidies slipped surreptitiously to the new board before it was set up?  Is it possible to get an estimate of the revenue deficiency this year?</P>
    <P>We have no option but to vote this money.  The money has been lost and somebody has to pay it.  Are we going to have a similar or a bigger loss this year and if not, why?  Is there any plan in any Government Department or with any member of the board, for effecting changes in the company's organisation or methods of working which will avoid similar losses in future?  Are there any Deputies in this House who would not, before they spent £10 of their own money in financing their own business, ask many questions about it?  If that is so, should they not ask something before spending £1,000,000 of their neighbour's money?</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the new board, <Col N="2100" /> whatever their intentions may have been when they were first appointed, are not being permitted to do even the limited things they might decide upon, that they have been told that their job is to keep the organisation going by whatever patchwork arrangement they can devise, so long as it does not necessitate any call upon the capital resources which were allegedly put at their disposal by the Transport Act of 1950.  Surely, the people of this country are entitled to get from the nationalised transport organisation something more than the patchwork arrangement that exists there now? The old board were criticised because they conceived it their duty to present the country with a national transport organisation which would tend towards its economic development, which would be conducive to prosperity and of which the people would be proud, when the reorganisation work was completed. They never got a chance of starting upon that programme, but because they sketched out such a programme and because it involved special capital expenditure for some years ahead, they were held up to derision by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as being hare-brained and reckless. I do not know what idea the members of the Government have as to the elements of a sensible transport plan.  If they have not got one of their own and if they are not prepared to adopt that which was put forward by the old board, will they not adopt the plan prepared by the expert whom they employed to give them a plan? Do something.  Do not let this national organisation run to seed as it is going. It is necessary, as I said, to vote this £1,000,000 but I think the Dáil ought to refuse to vote it unless we get from the Government some indication of what they are going to do to avoid a bill of this size coming back year after year.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that arrogance in politics is sometimes more or less a virtue.  Listening to Deputy Lemass one would think that the transport crisis or the problems which confront the present Córas Iompair Eireann had occurred for the first time.  In 1944 or late in 1943, <Col N="2101" /> Deputy Lemass, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, brought forward proposals here to reorganise the transport system.  At that time, it was claimed that the plan would produce an efficient, economic and sound, integrated transport system.</P>

      <P>They made profits in the entirely abnormal circumstances of 1946, but they did not make any in 1947.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that there was no profit in that year.  In those circumstances, except during the war years, this company or the rail end of it had not made a profit for years and the circumstances during the war which, if you like, made an enforced profit for the company, were entirely unique circumstances in which there was a shortage of all types of transport, shortages of petrol and oil and restrictions on transport.  But, even if the restrictions had not been there, the means of running any alternative transport of any sort were not available.  In those circumstances, Deputy Lemass wanted to know why we are letting the transport company run to seed, an organisation which had not merely run to seed but was in a decaying condition both in his time and in ours.  I do not know if there is any good going over past events, but to allege that there was some plan that could have produced a profitable transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy talks with a great deal of conviction.  The more convincing he seems, the farther he is from facts.  He can put up a terrific case with a great show of conviction, but the most confident assertion he makes, the farther he is from the facts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass wanted to know why the branch lines were not reopened.  Is there any virtue in reopening a line that is not paying?  I do not think there is any advantage whatever.  Córas Iompair Éireann are conducting the experiment at Ballinrobe of comparing the advantages of rail transport and comparable road transport adjacent to it.  It will be possible from that experiment, I hope, to get a picture of the likely results of the advantages of road or rail.  It is, I think, significant, as a result of that experiment, that the railway will be used much more extensively than it was in the past.  I suppose it is a trait of human nature that people never like to lose something they had, even though they do not regard it as conferring any particular benefit.</P>
      <P>There were certain other questions about the Milne proposal.  One of the recommendations in the Milne Report referred to the chassis shop at Inchicore.  Deputy Lemass criticised the proposal and said that the work could be carried out in the existing workshop.  Why should the undertaking be transferred to the company? He also criticised the Leyland proposal.</P>
      <P>The Deputy wanted to know what capital works had been carried out last year.  The works included the Donnybrook garage, Waterford garage, new carriages, wagons and the quadrupling of a line at the North Wall.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare.  I think it was the Public Works Vote actually.  It is easy enough to criticise the circumstances in which this company lost money. Last year was one which presented a great number of problems, some of them right up to the last few weeks or months.  On top of that there was the problem which affected other industrial concerns of rising costs of commodities, rising prices which resulted in increasing the charges which the company were obliged to meet coupled with the transport strike.</P>
      <P>It is only right to say here that if this transport company is to survive, as we know and, as the company would expect, it must be enabled to survive in circumstances in which services will be uninterrupted.  I do not wish at this stage to discuss or comment on the transport strike, but the effect has been to cost the company a very considerable sum of money.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate what the future will hold, but it is likely that some of the traffic lost as a result of that strike will never be recovered.</P>
      <P>The effect of a strike is always difficult to assess fully and the mere settlement of a strike and the resumption of normal services do not mean that conditions have changed before the strike will occur again or that the circumstances which enable particular services to pay will prevail in the future.  The effect of any stoppage in a rail system or in a transport system generally means a loss on some of that system for the future, a permanent loss of traffic which was formerly carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances of the last financial year were difficult for the company, difficult because of the cost of material and difficult because of the effects of the strike.  The fact that it is obliged now to raise fares is no new step in order to recoup losses incurred by reason of rising expenditure, but the extent to which fares can be increased and, at the same time, show a profit is not unlimited and the position <Col N="2104" /> which the company has reached in raising fares and freights or which it will reach after any contemplated rise, may result in an actual diminishing return on the increases which have been provided.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that all over the world railways are losing money.  I do not think this country is any exception.  I think it is fantastic to imagine circumstances are going to change in which the railway can again be run at a profit.  The growth of motor transport, the increase in the number of vehicles, lorries, cars and trucks, has been phenomenal since 1939.  On the assumption that there is no substantial increase in the quantity of goods to be carried and no substantial increase in the merchandise which is available for transportation, then somebody must be the loser and the circumstances of recent years amply show that the transport company, or the rail end of it, loses more severely than any other form of transport.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone can be but disappointed.  It is the responsibility of the Dáil to vote money, but in passing this legislation last year it was made quite clear that for the immediate future it was not expected that the company would pay.  The losses were assessed at varying amounts and circumstances in the past year have not improved the position. With the continuation of services, I hope that with an improvement in general conditions the position in the future will improve.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the company should open any lines which will not pay is at the moment quite impracticable and one which could not be entertained.  In addition, there is the added complication that coal supplies are restricted.  As Deputies are aware, in Britain a number of train services have already been curtailed.  The restrictions are much more severe than any that have been imposed here.  At present the services being provided by the company are, in the main, adequate, whether they are provided by road or rail.  I do not think that any other matter was raised which requires to be dealt with, and I conclude by <Col N="2105" /> expressing the hope that the coming year will be no worse than the year the company has passed through.</P>

      <P>On the Vote on Account, the Minister concluded with a boast of what Fine Gael had done by saying at column 1619 of Volume 124 (10) of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the end, we were able to get the moneys necessary to finance our programme.  That is what is hurting the Opposition Deputies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the end of that paragraph, I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you are not paying for it.  It is the future taxpayers who will have to pay for it.  You are just passing the buck.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister then said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is a question of the &lsquo;know how&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He added that I did not know how and said that he did not want to put too great a strain on me by asking me to try to understand.  He suggested that I wait for another year or so and it might dawn on me.  This Government has, in its three years of office, spent a fair amount of money.  It will have added this year to the national expenditure for ordinary housekeeping expenses £28,000,000.  The national debt. according to the Minister's estimate at the Budget, will be up by £54,000,000 and, in addition, the dollar debt will be <Col N="2107" /> £41,000,000 or £42,000,000.  To complete the overall picture of how the Minister got the money, we have to add that our external assets were reduced by £60,000,000 in three years and we assumed a debt to America of £42,000,000.  It is a fact that the yield of certain taxes has increased and it is also a fact that the Minister has put on a number of new taxes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply dealing with the point made by the Minister that we did not know how to get the money, on which he dwelt for several columns.  I want to show that we realise that the Minister got the money in certain directions.  We also realise that, if the Minister had inflated somewhat more during the past three years, the yield of taxation at the same rates would have increased very much more. When the Minister introduced this system of borrowing for what was normally paid for out of taxation, I and others warned him that the result of carrying out that operation in an inflationary period would be to increase the cost of living, and also, seeing that we were not a closed economy, to increase our imports, with a consequential diminution in our external assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Borrowing for what a person should pay for out of his annual income is not something new.  Many people borrow and run their families into debt, instead of living within their annual income, but the children have to pay the bill.  Borrowing, instead of meeting their annual expenditures out of current revenue, is an old dodge of weak and unscrupulous Governments. The &ldquo;know how&rdquo; of spending what the Government are afraid to collect is as old as Methuselah.  The Minister knows how and he has not hesitated to put into effect his knowledge of how to avoid the political difficulty of taxation by passing the problem on to future taxpayers, and by inflating, which is a tax on the income of every consumer. The Minister tried to liken his inflationary campaign of these last couple of years to that of the late President Roosevelt when he assumed office.  I <Col N="2108" /> think the Minister missed the bus in that regard.  If there were two Governments who had the same financial outlook on the world in 1928 to 1932, they were the Governments that existed in this country, supplied by Fine Gael, and the American Government, under President Hoover.</P>
    <P>We had in America and elsewhere, as a consequence, the spectacle of prices falling rapidly, Government expenditure being curtailed, bank loans being curtailed, so that the queue of unemployed men grew ever longer.  We had in this country the spectacle of 30,000 people a year going out of the country, over 1,000 factories closing down, the worst housing situation in Western Europe, and we had the financial outlook of the then Government being expressed by General Mulcahy, who was then Minister for Local Government, when asked to give Government grants for the building of houses, to embark upon a campaign of rehousing our people, when he said that no such campaign could be entered upon until the cost of labour and the cost of material fell to a point at which houses could be built at such a cost that they could be let at an economic rent.  That was the old deal of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The fresh outlook brought to that problem by the Fianna Fáil Government enabled us to put State credit behind all productive enterprise.  The Industrial Credit Corporation was started with fresh funds.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation was encouraged to go ahead.  Housing grants were given on a large scale.  Fianna Fáil, in 1932, knew how to reverse the disastrous policy of Fine Gael up to 1932 and, during those years, we did much to restore the confidence of our people in themselves and in their ability to produce at home things which formerly had been imported.</P>

      <P>Our policy, prior to 1932, in 1932 and to this day, is to make the greatest possible use of our own resources in men and material, to build up the higher standard of life that the people are willing to produce.  We do not believe in miracles.  We do not believe that it is sufficient to wish for a thing to believe that it is either physically or financially possible.  We believe that what is physically possible is financially possible, but we do not go as far as to say that anything that is physically desirable is financially possible.  My quarrel with the Minister for Finance, in his effort to hang on to office until a judgeship or a chairmanship becomes vacant, is that he has operated the finances of this State to please all the tailends of the Government and to try to satisfy them altogether and to keep them going from day to day, week to week, and month to month.  If the Minister did not know what he was doing, I would have more sympathy with him, but the Minister deliberately embarked on an inflationary policy during an inflationary period, with his eyes open, knowing what the consequences would be, knowing that the consequences of pouring more money into an inflationary monetary situation, inevitably, must be to drive up the cost of living, to drive up costs of all kinds and to wipe out, for rather useless purposes, a lot of our reserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other countries have gone to great trouble in recent years to build up their monetary reserves, that is, their reserves of foreign currency or other valuables, such as gold.  In the last couple of years we have been acting as if our reserves were burning our fingers.  That was because the Minister would not face the political consequences to himself and his Party of acting truthfully and faithfully by the people.  We have always believed, and acted up to the belief, that wherever there was an opportunity of building up our reserves we should, if necessary, translate our external reserves into internal assets.  We did it all during the periods when it was possible to do it.  During the war it was impossible, and a reverse process took place.  In the last couple of years <Col N="2110" /> the Minister succeeded in getting rid of about £100,000,000 out of a possible net external asset reserve of £220,000,000, or thereabouts.  In three years he has almost succeeded in getting rid of half.  That was not bad going.  It did result, I admit, in keeping the Coalition in office for the three years and will have that result for some time longer.  The Minister knew the consequences of that policy.  Not only did the Minister know it, but his Leader, the Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, knew it.  On 5th August, 1948, when the Taoiseach came back from London, with the British Agreement of that year, he said&mdash;column 2146, Volume 112, Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the intervening period&rdquo;&mdash;that is from 1938&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the adverse trade balance has gone to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment or who looks at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.  The balance of payments between this country and Great Britain has, in recent years, become completely disordered. When we took office some months ago and became aware of the actual position in regard to the adverse trade balance and the nature and the alarming extent of that adverse trade balance it was one of the problems that gave us the greatest possible cause for dismay.  We felt that it was essential, if this country was to retain its economic stability, that steps must urgently be taken to redress that adverse balance of trade and to try and restore order into our disordered balance of payments. That was one of the big factors that we had to keep before us during our negotiations with Great Britain.  I am glad to say that we have been able to achieve agreement, embodied in the agreement that is before the House, as to the methods by which we will be enabled to deal with that very alarming and very urgent problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Taoiseach in 1948.  Now, lest it might be thought that the members of the Government were as <Col N="2111" /> disunited in their outlook on this problem of the adverse balance of trade a couple of years ago as they are on many other questions, let me quote what the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, said on the 4th May, 1948, in his Budget statement, as reported at column 1050, Volume 110.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The direct State debt of £104.8 million at 31st March last compares with £100.8 million at 31st March, 1947, and £37.6 million at 31st March, 1932.  We have been fortunate in not having been forced into debt to the same extent as other countries, but £105,000,000 is a large total.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that large total debt of £105,000,000 was £10,000,000 which went into the Ultimate Financial Settlement with the British, under which we got rid of an annual payment of £5,000,000. In it also were many millions of pounds advanced to all sorts of public concerns, of advances to the Agricultural and to the Industrial Credit Corporation and to other people for the building up of agriculture and industry here.  The Minister then said that £105,000,000 was a large total. That total has been driven up in less than three years by the Minister's estimate of £58,000,000.  The Minister was aware, back in 1948, that the disappearance of external assets, without any corresponding upbuilding of our internal capital here, was something to be avoided.  The Minister also knows that the building up of State debt simply for the purpose of avoiding taxation is also a disastrous policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when replying on the Vote on Account last week, quoted what he said, through one of his colleagues, at a bankers' dinner on the 18th November, 1950.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But this I must stress&mdash;the value of money must be tenaciously defended if we are to preserve the incentive to work and save and ensure orderly economic development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking directly here in the House at column 1620, on the same day, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" />&ldquo;Last year we tried to get the people to understand what our purpose was.  We said that we were about to indulge in a particular capital expenditure programme and we hoped we would get our return in the following manner; productivity would inevitably rise by so much as would bear over a generation the increased cost required to remunerate the moneys borrowed.  If we get that, the borrowing will be easy.  If we do not get it, the borrowing will be a bit of a headache; and, if the country's productivity fails completely, then the borrowing may be, what it is now described as being, a millstone round the people's necks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, when the Minister is on the Bench or in some chair in a couple of years, the headache will be somebody else's.  The result of inflation in other countries has been where the ports are not as open, as they are here, to drive up the cost of living very much more rapidly than it has been driven up here.  I pointed out to the Minister two years ago that in France, in the year 1947, the mere borrowing of a few billions of French francs and the spending of them, resulted in one year in the cost of living being doubled The cost of living has not doubled in this country in the last few years because people were not confined in spending the increased amount of money pushed around on the limited quantity of goods produced within the country, but because all our ports were open to the inflow of a lot of useless products upon which the money was spent.  The result is that the cost of living has gone up only a few per cent. so far, but the tendency is there, and do not let the Minister or any of the other Ministers, tell me that the increased cost of living to date is a consequence of the war in Korea, or of any other war, or projected war.</P>

      <P>The price freeze has been held on foodstuffs, and the great increase that has taken place in certain raw materials has not yet come into <Col N="2113" /> operation.  We may take it that if by any chance our imports were to be closed off, instead of going down the cost of living would go up very much because the money that would be spent on purchasing foreign goods, thereby liquidating our external reserves, would be concentrated on buying the products available within the country from our own resources, either from our current production or from the stocks in the shops.  If such a thing happened, we should see prices rise in style.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his Budget speech of 1949 that he realised the consequences of the action he took in 1949 and 1950 in borrowing for what should have been met out of taxation in an inflationary period.  In that Budget speech he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The scope and scale of State capital projects raise questions which have a vital bearing on Irish monetary stability and the avoidance of inflation in the methods to finance these projects is a consideration of high importance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government was not behind any Government in seeking to build up our productive capacity so that we might have an increasing standard of living for an ever-increasing population.  However, we realised the consequences of trying to do more than we could do.  In an inflationary situation we were prepared to compel our people to save for the building up of our productive capacity in industry, agriculture and social matters such as housing.  In our last year of office, notwithstanding that it was unpopular, we collected £3,000,000 in taxation for farm improvements and housing grants.  The Minister proposes to borrow £12,000,000 this year for these purposes and he borrowed £12,000,000 last year also.  We want these things done but we want them done without having ill-effects on any other portion of our economy.  The worst way to tax the ordinary working man, the person with a fixed income of any kind, is by inflation&mdash;and the £12,000,000 that the Minister is raising by borrowing for this expenditure is a taxation by inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> The cost of living has gone up 4 or 5 per cent. in the past couple of years and that rate of increase is due to the Minister's inflationary policy.  If he had not permitted inflation to that extent, we would have had a decrease in the cost of living rather than an increase. It is all right for Deputy Cowan and those who are pushing the Minister for Finance along these disastrous lines to encourage him to proceed not only to the ruination of the people who have fixed incomes at the present time, but also to place a heavy burden on future taxpayers.  The people who want to see this country progress in an orderly fashion will urge the Minister to pay his way as he goes.</P>

      <P>Let us take the figures. The Taoiseach viewed with the utmost alarm the extent of our adverse trade balance in 1948.  It was a cause for dismay.  It was something that must urgently be reversed.  From 1939 to 1946, we built up our external assets by £140,000,000.  In 1946 they had gone up by £20,000,000.  In 1947 we reduced them by £20,000,000.  It was that, I think, that gave the Taoiseach cause for alarm&mdash;the fact that we had dropped a mere bagatelle of £20,000,000.  Inside the past three years we have dropped £60,000,000 and we have increased our external liabilities by £42,000,000.  Effectively, we have dropped £100,000,000.  That is a direct <Col N="2115" /> consequence of the Minister's inflationary policy.  If we had not imported that £100,000,000 worth of goods and if the inflationary expenditure by the Minister had not occurred, the cost of living, instead of going up 5 per cent., would have dropped by 5 per cent.</P>

We must add to that the £42,000,000 external debt in the shape of American loans.  That adds up to £102,000,000, if the Minister wants to be accurate.

I believe that it is no ill thing for either an individual or a nation to have some reserve.  I also believe that it is foolish for an individual or a nation to keep a reserve of money in the bank or invested if by investing that money within the farm or business of the individual or within the territory of the State it can increase the standard of living, that is if those <Col N="2116" /> savings can be translated into productive assets.  I think it very foolish, however, for a country or an individual to spend the reserve just to go on a spree.  If an individual has a few pounds in the bank it would be very foolish for him to spend it simply on giving his friends a good time for a year or two, and then to have to go into debt in the bank, leaving his children to meet the bill.  It is very foolish for a State to spend its reserve and go into debt to give the Government's friends a good time for a couple of years.  I must admit that from the point of view of avoiding headaches and of taking things easy, the present Government have had a good time. They have had the spending of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The poor fellow with the pint was going to die with thrist; everyone who wanted a drop of whiskey was lying in an extremity of death and could not be saved except by that drop of whiskey which we were putting out of his reach; people would cough themselves to death if they could not get cigarettes cheaply.

We, however, were not prepared, in order to get a few votes, to give the country a policy which would increase the cost of living, reduce our external assets by a half inside a couple of years and add 50 per cent. to the national debt, and ask the people for all of the next 30 years to pay that national debt with an annual sum for interest and sinking fund amounting to the total of that Supplementary Budget which so delighted Deputy Cowan.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go back over the ground covered so well by Deputy Aiken in the discussion. Provoked by Deputy Cowan, I would like to say a few words on our attitude to the supplementary taxes imposed in October, 1947.  I would like to repeat what Deputy Aiken said, that we are not ashamed of having imposed those taxes and that in vast areas of the country the people showed by their votes that they understood the nature of those taxes and continued to give confidence to the same number of Deputies of our Party as they had given in 1944.  I regard it as the lowest kind of politics to try to win an election on the price of stout or the price of tobacco.  I regard that as the lowest kind of politics, a thing all of us should try to avoid, since once you bring politics down to that level it is impossible for any elector to consider the many complicated issues before he makes his final choice.  If he has always to be driven to the point of considering his immediate selfish interest, we should have no nation.  no advancement, no reconstruction, nothing. Everything would depend on simply satisfying the selfish desires of any one individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to record again in this House for, I think, the third time, that I myself told everyone in Westmeath and County Longford that I could speak to at that time, that if, because they would rather smoke five cigarettes instead of four, they were prepared to throw the Government out, we did not want them to vote for us.  That was <Col N="2119" /> a frank way of speaking and it did not result in our losing any votes, noticeably, in my constituency.  If that point had been stressed even more in other areas, we would probably have lost less than we did in those areas where we lost a few seats.  It is the frank way of telling the people.  They will discover before they have finished that, as far as this Government is concerned, there are worse ways of dealing with the money a man spends than taxing his beer.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Aiken says, the cost of living has been going up as a result of the Government's inflationary programme and it would have gone up more if it were not for the fact that we have been rapidly spending our external assets, as the Minister for Finance says, on unnecessary luxuries. I should like the Minister for Finance to give us a little exposé of his present financial views, what he really believes. On the Vote on Account, he hinted that we were borrowing more than we were saving and that we were spending too much on unnecessary luxuries abroad.  He made a vague appeal to stop buying luxuries.  It is an idiotic thing to do, as you cannot alter consumption habits on the part of a people by making one reference, one appeal, in a debate which lasted for days and in which we noticed that none of the other Deputies in his Party made the same appeal.  There was no national appeal to reduce the drain on external assets.  There was the Minister's pitiful, solitary appeal to the public to stop spending money on goods which were not necessary and which were reducing our external resources.</P>
    <P>It is just as well, since we hear so much from Clann na Poblachta about bringing back external assets, that we should give the Fianna Fáil point of view about it.  The only result of the Clann na Poblachta campaign for bringing back external assets has been a wasting of them on unnecessary goods.  The Fianna Fáil view is perfectly simple.  First of all, it is a very good thing to have a reasonable reserve in a country with whom you trade, for buying goods.  That is a reasonable thing to state and it has been to our <Col N="2120" /> immense benefit for years and years. Secondly, it is much better to invest whatever money we have in Irish industry and production, if we can do it in a sane, sensible way.  I suppose the simplest and most elementary description of the Fianna Fáil view on the repatriation of external assets would be this.  If you have £100 invested in British war loan and you are getting £3 a year on it and with the £3 you buy a pair of British boots, it would be much better to spend that £100 on boot making machinery, bring it over here and set it up in Ireland. That is a sound policy on repatriating foreign assets.  We do not believe in spending them on unnecessary goods or that we are wasting our assets in bringing in machinery of that kind which would have the effect of increasing production.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Finance again whether he can give any idea of the proportion of those external assets which was spent on vital stockpiling or on machinery useful to production.  He told us in the course of the Vote on Account that he was unable to give figures accurately, but he feared that a great deal had been spent on unnecessary articles.  Has he in the interval been able to get any further information? If a large sum were spent on stockpiling for a possible emergency one could justify the expenditure, but he did not give us that reassurance.  He was not able to give it.  He could not say if this money were spent on wool or cotton cloth or agricultural machinery, on parts, or on materials for defensive warfare or anything of that kind.  He was extremely pessimistic and we would like to hear if he has any new information.</P>
    <P>We have been challenged by Deputy Cowan and others as to whether we approve of an increase of 2/6 in the old age pensions.  It is not a question of whether we approve or not.  The question we have to face is that the Government, so far as we can gather, have no real over-all financial plan. We never know when a new Estimate is coming in, in order to maintain the Coalition in office.  We have no objection to an increase of 2/6 in the old <Col N="2121" /> age pension.  We increased it ourselves by 5/- in 1947.  We added 50 per cent. to unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance and national health insurance in 1947 without charging the contributors.  The charge was put on the contributors afterwards, by the present Government. We are quite used to increasing social services.  We started the children's allowances.  We know all about spending money on social services. When we start to raise questions about expenditure, it is because the expenditure is unplanned.  We never know when it is going to stop.  We have had expenditure estimated at £1,000,000 for old age pensions, £12,000,000 for the mother and child scheme and £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 for the social security scheme.  We never know when these increases will stop. Most of them are carried out by Ministers who themselves on many occasions declared against, and completely against, the extension of social services.</P>
    <P>We can all argue about a Coalition having marginal differences of opinion on policy.  I do not think it is good for a country's stability or for a country's political honour, to have views so different as those that obtain between Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta in regard to a matter which is vital to this country, the extension of social security.  I am going to quote again the Minister for Finance because he cannot be quoted too often. He is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of March 19th, 1949, as having stated in Dublin:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He wished that he could get the opinion expressed at meetings where social services were claimed as being something good that they were nothing of the sort for the bulk of the community.  They were not anything to be clamoured for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, on the same occasion, as reported in the same newspaper, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was a danger in the development of the social services that the people would lose their sense of independence.  Social services were not something to be <Col N="2122" /> proud of.  They should be used like medicine and kept in a locker until they were required to treat disease or illness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, we on this side of the House do not object to the increase in the old age pension.  The Government have raised the cost of living so much that the old age pensioners no doubt will deserve that increase.  But we do object to the trotting out of Estimates involving huge amounts solely with a view to maintaining in office a Government consisting of people who differ very widely on matters of fundamental importance, because there may be, as I said, differences on matters even more fundamental which would shake the fabric of the country. I wonder whether Deputy Cowan agrees with the Minister for Finance's views on the social services.</P>

      <P>Does he think the Minister could alter his views fundamentally on a question like that in so short a period of time?  In discussing all these questions, I should like to challenge the members of Clann na Poblachta to beg the Minister to reverse his financial policy to the extent that there will be some external assets left to spend on production and on machinery for industry, because at the rate the country is going there will not be much left to spend on the objects for which Clann na Poblachta stated the money should be spent.  We should like very much to hear them appeal to the Minister and say: &ldquo;The spending is going the wrong way.  You are not spending on machinery or on increased production; you are frittering it away on luxuries.  You should reverse that and see if we cannot get the money spent on capital goods.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We have always had that point of view.  We were not too extreme.  We had a balanced point of view about finance; by not borrowing too much and borrowing if we thought it was a wise scheme of national reconstruction, and not to <Col N="2123" /> trot out expenditure to the tune of £16,000,000 in the course of a few months in order to maintain our Government in office.  We simply planned our expenditure as well as we could. We did not have, comparatively speaking, boom days for agriculture.  We did not have a Government in a position to negotiate a price for butter such as the Danes got.  We have heard a lot about that already from Deputy Corry.  We did not live in an atmosphere of being able to negotiate for famine prices.  We had an economic war to face and we had even a world war to get through.  My own view is that when history is written 50 years from now, allowing for the social and economic conditions under which we worked, it can be said that, in the expenditure of the money we spent and the money we borrowed, we did more national building than will be ever done by this Government in the course of their lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Aiken and Deputy Childers discuss this Bill.  One thing which, I think, Deputies probably do understand now regarding the Fianna Fáil policy towards spending money&mdash;I should like to be challenged on this by Deputy Aiken if I am incorrect&mdash;whether the money is being spent on projects of capital development or ordinary current expenditure, is that they say that their policy is to get all that money by taxation.  In recent years the only exception to that rule which has come to light as far as Fianna Fáil were concerned was their project with regard to the erection of new parliamentary buildings in Dublin.  I think it was conceded by Fianna Fáil Deputies that as far as that was concerned, as far as knocking down a vast area of the City of Dublin, including some churches and hospitals, was concerned, they would permit that type of work to be done on borrowed money.  But, as far as housing for the working classes and as far as other matters for which the present Minister for Finance is borrowing money are concerned, Deputy Aiken, Deputy Lemass, Deputy Childers and the other occupants of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench have time <Col N="2124" /> and again made it clear that their policy would be to get that money by taxation.</P>
      <P>Without endeavouring to discuss the social security scheme, I want to make a passing reference to it in connection with this matter.  In so far as the Fianna Fáil Party claim to have an alternative to the social security scheme as produced by the Tánaiste, their alternative is that all the money to finance that scheme is to come out of taxation, that none of it is to be obtained by increased contributions.  I think it is quite clear that if the Fianna Fáil policy is as I state, that all the various matters are to be financed out of taxation, the people of this country should be invited to consider what their plight would be at the moment if the Fianna Fáil Government were still in office.  I think it will be admitted by Fianna Fáil Deputies that the Supplementary Budget taxes would not have been removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Vote on Account, Deputy Aiken startled me somewhat by claiming that the Supplementary Budget taxes on beer, tobacco and entertainments were intended to be for one year only.  But it seems quite clear, from the few words which Deputy Childers spoke here this evening and Deputy Aiken before him, that the argument was merely used as a debating point in discussing the Vote on Account, and that it was shot out by Deputy Aiken without any very mature consideration.  I understood Deputy Childers's speech this evening to be in effect, not alone that he was not ashamed of the Supplementary Budget taxation, but that if Fianna Fáil were there still, the Supplementary Budget taxes would still be in existence.  I think it is a fair assumption that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office the people could expect a reimposition of those taxes. Deputy Aiken and Deputy Childers have made it quite clear that their policy is to tax the people.  Whatever development is to go on in this country, whether of a capital nature or not, whatever improvements of social services are to be given to the people of this country, all of that must come out of taxation, according to the enunciation of Fianna <Col N="2125" /> Fáil policy which we have heard from Deputy Aiken and Deputy Childers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken spent some time in discussing the reduction of our external assets and the manner in which that money was being used, the type of imports which came into the country in the last year.  I think it is true that the Minister for Finance did express some disappointment that a large proportion of the imports were of a non-essential nature.  I think he would express very much more disappointment if he reflected on the type of imports which came into this country when Deputy Lemass was Minister for Supplies and Minister for Industry and Commerce.  All of us remember very clearly, particularly the ex-soldier who was induced to put his gratuity, as part of the Fianna Fáil resettlement scheme, into the manufacture of confectionery, the type of imports which were allowed by Deputy Lemass. I think he remembers the various types of sweets and chocolates which flooded the Irish market just when some hundreds of ex-soldiers and officers were being persuaded by Deputy Lemass's colleague, Deputy Traynor, as part of the Fianna Fáil resettlement scheme, to engage in the manufacture and production of confectionery. I think, too, that the workers in the boot factory in Drogheda remember how, in the years 1946 and 1947&mdash;at any rate, I would be surprised if his colleague, Deputy Aiken, had not remonstrated with Deputy Lemass about this&mdash;the Irish market was flooded with imports of foreign boots and foreign shoes.  I think they remember that at least one of the factories in Drogheda, if it did not shut down completely, was reduced to the position of only being able to work part-time.  I do not know what the reduction in staff was, but I know there was a considerable reduction due to the policy of the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce in allowing in certain types of imports.</P>
    <P>We all remember, too, how the market here was flooded immediately after the war with fancy breakfast foods from America.  Indeed, I think the present Government has a right to regret bitterly the manner in which dollars were wasted at that particular <Col N="2126" /> time.  Dollars are valuable now; they were also valuable then.  All of us remember that for a considerable period &mdash;I do not think the imports stopped until the change of Government, though I may be wrong in that&mdash;fancy American breakfast foods were imported in large quantities under Deputy Lemass's administration.  I could give various other examples but I think I have said sufficient to indicate the general type of imports which were allowed by Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and by Deputy Aiken, the Minister for Finance, in the closing stages of the Fianna Fáil régime.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be wrong with the imports brought in last year, the manner in which the external assets were spent, it is right to say that no Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches, and particularly the two Deputies who were responsible for the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce respectively, is entitled to be critical of the type of imports to-day and the manner in which our external assets are being used having regard to their own record and to the hardships they imposed on many sections of our people because of their activities in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers said he was not ashamed and he did not think that Fianna Fáil as a whole should be ashamed of the Supplementary Budget. Perhaps they are not ashamed of it, but I doubt very much if they like to be reminded of it too often.  Deputy Childers spoke of the difference between the Fine Gael outlook on social service and the Labour outlook.  He quoted a speech made by the Minister in 1949.  Had he been a little bit more diligent he would have been able to give the House the benefit of other speeches made by the Minister when he was Deputy McGilligan.  I do not believe there is anything either contradictory or inconsistent in the speeches made by the Minister for Finance when he was in opposition and the speeches made by him since he took office.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone can claim that there is any inherent good in State social services as such.  The Minister's point of view as expressed by him time <Col N="2127" /> and time again, and it is one with which I fully agree, is that if you can get on without State social services by making your people more prosperous, by giving them good employment and good conditions, by raising the national income and the general standard of living, and by encouraging your people to make provision for the future, you will reduce the necessity for State social services and I believe that ultimately that is what we should aim at; I am not saying now that we can do without State social services at the moment.  While they are necessary, I believe we should endeavour to make the schemes as good as possible. I do not think there is any inconsistency whatever in the two points of view.  I hope to have an opportunity of disillusioning Deputy Childers when the Social Welfare Bill is being further considered; he is completely wrong in endeavouring to make the case that Fine Gael were at any time opposed to a comprehensive scheme of social security.  That has been a prominent point in Fine Gael policy as printed in their literature in the past and enunciated by their leaders from time to time. Deputy Childers took credit for the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government introduced the children's allowances scheme.  I think they are entitled to credit for that, but I think the present Minister for Education and the present Minister for Agriculture are also entitled to credit as being the instigators of the idea here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Childers did not seem to be quite as enthusiastic as his financial leader, Deputy Aiken, on this idea of taxation for everything and for everyone, taxation for all the schemes that are put into operation.  I think the Minister will probably deal with some of the results of Deputy Aiken's thinking, when he was thinking aloud here this evening.  It did seem to me somewhat far-fetched, coming particularly from an ex-Minister for Finance, <Col N="2130" /> that, in the absence of the Deputy Leader, who had spoken at length with his usual assertiveness on the Vote on Account, Deputy Aiken should come out with that proposition.</P>
      <P>It will be remembered that, when dealing with the Vote on Account, Deputy Lemass had the grace to admit that the various items of capital development, the various projects which the Minister was standing over as proper items of capital development, were all good projects, all proper projects of capital development, and that they were all sound investments. I think the very use of the word &ldquo;investment&rdquo; with regard to them would seem to indicate that Fianna Fáil were prepared to consider them as such and they were prepared to invest money in them.  I think money invested in these schemes of capital development obviously should be borrowed and not taken out of the people's pockets in any one year.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Finance at some time to while away a happy hour totting up what would be the bill if he were to take the advice of Fianna Fáil Deputies at its face value. If he were to allow all these schemes of capital development to stand, what would finance them?  Would it be all out of taxation in the same year?  If, in addition to that, he was to allow to proceed the various Fianna Fáil schemes which were either discontinued by the present Government or which were just bubbling to the surface and had not quite reached the surface before the change of Government, such as the scheme for a new Parliament building, how would we find the money?</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to do a little sum in arithmetic some day and give the House the result.  The people are entitled to know it.  We must remember that Fianna Fáil seriously put themselves forward as an alternative Government, with an alternative policy.  If they were serious in that, I think they would be the first&mdash;being the honest men they are&mdash;to admit that their policy should reach the people and the probable effects of that policy should be considered by the people before they are called upon to cast their votes at a general election. Obviously, the ordinary elector will have some interest in knowing whether he can expect increased taxation or reduced taxation by the return of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

He expressed himself as proud that he had the honour to introduce the Supplementary Budget of 1947, the Budget which was ultimately responsible for removing the Fianna Fáil Government from office.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in office was a tough bird, a tough nut to crack, and many efforts had been made over a number of years, but it took the intelligent effort of Deputy Aiken to cook the Fianna Fáil goose.

We have kept the price of those articles down without that particular Budget, and we have kept them down for the last three years without that Budget. That Budget was expressive of the state of mind of Fianna Fáil.  In other <Col N="2132" /> words, they had got into the state of mind that they could not be defeated. They saw opposing them Fine Gael, Farmers, Labour and Clann na Poblachta and I suppose, reasonably, they came to the conclusion that it would be impossible for these Parties to come together and oust them, and at the back of their minds they had the programme which they intended to put into operation, the programme which was to make slaves of the industrial workers of this country, the programme drafted actually into the Bill which would prevent wages being increased.</P>

We will make the people suffer and make the people pay.&rdquo;  Fortunately, it was possible to bring about a state of affairs whereby in a democratic and constitutional manner that Fianna Fáil Government with that mentality was put out of office.

      <P>Before we came into office&mdash;before Fianna Fáil were defeated&mdash;there was not a bed for a patient suffering from tuberculosis anywhere in the country.</P>

      <P>We have created a new scheme of hospital building which ensures that no person suffering from tuberculosis will have to suffer or fail to get cured because of lack of hospital accommodation or lack of beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention one very vital matter&mdash;a thing which I think was never done before in this country nor in any other country.  When we came to deal with the transport situation, with the railway, with this difficult position of Córas Iompair Éireann not only did we deal with it by providing the finances for it but we gave a guarantee of continued employment to every one of those 20,000 workers who were engaged in the Córas Iompair Éireann concern.  Could Deputy Lemass ever even have thought that it was possible to give such a guarantee to workers in any industry in this country?  Deputy Davin reminds me that the Fianna Fáil programme, the Lemass programme, the de Valera programme, to deal only with politicians, <Col N="2135" /> was to dismiss 3,500 railway workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Deputy Davin will be speaking subsequently and he will give the exact figures.  Our policy was to guarantee employment to the workers and not to hold up the spectre of dismissal.  That was an important thing.  It shows the mentality that is on this side of the House and the mentality that is on the opposite side.</P>
      <P>Somebody mentioned the cost of living. We have reached this stage in regard to living in this country that for the first time the complete butter production of this country has been consumed by the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>700,000 cwt. of butter have been bought and eaten by the people of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We sold some of it, believing the people could not eat so much but, when we found they were able to eat it, it was not a question of cutting the ration, as Fianna Fáil would have done.  The Minister for Agriculture imported the quantity of butter necessary to ensure that the people could eat as much butter as they liked.  Ten or 12 years ago&mdash; and I remember mentioning this from various political platforms at the time &mdash;we were exporting 400,000 cwt. of butter every year.  We were paying a subsidy on that butter so that John Bull could buy it much cheaper than we could buy it here.  Why did we export these 400,000 cwt. of butter? Because the workers of the country had not the wages to enable them to buy the butter, cheap and all as it was, at the time.  We had to export it and to pay John Bull to eat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to housing, can Deputy Lemass or anybody in Fianna Fáil say that we have not made extraordinary <Col N="2136" /> strides in the provision of housing in the past three years?  In a very short time, there will be no housing problem in the rural areas in this country.  In Dublin we are attacking the housing problem; the corporation is tackling it and they are getting every facility and co-operation from the Government and the Department of Local Government. Anyone who is in touch with people who are looking for houses can see the vast improvement there is in the situation from day to day.  In another few years we shall have solved the housing problem in Dublin for the first time in the history of the city.</P>
    <P>I have only touched on a few of what I might term the main headlines or outlines of Government activities for three years to show the difference there is between the inter-Party Government and the Fianna Fáil Government, but that is not the end of it all. We have introduced a social welfare scheme, and it is a scheme which is going to look after the worker from the cradle to the grave.  Because of certain criticism from certain uninformed sources, it was thought by Fianna Fáil that it would be a good plan or policy to wreck this Government on that scheme, but they were just as mistaken as they were in 1947. In spite of Deputy de Valera's visit to Cavan to give his opinion of the social welfare scheme, we have now reached the position that when the Second Reading of the Bill comes to this House, there will be no opposition to it from Deputy Lemass or anybody else.  I defy Deputy Lemass to vote against the social welfare scheme on its Second Stage in this House.  Then we have the other scheme which is announced as an ancillary to or part of the general scheme of social welfare&mdash;the mother and child welfare scheme.  Those are the indications of the mentality behind this Government, the mentality of trying to run the country in the interests of the country. That may offend the financial concepts of Deputy Aiken.  It may offend the financial concepts of Deputy Childers, but when it is a matter of happiness and prosperity for the people of the country, I say to hell with financial concepts.  On that note I finish my contribution to the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan has referred to the Government's social welfare proposals, and he did so for the purpose of suggesting that Deputies on the far side of the House are more concerned with the interests of the people who need State assistance than Deputies on this side.  I want to make a proposition to him in regard to the increase in old age pensions. In regard to the main part of the Government's proposal, to make it effective all they need do is to change one word in the Old Age Pensions Act. I invite the Government to get a Bill making that change drafted to-night, to ask the Dáil to meet to-morrow, and to submit it to the Dáil.  It can then be passed through the Dáil to-morrow, and become law next week. Is that not a fair offer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You decided to put that into the Social Welfare Bill, even though the Bill, as originally drafted, did not provide for it, in order to overcome objections to that Bill which had been expressed by Deputies who normally support the Government. You are not changing the amount of the old age pension because you want to improve the lot of the old age pensioner or because you want to restore the purchasing power of the pension to what it was before the war. You are doing this in order to overcome the political difficulty which you anticipated if you proceeded with the Bill as it was originally drafted.  Is that not true?  If you are trying to pretend that the increase in the old age pension is the outcome of any concern for old age pensioners, then I invite you to come before the Dáil to-morrow with the one-clause Bill necessary to make the change, and I <Col N="2138" /> guarantee to you that it will be passed into law before a week is out.  You will not do that because you were not interested in the old age pensioners at all until you began to realise that there was a likelihood that you might lose your jobs if the Social Welfare Bill were proceeded with in its original form.  Is there one amongst the Deputies opposite who did not profess themselves to be satisfied with the Social Welfare Bill as originally introduced without any provision for the old age pensioners?</P>

      <P>You were sweating behind the scenes.  Your knees were shaking behind the scenes.  You thought you were going out of office, as you would go out of office if there was a general election.  Then you went to the Minister for Finance, the Minister who promised to cut down Government expenditure before he took office, and having the same anxiety as you had, he coughed up £1,500,000 to enable you to increase these pensions.  <i>(Interruptions.)</i></P>
      <P>Why did you not hold out for a 25/- pension?  The Deputies who are interrupting me promised the old age pensioners a pension of 25/- a week.  They could have got it just as easily as the £1 per week.  All you had to do was to hold out long enough and he would have given you 25/- per week.  Are you satisfied with 20/-? Do you think it is enough?  Will one of you answer me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came in here on this debate expecting to hear a discussion upon the Central Fund Bill which the Minister for Finance has proposed consequential upon the introduction this year of Estimates for Government services which establish an all-time record.  Instead of that, we are discussing the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1947.  Whatever Fianna Fáil did in 1947 is done. Whether it was wise or foolish, it is over&mdash;it is on the record.  Whether it got us votes or lost us votes, there is nothing we can do about it.  We are discussing the administration of the Coalition Government in 1951, a Government who opposed that Budget on <Col N="2139" /> the ground that it imposed an intolerable financial burden on the Irish community. It involved governmental expenditure that year to the level of £59,000,000.  This year, it will be £83,000,000.  If £59,000,000 was an intolerable burden in 1947, what adjective describes a burden of £83,000,000 in 1951?  Do you not think that the occasion of a Central Fund Bill of this character should be taken advantage of by some Coalition Deputy to explain just why it is they failed so dismally to fulfil their promise to reduce the cost of Government services, to fulfil their promise of a policy of retrenchment? There is still plenty of time before the Dáil adjourns to give us that explanation, if there is one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan knows the right answers and, not being subject to any Party whip, was not deterred from giving them, because the whole administration of Government since the Coalition came into office has been directed to one purpose and one purpose only&mdash;to keep it in office.  Whenever any political danger threatened the Government which could be averted by spending money, the money was found, the policy of retrenchment was forgotten, and more will be found, and the only thing on which I feel like commenting in that regard is the reluctance of the Labour Party to use their power in full.  Why have they trimmed down their demands?  Why have they forgotten the programme they fought the election on?  Every single item of that programme can be put into effect now, if they want it.</P>

      <P>We do not mind.  We prefer to stand for the best policy on this side than for the worst policy on the other side.  A great deal of play has been made with the various matters the Fianna Fáil Government discussed from time to time and did not proceed with.  The Minister for Finance has established a precedent&mdash; understand that it is a precedent&mdash;of quoting from confidential documents circulated to the previous Cabinet in relation to various matters discussed there, and has endeavoured, upon the basis of these documents, to misrepresent what the previous Government were proposing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in confessing that many times during my years as a Minister, I put up propositions to the Government of which I was a member which were turned down by that Government, and which were turned down for reasons I accepted, because it seemed to me that the arguments advanced against them were stronger than the arguments I could advance in favour of them.  I do not mind confessing also that there were many times when other Ministers brought before that Cabinet propositions which I did not like and the withdrawal of which followed upon the arguments which were advanced against them.  If this <Col N="2141" /> precedent is to be established in our political life, I am quite certain that some time I will have a most enjoyable time reading the minutes which are now circulated to the Cabinet in relation to various proposals which from time to time raised their heads in the Coalition Benches and were never seen again. I could spend half an hour referring to projects that individual Ministers on the benches opposite stated they were going to embark upon and then forgot about, because, presumably, when they brought these propositions to the Cabinet, they were rejected, and rejected perhaps for a good reason.</P>
    <P>I do not care what documents you quote in relation to any of these matters to which reference has been made here.  I would much prefer that all the documents were made available for public examination, or at least for examination by Deputies.  I do not mind confessing that many times during those war years, or in the two more difficult years that followed the war, we thought it necessary to embark upon courses of action, or to examine the wisdom of embarking on courses of action, which we would not contemplate now, actions which would have no relation to present-day circumstances.  Surely, in 1951, we adult men should be able to discuss policy for 1951 with reference to the facts as we know them and not solely for the purpose of scoring some debating point by quoting partially and unfairly from documents relating to ideas discussed four or five years ago.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, I am quite prepared to let the record of the Fianna Fáil Government during the war years stand as a whole. <Col N="2142" /> The Minister for Finance can say that I was in favour of this form of control or that form of control.  That may be true or it may not be true.  In so far as our aim was to bring this nation through the war with a minimum of hardship for its people, with a minimum of damage to its economy and with the capacity within it to go forward, as soon as war-time difficulties were over, to economic expansion, to the improvement of the social welfare services, I claim we did it and did it reasonably well.  We made plenty mistakes, of course&mdash;not half as many as this Government are making&mdash;but the net result was good, and on the net result I am prepared to stand before any group of Irish electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly true that I said here during the debate on the Vote on Account that the public of this country want capital expenditure upon housing, drainage, afforestation, telephone development, electricity development and all the things that are in the Government's capital investment list.  I could double that list.  I could name as many other activities in which capital could be invested usefully and should be invested, if we had it.  Deputy O'Higgins appears to think that money borrowed and spent upon these capital purposes is not money taken out of the pockets of our citizens.  If it does not come out of the pockets of our citizens, where does it come from?  It is quite true that at the present time the nation has the benefit of substantial funds contributed by the American authorities. A sum of £40,000,000 is available in the Counterpart Fund for capital investment purposes here.  I often lie awake at night thinking of what we might have done in the years before the war if we had had half that sum made available here by the Americans or by somebody else.  Do you really think you are making the best use of it?  Do you think that this passing advantage which the nation now has is being availed of to give it permanent advantages which will enable it to pay its way when, next year, that revenue dries up?  Is it not true that a substantial part of that money has been dissipated in the higher cost of Government <Col N="2143" /> administration?  Is it not true that some of it has been used to meet Budget deficits used in that way because of the reluctance of the Minister for Finance to balance his Budget, his inflated Budget, by increasing taxation?</P>
    <P>I think that is what the record will be of these five years, a period of tremendous advantage, with the whole world situation favouring economic expansion here, with this tremendous financial asset of £40,000,000 given us free by the great United States of America.  Can you show, as compared with the development of the five years before the war, anything comparable as a result of these advantages?  We had not a world situation such as now exists.  We had every country in the world trying to dump goods on our shores, subsidising exports, subsidising shipping freights, trying to break down our efforts to build up industries by under-selling.  We had a world-wide slump.  We had an economic war on top of that.  We had nobody giving us money for nothing but everyone demanding that we should pay them money.  Yet, I would say, the record of that five years will stand in comparison with the record of these last five years and we have no need to be ashamed of the comparison.</P>
    <P>I am not going to deny that progress has been made in housing.  I will controvert the assertion that that progress would not have taken place under any Government, and I am not talking about the Fianna Fáil Government only.  Is housing a political matter, a matter of Party controversy?  Has it not been said by people on each side of the House that there is one matter upon which we are not in disagreement, the need to eliminate the legacy of slums that we got from years of British misrule by building decent homes for our people through the local authorities?  Is there a single Deputy opposite who believes that there would be one house less built if a Fianna Fáil Government were in office or if a Labour Government were in office or a Clann na Poblachta Government or a Fine Gael Government?</P>

      <P>When Deputy Cowan talks about hospitalisation, is it necessary to lie, to say that there was not a single bed for a tuberculosis patient in this country in 1947?  Will Deputy Cowan or any Deputy opposite name one hospital that has been built since that was not begun or planned before the change of Government?</P>
      <P>We have now certain problems which are grave enough to be securing the attention of this House without all this effort to score Party points, and it is in relation to those problems that we have been endeavouring in the past few weeks to get some information from the Government.  Price control is one of them.  I think there has been a complete mishandling of this price control situation, and I am anxious to get from the Government some elucidation of the principles upon which they are working.</P>
      <P>We know that an Order was made on 2nd January freezing the prices of a number of goods.  Last week, an advertisement was surreptitiously put into the newspapers amending that Order significantly.  There was no statement from the Government Information Bureau.  There was none of the ballyhoo which accompanied the making of the original Order.  An advertising agency came late at night to each newspaper with a vaguely worded Order which merely said: &ldquo;The schedule of the Price Control Order will be amended by substituting the following list for the list already appearing therein.&rdquo;  It appeared in every newspaper on a Saturday morning. It will show how astutely the advertisement was framed when not a single newspaper in this country grasped its significance or made any editorial reference to it.  It was not until the following day that people began to wake up to the fact that the whole price freezing Order had been put into the discard, or appeared to have been put into the discard.  Subsequently, the Minister for Finance revealed that the goods which appeared to have been decontrolled by that amending Order were not decontrolled at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was there not issued with that advertisement an explanatory statement <Col N="2145" /> of the reasons why the Government was making the change, what the effect of the change was, so as to help the trading community and the buying public of this country to understand the position?</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of what I have in mind.  The Price Control Order made on 2nd January applied to potatoes and it was expressed to apply to the wholesale and retail prices of potatoes.  At that time, the wholesale price of potatoes in Dublin was £11 per ton, but the Order was retrospective in its effect and purported to fix, as maximum prices, those which prevailed upon 2nd December, 1950.  On 2nd December, 1950, the wholesale price of potatoes was £9 a ton.  The position, therefore, was that, under that Order, the wholesale price of potatoes should have been reduced to £9 a ton and the retail price should have been related to a wholesale cost of £9.  By the 2nd January, however, the wholesale price of potatoes had risen to £11 per ton, and it is still £11 per ton.  Either by secret arrangement with the Department&mdash;because no public notice appeared&mdash;or because of the failure of the Department to enforce its Order, the wholesale price of potatoes has remained since at the £11 per ton it was on 2nd January and not the £9 a ton it was on 2nd December.  But, every retail trader in this city has been told that he must continue to sell at the 2nd December price, the price which was related to a wholesale price of £9 per ton.  Is that reasonable? Does it not indicate the need for creating some organisation within the Government which will explain to the public these apparent anomalies in the administration of their Orders and what precisely the Government is trying to do.</P>
    <P>I can tell you, from years of experience in administering price control, that it is impossible to achieve success of it by administrative methods alone. Unless you can get public co-operation and goodwill behind your control arrangements, they will not work.  It took us a long time, after the beginning of the war, before public co-operation was forthcoming in any degree.  Time and again I had to <Col N="2146" /> speak on the radio, to speak in public, explaining the need for that co-operation, pleading for it, endeavouring to get the public to understand that price control was, in the main, a matter for themselves and that, unless they helped to make it effective, it could not be made effective.</P>
    <P>We had to supplement these appeals for public co-operation with legislation of a terroristic kind, to make it an offence, triable before a military court, to infringe a price control Order, and to secure the imposition and enforcement of severe penalties.  Even with all that, even with the public knowledge that we were in a war situation, with the realisation that commodities were scarce and that rationing and price control alone gave a prospect of fair distribution of scarce commodities, despite the continued appeals to the public for co-operation, despite the existence of the military court, and the heavy penalties imposed by it, nevertheless, I say that price control was not more than 50 per cent. effective. There was a widespread black market &mdash;not as widespread as was alleged&mdash; but in every part of the country there were people evading that price control and cashing in on scarcity conditions.</P>
    <P>If we are now again entering into circumstances in which price control is necessary, do you think it can be made effective by this hole and corner method of administration, this surreptitious publication of advertisements in the newspapers?  Do you not realise that, unless the public back you, you cannot succeed?  The case I am making to the Government, that I have been trying to make, is that their existing administrative arrangements are ineffective and inefficient and that, if they are going to make price control work in present circumstances&mdash;and I think that we must have price control in present circumstances&mdash;then, they have got to apply in this year the accumulated experience of the war years and that experience is available to them amongst the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I think it was next door to lunacy to forgo that experience and to entrust this task to people who had no previous contact with it, a part-time <Col N="2147" /> advisory committee of people whose main interest is in other matters.</P>
    <P>We have now also the prospect of a fuel crisis.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I had an argument here during the debate on the Vote on Account as to who in the Government was responsible for the supervision of the turf production arrangements.  And merely to justify the assumption upon which I based my contention then that that responsibility had been transferred to the Minister for Social Welfare, I want to quote from a report which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 18th January last.  On that date there was published the details of a conference held between the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Local Government and all the county managers and county engineers, and to that gathering of county managers and county engineers the Minister for Social Welfare, according to the report published in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has charged me with general supervision over fuel requirements for 1951.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Taking that assertion of the Minister for Social Welfare, I said it was a foolish arrangement, that I could not see how the head of that Department, with his current responsibilities in relation to the Government's legislative programme and the absence of any one in the Department who knows anything about the problem, could effectively supervise the turf production programme on the scale required, and that there were available in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the organisations linked with that Department, not merely competent officials quite capable of exercising that supervision but also, as in the case of price control, with a great deal of experience which would be of inestimable benefit to them.</P>

But what the Minister for Social Welfare, according to the <i>Irish Independent,</i> is reported to have said is this: &ldquo;The Government has charged me with general supervision over fuel requirements for 1951.&rdquo;  That is either true or it is not.</P>

      <P>Was he entrusted with the general supervision of turf development? I do not care who is in charge. What I am trying to impress on the Government is this&mdash;let the public know what they are doing.  If there is confusion caused in the public mind by misleading pronouncements such as the Minister for Social Welfare seems to have made let the position be clarified and clarified beyond doubt.  I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary had taken some steps towards its clarification by his interjections here during my speech on the Vote of Account, but this afternoon he again confused the issue as to who is responsible for turf production.  If there is failure to procure the production in this country of sufficient turf to avoid a fuel crisis next winter who will be to blame?  Remember that the fuel crisis we are facing this year was not foreseen by the Government in time.  As far back as last August the Parliamentary Secretary to the British Minister of Fuel and Power spoke of an impending fuel crisis in Great Britain.  I want to put on record that on the 4th September, 1950, the <i>Irish Press</i> published a leading article referring to that statement made by the British Minister and referring to the possibility of a fuel crisis here and urging upon the Government that they should put into train the measures that were then thought to be practicable to minimise <Col N="2149" /> the effect of that crisis upon our people.  Not merely was nothing done but the Parliamentary Secretary, when the Dáil reassembled at the end of October said there was going to be no fuel crisis.  In the middle of October the Irish coal merchants went to the Department of Finance and asked for an allocation of dollars to buy American coal and were refused.</P>
      <P>When the Dáil reassembled the Minister for Finance was questioned on that matter and he said that unfortunately all the available dollars had been allocated and that none could be made available for coal.  A few days later the British Minister of Fuel and Power announced that Britain was starting to import coal and immediately there was a realisation amongst our own Ministers of the reality of the crisis and the dollars which a week earlier were not available for coal were then suddenly made available.  The Government then took a belated decision to organise the turf production programme.  More luck to their turf production programme, but let it be directed with competence, let it be directed by a single authority because you cannot get the co-ordination of all the forces necessary to make it a success if there is going to be a division of responsibility between individual departments.  Concentrate the responsibility in one department and let the public know which department has the responsibility, which department will be entitled to praise or entitled to the blame according as their programme succeeds or fails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters that we should now be discussing.  There are other matters perhaps equally grave and equally urgent.  Some are referred to on the Vote on Account.  They are far more important than the petty debating points which Deputies have been making, far more important than whether Fianna Fáil made wise decisions or wrong decisions during their term of office.  I have said that whatever we did is on record and we have got to stand over it.  The record of the Coalition is now being made.  What you do to-day or next week or next month will constitute your record.  Will you <Col N="2150" /> at least take the precaution of telling us what you are trying to do so that we will be able to relate your actual achievement with your intentions?

      <P>I have no illusions as to which was the better policy as far as these matters are concerned.  I had no illusions as to whether it was better to tax luxuries or to come along as one of the present Ministers did and describe here, in his most exuberant mood, the pip-squeak inspectors who were then being sent from door to door into every grocery and bakehouse in the country to see that as far as the ordinary individual was concerned he was not going to get one ounce of bread extra except what he could purchase in the black market.  Where did this Government get the money which their predecessors proposed to raise out of taxation on beer spirits and cigarettes? They got it from the black market in tea, the black market in sugar and the black market in bread.  So far as the ordinary individual was concerned, flour remained so scarce that the ration had to be kept on for him.  But there was a lovely white loaf for the fellow who could pay for it.  I want to know from the Minister what did he do with the £7,000,000 worth of fuel that was handed over to him by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce?  What did he do with the money when he sold it, and what stocks did he put in instead of it? <Col N="2151" /> Seven million pounds worth of fuel. There was a total of 368,000 tons of turf, 390,000 tons of timber and 480,000 tons of coal&mdash;and all he has left now is 11,000 tons of turf and 118,000 tons of coal.  The balance is gone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How is it going to be replaced and where is the replacement going to come from?  You pay more to-day for bringing coal from America into this country than the entire cost of the coal, freightage and all, would have come to 12 months ago.  Just consider that state of affairs.</P>
      <P>We heard Deputy O'Higgins talk about factories and the unemployment in the factories.  I have a kind of a recollection that, about three months after this mixum-gatherum team came in here, two little factories which we had in East Cork were seriously affected because there was a flooding of foreign material into this country. Protests were made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with it.  One of these factories had to do what Deputy Norton did with this Government.  It had to close down.  When it closed down and all the employees were told that they were idle, action was taken, and it got the protection to which it was entitled. I want to know what this money is for. There is a sum of 19,000,000 dollars for wheat.  A couple of million pounds was sent off last year to Formosa for sugar. A sum of £3,500,000 is being sent out of this Vote.  The Cuban will get £1,200,000 more for 67,000 tons of sugar than the Irish farmer and the Irish factory worker would get for producing that amount of sugar here.  That is what this Vote is for.  That is what this money is wanted for.  It is wanted in order to pay the foreigner for what our Irish people should be producing&mdash; and the Labour Party, of course, stand behind that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear talk about Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Labour Deputies know <Col N="2152" /> that over 70 per cent. of the total freightage carried by Córas Iompair Éireann is beet and sugar.  Just take that 67,000 tons of sugar.  You can fancy some 40,000 acres of beet and the employment it would give on the land.  The beet would then be taken over by a lorry-owner and transported to the railway station.  Just think of the freightage money that Córas Iompair Éireann would draw in respect of it and the extra couple of months' employment that it would mean for 5,000 or 6,000 men in the factories.</P>
    <P>Last March I appealed to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to call a conference in regard to that matter.  I was not listened to.  When the Formosan sugar was brought in, I appealed to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to call a conference of representatives of his own Department, of the Department of Finance, of the Sugar Company and of the Beet Growers' Association.  I appealed to him to call these four groups of people together in order to see if some method could be arrived at by which that 67,000 tons of sugar would be produced here.  I was asked what inducement I thought should be offered.  That was the only answer I got.  It was 36,000 tons then.  It is 67,000 tons now.  Just consider a price of £54 12s. Od. a ton to the foreigner as compared with £37 a ton for Irish sugar leaving an Irish factory.  That is what the money is for and that is the new policy of the Labour Party. We went from that to 19,000,000 dollars for the wheat.  We went to the Argentine for oats, we travelled to Iraq for barley, and then, glory be to God, we would up by buying back Brian Boru's butter from the Danes.</P>
    <P>We are told about the prosperity this Coalition Government have given to the people.  I wonder where it is. I wonder what the farmers in Mayo feel now about the 2/- for a dozen of eggs after the glorious picture that was painted of 3/6 a dozen.  I wonder what they think of the £20 maize which now costs £29 odd.  I wonder how they like it.  I wonder how the Minister fixes up his costs of production on that basis.  When I heard Deputy Cowan repenting, on the stool <Col N="2153" /> of repentance, for the bad acts he had done, I saw the Minister writing down his name in the book.  I can assure Deputy Cowan that he is going to get something.  I have often seen a fairly degrading spectacle, but I have never yet seen a more degrading spectacle than that of the farmers' representatives trotting into the lobby after Deputy Cowan to vote against an increase in the price of milk to the farmers.  I have never seen anything more degrading than that&mdash;and if that is the depth to which politics have sunk in this country then there is only one cure for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan told us all about the glorious Social Security Bill.  He issued his challenge because he had tacked on to the Social Security Bill &mdash;what?&mdash; 2/6 to pay the difference between the £5 a ton coal which the old age pensioner was able to buy in our time and the £10 that he has to pay for coal to-day.  We all know that the aged people are fond of a cup of tea. They can get their extra cup of tea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this matter which has not been sufficiently brought before the minds of this House and of the public with which I would like to deal for a few moments. To-night we are voting a sum of over £31,000,000 to defray the balance of the cost of the Supply Services for the year which is just ending and we are voting something less than one-third of the estimated total cost of the Supply Services for the year which will begin on the 1st April.  That £31,000,000 is already, as the House has been reminded, in excess of the Budgets which Fianna Fáil introduced in the years prior to 1939 which were denounced by the present Minister for Finance, then in opposition, as extravagant and oppressive.  I do not, however, propose to dilate on that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do want to draw to the attention of the House is that this £31,088,031 represents less than half of the £83,000,000 which the Minister for Finance anticipates we shall have to find either out of borrowing or taxation to defray the cost of the services for the coming year.  I might ask, perhaps, what this £83,000,000 is required for.  Judging by what we know of the mismanagement of the public concerns by the Government since it took office one might sum it all up by saying: &ldquo;£83,000,000 for a policy of mess and muddle.&rdquo;  At the beginning of 1948 they closed down upon the various schemes of national reconstruction which had been initiated by their predecessors, the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2156" /> Administration.  I do not want to recount them now, the shutting down of mineral exploration and development and of the short-wave broadcasting station, the sabotaging of the transatlantic air service or of the Farm Improvements Fund.  There are dozens of them which I could mention.  I do not want to discuss them at length but it is is no harm that we should keep these in mind.</P>
    <P>Other things have been happening, like the prices freeze Order.  It is called the prices freeze Order but everybody knows that it did not freeze prices.  The first public announcement of the advisory body which they set up was that it could not freeze prices, that prices were bound to increase. But it did freeze something.  What it did free was business, enterprise and industry, and before this emergency passes the people of the country will blame and condemn in no uncertain fashion the Coalition which allowed itself to be led by the nose by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare, into that sorry blunder.  That is an important point and it is as well that it should be put on record.</P>
    <P>It is equally advisable to remind the House, as Deputy Lemass has already done, that in so far as there is a coal crisis at the present moment it is largely due, or at least the aggravation of it is due, to the neglect of the Government to take steps to forestall it, the stupidity of the Government in closing its mind to the indications, and not only to the indications but to the plain public statements of people who are in a position to know what the future is likely to bring with regard to fuel, that is, that we would be facing a fuel crisis before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer to the sorry performance of the British trade agreement under which we were guaranteed to get the coal which we are not getting and bound ourselves to restrict the opportunities which present world circumstances offered to develop our export trade with the Continent.</P>
    <P>We can leave these things aside for one minute because I want to come back to what is really the fundamental factor in this situation.  We are going <Col N="2157" /> to spend £83,000,000.  That money is being voted by the Dáil.  It is conventional to say that it is being provided by the Dáil, but that, of course, is not the situation.  It is being provided by the people, but we take the responsibility by our votes here for that £83,000,000, and taking that responsibility there is another responsibility which is being imposed on us, that is the responsibility of seeing that this money is properly spent and properly accounted for.  If we turn to these Estimates we will not see at the head of any statement that the vote for the office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for instance, will be accounted for by the Minister for Social Welfare. Instead, we see that the Vote and the expenditure on the Vote is to be accounted for by the office of the Minister for Social Welfare, which is a very different thing.  Even though it may be under the political control of the Minister, he has no power to direct expenditure and he has, in fact, only a certain indirect power, acting through the Secretary of his Department, to control his staff.  It applies to every Minister in the Government.</P>
    <P>What we have to consider is what steps we are going to take to ensure that the 20,000 public officers who are being paid out of this £83,000,000 of the people's money will do their duty and obey the rules and regulations of the service.  What precautions are we going to take to ensure that this £83,000,000 will be spent by the responsible officers for the purpose for which it was provided? That is an issue which has been raised in a very acute and critical form during the past few weeks.  Under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, the man who is responsible for the general administration and conduct of the Department is the secretary of the Department; the man who is responsible for the expenditure of any money provided for the service of the Department out of any particular Vote is the accounting officer for the Department and the accounting officer for the Vote. If the position of the accounting officer is going to be undermined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, Sir.  That is the point.  Every accounting officer in the State is responsible for the expenditure of his share, for that portion of this £83,000,000, which is allocated to the service of his Department. The Ministers are not responsible except in so far as they override the accounting officer and direct him to obey without accepting responsibility. If they are going to do that, they must put that direction in writing.  It is a strange thing that the Government, acting as a collective authority, cannot direct any accounting officer to spend any money that he feels he is not entitled to spend in the fulfilment of his obligations to Dáil Éireann.  The Minister, who is the political head of his Department and, indeed, the effective head, too, may direct that officer in writing, having said first of all that he has taken note of the officer's objections and that, notwithstanding those objections, he directs that officer to obey without responsibility and to pay the money as directed.  That is the position of every accounting officer in this State.</P>
      <P>These accounting officers, in their capacity as accounting officers, are not the servants of their Ministers but are the servants of Dáil Éireann.  They are the custodians of the public moneys which we entrust to them for expenditure, and it is their duty to see that those public moneys are properly expended.  The first Public Accounts Committee, which was set up here to deal with the public accounts of 1922-23, made the position of accounting officers clear beyond any doubt. They said this&mdash;and it will be found in paragraph 9 of their first report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A serious personal responsibility attaches to them if they fail in this <Col N="2159" /> respect, for if a post factum application to that Department&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the Department of Finance</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;does not disclose any grounds justifying the expenditure, the responsibility is likely to come back to that individual.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the year 1927, the third Public Accounts Committee&mdash;which had been set up to consider the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General for the year 1925-26&mdash;disallowed a payment of some thousands of pounds which the then Minister for Finance had directed his accounting officer to make.  The then Minister for Finance, I am happy to say, acted strictly in accordance with the regulations that had been laid down.  He did not go off and try to get the Government to carry his responsibility.  He issued a minute to his accounting officer directing him&mdash;let me remind the House of the phrase&mdash;directing him to obey without responsibility.  The accounting officer, in discharge of his duty and in fulfilment of the obligations imposed on him by the rules for accounting officers, sent the papers to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. In due course, the Comptroller and Auditor-General reported upon this matter to the Public Accounts Committee, stating that he had been directed by the Minister to make this payment&mdash;the Minister did not deny it&mdash;and what happened?  The Public Accounts Committee disallowed that payment, even though it had been personally directed by the Minister for Finance, and in order to clear himself and secure parliamentary indemnity for the breach, for going outside the ambit of the Vote, the Minister, Mr. Blythe, had to come to this House and present a Supplementary Estimate and ask the House to give him the some thousands of pounds necessary, in order that he might be relieved of the responsibility of making good to the Central Fund the payment which he had wrongfully directed.</P>
    <P>It is upon that principle that the whole of our public accounting system is based, the personal responsibility of the accounting officer for every penny <Col N="2160" /> that is spent from his Vote.  In so far as anything is done by any Minister or by any Government which will weaken that principle, which will tend to undermine the responsibility of the accounting officer or indeed weaken the control over his staff, or tend to destroy discipline in the Civil Service, we are bringing this State down to the ground, we are reducing, and we tend to reduce the control over public finances, and it will not be very long until we reduce the whole administrative machine to chaos.  I want to raise this issue because I believe it has been very seriously attacked in recent days. It is not the last we are going to hear of it.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee has joined groups of people who are out to do two damaging things to this country.  He joined with those who are trying to give industrialists and traders every encouragement not to do the stockpiling that their business instincts would make them do and their national instincts would certainly drive them to do in a much more intense way.  He also joined with a group of people who are encouraging, as fast as may be, traders to charge prices which they are not entitled to.  That championship has disgusted quite a number of decent traders and industrialists and, in fact, even those who are not so decent and not so honest are getting ashamed of the open sabotage which is being done to the knowledge of these two classes. However, these people may well live to rue the day when they listened to irresponsible comment of the type to which Deputy MacEntee has given forth.  He has made a long-winded effort which I do not think has done him any good.</P>

    <P>The Deputy spoke again from the same polluted source of the muddy waters in which he has been splashing and disporting himself for some weeks past in the hope that he may be able <Col N="2161" /> to spatter a bit of the mud away from himself.  The Deputy, if he is interested in the matter discussed through a series of questions, ought to accept the definite challenge made to him by the Taoiseach, that if the Opposition want a day to discuss that unfortunate civil servant, who I am sure is now rueing the day that he behaved in such an uncritical fashion, they can get it.</P>

      <P>I want to direct attention to Deputy Lemass' speech and to ask the House to remember the arrogance of the last phrase, after the Deputy had travelled in bullying fashion over several matters, that his speech was the appropriate type of speech to make and not one about the pettifogging little political things spoken of by others.  The Deputy always had a good conceit of himself. <Col N="2163" /> He showed himself in his appropriate mood to-night.  I want people to recollect the hoarse anger, the vigour, the contempt for everybody, the criticism of everybody who went before him. That was the mood.  Add that mood to this, that he was annoyed at its being revealed that he left behind him his plan to freeze wages, making it a criminal offence for any employer to give an increase in wages.  He was, of course, going to take in the rise in profits, but only on a selective basis. He would choose for it industrialists who had not obeyed orders about fixing prices according to a profit margin. He would pick them and there might be an appeal for his victims to a certain body and they would be a very select group, selected as much for their political opinions as anything else. When these people were picked, they had a right to appeal to a certain body which the Deputy would set up, but the one thing he insisted upon was that there would be no right of appeal to the courts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan is perfectly right. There was in process of making here, by a group of people who forced themselves to the conviction that they were impregnable in office, before the election at which they were defeated, the tightest little tyranny ever fastened on any democratic country.  Wages frozen, profits to be taken from the people who had earned the displeasure of Ministers, and then the austerity programme that Deputy Cowan spoke of. In addition to that, in 1947, Deputy de Valera told us: &ldquo;As for emigration, we cannot stop it.  There is a tendency there and it will probably go on to the end of the world.  There is a tendency all over the world to drift from the rural areas to the towns and we cannot stop that, either.  As far as agriculture is concerned, if any of you people are in a position to give us a plan, we will accept that plan and try to work it.&rdquo;  That was the desolation that people were faced with.  There was certainly no enterprise in borrowing or spending for the good of the people in that&mdash;there was just taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Childers coming in here and speaking like somebody <Col N="2164" /> you would hear on the Third Programme of the B.B.C.  He told us that there was nothing wrong about taxing beer or smokes, that that is something which ought to be considered in conjunction with vast schemes of Government policy.  The vast schemes are revealed to be&mdash;even announced tonight&mdash;transatlantic planes and a short-wave broadcasting station, but, always left out by Deputy Lemass, the grand, magnificent £11,500,000 building for civil servants, a new Parliament House, by the destruction of a considerable part of Merrion Square.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass seems angered and worked up over what the Tánaiste did with regard to old age pensions and offers this: bring in a single phrase Bill and I will get the House to pass it immediately.  Is not that the offer? Yet on the 22nd October, 1947, as Deputy Davin reminded him, when there was not £1,000,000 in the kitty for the old age pensioners but some £500,000, the Deputy and his Party flocked into the lobbies against the proposal made then on the grounds that they could not afford it, and the phrase was used that if they had £500,000 they could afford they would put it to better uses than giving it to old age pensioners.  The Deputy is angered by the fact that the old age pensioners will get more money.</P>
    <P>I have here an excerpt from two of our morning newspapers the Saturday after the announcement was made.  I have the <i>Irish Press</i> saying: &ldquo;Below in tabular form are the Fianna Fáil proposals for social welfare as outlined by Dr. Ryan.&rdquo; The <i>Irish Independent</i> put it more honestly: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil offices last night issued the following announcement showing their proposals.&rdquo; Lo and behold!  there was, of course, in that tabular statement something for old age pensions and something about a means test.  They had forgotten that they had circulated part of their proposals before that Friday morning and there was a bit of a scurry that morning to get their proposals back so that they could include in them something for old age pensions.  It is there now, and the <Col N="2165" /> amusing thing is that, according to the Deputies on the Opposition Benches, it was at one time a bribe on this side of the House, but now, because Deputy Lemass backs it, it is honest politics.</P>
    <P>There was a time when I used to amuse myself reading the mythological stories of ancient Ireland and the heroes of long ago.  It was interesting to read about the heroes of that heroic period; before they went into battle they used to suffer all manner of bodily contortions in order to work up their enthusiasm for the fight.  Deputy Lemass was in that mood to-night The only difference is that mythological heroes were of heroic stature: there is nothing more undignified than the spectacle of a small man in a rage when the rage is such that the small man is unable to contain it.  That was the spectacle Deputy Lemass presented here to-night.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass told us during the course of the debate on the Vote on Account that lawyers were an essentially stupid tribe, outside of their court work.  But lawyers have occasionally been hired by business men, and even by politicians, to get them out of trouble when they find themselves in the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not in the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was one man who was.  In any event, the Deputy has quite definitely said that lawyers are stupid.  From what eminence does the Deputy speak?  If the Deputy were remarkable in this country for his performance in the arts, in science or in the humanities, or, indeed, in anything, one might see some excuse for him.  For three years back as far as politics are concerned this House has been entertained more often by records of the Deputy's failures rather than of his successes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy was in business at one time.  Possibly he may tell he has a business stature.  There is one business which will be remembered as long as people's memories last.  I believe to-day when business men meet around the town they sometimes toast Deputy Lemass and the way he <Col N="2166" /> handled the Argentine dictator, Péron. Does the House remember the way he did it?  Péron had wheat that had been mouldering over the autumn and through the winter.  Deputy Lemass was looking for wheat.  Péron raised the price of it.  It came to the close of the Deputy's period in office and the Deputy conceived a plan; it was overwhelming in its simplicity, and I think &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; is the operative word.  He would offer Péron his price. He did so, and he paid him £50 a ton, the price that Péron asked.  It was the worst bargain ever made in the history of this country and, if the Deputy wants to found his reputation on that, I think he should get his reputation established publicily on that transaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We paid the same price as everyone else paid.  The price was controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could have been bought much cheaper earlier but, as the stuff went bad, the price went up. The Deputy thinks that price control is difficult and he thinks that the one thing necessary is that it should be done before the public.  What are we doing?  The Prices Tribunal sits in public.  The great trouble the Deputy is in with some of his supporters is that they do not like to appear before a public tribunal and the clamour that the Opposition Deputies set up is that it is a scandal that people should have their business discussed in public or have the group profits disclosed in public.  We want public confidences. That was the reason put forward by the Tánaiste in his speech when he spoke in support of the establishment of this tribunal.  He said that we must make the public conscious so that, if prices had to go up, at least the people would know the reason for the inevitable increase and would no longer continue to exist in the state of confusion in which they were left in the past, a state in which people crawled around to the Deputy's Department and came out with the results of the machinery of price control working there which gave them unheard of profits.</P>

What has been the clamour since the Prices Advisory Body was set up?

      <P>I have examined the method.  The manufacturer got a price fixed and then on to that was put a percentage which the wholesaler would charge; the goods went to the wholesaler and, after that, there was a retail percentage fixed and, after that, the goods were marketed.  I asked one day what happened where a wholesaler did not exist and I was told: &ldquo;Oh, you stick it on to the retail price.&rdquo;</P>

I was just about to write on them when the papers were collected from me.  I asked what had happened.  I was told that it was all over as far as I was concerned.  I was anxious to find out what happened.  I was told that another <Col N="2168" /> group of people were asking for a certain percentage of profit.

      <P>I will tell the Deputy anything he likes.  He can go out and link arms with Deputy MacEntee and be quite happy in doing all the dirty work he wants to do.  I take it he is annoyed because I am not giving him some attention.  Deputy Aiken spoke here about &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo;.  He applied the phrase to borrowing.  I suppose it can be applied to borrowing; anybody who borrows can be said to be &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo;.  The Deputies passed the buck in their time; there was a lot of borrowing.  Where is the good in using a meaningless phrase like that?  The Deputy should really address himself to our programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have told him what we intend to spend.  We have told him the projects <Col N="2169" /> on which we intend to spend the money.  We have told him what our objectives are.  We have asked the Deputies to challenge them if they did not consider them proper for investment purposes.  We waited here through all the long and weary days of the Financial Resolutions and the Finance Bill.  Did anybody object to the programme we had laid down? We came to the present year then and all that Deputy Lemass could say in relation to the present Book of Estimates was that there were some flipperies with which he could quarrel, but that when it came to the borrowing programme there was nothing to which he could take exception.  The only peculiar thing was that he used the very peculiar expression that one should not borrow for investment purposes. Now that is where we part company.  We think our projects are good borrowing projects.  We think we are borrowing quite properly for them.  Deputy Aiken said on one occasion that costs had been increased by reason of inflation because of all the extra money poured out.  Later on he said that costs had not risen and that, if they had, it was only by a few points, and he suggested that few points was due to the impact of the Korean war, and the stockpiling which has taken place since.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken did see the gap which Deputy Lemass, apparently, did not see.  Deputy Aiken says that as long as the ports are open you will get in the goods; you will never have the type of inflation of having too much money chasing too few goods.  I deplore the rate at which some of the goods are coming in, but will Deputies put up their alternative proposals? Deputy Lemass wants physical controls in order to stop goods coming in.  But then we will have the classic type of inflation&mdash;too much money chasing too few goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass would have us going back to the good old days of beer and tobacco and a lot of other taxation, and you are taking the money out of the people's hands so that they will not have to spend it.  Deputy Aiken on several occasions said that assets are down by £100,000,000.  Some of these days Deputy MacEntee and <Col N="2170" /> Deputy Aiken will be coming in arm-in-arm, but they will realise that we have sounder ideas in relation to economics.  Deputy Lemass was rather anguished.  He spends sleepless nights thinking of what he would do if only he had 40 millions of American money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken thinks we have spent it and it is a debt; he thinks it is gone.  There seems to be some lack of cohesion between whoever it is who co-ordinates the efforts of the Opposition. There used to be a single mind, but now there are as many minds as there are individuals, now that they are in Opposition.  Deputy Aiken finally came to the point of believing that having a bit in reserve was a great thing.  He was challenged about the reserve and he was asked was it better to spend it at home or leave your money in fast-declining securities abroad.  The only way to get over the difficulty, in his opinion, was to have a good bit in reserve and not spend your money on a spree.  Now, it is interesting to observe Deputy Aiken's attitude and Deputy Lemass's attitude in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Aiken, money is being spent on a spree.  There is only one peculiarity over a spree.  A spree generally causes a headache. This has certainly caused a headache, but not to the people who are on the spree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers speaks like a B.B.C. Third Programme.  Some of these days he, too, will get to know something about this country.  The last Government gave Deputy Childers a naturalisation certificate, but there was some ambiguity about it; they failed to make him a naturalised Irishman. He has no conception of what this country needs.</P>

He thought we had reached the lowest depths of politics in a parliamentary assembly where actual play was made with taxation which <Col N="2171" /> affected smoking and drinking.  Even if the Deputy wanders up and down the Irish countryside, he has not yet got himself attuned to Irish conditions. If that is the type of mind he has, and if that is at the background of Fianna Fáil, I wish them luck with him and I hope he will long remain something of a leader amongst them.</P>

They told us, with regard to our main industry, agriculture: &ldquo;Give us any plan you have and we will try to operate it&rdquo;.  And the background of it all was Deputy Lemass's preparations for a wage freeze and a selective attack on people making unreasonable profits.  If it was not for the people's anger over what Deputy Childers thinks is inconsequential, they could have forced that programme home.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass was drifting around Government Buildings, keeping in touch with the parliamentary draftsman.  He was up and down and he had a scheme.  Suggestions were made by his colleagues.  There was no overpowering argument that he should drop it, but there were suggestions for changes.  And all this is on the file in the Deputy's handwriting. He wanted this new plan hurriedly drawn up in the parliamentary drafts-man's office because he wanted it as a weapon when he met the trade unions. Is not that right?</P>

      <P>I am speaking out of my own knowledge from the files. The Deputy did want this weapon against his meeting with the trade unions.  He wanted to have against the two Trade Union Congresses this weapon, with this in mind: &ldquo;If you do not agree, I have something in store for you.&rdquo;  And here it is.  No increased wage beyond what was there in mid-October, 1947, beyond that related to the cost-of-living new figure, and if any employer gave more than that it would be a crime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If any employee struck to get more than that, then that employee was going to have removed from him the protection of the Trade Disputes Act.  If that scheme had gone through it would unquestionably have brought the industrial activities of this country back to pre-Napoleonic days, back to the period when labourers could not combine in order to <Col N="2173" /> get themselves betterment in their industrial occupations.  Conditions of that description existed in those days, but by degrees civilisation progressed and one reformer after another came along and you got this thing gradually built up and ulitmately you had the protection of the Trade Disputes Act under which any of the people who were looking for improved conditions or extra wages could engage in a proper wage dispute and have an opportunity of making their case.</P>
      <P>But what was it the Deputy wanted? If he did not get the agreement he wanted to get back to the conditions that prevailed in pre-Napoleonic times. And if he got his agreement, could he boast that the conditions would be such that people could hammer matters out and arrive at some satisfactory conclusion?  No, it was not anything of the kind.  It was the biggest piece of coercion ever known in this country for years, and the whole thing comes to this, that there was in the process of manufacture in this country at that time the tightest little tyranny that was ever contemplated by any group of people.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1951, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that we have a very short period of time to <Col N="2174" /> discuss this.  I was speaking on this matter when the debate was adjourned because the Minister agreed there should be some time allowed to look into this very complicated scheme.  I want to be exceptionally brief because I understand it is vital that the scheme should be dealt with this evening.</P>
      <P>The first point I want to make is in regard to the salaries which the secondary teachers enjoy at the moment.  These salaries are too small. They are inadequate and that aspect has been touched on by some of the speakers in the debate.  With regard to secondary education, it is vital that salaries should be such as to attract the very best graduates from our universities into the profession.  In that connection, I should like to refer the Minister to the <i>Journal of Education</i> for January, 1951.  On page 16 of that journal he will find an article dealing with the revised salary scales in Scotland, Wales and in Northern Ireland. Under those revised salary scales, the ordinary graduates, men, start at £435 and rise to £725 in the 18th year. Honours graduates start at £535 and rise to £875 in the 18th year.  Notwithstanding that, it has been stated in the article that the basic scales as they stand, that is, the revised scales, will do little to induce the best type of student to enter the teaching profession. I only mention that casually because our salaries, which are much lower than those, are entirely inadequate.</P>
      <P>I quarrel with the scheme on a couple of grounds.  One is the retrospective payment, whereby secondary teachers will be required to pay a sum of £235 in a period of five years to the Department, working out at £47 per year, that is, the retrospective clause by which payment at 1½ per cent. is provided. There were increases recently granted to the secondary teachers of £60 a year.  If we deduct the 5 per cent. from that towards their pension, it leaves them with an increase of £57, out of which £47 is taken for this retrospective payment towards a gratuity. There are only 500 members affected according to the Minister's statement here.  Those 500 members went into a bad scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven hundred members went voluntarily into a bad scheme.  I suggest to the Minister that it is a mean thing to take from these 700 members almost the whole of the increase that has been given them recently.  The national teachers got this gratuity without any retrospective payment. Civil servants get it without any contribution, and I say that this 1½ per cent. should not be insisted upon now. I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter between now and the time the scheme comes into effective operation. If he does that, I will be satisfied.  The Secondary Teachers' Organisation are unanimously in favour of the abolition of this 1½ per cent.  If the Minister will endeavour to meet the secondary teachers in that regard, and if he will indicate to me that he will reconsider the matter between this and the time the scheme comes into operation, it will satisfy me.</P>
      <P>There is a further matter in regard to the penalising of people in the scheme.  I refer to married women who get a gratuity and retire.  If they do not go into the scheme, they can go back to teach at any time in the future, but if they go into the scheme and get a gratuity, they can never go back again to teaching.  I think it will be agreed that this is a restriction that is unfair, and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider, between this and the date the scheme comes into effective operation, the representations that have been made to him by the Organisation of Secondary Teachers and by Deputies in this House, that the impost of 1½ per cent. towards the gratuity should be eliminated from the scheme.</P>

The 1 per cent. that is regarded as retrospective payment is a payment made in order to get credit for past, services.

The secondary teachers will have at their disposal on Tuesday that general scheme agreed to by the Ministry and by the teachers to-day.  When it is signed and ready to come into operation on Tuesday, they will find that they will have machinery for conciliation in respect to salaries and allowances and in respect to the principles of superannuation.  They will have arbitration in respect to salaries and allowances, so that whatever requires to be said additionally to what has been already said on the question of superannuation, and what has to be done, can be said and done by the discussion of these matters through the conciliation machinery.</P>

      <P>There is nothing relating to the principles of superannuation that cannot go to the conciliation <Col N="2178" /> machinery.  It will not go to the arbitration machinery because the general position in regard to superannuation is that it is governed by statute and, having regard to the responsibility of the Government and the responsibility of this House, anything governed by statute will not be allowed to go to arbitration, but the principles of superannuation can go to the conciliation machinery.  I would ask Deputies to accept it from me that this scheme has had as much thought, consideration and sympathy from me as I could possibly give it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig said that I had not considered matters which the Deputy put up to me the other day, matters that I agreed to allow to stand over so that the Deputy might have an opportunity of considering them and of putting his views to the House.  I could not have given an assurance that between that day and now I would have entered into a discussion to change the scheme in any way.  Certain things require to be done under the scheme in order to bring the benefits of it to people who have left the service since the 1st January last.  I assure Deputies that no delay in the matter could help me to change that in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary and I were members of the same Party, we adopted as one of our objectives the achievement of clean, honest and efficient administration in this country.  I was shocked last week when I found that the Minister proposed to make a number of appointments, which, in my opinion, were unnecessary and undesirable.  I, therefore, put down a question to the Minister for Finance, asking how many of these appointments he proposed to make; in what way the persons appointed were remunerated; in what way they were selected; and by whom the appointments were made.  The Parliamentary Secretary replied&mdash;I am not reading his entire reply&mdash;that, so far, nine had been appointed in all&mdash; six in Galway, three in Roscommon and one in Clare.</P>
      <P>I used to labour under the impression that I knew something about simple addition.  I never claimed to have what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs once described as a college education, but I thought I could at least add up a few simple figures.  It seems that I will have to revise my views on that question.  Three and one certainly make four, but, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, four and six make nine.  If that is the system on which the new paymasters are to calculate the wages they pay to the workers, I can see that these workers will have a little more remuneration than is afforded under these regulations.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that these men are paid on a fee basis of 1½ per cent. of the wages paid.  There is no trace of these appointments in the Minister's Estimate, so far as I can see, and I can find no trace in any Estimates of any similar appointments which the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out were made in other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary went on to say further that the vacancies are not advertised.  I fail to see how he can justify the making of appointments in this manner without advertising them.  How does he know in his position as Parliamentary <Col N="2181" /> Secretary, who the persons are who are likely to apply, and how are the people interested in these positions to ascertain that they are vacant, if they are not advertised?  We have in our Constitution very definite provision for equal opportunity for all citizens. We are spending public money on these services and we are apparently, on the basis of the manner in which these appointments are made, without advertisement, selecting certain privileged people for appointment to these positions.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that he and he alone made these appointments.  I want to put this objectively and fairly to the Parliamentary Secretary: is is a good principle that the head of the Department should have this privilege of selecting people for obscure positions&mdash;because they are rather obscure positions, not very highly paid positions&mdash;such as these?  We know that, in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister had a similar right, but the plain people of Ireland, led by the plain people of Baltinglass, forced him to waive that right, to give it up, and to transfer his function in that respect to a selection board.</P>
    <P>I think that the method of appointment by selection board is the only fair method for appointments of this kind.  The Parliamentary Secretary is hardly fair to himself in taking upon his shoulders the responsibility for making these appointments.  I do not think there is any reason to hope that such appointments, when made as political appointments, can in any sense be fair.  It is not only necessary to be fair to everybody but it is essential that we convince the people generally that we are being fair.  When we find the relative of a Parliamentary Secretary appointed to a position of this kind, naturally we have the feeling that fair play does not operate.  In this connection, the Parliamentary Secretary is acting as the head of a very important Department from the national standpoint.  It is the Department concerned with the work of development and work of development is urgently necessary in this country.  It is a Department which employs a very <Col N="2182" /> large number of men and a large staff of officials, many of them very competent officials.  It is a Department which employs especially a large number of manual workers.  Is it right to introduce into this Department the system of the gombeen man, the privileged individual and the privileged friend of those in authority, who comes in between the honest worker doing his honest day's work and the wages he is to receive to get a rake-off from these wages?  That is a principle which this House should avoid at all costs. It is a principle which I certainly shall never accept.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary talking about precedents. There are precedents for everything objectionable.  We all know that in the old days we had the gombeen man coming between the Government and people in every sphere of life and getting his rake-off from decent people. That was an old-established principle in the days of the Famine and of the British-régime, if we go back that far. The Parliamentary Secretary went back to the time of his immediate predecessors but he could have gone back to the time of their predecessors to find this objectionable system in operation. If we went back to the days of the Famine of '47, when grants were given for the relief of the starving people&mdash;grants, of course, that were totally insufficient&mdash;he would see that much of the money was raked-off by people who came in between the starving workers and the authorities.  Is it not time to end that system?  Why should we stand for the introduction of this objectionable system into a Department where it did not exist before? There is no use in saying that it existed in the Department of Lands and other Departments heretofore. Why should we extend it?  Why should we not try to curb the system and ultimately eliminate it completely?</P>
    <P>Again, is there any necessity for such appointments?  The Parliamentary Secretary makes the case that it is essential to have a paymaster in each district who knows the men and who can disburse wages to them.  How are wages paid to county council workers? For example, thousands of men all over the country, far removed from the <Col N="2183" /> head offices of the county council, are paid by cheque each week or each fortnight and nobody has ever found anything wrong with that system.  It is a system which is open to check and correction if a mistake is made.  It is a system which is fair and one which adds to the dignity of the worker.  He gets his cheque for work honestly done and he can go anywhere he likes, into a bank or anywhere else, and get that cheque changed without any compliment to anybody, whereas under the other system the worker is degraded. He must go to some political hack in his district, touch his hat to him as our forefathers has to do to the landlords and the landlords' agents, to receive his few little coins.</P>

      <P>I want to say that this is an objectionable and obnoxious thing, which ought to be ended.  The Minister for Justice intervened when the Parliament Secretary was replying and he said: &ldquo;The Deputy objected to that principle being put into operation.&rdquo; I assume that he meant the principle of advertising public appointments. I assume that the Minister for Justice was referring to the appointment in Baltinglass.  I never objected to the appointment being advertised.  What I objected to was the elimination of an efficient and experienced worker and the appointment of a political hanger-on.  We succeeded in restoring the appointment to an honest lady who had discharged her duty efficiently.</P>

      <P>On reading the supplementary questions that arose on this question, I find that Deputy Cogan was trying to forestall me.  The Deputy's great objection is that the appointment was not advertised.  I suppose it would be quite simple, according to an appointment in which Deputy Cogan was interested not so long ago, to have such an advertisement issued, but then to make sure that it was a certain individual that would be appointed.  I cannot understand Deputy Cogan blowing with two sides of his mouth, one side saying it should not be advertised, that a particular person should get the appointment, and the other side saying, in respect of another case, that there should be an advertisement.</P>

      <P>I regret the position is as it is in the Board of Works.  I <Col N="2185" /> wish the Government of the day or this House would say to me: &ldquo;We will make a change in that.  We will make some change in appointments such as those.&rdquo;  I would gladly accept it.  I do not want the responsibility of it.  I am quite sure, when Deputy Cogan refers to political tactics&mdash;we knew each other for many years&mdash;he does not wish to throw that over on me.  Probably he refers to the fact that I had to take over a post that was so rotten with that class of business that when I take a file and read the representations made on behalf of a man who was appointed successor to Deputy Killilea, in the same job as a pay-master, I find a letter, dated 10/1/34:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;I wish to state that I have known such-and-such a man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He is not in the House to defend himself. I will not name him.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;for the past four years.  I have always found him a strong supporter of Fianna Fáil and at the last two general elections he placed himself and his car at the disposal of the Party.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, Deputy Cogan, I am sure, knowing me as he did for many years, would not even attempt to think that I would make an appointment on a political basis of that description.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Cogan that is not the case as far as I am concerned.  The special employments scheme office has to appoint paymasters.  The reason for that is that, up to last year, all our work was done by the county councils, that is to say, our bog development schemes, our rural improvement schemes, and the other schemes that we carry out in <Col N="2186" /> that office.  Certain county engineers and county managers throughout the country informed us that they could not carry on that work any longer.  The result was that, immediately, in counties such as Galway, Roscommon and Clare, we had to take over.  This year we have to take over Kerry and Mayo.  We have to appoint an engineer in charge of our own staff there. Formerly, the money was sent to the county secretary of each county; the work was done under the supervision of the county engineer of that county and the money was paid directly by the county council office.  They used to carry on this work when they would have their county council work done, at the end of October or November. When we had to take them over, as I said, we had to put in our own engineer in charge and then we had to pay the men directly.</P>
      <P>The question that arose was, were we to increase our staff in our office in Dublin, were we to call in more civil servants, or were we to find paymasters here and there throughout the various counties that we had to take over, just as the Land Commission and the Board of Works did.</P>
