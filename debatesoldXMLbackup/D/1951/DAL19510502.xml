      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) how many tons of chocolate crumb were exported from the Republic in the years 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, and (b) how many tons gross were produced in the Republic during the same periods.</P>

      <P>The quantity of chocolate crumb exported was 4,179 tons in the year 1947; 10,541 tons in 1948; 13,229 tons in 1949, and 19,691 tons in 1950.  Production as defined for the purposes of the census of industrial production does not include chocolate crumb which is further processed into chocolate confectionery by the producing firm. Accordingly, production as defined is practically equivalent to exports, except for changes in stock between the beginning and the end of the year, which, in the case of this product, were not significant in the years in question.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give a single reply to these questions which will cover transactions in all classes of goods and services.  It is estimated, however, that £1 in August, 1939, would purchase the same quantum of goods (including rent) at retail prices as 11/7 in July, 1914, and that £1 in February, 1951, would purchase the same quantum of goods (including rent) at retail prices as 10/6 in August, 1939.</P>

    <P>The introduction of contributory retirement pensions as proposed in the Bill referred to would have the effect of reducing the number of non-contributory old age pensions, but it is not yet possible to estimate what the reductions would be in the years 1956 and 1961.</P>

It is not proposed to repair the house.  As to his former remuneration, this is a private matter between him and his former employer, and I am not prepared to disclose it.</P>

Is he further aware that on Saturday morning the Land Commission shoved his six head of stock into a rood of land, known as the garden, enclosed them with a strong fence unknown to this man, and his cattle were left there for a considerable time, unattended?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a complete ruin, as suggested by the Deputy.  It is the house in which he has been residing for the past 35 years.  I am informed it is fairly substantial, but may be in need of some slight repairs. Also, he has got the house and garden as a free gift from the Land Commission, except for the payment of 1/-, which is purely a nominal thing, and he has got a larger gratuity than what the Deputy mentioned.  Apart from that, this whole matter is a reserved function of the Land Commission and I have nothing to do with it.  I am sure if the Deputy makes representations to the commissioners on the subject that they will, perhaps, review the case.  Representations from the Deputy might have the effect of improving Mr. McGovern's position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy refers to the steps recently taken by Kerry Board of Conservators to terminate the illegal use by the <Col N="1859" /> Cromane fishermen of a type of net known as a &ldquo;pusher&rdquo; net, the meshes of which are more than 11 inches in the round.  The use of such nets is prohibited by a by-law made in 1896 and their use as a fixed engine is prohibited by Section 31 of the Fisheries Act, 1925.  I have no power to abrogate the statute and no evidence has been put before me which would suggest that a case can be made for revoking or amending the by-law.

If it is considered that it is illegal to carry on the work that they have been carrying on for the past 40 or 50 years, without hindrance by any previous Government, I believe that they are entitled to challenge that.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy, I think it is right to remind him that the courts of law are there before which the Minister or the Taoiseach or anybody else is the bare equal of the poorest fisherman on the coast of Ireland.  I am advised that I have a statutory duty to discharge under the Act and I have got to discharge it.  If the fishermen of Cromane can bring me into court and get the court to say that I have not, I am perfectly satisfied.  It gives me no pleasure to be harrowing the people of Cromane or anywhere else.  So long as I take £2,500 as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, I must carry out the commands of the law, but, <i>ad interim,</i> I think it is right that the Deputy should be informed that the fishermen in Cromane had some difficulty in drawing their draw net owing to the rocky condition of the shore and perhaps the Deputy is already aware that steps are being taken to level out the <Col N="1860" /> beach there so that they can without damage to draw nets effectively draw them while, if they have it in mind, they are preparing to bring me into court and prove that I am mistaken in my belief that I have to enforce the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been fully aware for some time of the dangers to the Irish economy inherent in the growing scarcity of certain essential raw materials.</P>
      <P>In September, 1950, the Industrial Development Authority, at my request, took steps to encourage and facilitate the accumulation of reserve stocks. They advised manufacturers, in their own interests and in the national interest, to lay in stocks representing at least six months' supplies.  Manufacturers in general signified their willingness to co-operate and they took such steps as were possible to lay in reserve stocks.  To a substantial extent, the materials ordered at that time have come forward and have enabled manufacturers to withstand the impact of shortages which have since developed on an international plane.  In the case of some of the materials which seem likely to be in chronically short supply (e.g., sulphur), substantial orders were placed and accepted, but delivery could not be effected because of the restrictions imposed by exporting countries.</P>
      <P>The Government are taking all possible steps to secure international allocations of commodities in short supply, with a view to maintaining such stocks as will meet the needs of essential Irish industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that I have accepted recommendations made by the Industrial Development Authority for a relaxation of quota and tariff restrictions <Col N="1866" /> on certain commodities in order to assist stockpiling of goods manufactured from scarce raw materials.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have been fully alive to the desirability of encouraging and facilitating the accumulation in this country of stocks and reserves of spare parts, replacements and equipment for agricultural tractors and agricultural machinery.</P>
      <P>The Government considered that such stocks and reserves could most suitably be accumulated by the importers normally handling such items, and, as long ago as September last, consultations took place with all the principal importers and Irish manufacturers, who were advised to make provision against a possible future scarcity.  The firms concerned signified their willingness to co-operate and most of them had, in fact, already taken action for the purpose of meeting future shortages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Facilities are available to Irish firms to import agricultural tractors, machinery and equipment, as well as <Col N="1867" /> parts and replacements therefor, without payment of customs duty, and I am satisfied, from the substantial imports which took place during 1950 and the early months of 1951, that the trade generally is fully alive to the needs of the time and has taken energetic action to meet them as far as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state if the 1 per cent. tea-weighing allowance previously allowed to grocers has been withdrawn; if so, if he will <Col N="1870" /> state the reasons for this decision, the estimated saving of subsidy, and how grocers are expected to recover the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. This allowance was introduced in August, 1949, when the rationing of tea was for the first time related specifically to the surrender of coupons.  Retailers' quotas under the new system were regulated automatically by the coupons lodged with them and surrendered by them to their suppliers. It was felt that in the transitory stage retailers might encounter difficulties through the lack of a margin for contingencies in their quotas and the weighing-out allowance was introduced to meet these anticipated difficulties.  It was made clear at the time that this was a temporary measure and subject to review.  When the position came to be reviewed it was decided that the new system had been long enough in operation to justify the withdrawal of the allowance. The estimated saving in subsidy as a result of the withdrawal is £20,000 a year.  I do recognise that in certain cases grocers' quotas of rationed tea may not be sufficient to cover losses incurred in weighing and that they may have to make good the deficiency by the purchase of unrationed tea.  I can see no reason, however, why the Exchequer should make good to grocers, in the case of tea, weighing-out losses which are not made good in the case of other commodities, the retail prices of which are controlled.</P>

      <P>I propose this year to preface my budgetary proposals with a brief outline of the economic and financial conditions in which they are being introduced and which they in turn will influence.  So far as the recent past is concerned I am greatly facilitated by the National Income and <Col N="1876" /> Expenditure Tables published at the beginning of March by the Central Statistics Office.  While our information in this respect is reasonably comprehensive and reliable, it is particularly hazardous this year to venture predictions about the future.  We are going through an anxious period and until, as we pray, the clouds pass we must expect to encounter difficulties and reverses in our economic life.  In these unsettled conditions financial policy must necessarily be somewhat tentative but capable of adjustment should there be a further disimprovement in the economic situation.</P>
      <P>The broad purpose of my survey is to see whether all is well with the sources on which we depend for the maintenance of consumption and investment at their present levels and whether we are so ordering our affairs that, given normal conditions, we could reasonably expect to maintain in the future the standards of living set up in the immediate past.</P>
      <P Just="Center">PRODUCTION</P>
      <P>I shall begin with home production, which is the primary source of our income and wealth.  Gross agricultural output had by 1949 virtually regained the 1938 volume.  Last year, bad weather affected the output of crops and turf and, as a result of the decline under these headings, total output fell short of the 1949 level.  There was an improvement in the production of live stock and live-stock products.  The turf campaign and the improved prices for wheat and beet mark the Government's desire that production of these crops should be greatly increased this year. Viewed in relation to our export potential, the increase in the population of cattle and sheep revealed by the January, 1951, live-stock census is encouraging, but satisfaction is tempered by the drop in the number of pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In industry, the improvement recorded in recent years continues.  The expansion has been pretty general.  For some industries, such as hosiery, textiles, engineering, confectionery, footwear and bacon-curing, 1950 was a year of marked activity.  As might be <Col N="1877" /> expected, there has been an enormous expansion in recent years in the output of industries supplying materials for house-building and furnishing.</P>
    <P>If supplies of raw materials for agriculture and industry can be maintained, production can be still further expanded, but present prospects are not altogether reassuring.  Increased output is particularly necessary in agriculture because of the urgent desirability of an increase in our exports, four-fifths of which are derived from the land.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EMPLOYMENT</P>
    <P>Employment in industry has followed the same upward trend as output. There are now over 133,000 persons employed in the transportable goods industries as compared with under 100,000 persons in 1938 &mdash; an increase of one-third.  In insurable occupations generally, the average weekly number employed has risen from 416,000 in 1938 to 490,000 in 1950 &mdash; an increase of 74,000.  The secular downward trend in agricultural employment continues but since 1943 new openings in other occupations have more than made up for the fall in the numbers engaged on the land.  To this extent a significant contribution has been made towards solving the problem of emigration though at some cost from a purely economic standpoint.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EARNINGS</P>
    <P>Earnings per worker have doubled since 1938 and have thus outpaced the rise in the cost of living.  The index of weekly earnings for October, 1950, was 201.7, related to 100 for October, 1938.  In agriculture the improvement in wages since pre-war has been relatively greater than in industry and there is now a better balance between employment conditions in agriculture and industry.  In many industrial and service occupations wage rates are higher than they are in Britain.  Recent wage awards have unfortunately tended generally to increase the differential.  I refer later to the need for moderation on the part of all sections of the community&mdash;employers and employees alike &mdash; in the pursuit of <Col N="1878" /> higher monetary incomes unrelated to increases in output.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRICES AND MONETARY SITUATION</P>
    <P>The stresses to which our economy is at present subject arise largely from increased prices and these in turn are due in the main to external circumstances. After a period of virtual stability import prices took an upward turn last summer when we began to experience the delayed impact of devaluation, later reinforced by the effects of rearmament and the stockpiling associated with it.  There is reason to fear that we have not yet experienced the full consequences of the increased international demand for basic commodities.  Concurrently with the rise in import prices there has occurred an increase in our trade deficit; the return for our exports, though it also has increased, has advanced less than the cost of our imports.  When what we produce for export does not go as far as before towards paying for our import needs we suffer, as a nation, a reduction in the standard of living we can afford. Increases in remuneration offer no escape from this unwelcome development; indeed, they can only accelerate the process of inflation and cause social injustice as between those able to improve or maintain their position and those who cannot enlarge their incomes and are therefore forced to assume an undue burden of hardship. For this reason, the Government ask for restraint in the putting forward of wage and salary claims and have taken measures intended to limit price increases to those justified by increases in costs.</P>
    <P>The rise in import prices has naturally had an effect on wholesale prices and on agricultural prices, which have gone up by 14 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively, as compared with a year ago.  Increased prices and incomes, and the scale of national expenditure associated with them, have had marked reactions on our economy.  The level of bank advances and the monetary circulation has also increased.  During 1950-51 bank advances in Ireland rose by over <Col N="1879" /> £19,000,000.  Bank investments increased by almost £6,000,000 as a direct result of subscriptions by the banks to the Exchequer Bonds issue and the taking up of Dublin Corporation stock. That much of the new credit was spent on imports is shown by the fact that the sterling holdings of the banks decreased by nearly £19,000,000, bank deposits &mdash; including those on public accounts &mdash; going up by approximately £12,000,000.  The increase in certain prices and the greater volume of transactions to be financed account for the rise in the total circulation of notes and coin from £55.1 million on the 1st April, 1950, to £58.1 million, or 5 per cent. more, at the 31st March, last.  In present circumstances it is desirable that the banks, while continuing to finance capital projects, the laying-in of essential stocks, and normal import requirements, should discourage any merely speculative or excessive borrowing.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL INCOME</P>
    <P>The national income for 1950 has been provisionally estimated at £363,000,000 as compared with £352,000,000 for 1949 and £334,000,000 for 1948.  In part, these figures represent merely a monetary change.  But they contain some solid element of improvement in the real standard of income of the community of which the rise in output and in consumption is the direct evidence.  Of the national income of £363,000,000, agriculture contributes £104,000,000, industry £86,000,000, distribution and transport £70,000,000, other internal sources £80,000,000, making a total of £340,000,000, the balance coming from outside, £10,000,000 of it in the form of emigrants' remittances.  Non-agricultural income is distributed as between salaries, wages and pensions on the one hand and profits, interest and rent on the other as to roughly two-thirds and one-third; wage-earners are now getting a larger share of the national income than in 1938.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONSUMPTION</P>
    <P>In 1950 we were consuming over 25 per cent. more than in 1938.  Between <Col N="1880" /> 1938 and 1949 there was an increase in the consumption of food of 12 per cent., of drink and tobacco of 16 per cent., of clothing of 10 per cent.  Purchases of other goods have increased even more markedly.  I might instance motor cars, bicycles, wireless sets and household goods of various kind, including carpets and furniture.</P>
    <P>The material improvement in our mode of life since 1938 is in itself highly satisfactory, but as our agricultural output is still not above pre-war and our exports are only at pre-war level, one may wonder whether we can sustain such a greatly improved standard of living as we enjoyed in 1950.  This is the crucial question to which I shall devote the remainder of this survey.  It is true that industrial output has increased and that the tourist trade has developed since 1938 so that it has become a mainstay of our economy.  But a full answer to the question whether as a nation we are living beyond our means depends on a consideration of our balance of payments, present and prospective.  A deficit in the balance of payments is a means of adding to our current resources &mdash; a means open to us because we have been able to finance additional imports by drawing on our sterling assets and incurring dollar indebtedness. Deficits in the balance of payments cannot, however, be sustained for more than a short period; they involve an initial loss of purchasing power over imports owing to the depletion of external capital and the income derived from it.  Unless we are building up our productive capacity to an adequate degree, so that by increasing our exports or reducing our imports we can within a few years equalise our external receipts and payments, we must inevitably suffer a decline in our living standards.  Our external credits are far from being inexhaustible; they can be used up now only at the expense of the future unless they are used for productive purposes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TRADE AND PAYMENTS</P>
    <P>It is provisionally estimated that there was a deficit in 1950 in the balance of payments of about <Col N="1881" /> £30,000,000 as compared with £10,000,000 in 1949 and £20,000,000 in 1948.  It is prima facie disquieting that the approach to equilibrium indicated by the 1949 figure suffered such a drastic reverse in 1950.  Before any conclusions are formed, however, the causes of the 1950 deficit must be carefully analysed.</P>
    <P>It may be said at once that the widening of the gap between external receipts and payments in 1950 was due primarily to increased outlay on imports&mdash;£160,000,000 as compared with £130,000,000.  Exports increased from £61,000,000 to £72,000,000 but there was some decline in net invisible receipts; tourism in particular yielded less because our own expenditure abroad was exceptionally heavy on account of Holy Year pilgrimages. The import increase of £30,000,000 was the result, almost equally, of larger quantities and higher prices.  An analysis of the trade returns shows that producers' capital goods increased by £2,000,000; imports of food, drink and tobacco by £2.4 million, tea, sugar and tobacco being the main items; other imports for direct consumption, including petrol and household coal, accounted for a further £3,000,000.  The main increase, however, was in materials for industry imports of which rose by £22,000,000 in 1950.  This is the category that includes textile materials which were up by £4.3 million, wheat up by £2.1 million and a wide variety of other goods intended, when processed, to be sold to the domestic consumer.</P>
    <P>The increased imports of currants and raisins, raw cocoa and sugar were, however, destined to a considerable extent to become ingredients in exports of confectionery, chocolate crumb, jams and preserved fruit which taken together rose by £4.2 million last year. The analysis shows that we are importing necessaries rather than frivolities and the only question is whether we can afford to keep spending on imports on the 1950 scale.  For the answer to this we must look at the total pool of goods and services resulting from retained home production and imports and see whether we are devoting enough to investment and consuming <Col N="1882" /> no more than our current production entitles us to do.</P>
    <P>This is an appropriate point to introduce the term &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;.  The classical definition, in popular language, is &ldquo;too much money chasing too few goods&rdquo; and, therefore, driving up prices.  In our circumstances the definition might be re-formulated as &ldquo;too much money attracting too much imports,&rdquo; since over-spending by the public and the State is able to find an outlet in purchases from abroad financed not from income but from our past accumulations.  In a state of normality, we should be able to live on our income and indeed save enough of it for capital purposes not only to maintain but actually to increase our production and, therefore, our standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is still proper and eminently reasonable to draw on our external assets if thereby we speed up the process of capital development at home. What is abnormal and, if it persists, can be seriously damaging, is to use up our external resources for consumption purposes.  Have we being doing that?</P>
    <P Just="Center">INVESTMENT AND STOCKPILING</P>
    <P>What we did in 1950 was to add to the current resources available for investment or consumption by realising sterling assets and incurring dollar indebtedness to pay for imports we could not otherwise buy.  But, as I have indicated, we need not be concerned about external disinvestment which is balanced by a net increase in productive capital outlay at home. Indeed, last year I went so far as to say that, even if this outlay were not fully productive, some net loss of external purchasing power might be regarded as a premium worth paying for the expansion of employment and the greater economic and social security which domestic investment might afford.  It has been estimated by the Central Statistics Office that the increase in external disinvestment of £20,000,000 in 1950 as compared with 1949 has been accompanied by a net addition of £6,500,000 to physical capital at home.  The whole of the <Col N="1883" /> balance of £13,500,000 was not, I am glad to say, dissipated in consumption. There was, indeed, a loss to the economy owing to the relatively greater increase in import than in export prices; this loss has been estimated at about £8,000,000.  There is evidence that most, if not all, of the remaining £5,500,000 of the increase is represented by additions to stocks or advance purchases of such necessaries as sugar, tea, maize, fertilisers, tobacco, building materials, textiles, chemicals, rubber and household goods.  As regards both the additional home investment and the increases in stocks, we have value to show for the increase in the deficit.  The position is, however, far from satisfactory inasmuch as the basic £10,000,000 deficit of 1949 was repeated in 1950 and the disimprovement in the terms of trade in that year has also still to be made good.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of the present time may, however, be exceptional and as time goes on a better balance will, I hope, be achieved between our earnings from abroad and our necessary external outlay.  It is reasonable to expect both an expansion in our agricultural exports and better prices for them.  It is also possible that net tourist receipts will be greater this year.  When the accumulation of stocks has ceased expenditure on imports should decline.  The rise in import prices should, in due course, expend itself.  It would, however, be optimistic to expect an early reduction in the trade deficit.  The outlook for 1951 is, I fear, that the deficit may be even greater than in 1950.</P>
    <P>The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory, and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.  At the moment these might be premature. It is not so long since we were forced to accumulate surpluses on the balance of payments because of a shortage of imports.  While the materials are still available it is right that the State and private individuals should proceed with productive capital development to the utmost extent possible.  It is, however, <Col N="1884" /> also desirable that the public should transfer to the State for the purposes of its capital development programme a greater share of the purchasing power now being expended on the less essential consumer goods.  I concede that a substantial reduction in taxation on incomes would be a valuable stimulus to savings and investment, but the way to this is not clear.  Only if the gap in the balance of payments is narrowed so that external disinvestment is balanced by additional home investment &mdash; rather than by excessive consumption &mdash; can we be satisfied that as a nation we are making ends meet and not wasting our past accumulations.  One of the great benefits conferred by the possession of external assets is ability to ride out periods like the present of exceptional difficulty and stress, but this external mass of manæuvre is the mainstay of our economic independence.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>The general purpose of this broad survey was to examine the extent of the resources available to us from our own production and from imports and to see whether we are making the best use of these resources.  The conclusion to which the analysis leads is that, while the extra external disinvestment we incurred in 1950 was balanced as to roughly two-thirds by new home investment and increased stocks, there still continues to be a substantial use of past savings merely to lever up standards of consumption.  Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious.  We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.  Additional saving would ease the congestion that now exists and causes consumer demand to seek an outlet in imports.  It would relieve the pressure on the balance of payments and help to confine external disinvestment &mdash; or surplus imports&mdash;to what is needed for home development or stockpiling.  Additional home development would itself promote an increase in production and <Col N="1885" /> thus yield new resources to satisfy consumption permanently on a higher level and enable our exports to be expanded to close in time the gap in the balance of payments.  It is to these ends that our economic policy should be directed, and the Budget should help and not hinder their attainment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">II.  CURRENT BUDGET</P>
    <P Just="Center">FINANCIAL YEAR 1950-51</P>
    <P>Without increasing taxation and after providing £600,000 for Supplementary Estimates I expected to finish last year with a surplus of £28,000 odd. As things turned out my expectations were too modest in regard to all three items &mdash; expenditure, revenue and surplus.</P>
    <P>The original estimate of current expenditure was in fact exceeded by £1,394,000, the total coming to £77,070,000 as against the estimate of £75,676,000.  Part of the uncovenanted increase was due to purchases of reserve stocks (£520,000) but the main causes were the persistence of Córas Iompair Eireann losses and the heavier burden of bread subsidy.</P>
    <P>The resilience of the revenue was, however, equal to the strain.  Customs duties yielded £1,510,000 more than I expected, corporation profits tax £148,000 more and death duties a further £100,000 so that despite a shortfall in income-tax receipts, which were delayed by the bank strike, the net sum collected by the Revenue Commissioners exceeded the Budget estimate by £1,219,000.  Road tax receipts, too, were better than had been anticipated.  Non-tax revenue also surpassed our original expectations. This gratifying buoyancy of the revenue yielded in all a net addition of £1,651,000 to the Budget figures and resulted in a surplus of revenue over current expenditure of £286,000, which helped in a small way to finance the capital programme.  The result can be viewed with particular satisfaction because of the accumulation of reserve stocks out of current revenue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FINANCIAL YEAR 1951-52</P>
    <P>In the White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure for the current year non-capital <Col N="1886" /> expenditure is estimated at a total of £81,361,000 &mdash; £10,405,000 for Central Fund Services and £70,956,000 odd for Supply Services other than those classified as Capital Services. The Central Fund Services are up by £702,000 as compared with actual issues in 1950-51 or by £889,000 when allowance is made for the capital provided for the Industrial Credit Company last year.  Disregarding certain offsets, two items are mainly responsible for the increase.  Service of debt is up by £691,000 because a full year's provision has to be made for interest and Sinking Fund on the 3½ per cent. Exchequer Bonds issued last September and a further 30 years' annuity has to be provided for in respect of this year's £12,080,000 for Capital Services. Secondly, issues to the Road Fund are expected to reach £3,000,000 as compared with last year's £2,814,000 because of the expanding revenue from motor vehicle duties.</P>
    <P>The estimate for non-capital Supply Services shows an increase of £3,401,000 over the comparable outlay in 1950-51.  Ignoring the provision for reserve stocks the main increases are for Defence, Health Services, Old Age Pensions, Posts and Telegraphs and Industry and Commerce.  Included in the estimated expenditure of £70,956,000 is £1,793,000 for the purchase of reserve stocks by various Departments, e.g., Posts and Telegraphs, Defence, Justice, Health, the Stationery Office and Gaeltacht Services.</P>
    <P>Full provision has been made, in addition, for normal purchases and for the maintenance of customary stocks, so that the £1,793,000 is intended to create a true reserve as a provision both against higher prices and possible shortages.  It is not, as Deputies will agree, a charrge that I could reasonably expect the taxpayer to assume this year.  The expenditure on these stocks should be charged against revenue according as the reserves are in fact, drawn upon.  This will be a matter for review in connection with future Budgets, but, so far as this year is concerned, I can appropriately deduct the whole of the provision, thus <Col N="1887" /> reducing the estimate of current expenditure to £79,568,000.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if this year's Budget is to be framed with some approach to the prudence that the economic situation demands, I must anticipate that current expenditure in the year will exceed the original estimate.  Last year, as I have already mentioned, the excess amounted to almost £1.4 million.  This year it will be somewhat greater.  As already announced, the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill provides increases in old age and blind pensions and further substantial modifications of the means test, and a beginning must be made this year to meet these and other expenditures of social security.  A mother and child scheme, which will come into operation in this financial year, necessitates outlay greater than the sum already in the Estimates.  A Bill now before the House envisages increased grants for the Tourist Board.  I have, therefore, decided that I should add at least £1,500,000 to the estimates of expenditure, not indeed to be on the safe side but as a minimum precaution.  I must utter a warning against any facile assumption that this provides me with a reserve into which I can dip to meet the demands that are being pressed upon me from various quarters.  The £1,500,000 must be regarded as already fully committed and any additional expenditure must entail corresponding increases in taxes or other charges.</P>
    <P>The expenditure figure thus becomes £81,068,000.  Revenue at existing rates of taxation is estimated in the White Paper at £80,482,000 so that I am £586,000 short.  The estimated tax revenue &mdash; £70,490,000 &mdash; shows an increase of £2,772,000 over 1950-51. Under the heading of customs I expect to get £905,000 more.  I may say here a few words about tobacco, which is the mainstay of customs revenue.  Following successive relaxations, control over releases from bond was wholly removed last July and clearances since have shown a sustained increase. Imports of manufactured tobacco have fallen almost to the pre-war level.  This fact alone should prove, if proof were <Col N="1888" /> needed, that cigarettes are now freely available to the consumer.  They are, moreover, gaining somewhat in popularity as against pipe tobacco. From income-tax (including sur-tax) I hope for an extra £1,394,000 partly because of the increase in the number and carnings of taxpayers and partly because we shall be taking in payments due last year which were delayed by the bank strike.</P>
    <P>Non-tax revenue is estimated at £9,992,000, or £354,000 more than last year's receipts.  The increase is mainly in Post Office revenue and is due to normal expansion of business and recent increases in certain postal charges which form part of a plan to redress the serious discrepancy between Post Office costs and receipts and restore commercial solvency.  Despite every effort to secure economy and greater efficiency in the operation of its services the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has in recent years been operating at a loss.  The cost of maintaining its services has grown. Wages have increased substantially; other working costs have risen, including those affected by devaluation; and additional capital expenditure has had to be incurred in extending and improving services.  It is traditionally the Department's policy to make its services pay for themselves on a commercial basis and, to achieve this, increases in charges have become necessary.  The Irish Post Office is not alone in having to take this step.  Other administrations have recently been obliged to revise their charges or are preparing to do so.</P>
    <P>The deficit of £586,000 will be reduced to £286,000 by a contribution of £300,000 from the Road Fund.  This is less than I am entitled to take having regard to the additional revenue produced by the 1947 increases in motor vehicle duties, but I have exercised restraint in consideration of the commencement this year of repayment by the fund of post-war advances by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I now come to what Deputies and the public outside are no doubt anxious to hear: how I propose to meet this deficit of £286,000.  It inevitably entails <Col N="1889" /> additional taxation, but to ease the new burden I propose to accord certain reliefs, the net result being, I hope, at least an approximation to equity.  I shall deal first with the additional imposts.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PETROL AND OILS</P>
    <P>Consumption of petrol rose from 45,500,000 gallons in 1948-49 to an estimated 62,500,000 last year.  During the year imports increased in value by over £1,000,000, and we are now spending on motor spirit alone at the rate of over £4,000,000 a year, part of it representing dollar outlay.  Registrations of new private cars reached a peak of 17,524 in 1950, making for the last three years the remarkable total of 45,552.  It would seem that the rise of duty from 9d. to 1/2 per gallon, imposed in 1948, has in no way hindered the increasing use of motor transport.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, that I can safely propose to raise the customs duties on petrol and oil from 1/2 to 1/4 a gallon, with a consequential increase in the complementary excise duties.  The increase will become effective immediately, but in order that there may be no additional burden in respect of petrol purchased for and used in agricultural tractors and farm engines a concurrent Order increasing the repayment of duty from 6d. to 8d. per gallon in such cases will be made. The price of petrol in Dublin should not exceed 3/0¼d. a gallon (1d. more in the country) which still compares favourably with 3/6 in Britain and with the prices obtaining in many continental countries.  The additional yield this year is estimated at £600,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEATH DUTIES</P>
    <P>I am also proposing a new scale of rates for death duties which will produce a net additional yield of £400,000 this year.</P>
    <P>The rates at present in force were fixed by the Finance Act, 1941.  Estates of a net value not exceeding £100 are exempt.  From £100 to £500 the duty is 1 per cent. and the rates then increase by stages up to a maximum <Col N="1890" /> rate of 41.6 per cent. for estates exceeding £400,000 in net value.</P>
    <P>I propose, first of all, to raise the exemption limit from £100 to £2,000. Secondly, I propose to reduce the rates for estates from £2,000 to £7,500. In the range £2,000 to £3,000 the present rate is 3 per cent.; it will be reduced to 1 per cent.  For estates from £3,000 to £5,000 the existing rate of 3 per cent. will be lowered to 2 per cent.; and for estates between £5,000 and £7,500 the present rate of 4 per cent. will become 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>To make up for these reliefs, which will exempt the majority of estates from duty and reduce its incidence on many more, I am proposing steeper rates in the higher ranges.  The increase will affect estates over £12,500, the duty rising to a maximum of 53 per cent. for estates over £250,000.</P>
    <P>An adjustment as regards legacy and succession duties is a necessary corollary to the change in estate duties. Legacy or succession duty is at present chargeable only if the net value of the estate exceeds £1,000.  The proposed raising of the exemption limit from £100 to £2,000 for estate duty would result in there being cases between £1,000 and £2,000 which would be exempt from estate duty but would be liable to legacy or succession duty.  I propose to avoid this anomaly by making £2,000 the exemption limit also for these duties.  The existing provision for marginal relief will also be adjusted.</P>
    <P>A further matter affecting death duties also needs attention.  There are various provisions in the Finance Acts under which securities, chiefly Government securities, may be issued on the basis that neither the capital nor the interest shall be liable to any taxation so long as it is shown that the securities are in the beneficial ownership of a person who is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.  The object is to encourage foreign investors to take up and hold such securities, and the tax exemption is intended for them alone.  It was decided recently, however, by the court in another country, where corresponding provisions are in operation, that the <Col N="1891" /> exemption applied irrespective of the domicile or ordinary residence at death of the deceased person, once the successor in title was neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the country. If this decision were applied to our circumstances, it would mean that securities which form part of the estate of an Irishman who had lived here all his life and which would properly be chargeable, would be exempt from duty merely because the person succeeding to the securities was a foreigner.  This, of course, was never intended and it is proposed to put the matter beyond doubt by a provision in the Finance Bill confirming the original intention and preserving long-established practice.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCOME-TAX</P>
    <P>The increased duty on petrol and oils and the revised scale of death duties in the higher ranges are the only additional taxes proposed.  I now come to the reliefs.  In 1948, I promised to endeavour to ease the burden of income-tax and improve the personal reliefs at the earliest possible moment.  I took action in the following year when I had the standard rate of income-tax reduced by 6d. in the £ at an estimated cost, in a full year, of £1,000,000.  Provision was also made in 1949 for an increase in the dependent relative allowance from £25 to £50; for an increase in the housekeeper allowance from £45 to £100; and for the granting of a child allowance in respect of a year of assessment if the child was living at any time during that year &mdash; and not merely if the child was living at the beginning of the year.  These improvements in the allowances and the lowering of the rate by 6d. in the £ meant a loss to the Exchequer of approximately £1,200,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>Again last year I referred to the question of revising the personal allowances and said I would give it priority if circumstances permitted. While I should have liked to recommend to the House an all-round improvement in allowances, it is unfortunately not possible to do so because of the serious loss of revenue <Col N="1892" /> involved.  I have decided that the best thing to do is to give relief where it is most needed &mdash; to the married man, especially the married man with children.  I propose, therefore, that the allowance for a married man should be raised by £20, which will bring it to £280.  I also propose that the deduction in respect of a child should be increased by £20.  The deduction will in future stand at £80 for a first or second child and at £63 for any subsequent child (for whom a weekly cash allowance, not subject to tax, is available under the Children's Allowances Acts).  The necessary provisions will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>A couple of examples will illustrate how my proposals will work in practice. A married man who has two children and who is earning an annual £600 will find his tax bill reduced from £16 5s. 0d. to £6 10s. 0d.  If the married man has £700 per annum earned income and has three children he will be called upon to pay £9 5s. 3d. in place of £28 5s. 6d. &mdash; that is, his bill will be reduced by £19 0s. 3d.</P>
    <P>These two increases in the income-tax allowances will, it is estimated, cost £374,000 this year.  They will have the effect of removing many thousands of cases from the tax rolls.</P>
    <P>I have also given some thought to the position of elderly people with small or comparatively small investment incomes representing a lifetime's savings.  I am prepared to regard the annual yield these investments produce as tantamount to earned income.  My proposal is that a special income-tax allowance be granted of one-fifth of the total income &mdash; that is, from investments or from any other source &mdash; of persons of the age of 65 years or upwards whose total income is not in excess of £500.  As regards any earned income included in the total, the new allowance will be in substitution for, and not in addition to the existing earned income relief.  In the case of a married couple this special allowance may be accorded where either the husband or his wife (living with him) has reached the age of 65.  In such a case, however, the combined total income must come within the limit prescribed. <Col N="1893" /> Where the total income exceeds the limit, marginal relief may be allowed. This new allowance will, it is estimated, cost the Exchequer £32,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>There is an old provision in the income-tax code by virtue of which a registered trade union may be exempted from tax on interest and dividends applied solely for the purpose of provident benefits.  The exemption may be given if the trade union is precluded by its rules from assuring to any person an annuity in excess of a certain maximum, now £80 a year.  Following representations received I propose to have the limit raised to £130 in this year's Finance Bill.  The cost may be disregarded, as this measure will not have the effect of extending relief to any trade union which has not already enjoyed it.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1927, contained a section enabling the Government to enter into arrangements with foreign Governments for the reciprocal relief from taxation of profits derived from the business of shipping.  The section which gave legal effect to such arrangements was amended in 1936 so as to include profits from air transport. This provision as amended is not appropriate to present circumstances; for one thing, while it covers income-tax it does not extend to corporation profits tax.  I propose to have an up-to-date enabling section inserted in this year's Finance Bill.  In so far as relief from foreign taxes would be afforded, the development of our overseas transport would be aided considerably by the conclusion of international agreements under the proposed section.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STAMP DUTIES</P>
    <P>In my Budget speech last year I referred to the 5 per cent. stamp duty imposed by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, on transfers or leases of houses and lands.  I expressed regred that I was unable to propose any alteration in the incidence of the duty but under took that the matter would be reviewed again before the next Budget.  Deputies may recall, incidentally, that subsection (6) of Section 6 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950 &mdash; which was passed in August, after the Finance <Col N="1894" /> Act &mdash; provided for a reduction of the stamp duty rate from 5 per cent. to 1 per cent. in connection with any transfer or lease of a house qualifying for a grant on first sale under the main provisions of the same section.</P>
    <P>I now propose, as regards the types of case still affected by the 5 per cent. duty, that that rate should be reduced to 3 per cent. of the amount or value of the consideration.</P>
    <P>A minor point arises in this connection. Where the amount or value of the consideration exceeds £500 and does not exceed £1,000 the existing law provides a graduated scale finishing on the note that, where the amount or value is £1,000 but not more, the duty chargeable is £50 &mdash; in other words, at the rate of 5 per cent.  This graduated scale will require consequential amendment so that it will go up, not to 5 per cent., but to 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Provision for these changes will appear in the Finance Bill and they will come into effect on the 1st August next or the date of the passing of the Finance Act, whichever is the later day.  It is estimated that, this year, the cost of bringing down the rate as proposed will run to £233,000.  I am not proposing this year any alteration in the 25 per cent. rate.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1947, doubled the stamp duties chargeable under the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, on conveyances or transfers of stocks or marketable securities.  The doubling of the duties meant an increase in the rate from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent.  I now propose that the rate of duty should be reduced to its original 1 per cent. as regards conveyances or transfers of any stock or marketable security issued, whether before or after the passing of the Finance Act, by an Irish company. This relief will operate as on and from the 1st August next, or, should it occur later, the date of the passing of the Finance Act.</P>
    <P>It has been represented strongly to me that, if a reduction were effected as now proposed, it would give a notable impetus to investment in Irish securities generally and would improve the market for new issues.  I am, therefore, taking this step in the hope that it will add to the attractiveness of <Col N="1895" /> Irish securities and encourage Irish investors to invest their capital in them rather than outside the country.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, stress that this relief will not effect transfers of shares in external companies, except in a limited field for which it is considered desirable to make special provision. As regards external companies, the reduction in the rate will apply only where shares are transferred on branch registers established by such companies in this country.</P>
    <P>The relief will cost roughly £25,000 this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ENTERTAINMENTS DUTY</P>
    <P>The yield of duty under this head shows a continuous and satisfactory upward trend which discounts suggestions that the entertainment industry has passed its peak.  I have carefully considered various representations made to me, but I cannot discern that in general any sufficient case exists for review of the various scales of duty or, in particular, of the concession to rural areas, save in one respect.  This concession was designed solely to improve social amenities in the more sparsely populated districts, but there is evidence that in some cases it is being availed of deliberately to attract custom from other areas or for the purpose of holding the more expensive type of formal dance.  In so far as the concession was intended for local enjoyment, I think it wrong that it should be exploited for profit, and I therefore propose to take power in the Finance Bill to charge all dances in tax-free areas where the price of admission exceeds 3/9.  This will leave free of duty the normal dance in the village hall, as originally intended.  Another anomaly which will be rectified in the Bill is the case of the town in which the population exceeds the limit of 500 solely because the census figure includes the total of the inmates of an institution of some kind.  Power will be taken to deduct this figure so as to give such a town the benefit of the concession.  In both these cases the effect on revenue yield will be inconsiderable.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EFFECT OF TAX CHANGES</P>
    <P>The new imposts, for which financial <Col N="1896" /> resolutions will be moved, will bring in £1,000,000 this year, while the reliefs proposed will cost £664,000.  The net addition to the revenue this year will, accordingly, be £336,000, and setting this against the deficit of £286,000, the modest surplus of £50,000 emerges.</P>
    <P Just="Center">III.  CAPITAL BUDGET</P>
    <P Just="Center">GENERAL</P>
    <P>The Capital Budget presented last year provided for an expenditure of £34,000,000.  Actual expenditure amounted to £24.6 million; the reasons for the shortfall will appear later.  For 1951-52, the Capital Budget is £29.4 million, for which provision is made as follows, actual expenditure in 1950-51 being given for comparison:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> The full extent of public cutlay on capital works is not revealed by these figures.  Last year, for instance, Dublin and Cork Corporations spent over £4,000,000 from their own resources, mainly on housing.  They will be spending on a similar scale this year but not, I expect, without some aid from State sources.  The port authorities of these two boroughs spent over £900,000. Account has also to be taken of the expenditure of the Electricity Supply Board from depreciation and other internal funds (£1.1 million last year) and the outlay on hospitals financed by the realisation of investments of the Hospitals Trust Fund (£2.2 million). Thus, under these heads, capital expenditure was incurred last year on public projects of over £8,000,000 in addition to the £24.6 million which the State financed directly.  It is likely that experience this year will be similar.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from the table that this year again the biggest items in the State Capital Budget are housing and agricultural and power development, electricity and turf coming within the latter term.  I shall refer briefly to what was achieved under these heads in 1950-51 and explain the provisions for the current year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">HOUSING</P>
    <P>Although local authorities over-estimated their financial requirements, progress in house-building last year was unprecedented.  Nearly 8,000 houses were completed by local authorities as compared with the previous highest output of 6,931 in 1938-39 and with 5,299 in 1949-50.  The improvement was not achieved at the expense of any lessening in the volume of work in progress; the average number of dwellings in course of erection was also higher than in the previous financial year.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for the maintenance of local authority housing on the same scale as last year.  The amount included for this purpose in the figure of £11.7 million is £9.9 million of which £7.3 million will take the form of loans from the Local Loans Fund and £2.6 million will be <Col N="1898" /> grants from voted moneys.  With the winding-up of the Transition Development Fund a third source of funds has disappeared, thus reducing somewhat the complexity of housing finance while maintaining the scale of State assistance.</P>
    <P>Of the balance of £1.8 million, £1,762,000 represents grants for private housing and £54,000 a grant to Bord na Móna towards the cost of a new housing scheme for turf workers.  Last year the provision for grants for private persons &mdash; £1,675,000 &mdash; was fully utilised.  The number of private houses completed with the aid of State grants was 4,300, which was well up to expectations and compares with a figure of 2,650 in the previous year.  The estimate for the current year is 5,000 so that, on present expectations, local authorities and private persons, with State assistance, will complete between them approximately 13,000 houses this year.</P>
    <P>State assistance for housing does not end with the provision of grants and loans for the erection of new houses; substantial contributions are being made by the Exchequer to local authorities to meet loan charges on debt incurred for housing.  Approximately £900,000 is provided in the current Budget for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I referred in last year's Budget statement to the need for distributing more equitably the burden of housing costs as between the Exchequer, local authorities and tenants.  It is satisfactory that in the course of last year there was a marked extension of differential renting systems which have now been adopted by 29 local authorities.</P>
    <P>During the past year there was evidence that local authority housing costs were becoming stabilised in both urban and rural areas, the increase in cost since 1939 being about 150 per cent. in rural areas and 190 per cent. in urban areas.  The cost of private building, however, increased last year.  The heavy demand for raw materials generated by world rearmament and stockpiling will inevitably result in a rise in building costs which will be accentuated by recent wage increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> The housing programme which we hope to carry through this year is of such proportions that even in normal times there would be a risk of increased costs arising from the heavy demand on labour and materials.  In present conditions, the risk is much greater and while the efforts made to build up stocks of essential building materials may lessen the effects of higher prices, a continuance of the present trend would greatly increase the burden which the housing programme places on tenants, ratepayers and taxpayers.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT</P>
    <P>Expenditure on agricultural development last year was only half of the original estimate.  This is accounted for mainly by the fact that expenditure on the land rehabilitation project was less than anticipated.  The progress of this scheme was retarded by a number of factors.  It proved extremely difficult to secure delivery from abroad of specialised drainage equipment, especially excavators.  Another cause of delay was difficulty in procuring suitable drainage pipes.  Expenditure on arterial drainage was also somewhat lower than expected because of difficulties in connection with the supply of machinery.  Generally, however, the most important cause of delay was the bad weather experienced during about nine months of the year 1950-51.</P>
    <P>It is expected that expenditure on the land project will reach £2,500,000 this year.  Some at least of the difficulties which impeded the work last year have been surmounted.  Delivery of machines, especially of the excavator type, is improving, and contractors are showing a greater willingness to participate in the scheme.  It is expected that suitable pipes of domestic manufacture will soon be in plentiful supply.  To allay any misapprehension that may exist, I should say that farmers can rest assured that their land valuations cannot be increased as a result of improvements under the land project.</P>
    <P>Apart from drainage works, assistance is being provided under the land <Col N="1900" /> project for the liming and fertilising of land.  Considerable progress has been made in the spreading of fertilisers since the introduction of the fertiliser credit scheme in September last.  The transport subsidy recently introduced should bring about the more extensive use of limestone, particularly as a suitable small-type spreader is now available.</P>
    <P>In addition to the drainage which is being done under the land project over £2,000,000 is being provided for arterial and local authority drainage. Expenditure on the latter is estimated at £1,220,000.  The more urgent works have now been completed and this accounts partly for the lower provision this year.  In framing the Estimate regard was also had to the undesirability of interfering with the supply of labour for turf production.  Total expenditure on these works since the Local Authorities (Works) Act was passed in 1949 amounts to £2,925,000.</P>
    <P>The balance of the provision for agricultural development this year is made up of grants for poultry and egg production and for the construction and improvement of farm buildings.  There is also a provision of £50,000 for the National Stud.</P>
    <P>Before passing from agriculture I should mention that within the last two years additional capital of £300,000 has been made available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation from the American Loan Counterpart Fund.  In addition to the sum of £100,000 provided from this source in 1949-50, £100,000 was made available last year and a similar sum in the last few weeks.  The provision of this extra capital makes it possible for the enterprising farmers to obtain credit facilities at very reasonable rates to enable them to increase the productivity of their farms.  It is satisfactory to know that farmers are availing of these facilities to a greater extent.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT</P>
    <P>The State has now invested almost £30,000,000 in electricity development since the start of the Shannon scheme but, although generating capacity is being constantly added to the demand <Col N="1901" /> for current continually threatens to outpace it.  It was only because of the very heavy rainfall last year that rationing was avoided.  Production amounted to 970,000,000 units, an increase of about 24 per cent. over the preceding year.</P>
    <P>Gross capital outlay by the Electricity Supply Board in 1951-52 is estimated at about £6,000,000; of which £4,750,000 will be met by Exchequer advances and the balance by temporary borrowings from depreciation reserves and superannuation funds. Nearly half the total outlay will again be devoted to the expansion of generating capacity, the expenditure being incurred mainly on the River Erne scheme, a new steam station at Ringsend and the turf-burning station at Allenwood.  In the course of last year the Cliff station on the Erne was put in commission and the Portarlington turf-burning station was completed. It is expected that in the present year a section of the turf-burning plant at Allenwood and another station on the Erne will be brought into service.</P>
    <P>Progress is continuing with rural electrification.  Last year, 15,803 new rural subscribers were connected as compared with 13,688 the year before. The total number of rural subscribers is now over 40,000.  The question of the early extension of electricity to the western seaboard is being specially examined by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TURF DEVELOPMENT</P>
    <P>A slightly larger provision is being made for advances to Bord na Móna than the amount issued last year.  The provision covers advances for the erection of houses for turf workers as well as for the production of machinewon turf by Bord na Móna.  It is expected that the output will amount to 350,000 tons as against 250,000 tons last year.  The increase will be wholly absorbed by the two generating stations at Clonsast and Allenwood. Industrial and domestic users must, therefore, look for any increased requirements to the private producer and, to a lesser extent, to a special scheme being operated by Bord an <Col N="1902" /> Móna for which working capital of £271,000 is provided in the Vote for Industry and Commerce.  Outlay will continue to be incurred this year by Bord na Móna on drainage works and the laying down of railways to give access to bogs which are being prepared for machine cutting at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The amount advanced to Bord na Móna for development purposes has already reached £4,593,000, of which £183,000 has been repaid, leaving £4,410,000 outstanding.  Interest is being paid on roughly £200,000 of pre-1946 advances.  The advances made under the 1946 and 1950 Acts for the first development scheme are interest-free for a five-year period which will end next month, when the question of charging interest will arise for consideration. The five-year interest relief for advances under the 1950 Act for the second scheme will not expire until 1955.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TELEPHONE DEVELOPMENT</P>
    <P>The £2,000,000 provided for capital expenditure on the telephone system is needed for the further improvement of the system.  There will be comparatively heavy expenditure on underground cables, including work on the Dublin-Cork cable and its offshoots and on the Dublin-Belfast cable.  Extensions of the automatic system are contemplated and further progress will be made in the linking-up of new subscribers. Provision has also been made for building up stocks of materials.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TRANSPORT</P>
    <P>As time does not permit me to deal with the other items in the capital programme, I shall end this brief exposition with some remarks about transport. Issues for transport were lower than was expected last year mainly because the resources of the Road Fund proved to be sufficient to meet the demands made upon it and borrowing from the Exchequer was unnecessary. This year £500,000 has been entered as the extent of possible borrowing by the fund.</P>
    <P>Advances were, however, made to Córas Iompair Éireann last year to <Col N="1903" /> meet debenture interest payments, the amount being £433,000, and provision is made for similar advances this year to the amount of £477,000.  These advances the concern is liable to repay but if it does not do so within a year the amount has to be made good to the Central Fund by a Vote provision.  This procedure is intended to call attention to the default and does not absolve Córas Iompair Éireann of its repayment liability.  Without prejudicing the issue, doubt may be expressed whether the board will be in a position to repay the advances made last year. In fact, these advances did not represent the full measure of the assistance accorded by the State to this undertaking, as it was found necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to provide £980,000 to meet its operating losses and revenue charges, apart from debenture interest.  It is questionable whether Córas Iompair Éireann can in the immediate future attain a position in which it will be able to meet all its operating expenses and discharge as well the interest on transport stock.  The board has a statutory duty&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;so to conduct its undertaking as to secure, as soon as may be, that, taking one year with another, the revenue shall be not less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This duty will, I hope, be discharged with the utmost expedition.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATE DEBT</P>
    <P>The financing of last year's capital programme resulted in a net addition of £20.5 million to the internal State debt which is brought up to £22.1 million by the increase during the year in the capital liability for housing loan charges.  During the year the liability for dollar borrowings, in other words our external debt, increased by £17.8 million, so that the gross capital liabilities of the State&mdash; including the housing charges liability &mdash;increased from £152.4 million to £192.3 million or by £39.9 million.  To set against the external debt, however, we have the assets of the American Loan Counterpart Fund and <Col N="1904" /> the remainder of the proceeds of dollar borrowings held in the Central Bank. The increase in the internal debt is balanced by capital expenditure in the year.</P>
    <P>Assets held in State enterprises in the form of shares and repayable advances yielded a return last year of 3.2 per cent. as compared with an average rate of interest on long-term debt outstanding of 3.3 per cent.  This approach to equality is due almost entirely to the return on money invested in electricity development.  A considerable proportion of the State investment programme relates to projects which are not productive in the financial sense such as housing, hospitals and sanitary services.  These, however, yield social benefits and, it is hoped, will eventually result in an improvement in productivity.  Other schemes, such as land reclamation and improvement, which are designed to achieve an increase in production on a long-term basis also yield little or no direct return to the Exchequer. If the objectives are realised, a resultant increase in national income should offset the burden of debt charges.  The growth of State expenditure on capital projects which are not directly remunerative carries with it the risk that the increased debt charges will entail a net addition to taxation.  The total amount required for the service of debt in 1951-52 is estimated at £7.35 million, which is an increase of approximately £0.85 million over last year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL LOAN CONVERSIONS</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government have decided to avail of their option to redeem four National Loans next July&mdash;the 5 per cent.  Second, of which the outstanding dollar portion was redeemed last November; the 4½ per cent Third; the 4 per cent.  Conversion Loan and the 4 per cent. Exchequer Bonds.  Stockholders will be given an opportunity of exchanging their holdings for stock of a new Government loan on terms which will be announced about a month before the redemption date and which, I hope, will be found attractive.</P>
    <P>The only previous conversion was that of the First National Loan in <Col N="1905" /> 1935, of which approximately £7,000,000 was then outstanding.  On this occasion the total amount of stock involved is almost £21,000,000.  In view of the size of the forthcoming operation it is most desirable that it should be carried through successfully, by which I mean that the new stock should be accepted by existing stockholders in preference to cash.  The replacement of the existing stocks by a new issue on terms more closely attuned to the present market rate would result in a saving to the Exchequer and, therefore, to the taxpayer and would obviate the need for finding new money to cover redemptions. I trust that stockholders will avail themselves of the conversion offer and thus assist in the reduction of the charge on taxpayers for the service of debt and at the same time show their appreciation of the excellent security afforded by Irish Government stock.  Facilities similar to those provided in the National Loan (Conversion) Act, 1935, for trustees, executors and administrators will again be accorded so as to ease any technical difficulties in the way of accepting the conversion offer.  The necessary legislation will be introduced at an early date.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOURCES OF FINANCE</P>
    <P>Exchequer issues of £22.3 million were required to finance the capital investment programme last year.  Of this sum, £21.7 million was obtained by borrowing, the balance being found by the reissue of loan repayments, by drawing down the Exchequer balance and by using the surplus on current account.  The greater part of this £21.7 million was obtained through the issue of 3½ per cent.  Exchequer Bonds last September and by drawing on new deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank, the balance of £7,500,000 being obtained from the American Loan Counterpart Fund.  To meet this year's requirements it is estimated that a net sum of £28.7 million will have to be found.  It will be necessary to seek again public subscriptions to a national loan.  It is earnestly hoped that these subscriptions and savings through the Post Office Savings Bank <Col N="1906" /> and Savings Certificates will provide all, or, at any rate, most, of our requirements.  It may be necessary to have recourse to the American Loan Counterpart Fund, but it is desirable that this should be moderate; in present conditions, the release of monetary resources, which are the financial counterpart of goods already received and absorbed into the economy, is inflationary.  It is preferable that counterpart moneys should be withheld until such time as they can be released without the same danger as now exists of adding to inflationary forces.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SAVINGS</P>
    <P>I must, therefore, sound again the note struck at the beginning of my speech by emphasising the critical importance at the present time of increased savings.  They are essential for national development on lines on which there is a general agreement.  No one interested in the improvement of our social and economic conditions would suggest that the State capital programme should be abandoned. While some may advocate curtailment, many will share the view that it should be pressed forward with all possible speed because of the uncertainties of the future.  To make room for State spending on the present scale, however, the public must be prepared to abstain to a greater extent from spending. Overspending by the nation as a whole could only increase the rate of external disinvestment for unproductive purposes. In other countries where private savings are deficient, it is necessary to impose taxes to make up for the saving that the public ought to do.  I feel that we are not yet constrained to adopt this expedient.  It is preferable that means of stimulating voluntary savings should first be fully tried.  The Government have, therefore, decided to organise an intensive campaign to promote savings, especially amongst those of the younger generation who have not yet been properly initiated in the habit of thrift.  It is hoped to enlist the support and enthusiasm of educational bodies, trade unions and other voluntary organisations in this campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> It is highly desirable that there should be a widespread and significant response.  Apart from the security they afford the individual, savings are of vital importance from the national standpoint.  The present capital programme may be endangered if a greater proportion of our current resources is not diverted to investment by voluntary abstention from spending.  Increased savings are an alternative much preferable to increased taxation or increased restrictions and they are the best means not only of preventing serious damage to our economy but of ensuring in the future a higher standard of living.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SUSPENSION OF MARSHALL AID</P>
    <P>Finally, I have an announcement to make about Marshall Aid.  For some time past discussions have been proceeding between the United States Government and the Irish Government on the question whether, in existing international conditions, dollar aid to Ireland should be continued. These discussions have been part of a general review by the United States Government, accompanied by similar inter-governmental discussions, of the necessity for further special American assistance to the various countries participating in the E.R.P.</P>
    <P>As a result of the discussions, which have recently been concluded, it has been agreed by the United States and Irish Governments that dollar allotments to Ireland under the Marshall Plan should be suspended. We, in this country, are well aware that the United States Government and people have during the past six months assumed new obligations and burdens, great in amount and extensive in scope, which affect their domestic economy and involve the provision of exceptional assistance to countries abroad in respect of supplies and financial aid for military and strategic purposes.  In such circumstances, it became inevitable that economic aid of the kind contemplated under the Marshall Plan would be reduced and that dollar allotments would have to be suspended in the <Col N="1908" /> case of those countries which no longer can claim to have a vitally compelling need for dollar assistance in that form.  The improvement during the past six months or so in the central dollar and gold reserves of the sterling area and in the balance of payments between the sterling area and the dollar area has been such that at the present time compelling reasons no longer exist to justify the continuance of E.C.A. allotments to Ireland.  In the course of the discussions to which I have referred it was mutually understood that this is suspension, and not termination, of aid and that, if circumstances change, the question of resumption of American aid to Ireland can, and will be, considered.</P>
    <P>The total allotments made to Ireland by E.C.A. prior to the suspension of aid, which is now formally announced by both Governments, have been $146.2 million, of which $128.2 million have been allocated as loan and $18,000,000 as grant.  The dollars still outstanding under these allotments will continue to be available for this country until fully expended on transactions approved by E.C.A. under their regulations.  As at a recent date, the amount of imports delivered to this country under E.C.A. procurement authorisations was over $139,000,000, so that about $7,000,000 are still in the pipe-line.  In addition to these outstanding dollars available from allotments, E.C.A. will, notwithstanding the suspension of aid now announced, continue to provide dollar funds for technical assistance projects in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At this juncture, when, for the reasons stated, the flow of E.C.A. dollars to this country has been suspended, it is right and proper to express, and to repeat what has been said before on other occasions, the deep gratitude of the Irish Government and people to the Government and people of the United States for the generous dollar assistance afforded to this country since April, 1948.  By reason of this assistance, many difficulties have been overcome, beneficial results to our economy have been secured and we have been enabled to play our part in the great plan, so finely conceived by <Col N="1909" /> the United States of America, for the recovery and readjustment of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>This help from such a source provides, indeed, just one more evidence of the ties of friendship which exist between our people and the American people.  In any expression of appreciation of the contribution afforded to us under the Marshall Plan our thanks are due to the Ambassador, Mr. George Garrett, whose able and kindly interest in our needs and problems was so valuable in the initiation and development of aid for Ireland.  Credit must also be given, in full measure, to Dr. Joseph Carrigan, to his successor, Mr. Paul Miller, and to their colleagues in the E.C.A.  Mission, whose cooperation, advice and assistance have always been given in unstinted fashion and to our great advantage.</P>
    <P>The suspension of American aid means that, in so far as our own dollar earnings are insufficient, we shall procure the foreign exchange necessary to pay for our essential imports from the dollar area by converting sterling through the mechanism of the sterling area dollar pool.  Importers and others wishing to make payments to the dollar area will, as heretofore, continue to make applications to the exchange control for the necessary approvals before undertaking any commitments. Approvals which have already been given for pending transactions involving dollars will, of course, stand and the applicants need not reopen these matters on account of the suspension of aid.  As for the future we, in common with other sterling-area countries, will need to plan and programme our dollar needs carefully, bearing in mind the many uncertainties in the world situation and the continued necessity to maintain strict control over dollar expenditure. Similarly, we must in our own interest strenuously endeavour to increase our dollar earnings.  I emphasised these objectives in my Budget speech last year in dealing with the situation likely to arise as a result of the then anticipated reduction in the amount of E.C.A. allotments to this country and, obviously, such remarks are all the <Col N="1910" /> more important and relevant when aid has, in fact, been suspended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Once upon a time in a far away country an enemy of the people was being led out to execution by a firing squad.  It was raining heavily and he said to the captain of the squad: &ldquo;Is it not unreasonable to march me out in such weather?&rdquo; The captain of the squad said: &ldquo;It is not so bad for you, but think of us; we have to walk back again.&rdquo;  It is those who are likely to return here after the general election which we are told is now pending who have to worry about the financial position revealed by the Minister's statement.  It is the Deputies on the other side who can laugh.</P>
      <P>We have to consider this statement in relation to what the Minister has told us&mdash;that our agricultural output last year fell below pre-war level, that the prospects of industry maintaining its rate of development are not reassuring, that the deficit in our external trade which reached alarming proportions last year is likely to be greater this year and that the aid we have been receiving heretofore from the United States of America under the Marshall Plan has now ceased.  These are rather alarming announcements and not all the skill of the Minister in interpolating them with the other parts of his Budget can conceal them from the people here.  They must not be concealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say right away that I am personally greatly relieved that on this occasion the Minister made no reference in his Budget statement either to economy or retrenchment?  Deputies will remember that in his first Budget <Col N="1911" /> statement, Mr. McGilligan, the present Minister for Finance, announced that economy and retrenchment were to be the key-notes of his policy.  In his second statement, in 1949, he still thought it necessary to make some less vehement assertion of his adherence to the principles of economy and retrenchment. In his third Budget statement, in 1950, there was still, as he saw it, some necessity for a brief reference to the need for economy and retrenchment. This year it is gone.  Economy and retrenchment have been discarded. In order to maintain the growing level of Government expenditure and to help them to overcome their inability to raise the money they are trying to borrow, it is the public who have to spend less; it is the public who have to save more.  Economy and retrenchment have ceased to be watchwords for the Government.  They are now becoming orders for the ordinary working people of this country.  Because the Minister was unable or did not try or failed to apply his policy of retrenchment and economy, because the cost of Government administration has in three years increased by £25,000,000, or 40 per cent., because the State debt has more than doubled in that period, the public have to cut their spending, the public have to save, the public have to be satisfied with a lower level of consumption, so that the rake's progress of Government expenditure can be continued.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm at this stage to remind some of the Deputies opposite what they promised to do.  If rumour does not speak once more with a lying tongue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If rumour does not speak with a lying tongue, Deputies will shortly be going back to the constituents who elected them.  I wonder will they on this occasion give the same undertakings, the same pledges, <Col N="1912" /> as they gave before?  In 1947, Deputy Mulcahy, now Minister for Education, was the Leader of Fine Gael and in a formal pronouncement of the policy of that Party, made at Clonmel on February 4th, he said they had clearly defined objectives, (1) the cost of living must be reduced, (2) Government extravagance must be stopped and (3) taxation must be cut as part of the effort to reduce the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The present Taoiseach, then Deputy Costello, speaking in his constituency on January 5th of that year, said: &ldquo;The cost of Government is completely out of proportion to the national income,&rdquo; and he went on to say that while the public were being exhorted to curtail their expenditure, nothing was being done to reduce State expenditure. &ldquo;The cost of Government is completely out of proportion to the national income.&rdquo;  In 1947 the audited cost of Government was 19 per cent. of the estimated national income of that year.  In 1950 it was 26 per cent. In 1951 it will be higher still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite, when giving these pledges or announcing these intentions to the people whom they asked to vote for them, must have had in mind that some curtailment in expenditure was practicable and that it was, not merely practicable, but desirable if the object of lowering the cost of living was also to be realised. Do they not think, now that the Government is coming to the end of its term, now that they have to go back again to those unfortunate people whom they deluded in 1947 and 1948, that they should give some explanation of the reason for their failure to fulfil their pledges?  The Leaders of Fine Gael, who in 1947 pledged themselves to reduce Government expenditure, the present Minister for Finance who, in his first statement in this House, said that economy and retrenchment would be the key-notes of his policy, will have to offer, or will be made to give, some explanation of the fact that the cost of Government administration is now 40 per cent. higher than it was in the year before they came into office.  In so far as they allege that in that year there was extracted from the people's pockets in taxation more than the <Col N="1913" /> people could afford to give, let them face the fact that the amount which was extracted last year from the same people exceeded by £12,000,000 the amount extracted in 1947.</P>
    <P>The explanation of the difference between the £12,000,000 increase in taxation and the £25,000,000 increase in the cost of services is to be found in the enormous expansion in the State debt which occurred in the same period.  This year, the Government wants still more money to meet the estimated further increase in the cost of administration.  In the coming 12 months, another £2,250,000 is required. £300,000 of that is to be got from the Road Fund, £250,000 from increased taxation and the Minister for Finance has discovered a good excuse for borrowing the balance, £1,700,000.</P>
    <P>For how long does the Minister for Finance think it is possible for this State to keep expanding its debt at the rate we are going?  Between 1922 and 1948, in the 26 years since the Irish Free State Government first began to control the finances of this area, despite all the capital cost of the civil war, about which Deputies opposite used to be so eloquent, despite all the development in housing and hospitals, all the progressive expenditure initiated by Fianna Fáil before the war, despite the heavy financial burdens that had to be carried during the war years and the many abnormal expenditures that had to be faced then, in that period of 26 years the debt of this State rose year by year gradually to a total of £95,500,000.  In 26 years the State debt rose gradually to that level.  In four years you have doubled it.  To the end of last year, to that total of £95,000,000 another £81,000,000 of debt has already been added.  A further £28,000,000 is to go on this year.  For how long do you think it is possible for this State to keep adding to its debt in that way when, as the Minister admitted, the investment is not expanding and is unlikely to expand the national production in a corresponding degree?</P>
    <P>If we are going to have, as the Minister said, the prospect of <Col N="1914" /> diminishing industrial progress this year, if we have to face the fact that agricultural output has again fallen below pre-war level, if we have to face the prospect of a heavy increase in the deficit on external trade this year, if the exceptional facility which this Government and no previous Government enjoyed of having available to them an enormous pool of money resulting from Marshall Aid has now to cease, is it practicable to continue the policy, the extravagant policy, that the Minister for Finance has been pursuing?  Must there not be at some stage a dropping of the political cowardice which has characterised his policy from the beginning and some realistic facing of the country's problems?</P>
    <P>Under the administration of this Government, in three years, the State debt was increased, as I have said, by £81,000,000.  The public of this country did not save that amount of money in that period.  In the Table of National Income and Expenditure to which the Minister referred there is set out for each of these years the total of all the savings of our people over that period, all the personal savings of private individuals, all the undistributed profits of corporations, all the additions to the various funds of public authorities, and the aggregate saving through all sources over the whole period was substantially less&mdash;almost £16,000,000 less&mdash;than the total amount borrowed by the Government in that period.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister for Finance to put upon the public the blame for the dissipation of our accumulated reserves.  The public are not to blame.  Whatever expansion there has been in the consumption of luxury goods, which added unnecessarily to our imports, was deliberately encouraged by the Government's policy but, over and above any such expansion, that wasting of assets and resources accumulated by good management in the past is to be attributed mainly to the reckless and thriftless policy which the Government pursued during that period.</P>
    <P>These figures cannot be denied.  You cannot put the blame for the exhaustion <Col N="1915" /> of our external assets upon the ordinary people when, in a period in which the community was able to save from the proceeds of all its industrial, agricultural and other activities the total of £65,000,000, the Government itself borrowed and spent £81,000,000.</P>
    <P>Nobody here has ever objected to an intelligent programme of capital investment. We have objected to the investment of money in excuses to avoid taxation.  We have objected to the investment of moneys in directions which will not directly and obviously increase national productivity, increase the resources available to the Government with which to repay the borrowing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance should give us some fuller explanation than has been given to us of the reason for the Government's failure to carry through the capital investment programme which was announced to the Dáil last year.  We know they expanded the cost of administration. We know that when there was need to find money to pay for a larger number of civil servants or to expand the administrative organisation of any Department, the money was forthcoming without difficulty, but when it was required to finance capital development of a kind we all desire, the Government's performance fell far short of its promises.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies and Ministers opposite are able to conceal their failure to the public by the fact that during the past three years conditions generally were beneficial and were helping forward the recovery of the Irish economy.  At no time since the beginning of the State, were conditions so favourable for expansion of output in agriculture and industry or for the development of the country's capital resources as they were during the past three years.  Never before were international conditions so devoid of anything suggestive of a slump or the likelihood of a slump.  Never before were there poured into this country the enormous capital resources which became available under Marshall Aid. No previous Government had the <Col N="1916" /> chance which this Government had of building up the national economy.  It is not sufficient for Ministers to defend themselves by pointing to the fact that there has been an improvement in industrial output, in employment or in the standard of living.  That would have come if they had sat back and done nothing.  It there had been no Government, that would have been an inevitable consequence of the general improvement in conditions.  It is what they have not done, even in the limited field in which they thought themselves they could do more, that they have to explain away.</P>
    <P>We were all here agreed last year on the necessity of providing for a rapid expansion in the housing programme. The Government came in here last year with an Estimate providing for an expenditure of £14,000,000 on houses but they did not expend that amount.  Instead of developing the housing programme to the full extent of the £14,000,000 provided in last year's Capital Budget, the total expenditure fell short of that figure by £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance told us in his statement about the land rehabilitation scheme and about his desire to provide moneys for that scheme this year.  He made some excuses for their failure last year to carry through that scheme on the scale intended.  Do Deputies opposite realise how great that failure was?  Do they understand that of the £3,100,000 provided in last year's Budget for the land rehabilitation project, only £566,000, one-sixth of the amount, was expended?  When we come to analyse that expenditure, we find that half went in salaries to civil servants and other administrative expenditure and that less than half was paid out in a manner which benefited the farmers.  Do they understand that of the money provided in last year's Budget for hospital development, for the provision of dispensaries, clinics and other projects of that kind, £417,000, less than one-fourth, was expended, that of that £417,000, only £104,000 left the Exchequer?  Do they understand that of the projects administered by the Department of Agriculture, for which £6,250,000 was provided, <Col N="1917" /> only £3,121,000 was spent?  Do they know that in the case of turf development there was again a capital investment of only two-thirds of the amount mentioned this time 12 months by the Minister?</P>
    <P>In the case of telephone development, expenditure fell below the target by not less than £500,000.  Was that capital development programme last year a fake?  Was it that the Government never intended to go through with it?  Was it that they could not raise the money or was it that the administrative organisation available to Ministers, this swollen organisation which is costing the State £25,000,000 more than it cost in 1947, failed to do the job?</P>
    <P>What is the point of bringing forward another Capital Budget of the same kind this year when the Minister for Finance knows as well as I do that, with Marshall Aid stopped, with the Counterpart Fund practically exhausted, there is no source to which he can go to get money to finance it unless there is, as a result of sounder Government administration, particularly in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture, an expansion of activity in these spheres which is not likely and which the Minister for Finance himself admitted he does not expect?  The prospect of agricultural development, the prospect of getting that expansion in agricultural output which three years ago we were confident was possible, has been bedevilled by the instability of the Minister.  But no one man, not even the Minister for Agriculture, can be saddled with the entire responsibility for the position which has been created in that industry.  The whole Government must share the responsibility.  There is no Deputy in this House who does not know, or who has not learned from experience of the past three years, that no declaration of the Minister for Agriculture, relating either to the policy of the Government or his own intentions, can be trusted, that almost certainly within a month, two months or three months, a completely contrary declaration will come from the same source. How is it practicable to get in agriculture <Col N="1918" /> the expansion in output which is necessary if we are to maintain this rapidly growing superstructure of administration without having some consistent policy and some intelligent application of policy in that important Department?</P>
    <P>In the case of industry, the Government may be able to excuse itself by reason of the fact that the Minister in charge of that Department was ill for a period and that his successor has not really been able as yet to get down to work.  But let us face the fact that many industrial opportunities which were live possibilities in 1948 have been lost irretrievably and that they can never come back.  With prices rising and with the Government making blind plunges in an effort to check the effects of the rising prices and doing more harm than good in the process, it is understandable that discontent is rampant around the country.  Seven years after the war the Government is still rationing essential commodities like bread, tea, butter and sugar.  We have a scarcity of butter, compelling us to import supplies from outside.  We have a scarcity of fuel, one that is likely to persist, due almost entirely to Government neglect and mismanagement.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office here in 1948, in the first speech I made as an Opposition Deputy, I told them that they were getting the country in good shape and to make sure that they would hand it back in good shape.  We are not going to get it back in good shape.  We are going to get it burdened with debt, with every resource of the Treasury exhausted, with every Department of State becoming accustomed to inactivity or erratic behaviour, with mounting problems which cannot be easily solved because of their neglect over a long period.</P>
    <P>There will be, no doubt, ample opportunity of explaining these circumstances to the public.  Here we are faced, however, with another Budget, another Budget which recognises the fact that, as compared with last year, the cost of the Civil Service, the cost of Government administration, has increased in that period of 12 months by £4,500,000, and that the cost of servicing <Col N="1919" /> the expanding debt for which the Government is responsible is imposing an additional charge of £750,000 on our people.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister for Finance is able to write up his estimates of revenue from existing taxes and thus help to close the gap between revenue and expenditure. That writing up of his estimates is justifiable on the assumption that, during this year, as last year, prices are going to continue to rise and wages and salaries with them, but on no other assumption is it justifiable. It may be that experience will show that assumption to be justified.  It may be that, during this year, as last year, the Minister will get more money even than he estimates because of the inflationary effects of the policy that he is applying.  Whether or not that is so, it is obvious that the economy of the country has been gravely weakened, just as its finances have been confused by the policy which the Minister has followed.</P>
    <P>I think, also, that the grave announcement which the Minister has made of the termination of Marshall Aid requires to be followed up by a far more elaborate pronouncement from him as to its effects upon the trade of the country.  I do not know if it is anticipated that difficulties will arise in financing dollar imports at last year's levels.  If such difficulties are anticipated, it is fair to those who are trading in these commodities to let them know the position as quickly as possible.  If there is to be no longer available to the Government the Counterpart Fund from which to borrow to finance his Budget deficit as well as capital projects, from what source does he hope to get money? Is there to be further inflationary borrowing from the banks?</P>
    <P>It is a serious matter for us to contemplate that in relation to essential imports that we must procure from the dollar area we are in the position now that we cannot procure them except by an arrangement with the British Treasury.  Has any discussion taken place with the British Treasury concerning the release of dollars for our purposes?  Have any assurances <Col N="1920" /> been sought?  I asked the Minister for Finance that question here in 1948, when he agreed that we would not conduct our trade in such a manner as to involve a net draw upon the dollar resources of the sterling area.  Apparently no such assurance was sought then, no such assurance was deemed necessary then, but it is clearly necessary now.  Not merely is it necessary, but we must have some assurance that our weakness <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British Treasury consequent on the withdrawal of Marshall Aid will not be used to our detriment in any sphere.  I think it is essential that the Minister for Finance should make a fuller statement on that situation before long.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we are going to have another opportunity of discussing this Budget.  The normal practice of the House, as Deputies are aware, has been for the Budget to be introduced on one day and the discussion of it adjourned until the following day. This year, whether by accident or intention, the Budget was taken on a day in a week in which the Dáil would not be meeting on the following day because it is a religious holyday. Whether the Dáil is going to meet next week or not is a secret which the members of the Government are keeping locked in their breasts.</P>

      <P>Can we have some information from the Minister as to the effect of this increase in the petrol duty so far as transport charges are concerned?  The Deputies opposite will remember that this is the second occasion on which the present Government have increased the tax on petrol. When they did it first, that question was asked and while no positive assurance was given, the House was left under the impression that the increase in the tax on petrol would not involve any increase in bus fares, but bus fares were increased.  Are we going to have a further increase in bus fares now?  Will any guarantee be given to the House that the result of this tax will not be to increase the cost of public transport services?</P>

      <P>May I ask Deputy Davin if this tax is going to have his support?  It is a tax which will bear most heavily on the supporters of the <Col N="1923" /> Labour Party.  It is a tax which will not only increase bus fares, as Deputy Lemass has said, but that will also tend to send up the cost of the transport of all goods produced by farmers and by manufacturers and of everything the workers of this country consume. It would be interesting, therefore, to know if the Labour Party, which is represented in the Government by the Tánaiste, is prepared to support this tax, bearing in mind that, when it was necessary for the purposes of national defence to increase the petrol duty during the period of the emergency, he voted against it.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister for Finance who promised a reduction of £10,000,000 on a tax collection of £65,000,000 now justifying increased taxation on a Budget designed to get £85,000,000 or £91,000,000.  The Minister for Agriculture could only give a penny for the farmers who are supplying milk to creameries, but this tax on petrol in this Budget is going to take something of that penny back.  The Minister for Agriculture thought £1,000,000 was a great thing to give 400,000 farmers, 150,000 of whom, I suppose, are supplying milk to creameries, but of course <Col N="1924" /> he can afford to give £1,800,000 to a few thousand civil servants.  Of course he has Deputy Davin's support in that. Deputy Davin is supporting him in collecting more from the people who travel on buses, more from the creamery farmers who will have to pay their portion of the increase on petrol rather than take anything more from the excess corporation profits taxpayers. For years before the last general election the people of the country were deafened by the Labour Party and the other people who are now as mute as mice saying that they would take £3,500,000 back from the excess corporation profits taxpayers which Fianna Fáil had given to the &ldquo;racketeers.&rdquo; They are giving back £4,500,000 or £5,000,000 to what they call the racketeers this year which they could have taken off them in excess corporation profits tax and instead of that they are increasing the tax on petrol.</P>

      <P>The House is now in the happy position of having a tax proposed by a Minister who does not know that he is taxing.  Perhaps I might try to enlighten him a bit.  I understand that hydrocarbon oil is the <Col N="1928" /> expression which is used to distinguish diesel oil from the mineral hydrocarbon light oil commonly called petrol. This is the fuel which the Minister informed us during the brief discussion on the last Resolution, drives the buses which bring the workers of Dublin to work; the oil which drives the vehicles upon which most of those who have to live in Kimmage and Crumlin and who are earning their living in the City of Dublin have to travel twice and sometimes four times a day.  It is interesting to note that Deputy Davin and the Labour Party, who were so concerned about the position of the workers in Dublin at the last general election, are now going to vote to increase the cost of transport for the workers of Dublin while at the same time they approve of the Minister's proposal in Financial Resolution No. 5, to decrease the rates of death duties upon the fortunate individuals who die leaving behind them capital sums up to as much as £7,500.  I do not think there are many people living in either Crumlin or Kimmage or any other industrial residential centre in Dublin who will benefit by Resolution No. 5, but they will suffer under Resolution No. 3 because Resolution No. 3 proposes to increase by 14 per cent. the tax upon diesel oil which, again according to the Minister, is used principally for the propulsion of buses.</P>
      <P>The beneficiaries of those people who die and are fortunate enough to leave up to £2,000 in estate will be relieved of their present rate of taxation to the tune of 100 per cent.  If they are fortunate enough to leave between £2,000 and £3,000 they will have the tax upon that estate reduced by 66? per cent.; if they are still more fortunate to leave between £3,000 and £5,000 the tax upon that estate will be reduced by one-half; and if they go up in the scale of prosperity and good fortune and leave between £5,000 and £7,500 that estate will be reduced by one-third.</P>

But I am concerned with the fact that the people in Crumlin and Kimmage will have the cost of transport appreciably increased to them.

      <P>One of the first things we did when the exceptional expenditure in connection with the war was over, was to abolish the duty on dances.  The Minister is now extending the duty which he imposed on dances a couple of years ago.  I think it is a bad thing for the rural areas that a tax on dances should be reimposed. If any local club or parish <Col N="1933" /> organisation wants to raise a few pounds, the normal way for them to do it is to get a committee together to run a dance.  This extension of the duty on dances will put a stop to that and make the raising of money much more difficult; it will be more difficult for such organisations to raise money in a voluntary way in the future.  I do not know how it can be justified.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not only imposing the dance tax on dances held within a three-mile limit of ordinary towns throughout the country; in its operation, we find that this tax is being applied to halls which are more than four miles from the normal centres of towns.  Take the town of Dundalk.  The dance tax is being applied to halls that are four and a half miles from the post office.  The existing tax is hitting these halls and this extension of the tax will operate severely on halls that are 20 miles from any sizable town.

It is rather extraordinary that we have here a Coalition Government which is supposed to be supported by the representatives of farmers, and the Minister for Finance in that Government is imposing this tax upon a rural amusement. The Minister undoubtedly tried to make the best case he could for it. He said he was trying to prevent an abuse, and his method of preventing an abuse is to make it impossible for any person to run or organise a dance in comfortable surroundings in rural districts. You will note that the Resolution proposes to charge entertainments tax upon dances the charge for admission to which exceeds 9d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, I am merely referring to the taxable capacity of the community upon whom this tax will be imposed, as evidenced by the ruling prices for agricultural produce which, I gather, have secured for the Minister for Agriculture the united support of the farmers of Ireland.  However, it should be very gratifying to the farmers to know that if they do not get 1/6 a gallon for their milk and 3/- per dozen for their eggs, at least they will have the privilege of paying a tax when they go into any dance, the price of admission to which is more than 3/9.  I am sure that will be highly gratifying to them and to those who believe that, after all, something should be done to brighten rural life in Ireland.  That was the aim which the then Minister for Finance, my colleague, Deputy Aiken, had when he remitted the tax upon dances in rural centres altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the method which is being adopted by the Minister for Finance to brighten the lives of people who are in rural areas, to afford them the same sort of facilities as they might enjoy if they were living in some of the larger centres of population, is to make it more difficult for them to have any sort of evening enjoyment or Sunday enjoyment at all.  It is all very well to try to equate the position in rural areas with <Col N="1936" /> the position in Dublin and other larger centres.  In the larger centres, as we know, dances are taxed very heavily and, as many people thought when the new rates were imposed, taxed exorbitantly but, if they are, at least there is this to be said for them, that the proprietors of dance halls, those who invest money in dance halls, whether as a private enterprise or as a communal enterprise, as a committee of an organisation, in Dublin and larger centres, can have their halls occupied every night, can make a profit every night and, therefore, their charges can be lower and they can pay a rate of tax which is commensurately lower also.  But, in the rural areas, as everybody knows, the only night of the week upon which a dance can be held is a Sunday night, which means that the overhead charges upon the halls, the cost of lighting, the rates, and so on, are proportionately very much greater per patron than they would be in the City of Dublin.  Therefore, it is probably true that, in order that the dances can be fittingly conducted, in order that they may be comfortable and enjoyable, a great deal larger margin of profit must be available to those who promote them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is quite clear that to give to the rural resident anything like similar facilities to those that an urban resident could enjoy in a matter of this sort, the charges must be higher.  Bearing in mind that the charges, even in the City of Dublin, for a short dance, a dance running, say, from eight until midnight, run in the neighbourhood of 3/6 or 3/9, even if we were prepared to concede that there is any justification for imposing a tax at all, we all would agree that the exemption figure which the Minister has chosen is, by comparison with the rate prevailing in the City of Dublin, much too low and that, in fact, if a dance hall could be run profitably with a charge of 3/6 for admission in a large urban centre, in the case of a dance hall in a rural area which is to provide the same amenities, the economic price of admission would have to be correspondingly higher.  I am told that in rural areas, where there would be no question of abuse <Col N="1937" /> at all, where parish dances are run, for a dance on a Sunday evening, conducted with a certain amount of regard for the amenities, conducted so that every person would enjoy himself and that there will not be overcrowding and there will not be the inconvenience of not having proper cloakroom accommodation and so on and where, perhaps, some light refreshment is provided, the common charge is 5/- per head.  If that is the case, what justification can there possibly be for making the exemption limit, as the Minister has suggested, 3/9?</P>
    <P>First of all, the Minister is very ill-advised to reimpose the tax upon these dance halls at all.  If he is going to do it, the figure he has chosen as the exemption limit, 3/9, is much too low. I hope those Deputies who represent rural constituents will at least have the courage to get up and say whether they agree with me or not.  If what I have been saying does not appeal to their common sense, if they think that I have been painting the picture in too doleful terms from the point of view of the persons who attend these dances, I hope they will get up and say so.  On the other hand, if they think there is something in what I have said, I hope they will get up and say it also and that they will not sit here, mute of malice, neglectful of the interests of their constituents in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remission that was given here was given in answer to pleas that were made from pretty nearly every part of the House that there should be something done to aid the amenities of rural areas and rural areas were defined as areas that were under 500 population or places within three miles of a place of 500 population and it was agreed&mdash;it was a bit of an experiment&mdash;that it might be reviewed as the years went on.  Deputy MacEntee, of course, is only talking for the sake of talking, to try to do a bit of destruction.  To pretend that there are 5/- dances in the countryside is nonsense.  There are not 5/- dances. I am referring to dances attended by members of the rural community.  The people living in these areas do not pay <Col N="1938" /> 5/-.  If the Deputy had any touch with the countryside he would know that they do not pay 3/9.  The 3/9 dance is the dance that has become rather common recently in the countryside, in some of these tax-free areas, where people saw a possibility of commercialising dances and ran dances in country hotels and halls that they erected.</P>
      <P>By charging high prices they got people to come from neighbouring towns or towns within a considerable radius.  That was the representation made to me.  They even went so far as to run 2/6 dances, which could be regarded as the normal dance, for those in the rural areas.  Certainly it has been impressed upon us that the dances of the 3/9 type are not frequented by members of the rural community in the neighbourhood.  They are of no value to them.  They see a lot of strangers being brought in and money being made, money that legitimately belongs to the owners of dance halls in places two or three miles away, places, that is, of over 500 population. We are making this change in order to give better backing to the view that the people in the rural areas ought to be benefited by having the exemption from this tax.  We are not hurting rural people at all because they do not attend these dances.  That is the line and I think it is a good line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be great jubilation in all the farms in Ireland to-night.  The workers in Crumlin, Kimmage, in North-East, South-East, North-West and North Central Dublin will be all out lighting bonfires to the Minister for Finance because while he has imposed a tax upon the petrol which carries them to their work, he has at the same time reduced the rate of estate duty upon the fortunes which they leave behind.  Those of them who are lucky enough to leave a nest egg of £2,000 will now have the duty on that reduced by 100 per cent.  Those who are a little bit better off and die worth between £3,000 and £4,000, will have the duty reduced by 5 per cent., while those still better off, leaving something between £5,000 and £7,500 out of their earnings as skilled or unskilled labourers, are going to know that, from now on, they can sleep secure in the knowledge that, with the assistance of the Labour Party and the others&mdash; while the duty on petrol has gone up&mdash; the rate of estate duty has gone down by the percentages which I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This tax is expected to bring in £400,000 extra this year and something in the neighbourhood of £750,000 in a full year.  While we are doing that we are certainly giving remissions to people who die with small estates.  In the case of a man who dies leaving a small estate, certainly anything up to £2,000, Deputy MacEntee feels that he ought to be blistered.  The Deputy would dig something out of that man.  I propose not to take anything from him, but to relieve him of whatever rate there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to other small estates, we are either remitting entirely or lightening the rate per cent. <Col N="1943" /> In the case of an estate between £2,000 and £7,500, the duty will be either remitted or it will be reduced.  I think that is a very good social contribution. Lest anyone should feel that there is a good deal of money going to be lost, may I say that for many years by far the greater part of the enormous percentage of money that was taken in estate duties came from the big estates? We are taking more from those people than before, but we are giving some part of the benefit of that increase to the smaller people.  In addition, we are getting in in this part of this year £400,000 for the Exchequer, and in a full year £750,000.  Deputy MacEntee can explain that to the people he is anxious about.</P>

      <P>I can sincerely congratulate Deputy Gilbride, who was in possession when this Estimate was last under discussion, on the common-sense and sensible approach which he made in his contribution on this very important Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  I have listened to the discussion year after year since the present Minister was appointed to this important post and, although I did not hear every speech delivered from the Opposition side, I can safely say that the Estimate was never approached from the political common-sense point of view of discussing it on its merits and putting forward practical and sensible alternative proposals on behalf of those who are opposed to the Minister personally and to his policy.  It is the duty of every responsible Deputy, regardless of the side of the House upon which he sits and of the group with which he may be associated, to approach the consideration of important matters of this kind from a policy point of view, and not resort, as has been done for the last three years and this year in particular, to pouring out personal abuse upon the Minister, who is an efficient and conscientious man, rather than criticising the Estimate on its merits and putting forward, if they can, constructive and sensible alternative proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole matter has been approached from the point of view of obstruction and the time occupied in the discussion of this Estimate by some of the speakers from the Opposition side is proof of that.  Have we anything on the records of this House. <Col N="1946" /> from the point of view of wasting time, to beat the memorable speech delivered here last year lasting for five hours and 50 minutes by Deputy Smith?  Deputy Smith hopes to be the successor to the present Minister if and when&mdash;I hope it will not be for a long time&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party come back to power again.  Is there any sensible Deputy who would risk saying that Deputy Smith is a more efficient or conscientious person than the present occupant of the post of Minister for Agriculture?</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry will not even risk saying so himself.  Of course he could not.  As a representative of a rural constituency, I say quite sincerely, with the knowledge that, if <Col N="1947" /> other people like, it may be used against me as far as anything can be used against me in this matter, that during my long experience the farmers were never in a better position than they are to-day.  It is my privilege on occasions when I visit my constituency to meet supporters of all Parties in this House, and I have met many farmers who are supporters of Fianna Fáil who admit that, but dare not say it in public.  They might say it in a public house, but they would not say in public that the farmers were never better off than they are at present and that we never had a better Minister for Agriculture since this State was established than the present occupant of the post.</P>
      <P>While saying that, I admit that there are minor matters upon which members of this group may agree to differ with the Minister for Agriculture.  But do not these minor differences exist in the best-regulated families and Parties?  It would be a very unhealthy state of affairs, from my point of view at any rate, even in my own Party if everyone came into Party meetings and behaved as yes-men.  I have often stated to people, and I say it to the Minister who holds such an important position in the State, that the man who comes into a Party meeting or into a place where you work, if you are a person who holds a responsible position, and has the courage to criticise you is your best friend if he does it in a sensible, decent and straightforward way and provided he gives good reasons for criticising you personally or your policy. That is why I am pleased to pay a tribute to the line of approach of Deputy Gilbride on this particular Estimate and I am sorry that he was not here to resume the discussion.  I have stated that the farmers were never better off than they are at present.  Does Deputy Corry ever remember a time when the farmers were getting the prices they are getting to-day for live stock, including sheep and the wool on the back of the sheep?</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Corry knows very well that the members of <Col N="1948" /> this group, small or large, and irrespective of whom their leader was, never changed their policy in regard to agriculture. From the time we came into this House in 1923 we always advocated on these benches the provision of guaranteed, profitable prices for the farmers.  I am very glad to see that, as the years go by, particularly since the present Minister came into office, the position is improving considerably. As long as he is a member of this House, Deputy Corry will get up and show himself to be typical of the very small percentage of farmers who always growl from the time they get up in the morning until they go to bed at night and will never admit how well off they are.  Why should they not be well off?  There is a greater circulation of money in my constituency to-day and more employment of people at good wages than ever there was since I came into this House.  In the two years from 1947 to 1949 there was an increase of 37,100 in the number of persons engaged in insurable occupations. That increase dated from the time this Government came into office and the present Minister was appointed Minister for Agriculture.  I have not got the figures for last year. Deputy Corry and other Deputies know well that a very high percentage of the 37,100 were sons and daughters of farmers, and particularly of small farmers.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the number of registered unemployed.  I am sure it is known to my colleagues and to every other Deputy that the registered unemployed in five labour exchanges in my area are men who are living in rural parts of the constituency and who look for employment on road work and other schemes of that kind.  At any rate, there is evidence from the figures I have quoted that the number of registered unemployed in the rural constituency that I have the honour to represent has been reduced by half since this Government and the present Minister for Agriculture came into office.  On the other hand, there is convincing evidence that the number of persons&mdash;they are all rural workers &mdash;employed by local authorities on road work as a result of the coming into operation of the Local Government (Works) Act has been doubled. This Act was opposed in eight divisions in this House by Deputy Corry and the Fianna Fáil Party.  The circulation of millions of money under the Works Act scheme has doubled the number of persons employed by one of the two county councils in my area and to that extent there is a huge increase in the circulation of money in my constituency that was never available during any previous period that I have been a representative there.</P>

I am sure I will be challenged by some people who do not know the position. What does Deputy MacEntee know about the position of the farmers in any section of the country or even in my constituency?  He talked for about 15 or 20 minutes about depriving the people of certain amenities as a result of the introduction of certain amendments to the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I admit that the agricultural labourers may not be receiving to-day the rate of wages to which they are entitled, but no one will deny that, as a result of the agricultural policy of the Minister and his colleagues in the Government, the agricultural labourers have had their wages considerably increased since this Minister and the present Government came into power in 1948.  The agricultural labourers of to-day are entitled to get, and I hope are receiving, a week's holidays with pay which was denied to them by the Fianna Fáil Party and nobody knows it better than the Opposition themselves. They could have and should have done it when they had the power to do anything they wished, with or without the support of the members of this group.</P>

They are part and parcel of the general body of labourers making a direct contribution to increased agricultural production and to the increased prosperity of all sections of our people, particularly those in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will anybody deny that the standard of living of the people in the rural areas has not been considerably improved? Agricultural labourers, road workers, small farmers, forestry workers, turf workers and those engaged on schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act have had their position considerably improved.  The increase in the turnover of wages has helped to improve considerably the <Col N="1953" /> position of the ordinary traders who will tell you of the increased trade in the villages and towns.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of debate here in relation to milk prices. The price of milk is quite a proper matter for discussion and decision by those responsible for taking such decisions. I do not propose to challenge the accuracy of the statement made by Deputy Corry the other day.  I have been speaking for a number of years on this Estimate and I have always advocated the provision of a profitable price for those engaged in the dairying industry.  I shall not remain silent upon that matter now merely because the Minister may take a different view from that which I hold and have expressed clearly in the past.  As a result of the action of the Minister recently another £1,000,000 will go into the pockets of the people engaged in the dairying industry and even Deputy Childers will not deny that that is a magnificent contribution which will help to still further increase the prosperity of all our farmers, including those engaged in the dairying industry. If I were in the Minister's position&mdash; I might want to have more influence than the Minister has and I am sorry to say I have not got that influence&mdash;I might have given them a higher price and I might possibly look for the money from a different direction from the one the Minister has taken.  However, we make no apology to the Opposition because we are part and parcel of a team and during the life-time of this Government, which has lasted much longer than the political prophets on the Opposition Benches thought, we will play our part on the team and not behind the goal post or on the sideline.</P>

      <P>The operations of the Land Commission have a definite bearing upon the prosperity of agriculture, particularly in relation to increased productivity.

      <P>The Minister may not see eye to eye with me on this particular matter but I think it is imperative that better credit facilities should be provided for the farmers.  The Minister is apparently satisfied that there is no justification for extending or expanding the operations of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I think that rates of interest charged by that body are far too high and I see no reason why the rate of interest should be as high as 4½ per cent.  That body works partly under the control of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to think that no appreciable number of farmers need better credit facilities than those provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  May I remind the Minister in that connection that, in 1946, Deputy Seán Moylan, then Minister for Lands, brought a Bill in here and got a majority for it?  The purpose of that Bill was to give power to the Land Commission to put out of houses and holdings given to them under the Fianna Fáil Administration and possibly under the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration, too, thousands of men.</P>

      <P>I think he has, Sir, but I bow to your ruling.  I am using this as an argument to show that if the decent citizens&mdash;and I presume that they are all decent, hard-working citizens&mdash;who got holdings from the Land Commission over the years, had to be dispossessed, I assert, from personal knowledge of some of these cases, that they had to be removed from their houses and holdings because they had not the capital, or they had not the credit, to purchase machinery and live stock so as to enable them to make a livelihood.  I suggest that if such a position exists to-day, to a <Col N="1956" /> lesser extent, perhaps, than in 1946, is there not some case established to provide credit facilities for those people who got holdings from the Land Commission?</P>
      <P>I ask sensible Deputies to say whether it is not a fact that many decent, hard-working citizens who were employed by land owners and who got holdings when that land was taken from their employers, have neither credit nor capital and, because of that, although they were decent, hard-working ploughmen and herds and labourers when they were employed by the landlords over a long period of years, they failed to make a livelihood for themselves and for their dependents.  In some cases they even failed to pay their annuities and rates and they failed because they had not reasonable credit facilities, such as are given in other democratic countries wherever land has been divided.</P>
      <P>I put that case to the Minister for his favourable consideration and I am using these arguments in doing so.  I think the Minister will have to accept it as a fact that thousands of these people had to be dispossessed by the previous Administration because they were not working on the land they got, and they had to set it in many cases, and the reason was that they had no credit facilities and no capital which would permit them to stock the land and purchase machinery to work their holdings to the best possible advantage. I do not want to give a wrong impression. In the ordinary way, were it not for the type of obstruction carried on over several days, a delayed action kind of discussion, I would not, perhaps, have spoken at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assert that it is the duty of every responsible Deputy, irrespective of the group with which he is associated, to make his contribution to a discussion on this important Estimate.  During my time in this House, I know of no Minister for Agriculture, including even the late Deputy Paddy Hogan, the Lord have mercy on him, who had the energy and the ability that our present Minister possesses, or who has discharged his duties in a more conscientious way.  I say that quite deliberately, although I <Col N="1957" /> had the greatest possible respect for the late Deputy Paddy Hogan.  I salute the present Minister as being the most efficient, conscientious and hard-working Minister who has occupied that position since I came here 28 or 29 years ago.  When I go down the country I will be prepared to say the same about him.  All I will say will be to his credit.  I hope Fianna Fáil Deputies in my constituency, when they go down there and when they talk about this Government and about the Minister, and when they criticise policy, will be prepared to tell the people what they would have done if they were in the important position that is now occupied by Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is perfectly obvious to all of us in the course of this debate, and it has been obvious for some years now, that the motive of the Fianna Fáil Party, in so far as this particular Estimate is concerned, has been one of the lowest kind&mdash;personal political spleen and little else. Deputy Davin, in the course of his remarks, referred to the occasion when the Opposition will have an opportunity in the country to express their views about the policy of the Minister. I think it is too much to hope, it is expressing too sanguine a hope, that the Opposition can be expected not to criticise the Minister personally.  We all know very well that the stock-in-trade of the Fianna Fáil organisation from its inception has been personal attack and personal abuse.  Those of us who have become used to that have not wondered at the trend this debate has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose that there is on this side of the House one Deputy who has differed so vehemently, so strongly at various times, than I have with the Minister for Agriculture.  I have differed with him on many occasions in regard to matters which relate to the section of people whom I represent here, the agricultural workers.  I choose to be in the position of representing the agricultural workers because I find it impossible to be all things to all men, as some Deputies here would appear to be, or would appear to try to be, both on the side <Col N="1958" /> of those who are employing and on the side of those who are employed, even to the point where the interests of both clash.  I think that is political dishonesty, but it is practised pretty widely in this country.  It has been my prerogative, my honour, here to represent agricultural workers and, on the question of their wages and conditions, and on the general question of employment in agriculture, I have had on occasions to disagree strongly with the Minister, and I have stated here the reason for my disagreement.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that during the Fianna Fáil régime there were Deputies, now in opposition, who disagreed with aspects of Deputy Smith's policy, as it operated when he was Minister, and also the policy of Deputy Dr. Ryan, when he was Minister.  I have been searching through the Dáil debates over a long period, but particularly over the period during which Fianna Fáil ruled this country, and it is impossible to find an occasion when a Fianna Fáil Deputy dared to stand up here and disagree openly with the policy as stated by the Minister of the day, his own Minister.  It has been one of the very good things and the very hopeful things which came from the formation of the inter-Party Government that free expression of opinion has become part and parcel of the proceedings in this House.  We can observe here the absolutely untrammelled expression of one's point of view, and I say that as one who has often, as a member of the general public in other years, sitting in the public gallery, listened to discussions on this and other Estimates.</P>
    <P>We have heard in other years, before this Government was set up, one voice and one whip cracking and observed little or no open disagreement.  At the same time every one of us knows that there was disagreement in the Fianna Fáil organisation on agricultural and other policies but, of course, it was because the Party was ruled with the iron hand of dictatorship that free expression of opinion was not permitted in some parts of this House.</P>

      <P>Since the change of Government, we have seen the democratic right of free expression exercised in this House on many occasions and I have been the first to avail of that right and I always will be, whether inside or outside this House. It is inherent in any democratic country that there should be that expression of opinion that so many people talk about but so few practise.</P>
      <P>The question of milk prices has been one of considerable moment in this country over a considerable period. The farmers in the milk areas seem to have organised themselves pretty successfully and to be demanding increases in their prices.  As one who is not qualified to express an opinion, I shall not say whether they are entitled to the increases demanded or not.  I shall not say that they are not entitled to them, but I do say that at least some gesture has been made to them, at least some effort has been made to meet their case.  It should not be forgotten that that effort, which is represented by an increase of 1d. per gallon in the price of milk, means a very considerable impost upon those who live in the cities and towns and on the consumers of butter.  Deputies of all Parties who represent creamery farmers should appreciate that fact and that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst those who live in the cities and towns at the never-ending complaint and the continual demands put up on behalf of the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>It will be said, and has been said <i>ad nauseam,</i> until it has become hackneyed, that this is an agricultural nation.  Undoubtedly that is true.  Our basis is agriculture and if agriculture is not prosperous the nation cannot be prosperous.  We must have a balanced economy.  It is as well for farmers generally to realise that prosperity should not be one-sided, that prosperity must be shared, that the condition of the people who live in the towns and cities and the condition of the farmers are interdependent, that you cannot make one section of the community prosperous at the expense of the other, without jeopardising the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1960" /> I have on occasion referred to agricultural workers.  I want specifically to take up again the question of agricultural workers' wages.  Deputy Smith was very kind during the course of his few remarks to mention the agricultural workers' strike in County Dublin. He was very perturbed about it because it took place at an awkward time of the year.  Deputy Smith was not perturbed by the thought of men having to live on £3 10s. a week or, outside the County Dublin, on £3 a week.  Deputy Smith did not show much perturbation or worry when, during his régime, the average wage of the agricultural worker was 45/- a week for 54 hours a week, nine hours a day, six days a week, without a half-holiday, but he was perturbed, for his own political purposes that this strike took place at a time when the weather was good and farmers were trying to get work done.</P>

      <P>The persons who will decide when actions of this kind will be taken will not be Deputy Smith or Deputy Allen, but the workers. Deputy Smith and Deputy Allen were not in the position of having to work for £3 10s. a week.  If they were, they would not be so worried about the time of the year.  The time when any group of people, farmers, workers, traders, merchants or workers in towns, can best bargain for improved conditions is the time of their own choosing, the time when their bargaining power is at its height.  The workers in County Dublin, County Wicklow and County Meath decided this year that they would try to get a few shillings more.  They were attacked in this House, by inference. There was a suggestion inherent in the statement made by Deputy Smith that it was an effort merely to create trouble and to sabotage the national interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that was a lie and nothing but a lie.  It may be too much to expect that some of our Cavan border Deputies might know a great deal about agriculture in Dublin, Wicklow or Meath, but anyone who has such knowledge knows very well that the farm workers in Dublin, who live on the fringe of the city and the farm workers of County Meath who live, relatively speaking, in the suburbs of the city, and the farm workers in County Wicklow, have found it impossible to live on the miserable wage that they have been getting over the years. Thank God we did something about it and we brought about a big improvement. We secured the largest increase for agricultural labourers that was ever secured in this country.  It is unaccountable impudence for any individual, whether he be a Deputy or not, to suggest that organised workers should bow to anybody in their determination to get an improvement in their condition. That mentality might suit some sections in this country but, as Deputies well know, it does not suit the mentality of the workers of Dublin city or county. They bow to nobody and to no political organisation in their determination to improve their conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Administration achieved power, the wages of agricultural workers have been improved from an average of 45/- or 50/- a week up to a minimum of £3.  I suppose farmers and those who represent farmers will contend that that represents a substantial improvement.  Compared with the wages given over the previous 20 years to agricultural labourers, I suppose it is, but it will not be argued by anyone in his right senses that agricultural labourers can live to-day on £3, £3 10s. or even £4 a week.  What strikes me as the most incongruous feature of this business is that those who try to convince other people that there are sections of workers who can live on the level of existence represented by a wage of £3 10s. or £4 per week are living on a level that is very far removed from that.  It is a disgusting thing that anybody should try to justify a situation in which such a <Col N="1962" /> low level of existence is held out to workers.</P>
    <P>There is a State organisation, the Agricultural Wages Board.  There never was a more useless organisation so far as agricultural workers are concerned. Undoubtedly, it is very useful as a brake upon the efforts of workers to improve their conditions because it is so composed, and has been since its foundation, of agricultural interests, that the voice of the agricultural worker is very small and scarcely heard in its councils.  I would ask the Minister to give some thought to the need which exists for the establishment of a suitable organisation for the determination of wages of agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, as the Minister has said here on occasion, the prosperity of agriculture must finally be judged by the degree of well-being, physical comfort and the level of wages paid to the lowliest of those engaged in the industry&mdash;in other words, to the agricultural labourers.  That must be the final yard-stick in so far as the prosperity of the industry generally is concerned.  There is no use whatever, in my view, in farmers being paid high prices for their produce; there is no use in the employing section of the agricultural community as a body being fairly well off&mdash;and that they are, according to themselves; they have told me in discussion with them in council on the wages issue that they admit they are well off&mdash;because that, as far as I am concerned, is of little or no avail if the men who make that prosperity possible are badly treated and badly paid.</P>
    <P>I think it should be the duty of the Government, and one of the first responsibilities of the Minister, to see that the standard of living of these men is raised to a decent level because anybody who knows agricultural labourers knows&mdash;and every rural Deputy must know it&mdash;that agricultural workers are the salt of the earth.  They are the finest type of manhood we have in this country; they are people who will work unceasingly and uncomplainingly for long periods and they are, unfortunately, the people who get the least return for their labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> We have, it is true, secured the passage into law of a Bill recognising the right of agricultural workers to annual holidays.  Having granted them that right, we must now see that they are given the wherewithal to enjoy these holidays.  There is no use in giving a holiday to a man if his wages are not such as will enable him to avail of them.  We have written that right into the law of this country, at any rate, and that is something that stands to the credit of the Minister for Agriculture and, if I may say so, to the credit of the Labour Party.  I make no secret of the fact that one of the reasons why I have supported this Government was in order to secure an improvement in the conditions of the agricultural labourer. The Labour Party have secured improvements which otherwise would not have been given by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Added to that, we introduced into this House, even against the advice of the Minister, a Bill providing a weekly half-holiday for agricultural labourers, and Fianna Fáil found themselves in the position that they had to vote for it.  These are improvements which would not have been achieved under any Government other than the Government we have at present, or a Labour Government.  As such, they are something with which we can be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I want to address a special appeal to the Minister in regard to this anachronism known as the Agricultural Wages Board and to point out to him, and to Deputies generally, that in its present form it is totally unsuitable as machinery for the settlement of agricultural workers' wages.  This board is made up of a number of representatives of employers, a number of representatives of workers and some so-called neutrals.  It has been noticed that when decisions are taken in relation to wages these neutrals invariably vote against the interests of the workers.  I do believe, now that agricultural workers are becoming organised, there is need for some effective form of machinery to regulate the relationship between farmers and their workers.</P>

      <P>I am merely expressing an opinion.  Perhaps I shall have a further opportunity later on of developing that point, but I do think the Minister might have given some thought to the problems which arise from the present composition of that board.  I feel that the plight of agricultural labourers and the necessity for an improvement in their conditions have been brought to the public notice as much by the activities of the Minister for Agriculture as by those of anybody else.  The Minister has been made the butt of an attack by the Opposition.  As I have said, I agree that there are points in his policy with which I have often found myself in disagreement and have not hesitated to say so, but we should be mature enough in this country by now to be able to discuss political subjects without bringing in personalities at every turn.  The Minister's personality may not be such as will please everybody but I do think&mdash;it is not just my opinion; it is the expressed opinion of farmers in my constituency and elsewhere&mdash;that, by and large, he has done an effective and a good job in so far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he took office we were told by the Opposition that the doom of the country was sealed and that agriculture would be brought to nothing.  Quite the contrary has proved to be the fact.  He introduced one of the most imaginative and progressive schemes that could be introduced into this country&mdash;the land rehabilitation project.  I think that Fianna Fáil, were they in power, would have bally-hooed that scheme through their newspaper to such an extent that they would have persuaded themselves that it was the greatest thing that ever happened in this country.  Deputy James Dillon, the Minister, is the man who conceived that scheme and brought it into operation.  No matter what may be said against him on any other grounds, it cannot be denied that he did a great day's work for the nation when he introduced that scheme.  So far as my <Col N="1965" /> constituency is concerned, it has not benefited very much from the operations of that scheme.  County Dublin farmers realised the importance of drainage long before the advent of this Parliament and took steps to bring their land into cultivation early in the century, with the result that in County Dublin we have the most progressive form of agricultural economy that could exist in Ireland&mdash;a highly cultivated tillage area with prosperous farmers and relatively contented agricultural workers.  In the rest of the country, as we well know, there was greater need for land rehabilitation, and it is to the credit of the Minister that he introduced a scheme which gave an opportunity to farmers to bring land, which long had lain useless, into a condition of usefulness.</P>
    <P>As it is usual in this debate, I rose to draw attention mainly to the subject of the condition of agricultural workers.  I do not propose to expand upon the very wide field which has been gone over and trodden almost hard by Deputies for the past two weeks.  My function here has been to bring to the notice of the Dáil and the country the rights of these labourers.  I maintain, and shall always maintain, that the Minister, or any Minister for Agriculture, should look upon it as his bounden duty to improve the condition of agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>I have found this, that where there is an organisation amongst the agricultural workers, and where their conditions and wages are improved, then peculiarly enough agriculture improves. The pressure which results from that situation brings about an improvement in the working of farms.  If a certain standard of living must be afforded by the farmer to his worker, if he has got to exert more energy and make a little bit more effort to meet that standard, then he is going to benefit himself as well.  That has been the result, during the last three years, of the efforts of the organised workers, particularly, and of the Minister.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>As I have just remarked, while I am not putting myself forward in this House as an expert on agricultural matters, I think that one ought to express one's views on the broad principles which arise, and which strike one in connection with each Estimate brought before the House.  In view of the fact that so many of my non-agricultural colleagues have contributed to this debate, I feel that it is not out of place for me to make some contribution to it.  Connected with the theory of democratic Government, there are, as I say, very big broad principles to which one must hearken at all times, and among these one would have to include, I think, when considering any Estimate as well as the history of the Department in recent years, the liberty of a citizen of the State.  As a sub-head to that could be put the independence of the citizen, with fair play to all citizens, as well as this question of long-term planning and long-term views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Chair that I am going to relate that directly to this Estimate, because, so far as my constituency of South Tipperary is concerned, the Minister for Agriculture has built up there a tremendous fund of goodwill towards himself since he took office as Minister.  In all his actions as Minister he has emphasised the view that he holds that the farmer should be the boss on his own farm. I think that is a view to which we all, as democrats, should subscribe.  I appreciate that one cannot run a Government or run a country without a certain amount of control and without certain restrictions.  The aim of the Government, of the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1967" /> and of all other Ministers, should be to reduce to the minimum the number of restrictions.</P>
    <P>I think that the present occupant of the office has done well in that regard. He has set an excellent headline and has lived up to the headline which he set himself.  That headline is all the more remarkable when you contrast it with the headline set by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Smith.  The other evening in this House, Deputy Beirne gave us an extract from a speech delivered by the then Minister for Agriculture when concluding the debate on his Estimate in 1947.  I think that the quotations which Deputy Beirne gave from that speech will bear repetition. I think that the remarks which Deputy Smith then made cannot be given too often, because we are inclined to have short memories.  The quotation is from Volume 106, column 2237, of the 19th June, 1947.  Deputy Smith then said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I see a Deputy on the opposite side who comes from a neighbouring county to mine.  I like to keep my neighbours on my side; at any rate, I do not like fighting with them, but I cannot help thinking of a remark Deputy Giles made about some speech I had made in County Meath. Deputy Giles expressed the opinion that, if I were correctly reported in the papers as to my attitude towards farmers, I seemed to be&mdash;I do not know whether it was a prodder or a driver&mdash;I was a pounder of some kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles interrupted and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the Press report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith continued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It does not matter.  When I speak on a matter of this kind my mind is clear as to what I want. When my mind is clear as to what I want, I think I can express myself in such a way that there cannot be any misunderstanding or doubt as to what I mean.  When dealing with this matter at that particular conference, I did say that there were a number of people, small or large, who were not complying with the law, and that, as far as I was concerned. I would use every weapon, <Col N="1968" /> legal or otherwise, in order to ensure that they would.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was.  Deputy Smith was then concluding on the Estimate in 1947.  I have given the reference.  He had some more to say but I pass over that.  He went on to tell the farmers what precisely he was going to do.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I shall tell you that I had them safely tucked in the back of my mind when I was talking in Navan, and if it had not been for the kind of season that Providence decided to send us, I would not have had them tucked in the back of my mind; I would have had inspectors tucked after them, and I would have tucked them out into fresh land, and I would compel them to break fresh land and, if they did not do it, I would tuck in the tractors through the ditches and through the gates and tuck out the land for them.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is all very well for the leader writers.  They can all get down to the job of giving the Government hell, as the fellow said when he was listening to a friend of his preaching a temperance sermon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on, as reported in the same column, he continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Lord Almighty provides us with good weather that will enable us to make a start, and if there should be a necessity next season to be as rigid as heretofore&mdash;and there may be&mdash;I am going to tell them here and now that I will recruit the full of ten fields of inspectors, and I will spend plenty of money in paying them travelling expenses and everything else, and I will hire all the tractors and machinery I can get, and I will go down and pick everyone of the `cods' out, and I will say: `Take down that piece of wire and put it around the other corner and just break it up until we see will you get more than four barrels or four and a half barrels', no matter what their lamentations are about wheat growing.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was the Minister for Agriculture in 1947.  As reported in column 2240 of the same debate, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When I do that, you can call me a thug or a clod or a driver, whatever you like, I do not care.  If I am here in the position of Minister, so sure as I have the Almighty to face some day or another, I will end this nonsense. That is my attitude to this question of production.  I have heard more of this word `production' since this debate started than I have heard for as long as I can remember.  My back is nearly broken listening to it. Maybe I should not say much more. We were talking early in the debate about Guinness, but Guinness is never about at the right time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest to the House that the attitude of the present occupant of the office is welcomed by the agricultural community.  I suggest that the agricultural community ought to be well pleased with the manner in which the Minister is following the literal meaning of the word and presenting himself to the farmers as the servant of the farmers.  From my knowledge of the farmers of this country, I must say that I have a profound faith in them.  I have a profound faith that, when the necessity arises, they will always do the right thing, provided that you ask them and do not order them.  While the attitude which the Department of Agriculture is now taking towards the farmers continues, I think you will have a hearty response from them.  It is of the greatest importance that we should get a hearty response from them, because it is self-evident, and I think cannot be said too often, that every one of us, no matter what our occupations, depends ultimately upon what the farmer produces from the soil.  On his prosperity depends the prosperity of every citizen.  He cannot pay his workers a decent living wage if he is not deriving a decent living wage from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, while I am admitting that the farmers are better off than they were ever before, I say that <Col N="1970" /> that must be qualified by saying that they are comparatively better off.  The farther back you go in the history of this country, the darker the picture is so far as the farmers are concerned. They have progressed a long way, but they have not progressed far enough and, comparing them with other sections of the community who are rendering services to the national life of this State, I am of the opinion that the farmers are not at all as well off as they ought to be.  If you relate the remuneration which they are getting to the value of the services they render and put that side by side with the remuneration which other classes of the community are getting for the services they render, it will be readily conceded that we have yet a long way to travel before agricultural Ireland will be in as good a condition as it ought to be.  For that reason, just in passing, I should like to say that I was well pleased to-day to hear from the Minister's budgetary statement that the tax of 5 per cent. on transferred land was being reduced to 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is using many means to advance the interests and prosperity of the farmer.  The greatest of them, of course, is the land rehabilitation scheme.  It is astonishing to me that there are in some places throughout the country farmers who do not yet fully appreciate the tremendous benefits which there are for them in that scheme.  I was astonished about three weeks ago when a young farmer told me that he had a big poor farm and that he had not made any application for benefit under the land rehabilitation scheme.  I asked him why he did not avail himself of the benefits that were there and his answer was that, while he had heard of it in a vague sort of way, none of his neighbours had done anything about it and he was waiting for somebody else to start.  As I say, it is astonishing to me that everybody in this State who has any land does not know of the benefits which are in that scheme for him.  The more it is publicised, the better the Minister for Agriculture will like it and the better it will be for the country.</P>
    <P>That land rehabilitation scheme is <Col N="1971" /> the major benefit provided for the farmers, but Deputies will remember having got a document from the Department of Agriculture within the past few months in which a big list of the benefits given by the Department was detailed.  It was most interesting reading and I think is available in the library.  With this increase in prosperity for the farmers, the first section which will benefit from that are the agricultural workers.  No matter how we protest our desire to see the standard of living raised and to see the agricultural workers getting a decent wage, our protestations in that regard are futile except we put the people who have to pay them in a position to be able to pay them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing a good job in that regard, but I do suggest that, as yet, even he is not going far enough in making the means available for that. Farmers are people who will spend money if they have it and spend it liberally.  There are, I suppose, views that farmers are more tightfisted than urban dwellers, but, if they are, there is good reason for it.  They have not had money in the same volume as the urban dwellers have had it, and in recent years, when they have prospered, they have shown they will spin money around as it was meant to spin. I can, of course, see the difficulties which the Minister has to face.  The most recent difficulty is that of increasing the price of milk.  I had a conversation with the Minister recently on this matter and he told me that he found it impossible to please anybody, not to say please everybody.  My suggestion about an increase in the price of milk would be to give the increase, to err on the side of generosity as far as the farmers are concerned, and then to keep down the price of butter by subsidisation.  This State is in a prosperous condition and can stand up to substantial expenditure, especially as a result of the operations of this Government for the past three years.</P>

      <P>Among the schemes which ought to be and will be of great benefit to those who avail of them is that for the supply to farm dwellings of piped water.  The grant from the Department of Agriculture is a very generous one and fills a very great need in this country.  I know of a number of farmers who have availed themseles of that scheme and they certainly appreciate that they got tremendous value for the money which they had spent, taking into account the grant, the amenities and so on.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on one thing he did, and that was tightening up of the bread rationing regulations.  The manner in which the bread rationing was controlled had become a scandal throughout the country.  When the Minister took it over at the end of last year he put an end, once and for all, to the feeding of bread, on which huge subsidies were being paid, to dogs.  I said in the course of my speech that the Government cannot be run without resorting to restrictions and prohibitions.  Nobody, I am sure, will object to the course which the Minister for Agriculture took in tightening bread rationing, thus putting an end to the scandal that was being carried on around us.  It is right that the Minister should be congratulated on that.</P>

      <P>I think it is well to make comparisons.  It is a much better way of forming a balanced judgment. I was very interested reading the speech by Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture.  When he was concluding the debate on the Estimate in 1947 he proceeded to tell the House what he thought of himself as Minister. <Col N="1974" /> I think it would be well to repeat this now in view of what the Opposition want us to believe of Mr. Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, and what he ought to be.  At column 2258, Volume 106 of Official Debates, the then Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A disappointing note was struck here yesterday evening.  I have been doing my best, for how long I cannot tell you, to show you the great fellow I am.  I am the kind of fellow who believes I have made a fairly good effort at it.  I had succeeded in inducing myself to believe that even the farmers were beginning to think it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently he was satisfied then that the farmers did not think much of his efforts as Minister for Agriculture.  If he blames the present Minister for Agriculture for not being a super Minister for Agriculture I think he ought to remember what he himself thought of the farmers' attitude towards him when he occupied that distinguished position.  At column 2258 he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Not only that, but I have certain evidence that they thought that, in spite of the send-off I got, I was not such a bad fellow.  Do you know, I did know a little about the office and the work for which I have been selected?  I was fooling myself all along, taking myself by the arm and beginning to get a swelled head and terribly big and brave at the hit I was making.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that a few columns prior to that he was talking about filling ten fields full of inspectors.</P>

      <P>Believe me, this is in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was not going to refer to this at all, because I hear the things said about myself&mdash;some of them were favourable&mdash;and I was beginning to walk on air.

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Agriculture is considered by Deputies to be the most important Estimate presented to us because of the fact that the majority of the members comprising Dáil Éireann represent rural constituencies. Naturally, the Estimate which concerns mainly the interests of those living in the rural areas must be regarded as most important, most essential and most urgent.  The debate that takes place on that Estimate is the most serious of all the debates on Estimates presented here.  Agriculture is our main industry and naturally one would expect the principal debate of the year to be devoted to constructive critricism showing how that important industry can be prospered and improved.</P>
      <P>The main industry being agriculture, one expects that the full force of Government policy, through their mouthpiece, the most effective member of the Government, the Minister for Agriculture, should be devoted towards the building up and the safeguarding of that industry.  I am quite satisfied that our main industry is in the best and the most capable hands.  The present Minister has occupied that office for three years.  He has occupied it with credit to himself and he has aroused the envy of those people from the opposite benches whom I may refer to as being evilly disposed.  It is all the same who the Minister for Agriculture is, whether he is Deputy James Dillon or any other Deputy from this side of the House.  I have not heard one syllable uttered by any member on the Opposition Benches in a constructive fashion in this debate.  Every word that was uttered was uttered with deliberate malice and with the deliberate intention of complete destruction. The object was to bring the main industry to disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that those who are engaged in our primary industry are very proud people, and they have every right to be proud people.  They dislike and view with horror and disgust statements such as were made by Deputy Martin Corry, Deputy Walsh, Deputy Frank Aiken and Deputy <Col N="1978" /> Dennis Allen.  Such statements are likely to create the impression that those proud farmers have reached the status of paupers.  We have tried, and tried successfully, in the three years during which the inter-Party Government have been in power, to raise the standard and improve the conditions and even to raise still further the dignity of the farmers upon whom the whole country depends.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should give every possible consideration to the case put forward by the Opposition against the Minister for Agriculture. There was only one case put forward against him.  The Opposition cannot pick any pin-holes in his policy&mdash;I defy them to.  They cannot prove any failures in his policy.  In the three years during which he has acted as Minister his policy never got a good chance, but in the years that lie ahead of this Government it will get a chance.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, listening to the Opposition speeches, that starvation was facing the country, that instead of the condition of the farmers being improved, they were being reduced and left in queues standing outside the workhouse doors.  Very far from that. Surely, Deputy Allen and every other Deputy representing a rural constituency must know that there are more farmers driving to the church gates on Sundays in motor cars than there ever were before in the history of this country. That is one sign of prosperity. There are more farmers with tractors tearing up their land than there ever were in the long, painful, sad and sorrowful period of Deputy Smith's and Deputy Dr. Ryan's administration here.</P>
    <P>There is more agricultural produce to-day than there was under the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Smith.  Listening to the Opposition, one would imagine that our production had gone down to the lowest depths it could possibly reach.  In reality the only crops, the acreage of which has been reduced, are turnips, mangolds and cabbage&mdash;that is, since 1939.  Is the whole agricultural policy of Fianna Fáil based on the production of turnips, mangolds and cabbage?</P>
    <P>Let us go back to the administration of Deputy Paddy Smith and Deputy <Col N="1979" /> Dr. Ryan.  In 1939 we had 141,384 acres of turnips and in 1950 that had gone down to 128,311 acres.  In 1939 we had 85,502 acres of mangolds and that was reduced in 1950 to 78,387 acres.  As regards cabbage, we had 14,295 acres in 1939 and in 1950, 12,702 acres.  Do the Irish people depend completely on turnips, mangolds and cabbage?  Do Deputy Smith, Deputy Dr. Ryan or Deputy Childers, who now occupy the Front Benches of the Fianna Fáil Party, seriously tell us that this country, under Deputy Dillon's administration, is facing ruin and disaster because there is a reduction in the production of cabbage, mangolds and turnips?</P>
    <P>The Opposition seriously envy the successful attempts of the present Minister to increase food production. They have gone through this country and they have said that production has declined, that it is going down further, and that the Minister is out against tillage.  Will they prove to me from the latest available statistics how the Minister is fighting tooth and nail against a tillage policy?  Why, according to the latest figures, there was never more tillage in this country &mdash;and there is no compulsion either. In 1939 there were 255,280 acres under wheat.  In 1950 the acreage went up to 366,012.  Did the farmers have to be compelled in 1950 to grow it, as they were compelled in 1939?  One must realise surely that instead of being compelled they have grown more wheat voluntarily with a little encouragement, a little insistence and a little sympathetic patting on the back from the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

In 1939 there were 73,784 acres under barley and in 1950 there was a very great increase to 223,241 acres.  The real cause of the bitterness coming from the Opposition Benches against the present Government and against <Col N="1980" /> the present Minister is the fact that he has got results and has never even attempted to compel the farmers to give him those results.</P>
      <P>Let us take rye.  In 1939, the total acreage was 1,728; in 1950, almost 4,000 acres.  The total acreage under beans and peas in 1939 was 402; in 1950, 1,506. In the case of potatoes, the total acreage in 1939 was 317,169; in 1950, it was increased to 336,712.</P>

      <P>In 1939, 317,169 acres. That was increased in 1950 to 336,712 acres.  Is there not a serious attempt to produce food for our people? Despite the crying, moaning and wailing we hear from the Opposition that there has been less food and more hunger, there never was more food being produced in this country.</P>
      <P>Let us now take sugar beet, about which we hear Deputy Corry crying tears morning, noon and night and he is assisted in his attempt to produce those tears by the tears of his colleague, Deputy Allen.  In 1939, when Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen were the mainstay of Fianna Fáil in encouraging the Minister of the day to produce sugar beet, there were 41,661 acres under sugar beet.  In 1950 that was increased to 60,002 acres.  In 1939 there were 4,123 acres under flax.  In 1950 there were 10,000 acres under flax. Deputy Childers might like to have a favourable ending to these statistics which are distasteful to him.  In 1939 fruit covered 8,170 acres and in 1950, 12,240 acres.  Will Deputy Childers or any Deputy in the Opposition endeavour to convince me that there is less food being produced or a less acreage under tillage to-day than there was when Fianna Fáil were in office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Deputy, I invite any Deputy, with the permission of the Chair, of course, to contradict the fact that more wheat, more beet, more barley, more rye, more flax and more potatoes are being produced <Col N="1981" /> than there ever was in the history of Fianna Fáil, and that there is less mangolds, less turnips and less cabbage.  If Fianna Fáil desire to devote their whole agricultural policy to mangolds, turnips and cabbage, they are welcome to it.</P>
      <P>Those figures have convinced me that the wealth of this country has very vastly increased.  We have been taught that agriculture is the basis of the nation's wealth, that the wealth of the country is in the soil, and that we can produce real wealth only by hard work.  Such a huge increase in the acreage under crops must mean that more farmers are producing, that there are more people employed on the land, and that there is greater encouragement to work on the land and, further, that there is more contentment on the land than there has been in the past.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with the Minister for Agriculture and his efforts. Although I am far from being a prophet or a mind reader, I am satisfied that the vast majority of Deputies in the Opposition know in their hearts and souls that there never was more food produced, and there never was more prosperity in agriculture than there is to-day, but they just do not want to admit it, because of some personal dislike of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Let us now reflect on the fact that we, as Deputies who came together to save this country from complete disaster three years ago, are responsible, by our votes, for having Deputy James Dillon as Minister for Agriculture.  Is there any Deputy, except one with some personal grudge against the Minister, who can honestly stand up and say that I have done wrong to my country by casting my vote in favour of Deputy James Dillon?  I cast my vote in favour of Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture in 1948, in the hope that the report that I have just read would be produced, in the hope that more food would be produced, and that the farmers would get a fair and <Col N="1982" /> square deal.  I voted for him expecting the report that we have got.  I am not disappointed.  It was just what we expected from a common-sense, intelligent man who has the interest of the agricultural community at heart. We got just the report that we expected. I will go further and say that I feel proud that I voted for Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture.  I will feel twice as proud in coming back after the next general election and voting for him again as Minister for Agriculture, and using every influence I possibly can, as an Independent Deputy, to see that he will be Minister for Agriculture, so that he can build well and high on the solid foundations he has laid for agricultural prosperity.</P>
      <P>Let us consider for one moment an aspect which I consider of paramount importance.  From a study of the statistics one realises that many appeals have been made to farmers to make the best possible use of their land and to produce all the food that is possible.  Deputies on the opposite side of the House are moaning and groaning because there is not compulsory tillage.  Every Deputy must realise that we have striven for years to get rid of compulsion in this country.  Assume for a moment that the workers of this country were forcibly driven at the point of the bayonet to do whatever work they were ordered to do against their will and against their wishes, that the members of the legal profession were marched into a square and, at the point of the bayonet, were paraded to the courts and to their offices and compelled to sit all day listening to the stories of their clients, that the members of the medical profession were compelled to do their duty, would not that be regarded with horror, amazement and disgust?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If plasterers, masons and others engaged in the building trade were paraded and compelled to take part in a building drive, what resentment and protest would come from all sections of the people!  One must realise that the farmers, for a number of years, were singled out and compelled to till under a penalty of imprisonment or very high fines that <Col N="1983" /> could put them completely out of business.  We have had the sad experience of farmers being dragged into the courts and compelled to till their land.  Would it not have been a far better policy to give these farmers encouragement to till their lands, to give them guaranteed markets for their produce and to relieve them from the unwelcome attentions of hordes of inspectors who were continually invading their premises? Would it not be far better to give them a fair price for all their crops and let them grow what they liked, when they liked and where they liked?  Let them, in other words, be masters of their own castles.  Let them till what they like; if you pay them well, they are the men who are the best judges of their own business and they will sow the crops that pay them best.  The day the Minister introduces compulsory tillage is the day that I shall step a pace in advance of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I shall oppose as strongly as I possibly can any attempt to compel farmers to till, but I am 100 per cent. with the Minister in getting the farmers to do their job as they like best themselves. Surely the farmers have not to be driven and shown the way to sow oats, barley or any other crop?  As I said, they are the best judges of their business and they will produce the crop that pays them best.  I hope that the farmers, who are the most intelligent section of the community, the real producers of wealth, will be delivered from such a catastrophe as having as Minister for Agriculture, men like Deputy Smith or Deputy Ryan.  The day when they fall into such incompetent, incapable and such irresponsible hands, is the day the farmers will certainly shed bitter tears.</P>
    <P>Farmers now can appreciate the measure of freedom they have had for the past three years, and the assistance they have got in the way of guaranteed markets for everything they produce at prices fixed, not a month before they produce their crops, but fixed far in advance and for years afterwards.  Let us assume for a moment, if any of us had the experience of being bound in chains and locked within the dreary <Col N="1984" /> iron bars of a prison, how glad we would be to hear the jingle of the keys in the lock to open the prison doors and the words coming from the lips of the jailer: &ldquo;You are now a free man in a free country.&rdquo;  Surely it must have been an occasion for rejoicing for farmers when they were told that they were free men to use their land as they wished and to till it when, where and how they liked, that they could even sow nettles or docks if they so wished. But nettles, ragweed or dockweed do not pay.  Wheat, oats and barley pay and these are the crops the farmers of this country will sow&mdash;the crops that pay them best.  Must not it have been a glorious day for the farmers when the trumpet was sounded and they were told that they were again freemen, masters of their own land and released from dictation by a group of civil servants, coming from Merrion Street to tell the farmers of Leix-Offaly and the rest of the country where they should sow wheat, oats and beet?</P>
    <P>I am not a farmer and I never hope to be, with God's Holy Will, but if I were a farmer and if my premises were invaded by a group of gentlemen, armed to the teeth with fountain pens and pencils, coming to tell me where I should sow my oats, my beet and my barley I would be inclined to answer them in typical country language. Deputy Cogan no doubt is waiting anxiously for the day when he will have to pull down one of his dairies or his stables and erect an office and staff it with clerks to keep the inspectors going with statistics, talk and figures. I am sure that neither Deputy Cogan nor any other Deputy is anxious for the day when, instead of erecting outoffices, he will have to erect a proper office provided with desks, electric heaters, ink, writing pads and pages of blotting paper and have a reception room for the purpose of receiving the hordes of inspectors who will come to tell him what land he is to till and what crop he is to sow.  If you ask some of these same inspectors the difference between a moving machine and a reaper and binder, they could not tell you.  That day has gone in this country, thank God, gone for good and may it never return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> While we have unity on this side of the House on agricultural policy there is not the least shadow of doubt that the farmers of the country will have nothing to worry about.  Is it not a sad thing that men who have come from the land, who have experience of tilling the land, who welcome their harvest cheques, men like Deputy O'Reilly from Cavan, Deputy Cogan from Wicklow and Deputy Lehane from Cork and others, are anxious for the return of Fianna Fáil to power, to make a complete hoax of agriculture in this country and to drive it back, not where it was in 1939, but where it was in 1847?  That is their aim.  Surely those who are anxious for a return to the dreary days of Fianna Fáil to foster agriculture are not acting with clear consciences.  Are they anxious to see their fellow farmers dragged to courts for failing to till their land?  Would any of us in this House like to be compelled to do anything against our wishes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not lose sight of the fact that in this country we have 210,000 holdings each with a valuation of under £10, and in addition 80,000 holdings, each with a valuation of under £21 10s. 0d.  That means that roughly there are 290,000 holdings <Col N="1986" /> with valuations of less than £21 10s. 0d. each.  In my opinion the man with a £10 valuation holding cannot, in the real sense, be described as a farmer at all because his holding is too small to enable him to make a living on it.  It would be a grave injustice to compel a small landholder to produce anything from his holding except what he himself considered was most suitable in his circumstances. If in the future any attempt were to be made by this Government&mdash;I know there will not&mdash;to have compulsory tillage, I certainly would not support it.  Should the country be ever unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of some irresponsible Minister whose policy was compulsory tillage, it will get the stiffest possible opposition from me inside and outside the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has a very difficult job.  He was criticised severely recently by the dairy farmers when they made a demand for an increase in the price of milk.  We have tillage farmers, we have ranchers and we have the dairy farmer.  The tillage farmer is the one I have the honour to represent in this House.  We have more tillage in my constituency than grazing or dairying.  That is one of the reasons why the Minister cannot be more generous in catering for one section of farmers than for another.</P>
      <P>Assuming for one moment that the dairy farmers got all they had been asking for, would not Deputy Cogan and many of his friends be inclined to ask why they were being treated so generously, and why more was not being done for the tillage farmers? Other Deputies would ask why provision was not being made to give them increased prices for the live stock they export to the British market.  We have in the Midlands, for example, men who are exporting some of the finest beef in the world.  We have men in the South producing the very best milk, and men in the Midlands producing the finest crops of wheat, oats, barley, beet and root crops.  A balance must be kept between the dairy farmer, the cattle exporter, the grazier and the tillage farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> Suppose the Minister were to comply with the full demand made by the dairy farmers in the South, how would it be met?  He has already given them an increase of 1d. per gallon for their milk.  Is the position this&mdash;that their full demand should be met by subsidies?  Deputies should realise that subsidies are bad, dangerous and damaging.  If I had my way, nothing would be subsidised.  If an industry cannot support itself, then it should be scrapped.  Every 1d. extra per gallon which the Minister gives in the price of milk means an increase of 2d. per lb. for butter.  I certainly will oppose any attempt by the Minister to give the milk producers in Limerick, Cork and parts of Tipperary an extra 1d. per gallon.  I do so on behalf of the workers in my constituency, the men on the Clonsast bog, the workers in Goodbody's of Clara, the workers in Salts, Ltd., Tullamore, the workers in the mills and factories in Portlaoise, the county council workers in my constituency, and the workers on the Brosna drainage scheme.  I oppose any proposal to compel the wives of those men to pay an extra 2d. per lb. for their butter.  If I agreed to it, I would have to answer for it in my constituency.  I would be asked why I did not oppose it in the strongest possible manner.  The workers would tell me that they were far less well off than the prosperous dairy farmers in Tipperary, Cork and North Kerry.</P>
    <P>I know those farmers have to work hard, but surely they will admit that they are better off to-day than they ever were before.  Will not the House agree with me that we had a wise and sane Minister&mdash;may we not thank God for such a Minister?&mdash;when he decided not to give an increase of 3d. per gallon in the price of milk?  If he had done so the price of butter would have been increased by 6d. per lb.  Everybody knows that butter is a most nutritious food.  The human body cannot be maintained in health without it.  There is no other food which produces the same amount of energy in the human body.  It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that mothers and their children should have ample supplies of it made available to <Col N="1988" /> them at the cheapest possible price. Why should the Minister for Agriculture, or any Deputy on this side, stand for depriving the mothers and the working-class people of the butter that should go on their bread in order to satisfy the greed of the big South of Ireland farmers?  I am proud and glad to stand behind the Minister for Agriculture in supporting every word that he uttered in defiance of the demand made by those dairy farmers for a further increase in the price of milk.  If the working-class people in my constituency have to pay that increase, then they will never get it.</P>
    <P>It is only right that this whole question should be viewed from every angle.  I am very glad that the majority of the Deputies who are supporting the common sense and sound policy of the Minister are prepared to take into consideration the consumer, who is not as fortunately placed as the producer.  He has greater difficulties to contend with in securing the wherewithal to enable him to purchase enough commodities to keep body and soul together.  For these reasons, I believe that the Minister for Agriculture has handled this situation in an admirable way.</P>
    <P>He has done a magnificent job.  He has given the dairy farmers an extra 1d. per gallon for their milk, and that is going to increase the price of butter by 2d. per lb.  Surely the South of Ireland farmers cannot be so ungrateful as not to admit that the position of the working-class people must be considered. We must see to it that butter is made available to them at a price which they can afford, particularly when we realise the great value that butter has in building up and sustaining the human body.  The Minister has been bitterly and unduly criticised in connection with the price of eggs.  The Minister has increased the price of eggs from 2/- to 2/6 per dozen up to the 31st August next, and from 1st September to 31st January to 3/6 per dozen, and that price is guaranteed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>And Mountmellick. If the egg producers were to demand 10/- per dozen for eggs, does that mean that the workers whom Deputy O'Rourke has the honour to represent, such as the miners in the Arigna coal mines, must pay 10/- per dozen for them?  Does it mean that the working-class people in my constituency, in the City of Dublin and throughout the country and those who are ill in hospital and those who require eggs as nourishment must pay 10/- per dozen if the producers demand 10/-?  A price of 3/6 per dozen is as much as the labouring classes can afford to pay for eggs.  The Minister for Agriculture, in his own wise and common-sense way, has taken into consideration the producer on one side and the consumer on the other.  In my opinion, he has given the farmer the benefit of the doubt because, if I had my way, I would provide eggs for the working-class people at 1d. each.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would see that eggs were provided for the working-class people at 1d. each.  The Minister for Agriculture is more than generous in the price he is giving farmers for the eggs.  I am of opinion that 2/6 per dozen for eggs now is a fair and reasonably good price, but the Minister has extended his generosity further still and guaranteed that they will be 3/6 per dozen from 1st September to 31st January, 1952, and longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a section of the farming community to which I should like to draw the attention of the House, namely, the small farmer who suffers from lack of capital to work his land as he would wish.  As I have pointed <Col N="1990" /> out, there are 210,000 holdings in this country with a valuation of under £10 owned by very small struggling farmers. Most of these have not recovered from the effects of the economic war. Most of these were sunk during the economic war owing to the irresponsible actions of the Opposition.  Many such farmers were on the steps of the workhouse and many of them died in the workhouse as a result of the economic war and to-day their sons and daughters are labouring in an attempt to recover from the effects of the economic war.  In view of that, I believe that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should open their tills a little wider and come to the aid of those smallholders.  For the past nine years I have spoken annually on the Department of Agriculture Estimate and on each occasion I have advocated that the question of providing capital for small farmers should be given consideration by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister will not listen to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I advocated it while in opposition and I am advocating it now in the hope that it is not too late for the Minister to give some consideration to the many applications rejected by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. We know very well that when one applies to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a form in order to make application for a loan one of the first questions on the form is: &ldquo;How much money have you in the bank and how much money have you on hands?&rdquo;  Such a form would not be addressed to a person looking for a loan except it was being addressed from Grangegorman.  Imagine asking an applicant for a loan how much money he has in the bank.  Surely, if he had any money in the bank he would withdraw it and work on it or, if he had money on hands, he would not be going on his hands and knees begging for a loan to assist him in buying live stock or purchasing other requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Minister will have to listen very carefully to the demands made from all sides of this House for the formulation of a satisfactory, favourable and successful scheme <Col N="1991" /> whereby credit will be made available at a cheap rate of interest for small farmers who need it.  We have 210,000 small farmers with a valuation under £10 many of whom are taking land on the conacre system.  The Minister knows very well that there are 620,200 statute acres set by conacre each year. That means that they are set on the 11 months' system, that the farmer must clear off at the end of 11 months, and go to a public auction again at which the highest bidder gets the land.  The 620,000 acres set on the 11 months' system bring in from £12 to £14 per acre.  In parts of my constituency&mdash; Deputy Davin can verify this&mdash;conacre land went to £23 and £24 per acres.  The person getting this land under that system is the smallholder with a valuation of less than £10.  That is the man who is expected to produce food.  As has been stated from this side of the House, when this country needed food, when the Government of the day were appealing for the growing of food for man and beast, it was the small farmer who gave the good return.  It was the men who took the 620,000 acres in conacre, who tilled and produced the wheat, oats, beet and barley with skill and industry, marching from morning until night between the handles of the plough and following the hooves of their horses who saved this country from starvation and complete disaster, and these are the men to whom special consideration should be given in the matter of financing them to enable them to work their land.</P>
    <P>The farmer who has to pay £14 or £15 or £20 for a few acres of land on the 11 months' system cannot make any profit out of it, because, at the end of the year, he has to pay the seed merchant for his seed and has to pay his agricultural worker, if he is able to pay one.  If his own sons work for him, he has to feed and clothe them and give them pocket money on Saturday night and then pay £23 or £25 per acre to the auctioneer.  In some cases, these farmers get their seed from generous seed merchants like those we have in my constituency&mdash;Messrs. D.E. Williams and Co., Messrs. P. and H. Egan, Messrs. H. Smith and Sons and <Col N="1992" /> others&mdash;who go out of their way to help these farmers by providing seed on credit until such time as the crop comes in and they can be paid.  In the case of these small farmers who have to get seed on credit, who have to depend on the generosity of the helpful merchants and their obliging staffs, we see that, when the end of the year comes, the greatest deduction from their earnings is due to seed and payments to the auctioneer for the land they took in conacre.  Manures have to be paid for as well.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a scheme will be announced or formulated whereby credit facilities will be provided for the type of small farmer I have referred to.  There are in this country 15,000 farmers with valuations of over £50 but not exceeding £80 and 17,000 holdings of over £80 valuation.  I believe that <Col N="1994" /> farmers with valuations of £50 to £80 will not be appealing to the Minister for financial assistance, nor will the farmer with the valuation of over £80 &mdash;and there are 17,000 of them, as I say&mdash;be begging or craving the Minister to provide them with financial assistance.  There are very few farmers with valuations of £50 to £80 and over £80 on the lists of the Agricultural Credit Corporation or on the files of the Department as having applied for loans and financial assistance.  If there are, I say, and say without any fear, that those farmers should be in a position to produce from such highly-valued holdings what will keep them going and what will enable them to pay a decent and proper wage to their employees.  I furthermore believe that they should not be entitled to any scheme of credit.</P>
      <P>Credit should and must be provided for small farmers, and I hope and trust that some scheme will be introduced whereby facilities will be made available for the very small farmer and that it will be recognised that the large farmer is in a position to carry on without any aid from the Department or any State concern.  Let us assume that the promoters of a flourishing and prosperous industry, an industry producing annual profits and paying good dividends to its shareholders, were to look for State aid.  Would we not be inclined to shout them down, and, rightly and properly, to ignore their applications?  Therefore, why should we not ignore completely the applications of these farmers who should be in a position to work their lands so as to enable them to put money aside from the profits of their holdings and why should not the small farmer who has not sufficient land to enable him to make such a profit as will enable him to have a reserve of money to carry on be given very special consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if I am keeping Deputy Lynch from speaking, but surely there is ample time for every Deputy who desires to make a speech to do so.  You will agree that in the past three years I have occupied very little time in this House.  I seldom rise to speak in this House and when I rise to speak on such an urgent and important Estimate <Col N="1995" /> as the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture I hope that the Chair will give me, in accordance with the Standing Orders of this House, the unlimited time to which I am entitled in order to express my views on the agricultural industry.  That is especially so when one realises that last year Deputy Smith spoke for five and a half hours.  Surely, if Deputy Smith can speak for five hours' deliberate obstruction in this House I am entitled to at least three hours to talk common sense.</P>
    <P>We must realise that last year the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture was debated for 46 hours. None of us on this side of the House said that that debate had gone on long enough or that it was going on too long.  We did not do so because we welcome the views of every Deputy. More especially we welcome criticism but we do not welcome dishonest criticism&mdash;because we know that it is dishonest.  The debate went on for 46 hours last year and this minute it is now only on its thirty-fifth hour&mdash;and no one took five hours, although I am on my third hour and I will probably go on my fourth.</P>

      <P>I certainly do&mdash;and the electors of my constituency will prove that when I have the honour to go before them, as they did before. However, let us get back to the Estimate. May I ask Deputy O'Rourke or any Deputy on the Opposition Benches, through the Chair, if they give the Minister credit for any one good thing which he did in the past three years? Will they tell me if he did anything good in the past three years&mdash;or did he do everything the wrong way round? Do they not even give him credit for the land rehabilitation project? Do they not even give him credit for a scheme which is in operation in part of Deputy O'Rourke's constituency, which borders my constituency, in the parish of Moore?  In that parish land <Col N="1996" /> is now completely drained over which snipes were flying three or four years ago&mdash;and before very long that land will be producing bountiful and profitable crops for the land owners as a result of the Minister's scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy O'Rourke must realise that if one scheme has ever been of benefit to the agricultural community it is that scheme.  Remember also that this is a scheme that is not solely of benefit to the agricultural community.  It is of benefit also to the people of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and the people of the cities and big towns because it means that as a result of the reclamation of the land more food will pour into the towns and cities.  Therefore, in my opinion, the land rehabilitation project has been such a great, perfect and sound and common-sense scheme that farmers believe it to be a dream coming true.  I am very glad and pleased about the wonderfully good response there has been to that scheme from my constituency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith comes along and criticises the Minister for Agriculture because he states that less is being provided for the land rehabilitation project this year than was provided the previous year.  Surely Deputy Smith must realise that machinery had to be purchased.  Surely Deputy Smith must realise that at the present time machinery is a very expensive item. Surely Deputy Smith must realise that it takes great foresight to order machinery and to get machinery, and surely he must be aware that licences have to be had from Departments such as the British Board of Trade, and from the Americans, for the supply of such essential machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister not get even the smallest word of praise&mdash;not even from a man who loves the Minister, Deputy Eugene Gilbride of the Fianna Fáil Party?  He said that he likes the Minister.  He displayed all the signs of great affection and high love for the Minister.  But will Deputy Eugene Gilbride be prepared to prove his affection for the Minister?  Will he be <Col N="1997" /> prepared to show that he really loves the Minister and appreciates the Minister's work?  He can do so by walking into the Division Lobby and voting for this Estimate.  Will he do that?  Let him be sincere and display his love and affection for the Minister, which came from his lips last week.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilbride is an honest decent man outside this House, but he does not speak very honestly or sincerely when he professes in this House to love the Minister for Agriculture and yet does not give a practical demonstration of that love by walking into the Lobby and voting for this Estimate and showing his approval of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilbride had not a word of praise or credit to utter in favour of the land rehabilitation project.  Why? Because he did not know that it was operating in his own constituency. There are none so blind as those who will not see.  Deputy Gilbride did not know that it was operating in his constituency. If Deputy Smith had initiated the land rehabilitation project Deputy Gilbride would know then that it was working in Sligo-Leitrim. He would know then every perch of land being reclaimed.  He would know then every drop of water which was leaving the land as a result of the scheme.  He would know then the number of small concrete pipes that went into drains and he would know the number of men employed.  He would even know, intimately and personally, <Col N="1998" /> the officer of the project&mdash;and that is the most important of all.</P>

      <P>I think that wonderful work has been done in three years considering that nothing was done in 16 years by the Deputy's Party.  At least it was not planned for ten years, put on the shelves of the Department of Agriculture, covered with cobwebs and weighed down with dust.  That is one of the schemes that was not left on the shelf to be planned and promised for years.  That is one of the schemes that never got a chance of being surrounded with cobwebs and overshadowed with dust.  That is a scheme that was conceived and immediately put into effect.  The farmers of the country were told: &ldquo;We are prepared to spend £40,000,000 on putting your land into a productive state.&rdquo; Does the Fianna Fáil Party not even give the Minister for Agriculture credit for that scheme?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can they not at least be honest and say that it is a good scheme?  I know that in my constituency a number of farmers were making inquiries about the land project. Deputy Smith was very displeased and vexed when in this House some months ago the Minister for Agriculture made a statement which was completely in accordance with the facts.  I have heard from my constituents who were anxious to avail of the land rehabilitation project that when they were paying their annuities every farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties got with that receivable order a leaflet giving full details of the wonders and benefits which that scheme could and would work.  When they wished to apply, they wrote to the Department of Agriculture for their forms and at express rates or at least by return of post those forms were sent to them.  In areas in which Fianna Fáil Deputies resided poor farmers sought the advice of county councillors and Dáil Deputies of that Party and were told: &ldquo;Do not fill in that form.  Have nothing to do with that scheme because your rates and rent will go sky-high.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers who need it most are the small farmers under £10 valuation, and there are 280,000 of them.  This scheme and many other beneficial schemes of the Minister's will help these farmers.  They are not as well up, as highly educated or as influential as the mighty big farmers who could use their own common sense and see that the scheme was a good one and that nothing in it would put up rent, rates or taxes, and the poor small farmer was advised to have nothing to do with the scheme because political capital could be made out of it if it could be described by the Opposition as a white elephant.  But no, the scheme could not be described as a white elephant because farmers used their own common sense in most areas, completed their forms, and were acquainted with someone who read the announcements in the daily papers. They listened attentively to the wise and fatherly words of the Minister for <Col N="2000" /> Agriculture when he said that rates and annuities would not go up because of work done under this scheme. Therefore many farmers could have availed of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that they were not properly advised, however, and were wrongly advised and because of that they refused to complete their just = "right" ri = "1"application forms.  I would impress upon the Minister for Justice to convey to his colleague the Minister for Agriculture the need for further announcements from him and further advertisements in the columns of the daily papers from his Department, making it quite clear that as a result of the scheme valuations would not be increased, inviting farmers to participate in it, and again assuring them that the obstacles put in its way mean nothing, and are only humbug, tripe and deliberate defiance by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Might I ask him to convey to the Minister for Agriculture the necessity of communicating with the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce, because if this scheme is to be successful concrete pipes will be necessary.  If the land drainage scheme is to be carried out within the terms of this scheme, there is a prescribed pipe which must be used, and more farmers could avail of the scheme if suitable pipes were made available. Deputy O'Rourke is anxious to know when the scheme will be finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing holds up the scheme but a shortage in certain areas of concrete pipes.  In my constituency in Portlaoise an industry has opened and it shows the sincerity of the good farmers of that constituency when I say that an order for pipes for 40 acres of field drainage under the land rehabilitation scheme has been placed with the manufacturers.  In order to manufacture pipes for field drainage, they must go through a certain process and when they are manufactured they must pass certain tests by officers of the Department of Agriculture.  I would impress upon <Col N="2001" /> these officers to permit the passing of that test with every possible speed because delay in this matter is one of the reasons why the scheme is not going through as quickly as Deputy Lynch would like to see, as speedily as Deputy Allen would like to see or as speedily as Deputy O'Rourke would like to see when he says that it will never be done.  That scheme is going on as quickly as possible but we have not as much machinery as we would like in order that the land rehabilitation project should produce the results and the great benefits wanted by every farmer who avails of it.</P>
      <P>Machinery is not the main cause of the hold-up however.  Now that the Minister has resumed his seat, may I direct his attention to the need for the establishment of centres for concrete pipes for field drainage and for field drainage alone?  I hope that the officers of the Department of Agriculture will communicate with the officers of the I.D.A. so as to encourage even co-operative societies to establish them in as many areas as possible.  I understand that for £600 a suitable type of machine can be obtained, as we have seen obtained by the firm of Messrs. Jessop of Portlaoise, for the making of the pipes for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Minister, further, if he is anxious to see that pipes are made available for the land rehabilitation project, would he not consider, as well as giving the farmers the benefits of this scheme, giving the producer of the concrete pipes some benefit also? Since I understand that a certain sum of money for this scheme is being provided from Marshall Aid funds, would he not consider devoting some of the funds to industry, to manufacture solely for the Department of Agriculture concrete pipes for the carrying out of work in accordance with specifications laid down by the Department for the field drainage scheme?  That is something worth considering.  Again, we have many enterprising people and if they get any help from the Minister, even a word of encouragement, or if they can get a grant from him, or even a loan to be repaid with some interest over a long period of years, or get any assistance from the Government, these <Col N="2002" /> pipes will be manufactured and nothing will stand in the way of progress and speed in land rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>May I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on that wonderful scheme and hoping that he will be Minister for Agriculture for many long years, until he sees the benefits and the results which that scheme will yield?  It is a scheme that the farmers thank God for, that would never have been in existence were it not for the fact that it came from the brains of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;just as the children's allowances scheme came from the brains of the present Minister for Agriculture.  That is the second outstanding scheme that came from his brains, but he needs help and support and co-operation and the only place that he can get it is from the members of this House.  If there are members obstructing and pulling against him and advocating that people should deny certain farmers and smallholders and other applicants the benefits of the land rehabilitation scheme, shame and disgrace to those men&mdash;shame and disgrace to them that are anxious to stand in the way of progress, shame and disgrace to the men anxious to stand in the way of increasing the productivity of the land and the fertility of the soil.  Certainly a good deal of work has been done under that scheme and I am glad that it has been done.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy Cogan or any other Deputy does not think that at this hour of this Dáil I should dream of betraying my friends?  To get back to the water supplies to farm dwellings, about which Deputy Cogan and some others may not be anxious to hear, this is equally as valuable and beneficial as the land project.  Surely one would expect the charity of the silence of the Opposition if they had not a good word or a word of praise for this scheme?  If they could not praise it, if they could not give the Minister the benefit of saying it was another good scheme, surely they would say nothing whatever about it?  By the end of the financial year 1950/51, 3,713 people had made application to the Department under the water supply scheme and a sum of £100,000 has been provided in the Estimates for this service for 1950/51.</P>
      <P>Is there a Deputy who will go down to his constituency next week-end or the following week-end and say: &ldquo;I have voted against a sum of money which will put a water supply into your kitchen&rdquo;?  How many Deputies in the Opposition Benches, how many Deputies in the Government Benches, would dare dream of going to their constituencies and telling their constituents, whom they have the honour to represent here, that for one moment they stood and walked up those steps and turned into that Division Lobby and deprived the farmer of having a water supply to his house?  Is it not true that Deputy Allen and Deputy Corry have been crying and weeping over the amount of money which the Wexford County Council and the Cork County Council have to spend in providing public pumps in their areas in order to supply water for domestic purposes?  Is it not true that the Department of Agriculture, on more than one occasion, refused to provide grants for pumps in certain areas?  Is it not true also that people were put to great expense in the provision of a water supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say that the late Deputy Willie O'Donnell&mdash;God rest his soul and I hope he is in heaven to-night&mdash; often spoke from these benches on many an occasion and appealed to <Col N="2004" /> Deputy Smith when Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture, and appealed to Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister; but not alone did Deputy Ryan and Deputy Smith give the late Deputy O'Donnell the deaf ear and the blind eye, but they paid no heed whatever to his appeal and request on behalf of the farmers who needed a water supply to their homesteads. Deputy O'Donnell made that appeal here as far back as 1943.  Why did not Deputy Smith or Deputy Dr. Ryan, when in charge of the Department of Agriculture, foresee the difficulties that Deputy Dillon foresaw to the many farmers who had no water supply in their areas?  I will ask even Deputy Paddy Burke, and when asking even him I am sure I may expect some atom of common sense in the reply&mdash;is there any more inconvenience that could be created or caused in any house or home than to provide that there is no water supply?  Does not the appeal come from every area?</P>
    <P>Deputies associated with local authorities, who have been mixed up with county councils and urban councils, know that it does.  This is where Deputy Cogan comes in. Deputy Cogan knows that he made representations to the Carlow County Manager, to the Kildare County Manager and to the Wicklow County Manager, asking that pumps be erected in various places.  But Deputy Cogan knows that when those county managers wanted to have those pumps sunk a water diviner had to be obtained first.</P>
    <P>Like everything else, there is a special manner in which water can be divined.  It is very hard and difficult to secure the services of a good diviner. There are many areas where local authorities are anxious to have pumps. I have known a number of areas in my constituency around Clara and Ballylinan and elsewhere where there was no water supply whatever and where the local authorities found that the erection of a pump would not justify a demand on the rates.  I now find that the problem will be solved and that people will get assistance from the Department of Agriculture for the erection of pumps and a supply of water to the homestead.  Can any Deputy <Col N="2005" /> deny that there is no greater scheme after the land project than the provision of water for the homestead?  Is not the provision of a water supply necessary for the dairy farmer?  If anyone wants to see the success of a real water supply let him go to the Salesian College at Warrenstown, County Meath, and there he will see it.  There is no greater benefit, there is no greater convenience to the housewife than a water supply for the purpose of washing household utensils.  Even if someone like Deputy Pat McGrath was in the area and dropped in to a housewife for a cup of tea how anxious he would look if he were told that there was no water supply.  May I say that the Minister for Agriculture is to be congratulated.  I want to say that the people of this country are leaping out of their pants and shoes to get an opportunity of showing their appreciation, and as sure as there is a bill on a crow, they will show that appreciation before long.  Those schemes are not schemes that can be forgotten.</P>
    <P>May I say that the water supply scheme is one of the best schemes that has been introduced by the present Government.  Another reason why I, as an Independent Deputy, am voting for this Estimate is because there is included in it provision for a certain sum of money to be spent in my constituency on a water supply.  My constituency will receive the benefit of the Minister's wisdom in having this scheme formulated. The number of applicants under this scheme is 3,713 but, since these statistics were supplied to us, the number of applications must have undoubtedly increased.  I believe that, by the end of the present financial year, 31st March, 1952, the number of applications will have increased still more. More important still will be the number of increased applications which will be received from those persons anxious to avail of the Minister's scheme, knowing that it is a scheme that will render very great service and one which will be very highly appreciated.</P>
    <P>We have in this country a voluntary organisation known as the Young Farmers' Clubs.  Very useful and valuable work has been done throughout the country by the Young Farmers' Clubs. <Col N="2006" /> I have the honour of having in my constituency Mr. William Bland, a past president of the Young Farmers' Clubs of Ireland.  Mr. Bland, who is one of the most practical farmers in this country and one of the finest farmers worthy of the title of farmer, has on more than one occasion, with the executive committee of the Young Farmers' Clubs, approached the Department of Agriculture. I am satisfied from my own knowledge that the Minister for Agriculture has met the Young Farmers' Clubs with open arms.  He has been prepared to accept their views.  He has listened to their suggestions and has given a sympathetic ear to any grievances or suggestions that they desired to put before him.  But the Young Farmers' Clubs serve a purpose other than to advise the Minister.</P>
    <P>Soil testing is carried on in my constituency by the staff of the Laois Vocational Education Committee.  In the various vocational schools where soil testing is carried out, members of the Young Farmers' Clubs provide the seeds and have the soil tests carried out.  I say in all sincerity to the Minister that the Young Farmers' Clubs deserve every support and co-operation that is humanly possible from the Minister for Agriculture.  What greater advice could the Minister ask for? What greater advice could be given than that tendered by the Young Farmers' Clubs who give the weight of their experience to the Minister on problems which affect the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>In those clubs, we have the young farmer who has more modern and up-to-date ideas than the head of the household, the old and experienced farmer.  The Young Farmers' Clubs are advising the farmers to become more mechanical minded and to leave aside the plough.  That has been made a skit of by the Opposition, but suppose the Athlone Woollen Mills of which Deputy Lemass is a director went back to the day of the spinning wheel, how long would it take the mills to get the same return as they are getting to-day by the use of up-to-date machinery?  Deputy Lemass would not tolerate the use of the spinning wheel for one moment because he is a business man who does his own <Col N="2007" /> business in a businesslike way.  He is associated with a company that yields a profit and not a loss.  He would not associate himself for one moment with the old spinning wheel of 50 years ago. Therefore, is the Minister wrong in advocating machinery instead of the old spinning wheel of the land, the plough?  I think it is slavery to be working a plough.  I believe that the day of the horse plough is gone completely in this country.  We are getting more machinery minded and up-to-date. We had no fine day in this country from the 17th July, 1950, up to the 28th April of this year.  We had rain, frost, snow and sleet.</P>
    <P>In January, not only were the farmers unable to stand on the soil but they could not look out the door. February was no better for them.  In March, not only could the farmers not plough but they could not stand on their feet as they would be blown skyhigh. A few days ago, the Irish farmers were blessed with a few fine days, and with the service of the tractor they ripped up and tore the land just as if they had been ploughing since last November.  If the farmers work is not as far advanced to-day as it should be, it will be as far advanced next week as it would have been had we had fine weather the whole year round.  The sowing will be done and, with God's help, the crops will grow and we will have as good a harvest this year as we had in other years. There will be no need to import wheat.</P>
    <P>The young progressive farmer and the tractor are most important.  The old farmer is inclined to take the attitude that the horse and plough are good enough for him; they were good enough for his father and his grandfather before him and he will not change.  The young progressive farmer on the other hand regards the horse plough as slavery.  He realises it means time lost.  He knows that speed and efficiency will give a good return, the kind of return we want, and he will bring the modern tractor into service.  I hope the day is not far off when every farmer will be able to afford a tractor.  I hope that the Department of Agriculture will make available tractors for hire in every <Col N="2008" /> parish through the medium of the county committees of agriculture for those farmers who need them and who cannot afford them.  I hope that the old horse plough will be used only for the headlands.  When the old horse plough has done its work on the headlands I hope the clay will be scraped off and the plough laid up in the haggard until it is required next year to do the headlands again.</P>
    <P>The tractor will do more in one day than the horse plough will accomplish in a fortnight.  For that reason I want to see the modern tractor installed in every farm.  The Minister has wisely adopted the policy of making our farmers machinery conscious.  It is because of the wise advice the Minister has given that I was able to-night to read for the House the report I was so happy to quote.  The more machinery we utilise on the land the more production we will get out of the soil. During Deputy Smith's period of office as Minister for Agriculture there were inspectors for almost every phase of our agricultural economy but to my knowledge there was no inspector to carry out inspections of broken down threshing mills.  I never heard of an inspector inspecting these old crocks.</P>
    <P>In the harvest time there are old mills going out behind the tractors and, judging by some of them, they must have seen service in the days when Brian Boru was busy at Clontarf. These old mills should be condemned. They should have been put out of use long ago.  Because they are defective a certain percentage of valuable grain is lost in the chaff.  That grain represents a loss to the community.  The owner of the threshing mill charges the farmer a fee of anything from £5 to £7 a day. If these old mills continue to function the results will be disastrous for the farmers.  I think these mills should be subject to some system of inspection by an officer of the Department of Agriculture so that the farmers will no longer have to see some of their wheat, a big quantity of their barley and a great percentage of their oats being swept into a heap and burned with the chaff. That is what happens at present.</P>
    <P>I am not sufficiently qualified to inform the House exactly what adjustments <Col N="2009" /> would be necessary to ensure that none of the grain will be lost in these defective mills.  I believe these mills should be condemned and no time should be lost in condemning them. At present their operations represent a serious loss to the farmer.  The farmer has to pay heavily for the use of the mill.  He has to provide food and refreshment for the mill owner and his workmen.  Everybody knows harvesting is an expensive turn-out. Threshings are looked upon in my part of the country as occasions for rejoicing. There are harvest celebrations after the threshings.  Though the farmer is very happy to see his harvest successful, nevertheless he has to incur certain expenses in connection with it.  I admit that the farmer to-day can well afford to rejoice under the administration of the present Minister for Agriculture.  He had no reason to rejoice during the economic war, and he certainly had no occasion to celebrate under the administration of Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister met a deputation from my constituency, composed of the chairman of the Laois County Committee of Agriculture, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins and Deputy Davin. Deputy Gorry was also present.  That deputation pointed out that in the Luggacurran electoral area there are small farmers who suffered very severe losses in the winter of 1946-47.  The Government of the day came to their rescue at the time, and provided them with a scheme under which they got loans interest free from the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the purchase of live stock to replace the live stock that had died during the previous bad winter.  The present Minister met the deputation to which I have referred very sympathetically and, as a result of our efforts and his action, supplies of feeding stuffs were made available through Messrs. Odlum of Sallins to the Dunmore Co-operative Creamery for the farmers in that area whose live stock were dying because of lack of fodder.  The hay crop was a complete loss.</P>
    <P>In that area they are all honest farmers.  The Minister has often said <Col N="2010" /> that the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it.  Those farmers who availed of the interest-free loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation to replace the live stock they lost during the bad winter of 1946-47 have a good record in relation to the repayment of their instalments of the loans made available to them.  The chairman and members of the Agricultural Credit Corporation know that they have a good record.  Those loans were guaranteed by two solvent backers who guaranteed that if the farmer did not pay up they, the guarantors, would be responsible.  Because of the bad winter through which we have just passed, because the hay crop has again been lost, because the land in this area, which is very mountainous, is poor quality land&mdash;there are coal mines at Killeshin, Rossmore and Wolfhill&mdash; the farmers are once more seeing their live stock die for want of food.  Would the Minister, then, be prepared now to give a further interest-free loan? The county agricultural instructor can prove that the farmers have suffered severe losses during the past winter. Would the Minister be prepared now to give them the same facilities as they got before?  Would he give them an interest-free loan?  Alternatively, if he cannot do that, will he request the Agricultural Credit Corporation not to press and not to institute legal proceedings against the guarantors in these cases?</P>
    <P>I trust that some chance will be given to the unfortunate smallholders in the Luggacurran area until such time as conditions will improve for them and that they will be enabled to pay back the instalments.  Better still would be the introduction of an additional scheme for the most deserving applicants, not alone in the Luggacurran and Wolfhill areas, but all along the Shannon Valley, part of which would be in Deputy O'Rourke's constituency and also in the constituencies of Deputy Fagan and Deputy McQuillan. I am referring now to the areas that lie in Offaly quite convenient to the Shannon, right around Lusmagh in Offaly and convenient to the Birr area and the Banagher area.</P>
    <P>In this connection I have also in mind Ferbane and the whole parish of <Col N="2011" /> Shannonbridge.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will bear me out there as a result of the representations made to him by the parish priest of that parish in regard to the carrying out of relief works.  There is no farmer in the barony of Garrycastle or from Meelick up to Athlone&mdash;if Deputy Beegan was here he would have some knowledge of that area, I am sure&mdash;who succeeded in saving even a wisp of hay, so bad was the season.  There is no farmer along that stretch who has not had his land flooded for at least nine months out of the 12 because of the overflowing of the River Shannon.  There is no farmer there who can use his land for more than three months or put a beast on that land because his beasts will suffer from fluke, due to the water-logged condition of the land.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister not consider some scheme with the object of curbing the fluke, as a safeguard against the fluke?  I am sure he is prepared to do everything he can to assist those people.  He always makes an effort to assist them, but on this occasion I would ask him to go a step further and give special assistance to the unfortunate farmers in the Shannon Valley area who, according to the information we got here recently, received sad news. They were told that we can never hope to have a comprehensive drainage scheme carried out on the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister for Agriculture propose to do about the fertility of the soil in the Shannon Valley?  Does he propose to come to the aid of the unfortunate farmers who are thinking seriously of leaving that area?  What provision does he propose to make in order that the farmers may exist there?  I respectfully suggest to the Minister and to every officer of his Department that it is of supreme importance to give immediate assistance to the farmers in the Shannon Valley area and in the electoral area of Luggacurran, in County Laois.  Perhaps they can provide some scheme which will meet the needs of these people?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> I do not propose to harp unnecessarily on the Shannon Valley area or Luggacurran, simply because it is in the constituency I have the honour to represent.  There are also parts of Leitrim, about which Deputy Maguire spoke, and there are certain areas in Wicklow that Deputy Cogan has been speaking about.  There may be isolated cases in these areas.  There may be, particularly in County Leitrim and, I believe, in parts of Donegal, hard cases, cases in which genuine hardship can be proved.  I do not believe any section of our taxpayers would stand in the way if relief were proposed for these genuine cases of hardship.  There would be no objection to giving them financial aid or giving those people interest-free loans in order to allow them to purchase live stock to put on their land.</P>
    <P>Most of the small farmers in these areas had to dispose of their live stock before the animals were fit to be disposed of, all through lack of fodder &mdash;a shortage of hay.  I have known farmers to go to the fair of Kilcormac, in Offaly, and sell their beasts months before those beasts were fit to be sold. The Minister said he was after the tangler.  The tangler took the bull by the horns; he took a mean advantage of the unfortunate farmers who had to clear their land of stock because of the shortage of essential foodstuffs, particularly hay.  The farmers had to take their live stock to the fairs and they met the tanglers in the early hours before they could reach the fair of Kilcormac, the fair of Clara or the fair of Tullamore.  The tanglers met them before they could enter the fair where they would meet their friends. Possibly their friends were in the same position, if they were not worse off.</P>
    <P>These farmers had to sell their cattle months earlier than they would have sold them if the fodder was available. In that way many pounds, shillings and pence were lost to the small farmers. They had to dispose of their stock at a loss.  Is that not a sad commentary? We have had a hard and disastrous winter.  For years we never experienced such a bad winter as the one we have just gone through.  I hope and trust the Minister will take the necessary steps to see that in the future his <Col N="2013" /> Department will provide for such cases of hardship as I have just referred to.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the Minister's policy into which I would like to go in detail to-night, but I find that the time will not permit me to do so.  I would like to elaborate on the many beneficial schemes the Minister has introduced.  I would like to have spoken on the subject of wheat storage. Fianna Fáil neglected to provide storage for wheat.  I should like to speak at great length on the many failures of the Opposition when they were on this side of the House, so far as the agricultural community was concerned.</P>
    <P>I join with the farmers of Ireland in trusting and praying that the day may be very far off when the agricultural community will find themselves within the palms of irresponsible hands, within the claws of those not prepared to attend to their requirements.  I trust that the Minister for Agriculture, under whom we have had the honour to serve for the past three years&mdash;three fine years of prosperity so far as the agricultural community is concerned&mdash; will be spared to us for many years to come.  In the interests of agriculture he has exercised his wisdom and he has used a true and sincere discretion in relation to the many problems which confronted him in his Department.</P>
    <P>He has been made the subject of severe criticism, but he is thick-skinned enough to take that criticism.  We must remember that anyone who does good will be bitterly criticised for it. To do good you must offend others and others become jealous and it is through petty jealousy, sheer jealousy and madness because of the volume of support the farmers are giving the Minister, that the Fianna Fáil Party are so bitter in their criticisms of the one man who has proved himself such a worthy successor of the late Paddy Hogan who, God bless him, served his country for many years and who spoke from these benches before I got the honour of serving the people whom I have been proud to serve for the past nine years. I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  My objection is this: that we expect from a Minister of Dáil Éireann who interrupts a debate that he interrupts it for good reason and, above all, of necessity.  I understand that the expression that I would use towards the Minister would be out of order in this House.  I will read for the House what did happen. On the 18th April, 1951&mdash;columns 987 and 988&mdash;the following debate took place:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I come now to a matter to which, I hope, the Minister will devote his serious attention.  He must be aware that, undoubtedly the Irish Sugar Company were the pioneers of ground limestone in this country. They started their quarries in Ballybeg. They bought their plant and machinery and they set about producing ground limestone for the Irish farmer.  I do not know the <Col N="2015" /> present position, but when I wrote to Mallow last week stating that I wanted lime spread on my farm I got a reply informing me that if I wanted it spread on the farm I should have to take it without any subsidy at 30/- a ton or that I could send my order to Córas Iompair Éireann and have the lime delivered on the roadside at 16/- a ton.  Labour is not got for nothing on Irish farms to-day.  Would it not be far easier, where you have a fleet of some 80 lime spreaders&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that the Sugar Company have 170 spreaders&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;owned by the Sugar Company in Mallow, to have the lime filled into these spreaders by machinery, then sent directly to the farmer's land and spread at 5/- per ton of an increase in price?  Would it not be far easier to do that than to have the complete dislocation of work that is incurring at present?  The farmer who takes advantage of the fact that the lime will be spread on his land by the Sugar Company is being deprived of what his fellow farmers can get, namely, a subsidy of 9/- a ton. Surely it is possible to surmount this difficulty.  If the Minister is not prepared to deal with a State company, which the Sugar Company is, and to give to that State Company the subsidy which he is giving to others&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Everything is working perfectly smoothly.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: What about this letter I received last week from the Sugar Company?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;which was sent by the Cork County Committee of Agriculture to the Minister&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What has the Minister to say about that?</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: The Deputy is out of date.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: Has the Minister changed it since?</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I cannot say, since the Deputy has got the letter, but it is working perfectly smoothly now&mdash;if the Deputy does not upset the apple cart.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> Mr. Corry: Can I get&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: &mdash;&mdash;all the lime you want.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: &mdash;&mdash;and spread on my land at the subsidised price?</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Everything is now working perfectly smoothly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a statement made by a Minister for Agriculture in this House. Anybody who heard that statement would be under the firm impression that this difficulty had been removed and that the farmer who wanted lime spread on his land would get the subsidy out of the £1,000,000 given by Mr. Millar of the E.C.A., that my farmers in Cork would get their share of that money.  Instead of that, ever since this subsidy scheme was brought in, these unfortunate farmers are bringing out that lime and paying at the rate of 30/- a ton for it.  There are 170 spreaders at work drawing out that lime every day and those people are deprived of their share of the £1,000,000 grant given by Mr. Millar of the E.C.A. to subsidise lime in this country.  There is no justification for it.  I hoped that they would get it when I read that, but I found afterwards that the Minister was only a brother of Annanias.  I cannot use any other expression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that when the Minister's attention was brought to the matter in this House he would remedy it.  That was the 18th April. This is 2nd May.  The lime spreaders are still going out, and the 30/- per ton is still being paid.  I got into communication with Ballybeg yesterday.  I asked them were the farmers in my district now entitled to the subsidy. They said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that they were not entitled to the subsidy, that they had heard nothing about it.  They had heard nothing about it, yesterday.  I consider that it is my duty as representing my constituents and the farmers of my area to see that my <Col N="2017" /> farmers will get the same crack of the whip and the same subsidy as is given to anyone else.  I cannot understand a Minister of State, coming here and, like the cow that kicked the bucket of milk, upsetting the whole business as he has done ever since this subsidy was brought in.  Every farmer, anyone who has anything to do with agriculture, knows that during the months of March, April and May there is more lime put on the land than there is in the other nine put together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read for the House the Minister's statement when he intervened in the debate on the 18th April.  I put down the following question to him for answer to-day:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (1) what arrangements, if any, have been made by his Department with the Irish Sugar Company, Limited, for the delivery and spreading of ground limestone under his subsidy scheme by the company's lime spreaders; (2) if he is aware that this company have about 80 lime-speading lorries&rdquo;&mdash; that should be 170, thank God&mdash;&ldquo;that they spread the lime at 5/- per ton, that farmers using these lime-speading facilities are deprived of any benefit under his subsidy scheme, and, if so.  (3) if he is prepared, <Col N="2018" /> failing any agreement between the sugar company and himself, to allow the farmer making use of this method of delivery and spreading of lime the amount of the delivery subsidy on production of the sugar company's receipt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would be a very simple way out of it, if this wrangle is going on.  I got the following reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Discussions are taking place between the Irish Sugar Company and Córas Iompair Éireann with a view to enabling farmers who purchase lime from the sugar company and who desire to avail themselves of the company's spreading service to participate in the subsidy scheme.  I am confident that a satisfactory arrangement will be reached.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the reply I got on the 2nd May, but I was told on the 18th April that everything was working perfectly smoothly.</P>
    <P>A fortnight after, the agreement has not yet been made between the Sugar Company and Córas Iompair Éireann. I do not know what brings Córas Iompair Éireann into this game at all, to be quite honest about it.  The lime spreaders belong to the Sugar Company. There was a perfectly smooth-working machine there for the last couple of years, under which we got lime delivered and spread on the land by the Sugar Company.  I cannot see the purpose of this bullocking in by Córas Iompair Éireann, unless it is that Córas Iompair Éireann want  grab as much as possible of Millar's £1,000,000.  That is my reading of it anyway; I may be wrong and I hope I am wrong.  Where the Minister found quarries working, ground lime stone being produced, and the lime being taken 40, 50, 60 or 70 miles to be spread over the farmers' fields, I cannot see why the Minister should come in with messers like Córas Iompair Éireann to mess up the job.  The Minister had the experience that we had as beet growers of the activities of Córas Iompair Éireann and he knows that they have enough to do in their own particular line without meddling in lime particularly having regard to the fact that there was a perfectly smooth-working machine there already.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply to me was that discussions are taking place between the Irish Sugar Company and Córas Iompair Éireann.  I am aware of Deputy Flanagan's anxiety that as little of this as possible should get out but these are the facts.</P>

      <P>What has happened is that thousands of tons of that lime have gone out since the subsidy was announced here by the Minister, and announced down the country by Mr. Millar, and these unfortunate farmers are deprived of that subsidy. They have to pay the full amount for their lime.  And for what?  So that the Minister could bring in here certain proposals.  I admit they might be needed in some parts of the country and I would be sorry to deprive any portion of the country of the facilities they can get, but I cannot understand this idea of the Minister's coming along with lime spreaders to be purchased and 170 lime spreaders being put off the road by the activities of the Minister.  There is a big difference between getting your lime delivered on the side of the road at 16/- per ton and having to pay 30/- a ton for it.  There is a wide difference between having a lorry coming along to within half a mile of your house, tipping up seven, eight, or ten tons of lime, and your being compelled to have a man there to shovel that lime into a horse butt, and then trying to scatter it in the field.  I am amazed at the Minister harbouring that idea for one moment.  I would suggest to him that he should not be like the cow that gave a bucket of milk and then kicked the bucket and spilled it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This money, after all, is not the money of the Irish taxpayer.  It is a grant from America to the farmers, and the farmers are entitled to it. <Col N="2020" /> Why that money should be dished out in such a manner that Córas Iompair Éireann are going to grab 75 per cent. of it I do not know.  The Government should get some other way of subsidising Córas Iompair Éireann apart from that.  That is briefly the position in which I find myself in this matter. I am glad that even now, at the eleventh hour, I have dragged from the Minister this much anyway: that my farmers in Cork County and in Kerry, Limerick and Waterford who have got this lime from the sugar company and who, to their credit, have continued taking it from them, without any subsidy, are now going to get the subsidy and the share of the American money to which they are entitled.  The idea of depriving them of that because they were using up-to-date methods was a perfectly ridiculous attitude for the Minister to take up in this House.</P>
    <P>I would not dream of raising this matter on the Adjournment were it not for two things.  The first was the untrue statement made by the Minister to me in this House on the 18th April.  It is hardly worth while bothering about it now, but I would not allow a Minister belonging to any Party to get away with an untrue statement of that description in this House.  I wanted to nail it and I have nailed it.  The second thing is that time is going on and my unfortunate people in Cork are bearing the brunt and losing money.  Worse than that, they do not know where they are.  They are nervous of putting out lime, nervous of taking advantage of the scheme.  I would say that you would practically have at least another third as much lime put out if the Minister had come in here the first day and said what any Minister would have said to the sugar company: &ldquo;You have perfect machinery for that work and we will give the subsidy on lime you distribute.&rdquo; That was a very simple way out of it instead of sending the sugar company to Córas Iompair Éireann to know what Córas Iompair Éireann would charge for doing this work. What is going to become of the drivers of the trucks employed by the sugar company?  Are they going to be replaced by employees of Córas Iompair Éireann?  Is the whole machinery going <Col N="2021" /> to be wrecked in order to gratify this departmental whim in an endeavour to cover up the losses of Córas Iompair Éireann by an arrangement between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture leading to a further robbery of the farmers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is one minute left.  I just want to ask one question.  I understand this subsidy is now being made available on lime distributed by the sugar company.  They have a very fine fleet of lorries suitable for this purpose.  There are other firms manufacturing lime which have also their own distributors and I should like to ask if the subsidy will be made available on lime distributed by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry's conduct and language are as mischievous as those of a Gibraltar monkey.  It is a new departure when Deputy Corry assumes the baronial &ldquo;my&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;my farmers in County Cork&rdquo;.  Since when did the farmers of County Cork belong to Deputy Corry?  &ldquo;My farmers!&rdquo;  God knows the farmers of this country will have sunk to a low level, the day they belong to Deputy Martin Corry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts of this are that the sugar company and Córas Iompair Éireann have been in discussion about this whole business of distributing lime ground at Ballybeg.  The facts are that, owing to circumstances of which Deputy Corry has full knowledge, there were certain unavoidable delays in connection with those discussions owing to the unavoidable absence, consequent on a protracted period of hard work and the enjoyment of a holiday for the first time in six years by one of the managerial persons concerned, so that it was not possible to bring the discussions <Col N="2022" /> for the co-ordination of the work of Córas Iompair Éireann and Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann to a conclusion as rapidly as was hoped.  Certainly, I consider that any delay that has taken place is no reflection on either of the two distinguished gentlemen who were responsible for the negotiations, and it ill befits Deputy Corry to hold them up to public odium in this House because either of them has done for this country more in one month than Deputy Corry has done in the whole of the 63 years that he has been stumping Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the Ballybeg lime will now be available to those who want it spread on their land at, I understand, 20/- per ton. If there is anybody who has drawn lime from Ballybeg between the period of the initiation of the scheme and to-day, I understand he will be facilitated in getting from the sugar company a refund of whatever excess charge was made as from the date of the initiation of the scheme and to-day. Deputy Corry knows that.  I told him that earlier to-day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He is naturally irritated and exasperated by the fact that it has been possible for this Government to make available to our people everywhere abundant supplies of calcium for their soil.  The Ballybeg limestone was there for the last 10,000 years, and for 16 of those 10,000 years Fianna Fáil was the Government of this country, but if Fianna Fáil was the Government of this country for the next 10,000 years the Ballybeg limestone would continue to be covered by fossils as it had been covered for the last 10,000 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position to-day is that the limestone is now being quarried out of Ballybeg.  It is being ground there, and carted to the farmer's gate and <Col N="2023" /> spread upon his land, not only in Ballybeg, but in every county in Ireland.  That is what makes Deputy Corry and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party irate, vicious, vindictive, disappointed and desirous of making mischief.  It is about all they have ever been good at.  Now it does not matter what they say or do, the lime is going to go out and the land of every farmer in this country is going to enjoy the benefit of this scheme. Whether Deputy Corry wants it or not it does not matter a fiddle-de-dee.  It will be the same price for everyone, and nobody will be asked what political party he belongs to, and no one will be told that, if he licks the feet of the Fianna Fáil wheel horse, he will get it before his neighbour gets it, or that he will get it cheaper than his neighbour gets it and nobody will be called upon in the middle of the night and warned that if he does not vote right in this election he will get no subsidy.  <i>(Interruptions).</i> I remember the time when our people in every general election were warned in respect of every scheme operated by the Government of this country that if they were not prepared, corruptly, to purchase the favour of Fianna Fáil T.D.s, they would be denied their lawful rights under those schemes.</P>

It is for everybody, and that is what has made Deputy Corry and Deputy Ó Briain so mad about it.  Well, they can get as mad as wet hens and go down to Cork and Limerick &mdash; Deputy Corry in English, because that is all he will be able to do, and Deputy Ó Briain in English and in Irish, and begin &ldquo;A Chara dhíl,&rdquo; and end &ldquo;Mise le meas mór.&rdquo;  The fact, however, remains that, so long as this scheme is operated by this Government, it will be operated honestly.  If it ever falls into the hands of those whom Deputy Corry supports, it will be operated corruptly, viciously and vindictively.</P>
