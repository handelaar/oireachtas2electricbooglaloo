      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the date upon which the Report of the Central Bank in proof form was first communicated to the members of the Government.</P>

      <P>As reading is slow and difficult for me, may I ask permission for my Parliamentary Secretary to read my replies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Deputy's attention to a reply given by me in this House on Wednesday last, in the course of which I said: &ldquo;I consider that it would not be proper or in the public interest to establish a practice by which particulars of matters submitted to the Government could be elicited by questions in this House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this particular case, however, I am prepared, exceptionally, to inform the Deputy that the Report of the Central Bank of Ireland for the year ended 31st March, 1951, which is no doubt the report to which the Deputy refers, was circulated to the members of the Government on the 15th October, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document has been referred to as having been circulated in &ldquo;proof&rdquo; form.  It was circulated in that form with a view to minimising delay in complying with the statutory requirement that the report should be presented to each House of the Oireachtas &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; upon its receipt by the Minister for Finance.  The circulation of the report in proof form did <Col N="636" /> not, of course, imply that the text of the report was being submitted for the approval or sanction of the Government; it was circulated to the members of the Government merely for information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether, in view of the subsequent repudiation of the report by the Government, he took any steps to inform the chairman and directors of the Central Bank that it was the intention of the Government publicly to repudiate the contents of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank is an independent body with its own duties and responsibilities.  The Government is independent of the Central Bank and can adopt its own policy. Any question of conversations between the two bodies is a matter for each to determine for itself.  I do not know that there have been any conversations. The Minister for Finance may have had a conversation, but I am not at this moment able to say.  I have no knowledge as to whether the Minister for Finance either did or did not speak to the Governor of the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Taoiseach's answer to my supplementary question that, in fact, the Government took no steps to inform the Central Bank that it was proposed to repudiate its report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank has a statutory duty imposed upon it to safeguard the integrity of the currency and to publish its report.  It is an independent body, just as a commission is, and the Government, with respect to any reports it gets, can take any action that it sees fit to take without giving any notice, if it so chooses. As I say, that report was circulated for information.</P>

      <P>A copy of the resolution, adopted by the Borough Council of Sligo, to which the Deputy evidently refers, was received in my Department from the town clerk of Sligo on the 9th instant.  The town clerk was informed on the following day that, as the subject-matter of the resolution was one for examination, in the first instance, by the Minister for Finance, it had been referred to that Minister for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the practice followed by some of his Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries under which they utilise their ministerial offices and free postal facilities to call reorganisation meetings of the Fianna Fáil cumann in their constituencies and whether this is not considered an abuse of these privileges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of such a practice.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries and find that, in one case, on a few occasions, through inadvertence, the facilities referred to by the Deputy were, in fact, used to call reorganisation meetings of a political Party.  I am informed that the moment the impropriety of this was adverted to, it was discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Social Welfare, as late as October this year, forwarded a stencilled circular and a ticket for a sweep on a race to be run in January; that the ticket is headed &ldquo;Westmeath Comhairle Dáil Ceanntair Fianna Fáil&rdquo;; that this circular was sent to a person who at the time was dead, but who, prior to his demise, was never a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, and stated: &ldquo;I am sending you a sweep card for our annual sweep, and I shall be very grateful if you will take same and dispose of it.  As you know we have fought two elections, a local in September and a general in May, and we are very depleted in funds. Thanking you for your past support&rdquo;; that the postmark on the outside of the envelope is the official Government <Col N="638" /> postmark under the Department of Social Welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire whether the Taoiseach is aware that Department of Social Welfare envelopes and stamps have been used on a document signed by a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party who is neither a Minister nor a Parliamentary Secretary, and have been issued; is he further aware that Department of Social Welfare stationery is going around more constituencies than one in an attempt to organise Fianna Fáil cumann?  I can give the Taoiseach the information.  It is a disgraceful thing.</P>

In explanation of this decision, Córas Iompair Éireann states that the Scotch tender was substantially below the lowest tender submitted by any Irish firm, even allowing for payment of duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the town of Balbriggan is very seriously hit by large-scale unemployment of workers engaged in the hosiery mills; if he will state whether the importation of goods from foreign sources is contributing to this situation; and, if so, what steps he is taking, if any, to secure the re-employment of these workers whose sole dependence is the hosiery industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is some unemployment in a hosiery mill in Balbriggan.  Trade and shipping statistics do not suggest that this position is mainly due to imports from external sources.  Articles of the type made in Balbriggan are subject on importation to tariffs or quantitative restrictions.  The quantitative restrictions now in force amount to virtual prohibition of imports.  In the case of the articles subject to tariff the imports are not abnormal.  As well as the existing tariffs on garments the factories now get the indirect benefit of the tariff on knitted fabric imposed by the Government on November 6th.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that all necessary measures will be taken to maintain maximum employment in the hosiery industry, and to offset the effects on employment of the temporary recession in trade which is now affecting sections of the clothing industry in this and other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the position in Balbriggan cannot be described as normal?  Not only is there not partial unemployment in Balbriggan but there is in fact half of the total of 400 workers unemployed.  The other 200 are on short time and are working only three days per week.  This is the main industry in the town and has been for the past couple of centuries. Is the Minister further aware that citizens have written to me giving me details of purchases made in the centre of the City of Dublin of articles such as socks, which bear a trade mark from Hong Kong?  I have an example here and can show it to the Minister. Is the Minister further aware that there is a general belief that the reason for this recession in trade is due to imports, and to some extent to stockpiling? In the light of that, will he consider taking some steps to control the release of such imported stockpiled goods as may be there, in order to ensure that the Balbriggan situation will return to normal as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the situation to which the Deputy refers applies to only one hosiery factory in Balbriggan and that, in fact, some of the workers laid off in that factory have been employed by another hosiery factory there.  As far as hose and half hose are concerned, there were no abnormal imports and no stockpiling. In fact, imports of hose and half hose this year up to the end of September were no higher than they were last year.  If that situation should change, I am prepared to take steps to deal with it.  The indications are that the tariff now in operation is effective so far as controlling imports is concerned. Undoubtedly, there is here, as in other countries, some recession in trade, and, consequently, there is some danger that the surplus products of other countries may be dumped here at cut prices, but in the particular lines in which this country is engaged no evidence of that has emerged from our trade and shipping statistics.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether it is a fact that his Department gave permission to a Major Aldridge, Mount-falcon, Ballina, County Mayo, to place obstructions in the River Moy, the placing of which has caused excessive flooding in the area; and, if so, the date on which such permission was given and if he will now issue instructions to Major Aldridge to remove these obstructions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. Following an investigation in September, 1949, of a complaint which they received in this matter, the Commissioners of Public Works were advised that there was no evidence of any obstruction having been created in the river by Major Aldridge which might cause the flooding of any land.  Consequently, there was no infringement of the relevant provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, and the commissioners were not empowered to take any action in the matter.</P>

    <P>It is, of course, as natural and right to display the Green, White and Orange in Enniskillen as the Union Jack in Leeds or the Stars and Stripes <Col N="674" /> in Philadelphia.  I am satisfied that there is a growing recognition of the common interests of Irishmen by men of all classes and creeds in the Six Counties and I hope they will soon be as successful in persuading the inner circles in Belfast to adopt the same adult and modern approach to the display of the National Flag as they have in other matters recently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the reports referred to by the Deputy.  These reports, like all others issued by the agency, are solely the responsibility of the board of directors. I have made inquiries from the agency, however, and I understand that these reports were furnished by the local correspondent of the Irish News Agency, a well-known Limerick journalist; that they were queried by the Dublin editorial staff of the agency and, having been confirmed by the correspondent, were issued.  It subsequently transpired that the reports <Col N="676" /> contained an error, the incorrect attribution of a statement to the City Manager of Limerick.  Immediately this error was discovered, the agency severely reprimanded the correspondent. The circumstances were explained to the city manager, and the agency expressed its regret to him. Reporting to the city council on the matter at its meeting on 12th November, the city manager concluded:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish News Agency has apologised and I am satisfied that it was not really their fault.  They have since acted most gentlemanly in regard to the matter and I am quite satisfied.&rdquo;</P>

Does the Minister suggest, if he has read the report to which I refer, that this report, issued by the Irish News Agency to foreign newspapers, contains merely an error?  Does he not agree that it is one of the most scandalous products that ever went out of this country in relation to this country, apart from being entirely inaccurate and without foundation?</P>

If the agency is to be successful, if it is to get a fair chance, it has to be removed further from the Government rather than under the day-to-day administration of the Minister.  I told the House in answer to a question early on that I was going to give every chance to this agency to become a <Col N="677" /> success and one of the things that would kill it would be interference from day to day by the Minister or by anybody else.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that tenants on his Department's estate at Billeragh, Arriglen, Kilworth, hold their lands under a five years' lease and that, on the expiration of each five year period, their rents are increased with a consequent deterrent to good husbandry; and, if so, if he will enable these tenants to purchase their holdings by the introduction, if necessary, of legislation for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the State lands at Billeragh, Kilworth, administered by my Department, are at present let in lots to eight tenants for a period of five years ending on the 31st December, 1954.  The lands in question have <Col N="687" /> always been let by competitive tendering after being duly advertised as is the practice in the case of State lands. As they are subject to the provisions of the State Lands Act, 1924, they cannot be alienated.  It is not intended to introduce legislation to provide for the sale of these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>These tenants have been there for the last 40 years at least.  Only last year the rent, in one case, was increased from £4 to £18 and in another case it was increased from £18 to £23. Would not the Minister agree that under those circumstances it is undesirable for those tenants to make any attempt to improve their holdings? Does the Minister consider it a desirable condition of affairs to have 400 or 500 acres used in that way for the last 40 years and would he take steps to bring in legislation&mdash;if legislation is necessary&mdash;to deal with the matter?</P>

Arrangements have been made for the payment to Messrs John Collins and John Llewellen, pioneers, Fermoy Aerodrome, of a revised rate of £3 9s. 6d. a week with effect from the 10th instant.  The rate payable to pioneers in Cork City is £5 12s. 0d. a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state why, in view of the fact that 80 per cent. of the children attending Falcarragh National School, County Donegal, are in receipt of the £5 Gaeltacht grant, the school is not classified as a Fíor-Ghaeltacht school, thereby depriving students attending the school of the opportunity of competing for Gaeltacht and preparatory scholarships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch) (for the Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the rules and regulations for national schools it is necessary that three conditions be fulfilled before a school may be scheduled as being situated in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, viz:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  that it be situated in a district where Irish is generally spoken as the language of the homes;</P>
      <P>(2)  that a considerable proportion of the children coming to school for the first time know Irish only or know Irish better than English; and</P>
      <P>(3)  that instruction in the various subjects of the school programme (other than English) be given entirely through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>An examination of the position in the case of Scoil Cheathrú Cheanainn, Falcarragh, which is presumably the school to which the Deputy refers, was made in the school year 1947-48.  As a result of the investigations then made it was decided that the inclusion of the school in the list of Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>I have now arranged for the matter to be investigated again and I will advise the Deputy of the result as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> I have to point out, however, that the Deputy is not correct in implying that pupils of this school are deprived of an opportunity of competing at the preparatory college entrance examination. They are not eligible to compete for the special places reserved thereat for pupils of schools scheduled as Fíor-Ghaeltacht, but these special places constitute only 25 per cent. of the total number of places available annually in the colleges, and a further 25 per cent. of the total number of places is reserved for candidates who obtain 85 per cent. or over in oral Irish at the examination irrespective of the scheduling of the school attended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will provide transport during the winter to bring children from the Clonmeen and Clonlack areas to Rhode National School, County Offaly, as many children have to walk long distances to school and the roads are bad and without shelter from the weather.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I have received no representations in regard to the question of providing a transport service for pupils attending this school and, in the absence of particulars of children, who, it is stated, have to walk long distances to Rhode School, I am not in a position to say whether State aid could be granted, under the regulations, towards the cost of a transport service.</P>
      <P>On receipt of an application from the manager of Rhode National School or from the interested local parties giving the names and ages of the children and the distances of their respective homes from the nearest national school, I will have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>Certain arrangements in connection with the evidence of title to the site offered by the manager for this new school have yet to be made before the Department will be in a position to sanction a grant towards the cost of erecting the school.  I expect that these arrangements will be completed at an early date.</P>
      <P>When a grant has been sanctioned it will be a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works to have working drawings and a specification prepared and to take such other steps as may be required to enable the new school to be erected.  While I am unable to say at present when building operations will be commenced, there will be no avoidable delay in having the case brought to the stage at which a contract can be placed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state (a) the number of retired national teachers alive on 31st October, 1951, who were not granted a retiring gratuity; (b) the sum of money required to pay those teachers this gratuity and (c) whether it is intended to pay the gratuity to all pensioned teachers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) It is estimated that the cost of providing a retiring gratuity to those 2,716 pensioners on the basis of that granted to teachers who retired after <Col N="692" /> the 31st December, 1949, would be about £1,090,000.</P>
    <P>(c) As I have already indicated in reply to a similar query on this point on the 9th instant, careful consideration is being given to the representations made by and on behalf of the pensioners that they should receive a retiring gratuity and an announcement of the decision which will be reached in the matter will not be long delayed.</P>

      <P>I ask permission to raise a matter in relation to the reporting of the Dáil proceedings on the 7th November, 1951.  During the course of the debate on the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill, 1951, the Minister for Industry and Commerce used the words &ldquo;&mdash;you cannot develop the resources of this country by credit. You must do it by cash!&rdquo; That remark was made at 5.50 p.m.  I noted the time at which it was made for ease of reference subsequently.  I find, however, that the words, as spoken, are not reported.  Towards the end of column 320 I do find the words &ldquo;&mdash;you cannot develop the resources of a country without cash.&rdquo;  In view of the importance of the matter under discussion, I would like to know what are the circumstances under which the words, as reported, are not in the debate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me permission to make this personal explanation.  Following a question of mine on Thursday last, Deputy Mulcahy and others voiced a strong protest.  I wish to inform the House, and to have it recorded, that, in asking this question, I did not intend to suggest, nor did I at any time think, that, in accepting this allowance, Deputy Norton acted in any way improperly, or used the money for any purpose other than that intended by the Act. Had I tried to create any such false impression, I consider that it would have been my duty to avail of the first possible opportunity to withdraw the statement and to apologise to the Deputy and to the House.  I state without reserve that I never intended making any such suggestion, nor did I think my words capable of any such interpretation until I read in the Official Report the statement made by Deputy Oliver Flanagan at column 514. In asking, at column 450, the question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is the Minister aware that when this Bill was under discussion, Deputy Norton said that under no consideration would he ever touch a penny of this money.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> I was simply referring to the following statement by Deputy Norton (Volume 73, column 938):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a provision in this Bill to which I would like to make a personal reference.  It is the one which provides for an allowance of £800 per annum to the Leader of the second Party and £500 per annum to the Leader of the third Party in the Dáil.  So far as I am concerned, as one who would be entitled to benefit under that section, I do not want to handle one farthing of that sum of money and I do not propose to handle one farthing of it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>My name has been mentioned and perhaps you, Sir, will permit me to make a brief statement.  I am obliged to the Deputy for having corrected the misrepresentations of which his remark was capable on the last occasion and I want to say now that never since the allowance was paid did I handle it, did I administer it or profit by it by as much as one penny and that fulfils the declaration I made when I made the speech on the Bill to which the Deputy has just referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last Thursday, I was referring to the steps which this country must take if it is to strengthen its economic fabric in a manner that will ensure a good standard of life to our people and, at the same time, enable the nation to withstand the shocks from which a small country like this can never be insulated, having regard <Col N="697" /> to its dependence on supplies from overseas.</P>
      <P>I indicated last week that, so far as the Labour Party was concerned, we were prepared to support a policy of the fullest possible expansion of our industrial resources, that we would support a policy which aimed at the production here of every class of commodity which could be produced in reason and that in pursuance of that policy we would use tariffs, quotas and even exclusion Orders to give native industries an opportunity of growing and developing to a condition in which they could withstand outside competition. But I suggested that where the nation comes to the assistance of an industry, or where it comes to the assistance of a group of industrialists and imposes tariffs, quotas or other restrictions whereby the community stand between the industry and competition, fierce or unfair, from outside sources, then the community are entitled to ensure that these tariffs, quotas and restrictions are administered in such a way that the industry avails of them for the purpose of producing efficiently the commodities which the industry was established to manufacture, that these goods should be of high-class quality and that the industry should aim at supplying not 10, 20, 30 or 50 per cent. of the demand of the home market, but should have placed on it an obligation to produce the entire quantity of goods required by the home market and, if possible, find an export market for its commodities as well.</P>
      <P>The weakness in our tariff policy over the past 30 years has been that we were content to put on a tariff or quota and see what happened.  Those who took the trouble to see what happened will have found, in many cases, that the industry which was helped by a tariff or a quota was content to supply a fraction of the goods demanded by the home market and never took the necessary steps to energise itself sufficiently to supply the entire demands of the Irish market.  Many people were content to say: &ldquo;We are doing nicely, we are producing £20,000 or £50,000 worth of goods;&rdquo; when the home market was capable of absorbing goods to the extent of £100,000 or £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="698" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That has got us where we are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we have to ensure, that the industry is not merely protected by tariffs and quotas but that the manufacturer must know that it is fundamental Government policy&mdash;and I would like to see agreement on government policy in this respect&mdash;that he cannot fall back with a feeling of inertia, thinking: &ldquo;I am doing all right;&rdquo; but that instead the industry must produce as much as it is possible to produce and the ceiling which they must aim at is to supply the entire home market.</P>
      <P>We have not in the past imposed that obligation on the industries which were helped by tariffs.  If we are to make any real progress in the way of curtailing imports of commodities which we can produce here, we must impose on the industrialist, protected as he is by the community against unfair competition from the outside, an obligation to produce sufficient goods for the entire home market.  We must do something more than that.  Where we are importing a substantial quantity of goods of a particular kind and where the home market for these commodities is such as to enable a native industry to manufacture the goods, then we must&mdash;through the aegis of the State, if necessary&mdash;establish factories here to manufacture these goods, not merely to curtail imports but primarily&mdash;and this is the vital approach to the problem&mdash;to provide employment for our people, wealth for the nation and to bring under control in the foreseeable future, with an eye to its ultimate eradication, the evil of emigration which is taking such a heavy toll of our people to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any policy which aims at strengthening the economic fabric of the nation by producing the maximum quantity of goods at home here, goods produced efficiently in decent factories where decent wages are paid and decent conditions are observed, will have the wholehearted support of this Party. But it is essential if we are to ensure the success of that policy that there must be constant supervision by the State of the manner in which the tariff is used by the industry.  The <Col N="699" /> tariff must not be regarded by industrialists as an armchair in which they can rest and count their profits.  It must not be a buttress for inertia or laziness.  It must be regarded as a springboard, as something available only for a limited period of time to enable the industry to get on its feet, to perfect its method of manufacture, to train its workers and ultimately to be able to supply the entire home market against competition from any outside concern.</P>
    <P>If, well and good, any unfair competition should develop from outside, either through the utilisation of cheap labour or by a manipulation of currency or exchange regulations, such as might damage or undermine entirely the fabric of an Irish industry, then at all times the State must step in and protect the Irish industry against competition of that character.</P>
    <P>If we are going to build an economy here that stands a reasonable prospect of insulating itself against the worst shocks produced by international crises, then we can do it only in three ways&mdash;by the fullest exploitation of our natural resources and our industrial possibilities, by the fullest exploitation of our agricultural potential and by the utilisation to the full of the credit resources which this country possesses in the form of sleeping money, so as to ensure the inauguration and the completion of schemes of national development which will enrich the national estate, provide employment and give our country the characteristics of a first-class nation.</P>
    <P>I have dealt so far with the industrial approach.  I now wish to refer to the potentialities which lie within the land, and indeed the climate also.  At present approximately 50 per cent. of the people gainfully employed in this country get a livelihood in agriculture. Agriculture is our main source of employment and, in fact, our main and probably most enduring source of wealth production.  This country is not a dust bowl.  This country possesses some of the finest land in Europe to-day and it is simply criminal if with these possibilities of exploitation of the land before us we neglect the opportunity <Col N="700" /> of exploiting that land for the benefit of the nation and of those who own the land.  Agriculture to-day, while it is substantially better than it has ever been before&mdash;there is not an intelligent farmer who does not know that fact&mdash;is still capable of considerable expansion and of earning a better livelihood for the nation as a whole and for those engaged in the industry.</P>
    <P>I think that nobody will attempt to deny that there is scope for improvement and scope for State assistance in every branch of agriculture.  One thing, I think, upon which we can get agreement&mdash;and the old controversies can be relegated to the limbo of the past&mdash;is that a policy of encouraging tillage is not a policy which aims at the annihilation of the live-stock industry and similarly that it is possible for the nation to have a vigorous policy of live-stock production side by side with an extensive area of tillage, that, in other words, tillage is not the enemy of live-stock production and live-stock production is not the enemy of tillage.</P>
    <P>In those countries where there is a balanced type of agricultural economy, we have seen that live-stock production has been mixed with tillage with the best possible results from the point of view of agricultural income and with the steadiest kind of employment from the standpoint of the agricultural worker and generally with a balanced policy which gives the nation a more stable agricultural structure.  We must aim to-day at putting agriculture in an even better position than it is in so as to reap the rewards of a fully-developed agricultural economy.  We must do that firstly to produce more wealth, to provide more employment and above all to provide more regular employment for the agricultural worker class, a class which, unfortunately, in the past and even now has to withstand the misery of long periods of idleness and interrupted employment.</P>
    <P>If we are ever to put agriculture in the position which it can legitimately attain we can do that only by remedying the basic difficulty in agriculture to-day which is the fact that it is grossly undercapitalised.  The land of this country is probably the most undercapitalised land of any country <Col N="701" /> in Europe.  When we compare with the capital employed here the capital employed in the land of those countries which compete with us in the British market we find that our agricultural industry starts in the production race severely handicapped because it has not invested in it the financial resources which have been poured into the land of other countries.  What the Irish farmer must recognise&mdash;and he should recognise it to-day more than ever&mdash;is that the best place for his money is not in the bank but in his own land because he can get from his own land, by the investment there of his money, dividends which he can never get under a banking system. He has got, therefore, to be taught that he should put as much of his money as possible in his land because it will pay the best dividends in the long run.  Where farmers are handicapped by lack of money the State should help the farmer, help him because he has it within his power to earn a substantial income for the whole nation and to strengthen the entire fabric of the nation.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which the farmer can be helped, but there are three ways in which he must be helped at the outset.  If we are ever to give agriculture the place it should have in our national affairs and money earning capacity the farmer must be encouraged to utilise the land for the purpose for which land is intended, namely, tillage and the production of food for our people.  That is the natural purpose of land and land should be utilised to the limit for that purpose. Not merely must we improve the areas under tillage but we must evolve a long-term tillage policy which will enable the farmer to foresee the future and to plan with some certainty about the remuneration he will get for the crops he produces.</P>
    <P>We must do more than that.  We must improve the grasslands of this country because the grasslands represent the fodder consumed by our live stock and the better our grasslands the better our live stock.  It is impossible to imagine that you can develop live stock which will command the highest prices if that stock is fed on <Col N="702" /> impoverished lands.  An essential part of our programme for the expansion of agriculture must be to effect a substantial improvement in our grasslands. Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture gave very considerable attention to that problem and commendable progress was made from the standpoint both of improving our grasslands and improving our land generally so that it could produce good pasture.</P>
    <P>Over and above the increase in tillage and the improvement of our grasslands we must take steps and take them hurriedly to improve our live stock.  The biggest blister on this country to-day in an agricultural sense and a financial sense is the 300-gallon hungry cow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Until we get rid of the hungry 300-gallon cow we will never make any real progress in agriculture or in our dairying industry.  We have now, thanks to the 300-gallon cow, reached the situation in which this generation can boast that you could not sell Irish butter on any market in Europe.  So long as we are content to see the 300-gallon cow roam the fields and produce milk at the cost of feeding this 300-gallon producer then we will produce milk and butter at a price which nobody in Europe will pay.  You cannot sell Irish butter on any market in Europe because nobody will pay the price which the butter costs to produce from the 300-gallon cow.  Much affection as we may have for live stock, we ought to recognise that the 300-gallon cow is uneconomic from the point of view of the farmer and from the point of view of the nation and that an effort should be made, with State aid, to eliminate the low-yielding cow so as to produce live stock which will again bring our dairying industry to the level it once occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present and foreseeable world conditions, agriculture has a bright prospect before it.  We are at the door of a country with a population of 50,000,000, while we have in this country a population in all of 4,500,000. We are at the door of a country which <Col N="703" /> is a non-food-producing country, relatively. We have got a market there for the needs of 50,000,000 and we have overseas markets in Europe as well. If one studies the reports of the various United Nations organisations from the standpoint of the food potential and the requirements of Europe and the world, one sees clearly that, no matter in what other respect there may be depression or recession, there will be no depression from the point of view of a sustained demand for agricultural products and dairying products generally.</P>
    <P>There is a bright future before the farming community in this country.  We are economic imbeciles if we do not take advantage of these possibilities. We can take advantage of them only in one way&mdash;by recognising that the methods of yesterday and even of to-day will not be sufficient to energise the industry, to capture the markets which are there waiting for us if we will only reorganise and revitalise many limping sections of our agricultural and dairying industry.  Efforts were made by the last Government with commendable success in that field within the past three years.  It is work which requires patience, and even impatience with unsatisfactory methods of agricultural husbandry.  But it is work which, properly tackled and brought to fruition, will yield substantial dividends to the nation in the long run.</P>
    <P>As far as this Party is concerned, we are prepared to back any forward policy in industry and in agriculture which will develop and strengthen the economic fabric of the nation, which will energise our agricultural industry, which will produce more wealth on the land and from the land, which will market the goods in the most efficient possible way and which will add to the national wealth by adding to the volume of production and by accelerating our standards of productivity.  In the field of production and in the field of productivity in agriculture, there is an enormous lag to be made up.  While the volume of our agricultural produce and our agricultural exports has increased, unfortunately we are still lagging behind in the volume of production <Col N="704" /> which the land is capable of giving.  We must insist that the trends and the methods which produced that condition of affairs shall be altered in order to give us a greater volume of production, a greater volume of agricultural wealth, and enable us to utilise the unique trading position which we have in order to capture external markets for our agricultural products and to buy with our surplus agricultural products the commodities which it is not possible for us to produce here.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate, the Central Bank has figured largely.  I have already made some references to the Report of the Central Bank, but there are aspects of the Central Bank's activities or inactivity on which attention should be focussed.  It has been revealed in the report of the bank that the income which is earned on £80,000,000 invested in Britain is only £400,000, approximately.  In other words, our £80,000,000 invested in the British banking system yielded us an interest of ½ of 1 per cent. £80,000,000 of our money was handed over to Britain at ½ per cent. interest; that is what we earned on the £80,000,000 referred to in the Central Bank's Report.  While we are satisfied to lend our money at ½ per cent. to British banking institutions, we charge our own people 4 and 5 per cent. if they seek to borrow money even for worth-while purposes.  Does anybody know anything dafter than that&mdash;that you lend your own money to Britain at ½ of 1 per cent. interest and you charge your own people 4 or 5 per cent. for the money which they need to engage in worth-while national activities?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, who personally knows very little about finance or the Central Bank or any of these complicated activities, attempted to say that this was due to the necessity for maintaining a high degree of liquidity on the part of the Central Bank.  But, if you look at the Central Bank's holdings now and then look at the Central Bank's holdings five or ten years ago, you will see that their investments of this high liquidity character have jumped enormously in recent years, jumped from, I think, <Col N="705" /> about 5 per cent. to 20 per cent. of the money deposited with the bank.  But if 5 per cent. at one time or 7½ per cent. at another time or 4 per cent. at another time was a sufficient holding, how does 20 per cent. become so essential now?  Speaking for this Party in the matter, I believe that we have got to face up to the problem which reveals itself in lending £80,000,000 to British banks at ½ per cent. interest and charging our own people 4 to 5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>It is to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a banking transaction and the British Government gets its hands on it ultimately.  However, either the banks or the British Government give us ½ per cent. on our money invested in Britain and we charge our own people 4 or 5 per cent.  Why should we regard the British Government as a better target for the repayment of our money than our own people?  A statement was made in the British House of Commons the other day by no less a person than the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the British position had now reached such a stage that their entire foreign investments would be exhausted at the present rate of imports and exports.  He said that the gap in the balance of payments was approximately £1,000,000,000; that there was £1,000,000,000 in the kitty, which would stop the haemorrage for about 12 months, but if they went on spending as they were spending and importing and exporting as they were, at the end of 12 months the kitty would be empty and there would be nothing to stop the hæmorrhages which might be expected in the future.</P>
      <P>To remedy that situation the British Government has decided to cut imports by £350,000,000 which at best can postpone the evil day for a further year and four months unless in the meantime Britain can persuade the United States of America to agree on the convertibility of sterling or unless the United States of America will again step in with Marshall Aid, mutual aid or some other financial injection of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> Why do we imagine in these circumstances that it is better national policy for us to lend the British Government money at ½ per cent. interest, while, if a man wants to build a house in Dublin, in Longford or in any other part of the country we insist that he pay 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. for the money he borrows for that purpose? The present position in respect of housing is typical of what is happening in many other directions, but housing will illustrate the position for the purpose of my argument now.</P>
    <P>At present no local authority can borrow money under 4 per cent. for housing.  Some of them find it hard to get money at 4 per cent.  While they cannot get it at less than 4 per cent. the Central Bank, the organisation created by us, is lending money at ½ per cent. to the British Government. I want to see that policy corrected.  I want to see that policy reversed.  I want to see us make up our minds definitely and deliberately, notwithstanding old tenets and old prejudices, that we should utilise our money for the purpose of producing in Ireland the services and the commodities we need for our own people.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a house.  At present, if a local authority borrows £1,000 to build a house, it pays approximately 5 per cent. or 4½ per cent. for that money and that local authority will ultimately repay £2,000 in respect of the £1,000 which it borrowed originally.  The rent which the local authority has to charge has to make provision for the fact that interest has to be paid on the entire sum of money, and that sum of money must be raised and repaid in full with interest.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  If borrowing £1,000 necessitates repaying £2,000, then it is quite clear that half of the rent at present being charged for labourers' cottages and for houses for our workers in the city is a charge to repay the interest on the borrowed money.  To-day, local authorities throughout the country are charging rents which could be halved if money were made available free of interest for building houses.  The fact that rents <Col N="707" /> to-day are double what they ought to be is due to the situation in which we find ourselves wherein those who have money to lend get 50 per cent. of the rent as repayment of that money which was borrowed and upon which the borrower has to pay a high rate of interest: in other words, the man who gives the land, the builder who provides the material, the carpenter, the plasterer, the tiler, the slater, the plumber and the labourer, all these people together who put up the house get 50 per cent. of the sum which is ultimately paid for that house.  They get £1,000 of that £2,000 house and the institution which lends the money gets the other £1,000.</P>
    <P>It is a good scheme from the point of view of the moneylender.  It is a bad scheme from the point of view of the tenant and it is a bad scheme from the point of view of encouraging the erection of houses and settling in those houses tenants at a rent within their capacity to pay.  The biggest blister on the tenant of a new house to-day is the rent which he or she has to pay. It may be that differential renting will make some contribution to the difficulty but, even it it does, it creates other problems as well.</P>
    <P>A far better approach&mdash;I admit it is a radical approach&mdash;to the problem of housing finance would be for the State to direct the Central Bank to issue money at no rate of interest, or a very low rate of interest, for the purpose of building houses and let money so issued by the Central Bank be repaid in the form of the rents charged for these houses.  I want to know why it is impossible in present circumstances to adopt that policy of lending money at ½ per cent. for the building of houses here instead of charging our local authorities 4 per cent. and sometimes even 5 per cent. by the time the money is procured, while we are lending money to Britain at ½ per cent.?</P>
    <P>Britain is investing her money in warships, in planes, in submarines and in every other possible instrument of destruction.  That is the only guarantee we have for our money, more planes, more submarines and other <Col N="708" /> instruments of death and destruction. Would it not be far better to make that money available for investment here in bricks and mortar in an Irish town or an Irish village?  Would there not be much more security in investing that money in houses in Ireland, in afforestation in Ireland or in electrical development in Ireland than there is in lending it to a Government which, in its present financial position, is not nearly as good a target for a loan as would the investment in house-building or the creation of valuable capital assets in our own country?</P>
    <P>I think the time is long overdue when the whole approach in relation to the lending of money for essential schemes of national development should be reexamined. I do not believe that this mechanism requires for its efficient operation the continued payment of 5 per cent. interest to some body which has money to lend and which does nothing else.  I do not believe it is necessary to continue the 5 per cent. racket in order decently to house our people.  The question of housing our people decently at rents within their competence to pay should not be imperilled merely because up to the present we have been following a pattern of life in which those who have money to lend get 50 per cent. of the rent and that charge is as big a charge on the house of an Irish working-man and his family as all the other charges in respect of land, labour and material.</P>
    <P>Whether this Government will face up to examining that problem and breaking with that tradition, which I have always felt was followed too long and in too docile a manner, remains to be seen.  Any bank which will make money available at a low rate of interest, or no rate of interest, to this nation, money which is at present being lent to Britain at ½ per cent. interest, will have the support of this Party, so long as these moneys are utilised for schemes of national development, including the provision of hospitals, schools and houses for our people and the development of our electricity and afforestation potential.</P>
    <P>In the speeches which have been made by the Minister for Finance and <Col N="709" /> by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, both here and outside the House, there has been a reference to the capital Budget which was decided upon by the last Government, and suggestions have been made that the capital Budget was, in some way, a device to get money easily and quickly; that there was something shady about the whole transaction of introducing a capital Budget.  In my view, the introduction of a capital Budget was a wise and a very carefully planned decision of the last Government, one which I then supported enthusiastically and still support enthusiastically, because I believe it is one line of policy in the sphere of national development which holds out the promise that we may make up the serious lag in national development which exists in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>The obvious advantages of a capital Budget scheme were that it permitted the development and employment of schemes of development which were not possible under the former method of financing capital expenditure by budgetary allocations.  We found money for large-scale schemes of development under the capital Budget scheme, and we provided for the payment of interest and the creation of a sinking fund in order to amortise the money so borrowed for those schemes of capital development.  Judged even by the most orthodox capitalist financial standards, or by the criteria employed by the most Victorian of economists, the provision made for exterminating the loans raised by us under the scheme of capital Budget will fulfil the most rigid tests imposed by even the most conservative of financiers or economists.</P>

      <P>If I had any one complaint about it, it is that it was too prudent, far too prudent, and that we were making provision as if we were living in the early days of the last century; but, even the provision which was made, cannot, in any way, be criticised as being improvident, even from the standpoint of the most respectable of our economists or financiers <Col N="710" /> to-day.  As a matter of fact, it is worthy of note that no economist of standing has attempted to question either the introduction of the capital Budget or the financial provision made by the last Government to finance borrowing for that type of Budget on a most orthodox line.  Why should they and why could they, one might well ask, because a capital Budget is already in operation in many progressive countries in the world.  We were one of the few countries which had clung to the old method of financing our schemes of capital development.  Fortunately, the last Government ended all that, and I do not think that, even this Government, would dare go back to the old method of financing capital development because the shock to our whole employment situation, and the economic gloom which would be caused in the homes of the people, as distinct from the gloom in the Central Bank, would be such that no Government would stand very long the test of the public criticism which would be generated by its actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a reasonable thing, even in your own domestic life, or in business or in commerce, to pay every week the expenses which are common to that week or to a particular year; but I think it is a perfectly legitimate thing, where you have non-recurrent expenditure, where you are doing something in the way of buying a commodity which has a value for ten or 20 years, to pay for that commodity in instalments.  For instance, take the ordinary household.  There is nothing wrong with a man who decides to pay his grocer every week because he eats what he gets from the grocer every week, or to pay the milkman or the butcher every week; but if he decides to buy a piano, which is probably the only one he will buy in his lifetime, there is no reason why he should pay for it in one week.  It is perfectly legitimate for that man to decide that he will pay for it over two or three years, and nobody would question that method of running a household.  That is precisely the kind of method which we employed in devising a capital Budget and planning it in such a way as to make moneys available for the <Col N="711" /> undertaking of large-scale schemes of public works throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In my view, the money borrowed for capital development has been fully justified and, both by practice and precept, it has been commended by enlightened economists in this and in other countries.  If we are ever going to get rid of the under-development which is so characteristic of this State, then we can only do so by continuing to supply our national requirements through the medium of a capital Budget which will provide for us the necessary moneys to undertake these schemes of development and which are not possible if we try merely to get an annual allocation from the Budget, or if we try to finance them merely by taxation which, in our circumstances, may never yield anything like a fraction of the money which we need for a vigorous programme of capital development.</P>
    <P>What we have to recognise is that we are a generation behind Europe, from the standpoint of our lack of industrial and national development, and, if we are ever going to make up that lag, then we can only do it by a vigorous expansionist policy in industry and agriculture, and in the field of creating valuable capital assets for the nation.  If other nations can borrow money for guns, planes and battleships and to meet the gigantic cost of maintaining these instruments of destruction, once they have been bought or built, surely it is much more economically sound for us to borrow money not for battleships, planes or guns, but for such things as electrical development, turf development, land reclamation and drainage, housing, hospitals, the provision of schools, afforestation, and for many other capital works of that kind which create permanent assets, and which, at the same time, promise a return in money, in wealth, and in human happiness and social contentment.  I see nothing wrong with a capital Budget scheme raising money for these things, but rather I see a thousand reasons for commending a Budget of that kind, particularly when I see the way in which money is being raised to-day for less enduring purposes in other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My clear recollection is that the Minister stated that, in his view, we ought to finance our capital development schemes by taxation.  We were told by the Minister that at one time the unlamented Adolf Hitler used to offer the German people a choice between butter and guns and that they had to do without the butter in order to get the guns.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said here: &ldquo;It is not a choice of butter or guns but a choice between taxation and schemes of capital development.&rdquo;  I think that is a complete misreading of the economic <Col N="713" /> facts and the economic possibilities which are before our eyes to-day. I do not think it is necessary to impose taxes especially on the masses of the people in order to produce schemes of national development.  Here in this country you may well impose taxes on luxuries, but I am not prepared to back a scheme taxing the very necessaries of life for our people in order to develop our national estate. I do not think it is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when speaking on this subject the other day, said he planked for a policy of taxation as the only means by which we could embark upon a policy of capital development.  I believe that is a wrong approach to the problem.  By all means, let us tax luxuries, obvious luxuries.  By all means, let us rake off whatever taxation can be got there, if it is necessary to raise taxes for the national well-being.  But taxation on the clothes which the people wear, on the food which they consume, can be a savage form of taxation which would far outweigh any benefits which might accrue by financing the schemes of capital development with moneys raised in that manner.</P>
      <P>I do not see why, in our circumstances, with £400,000,000 invested in Britain, with £80,000,000 lent by the Central Bank to Britain at ½ per cent. interest, we should impose crushing burdens on the masses of our own people to raise taxes to finance schemes of capital development, when all the money we want is under our eyes for the asking and for the taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Fianna Fáil Benches what is wrong with using that money for a scheme of capital development so long as, even from their point of view or the financier's point of view, we make adequate provision for repaying borrowed capital.  I think it is the right line for us to pursue in the matter of capital development.  We should use our own assets as we need them.  We should also appeal to the people to invest their savings so that the State can utilise those savings for the purposes of national well-being.  We can easily repay the money so borrowed by annual budgetary allocations, supplemented, if <Col N="714" /> needs be or the occasion arises, by such income as is derived from the capital assets created under a capital Budget scheme.</P>
    <P>Let this be said, that when the economic minds of E.C.A. applied themselves to an examination of how we used borrowed moneys, they admitted that we had used borrowed moneys so efficiently that we had been able to effect considerable transformation in the Irish economy and that we had probably made better use of our Marshall Aid moneys than had many other countries in Europe to-day. Therefore, whether you want the viewpoint of the staid economist looking back to the last century or the viewpoint of the Marshall Aid economic adviser as to our work during the past three and a half years, you can get testimony there that the work was wisely conceived, that it was courageously planned and that it yielded results which begot the admiration of those in an independent position to judge for themselves the utilisation of the moneys and the skill and direction behind our capital Budget programme.</P>
    <P>We want to end unemployment, develop our industries, expand our agriculture.  We want to provide houses, schools and hospitals, to drain and reclaim land, to electrify rural areas, to develop our peat resources and our forests.  There is only one way in which that can be done and that is by a vigorous policy of national expansion through the medium of the capital Budget.  There is no other way in which it can be done and it is an illusion to think that any other way will yield the same results which would follow the adoption of our capital Budget plans.</P>
    <P>So far as the Labour Party is concerned in this House, I want to put on record that we will support policies which are based upon an approach of the kind I have indicated in the field of industry, agriculture and the capital development programme.  We will support any vigorous expansionist policy to develop our resources and to develop the potentialities of the nation, but we will oppose relentlessly any reactionary policy such at that indicated in the Central Bank's Report, in the White Paper and in the <Col N="715" /> recent gloomy speeches which have been made by Ministers.</P>
    <P>The economic philosophy of the report and of the White Paper and all the gloomy ministerial speeches are the economics of a demented recluse who just wants to live in squalor, misery and penury while his money is wrapped in the miserable rags that hang from his body.  Any policy of curtailing consumption, or of curtailing national development will inevitably lower the standard of living of our people.  It is because of that that we are ruthlessly opposed to any such policy, believing that national regeneration can better be secured by a vigorous policy of expansion in industry, in agriculture and in schemes of national development.  One does not know what the target of this Government is, because we have had confused speeches by Ministers, alterations in the Official Reports, and we do not know exactly what road this Government is going to travel.  We do not even yet know what is the Government's policy.  We do not know whether the Independents who support the Government are aware of its policy.  Probably the Government's final policy will not be determined until the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and, perhaps, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Flynn from Kerry have X-rayed the nation's economic disabilities and have pronounced upon the remedies to be applied.  Whatever policy this Government intends to pursue, I want to say that it will beget the opposition of the Labour Party if it is a policy of cutting down the standard of living of our people, if it is based upon an appeal to our people to eat less, to wear less and to consume less and if it is based upon a return to the free trade ranching policy to which the Central Bank's Report would lead us.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, we are prepared to support any reasonable policy based upon expansion, upon the fullest development of the nation's resources, upon the idea that this country has potentialities capable of beneficial development by and on behalf of the people&mdash;a policy that acknowledges that we have an abundance of financial resources to finance <Col N="716" /> all our national activities, and that it only requires big minds with courage and vision to harness our needs to our assets in order to give us a full-blooded policy of national development. Any policy which is calculated to take that road, the road to expansion, the road to development will be supported by the Labour Party, but any policy calculated to lower the standard of living of our people will be strenuously opposed by the Labour Party with all its resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak with some diffidence.  I gather that we have been listening to the exposition of a great mind.  When I heard Deputy Norton speak here on the last occasion when he moved the adjournment of the debate, he made some reference to Cinderella which made me imagine that, for a moment, he was thinking of himself as the charming principal boy of the pantomime.  It was quite clear from Deputy Norton's speech that he has been living in an atmosphere of fairy tales during his period of office. Now the fairy tale is over, and facts must be faced&mdash;cold facts stated in figures that cannot be controverted and which will stand the closest examination. The two documents which have been the subject of attack in this debate, the White Paper setting out the condition of our external trade and the Report of the Governor and Board of the Central Bank, expose the atmosphere of fraud, deception and suppression in which the government was carried on by the last Administration. That is why these documents have been attacked in terms which are designed to prevent the public from reading them, and that is the reason for the prejudiced approach which is being attempted here, to forestall the examination of these documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These documents have been attacked, let me repeat, because of the disclosures which they contained.  That is why the Leader of the Opposition treated the Dáil in his opening speech to an exhibition of forensic fustian such as has not been witnessed since the days of Sergeant Buzz Fuzz.  He thumped his desk; he tore his gown; he rent the heavens; he bowdlerised <Col N="717" /> figures; he quoted irrelevant statistic after statistic, in an endeavour, as I have said, to prevent the Dáil from examining our problems, problems not merely of this Government, but the problems of this nation, in a cold, objective and realistic way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He talked about the presents this Government had left to its successors.  I shall mention some of these later.  He made grossly misleading statements as to the value of our sterling assets&mdash;the sterling assets available to us, statements which were repeated by Deputy MacBride.  There is only one conclusion to which I can come, bearing in mind the fact that he disregarded that, as against the gross value of our sterling assets, we had a considerable volume of commitments in terms of sterling.  Instead of having, as he said, belonging to our people, to individual members of our community and to public institutions in this State, £400,000,000 sterling, we had in fact about £250,000,000.  It is quite clear from Deputy Costello's speech that the basis upon which our Government and our public affairs were conducted during the three years of his Government has been this: What we have is the only thing that counts; what we owe does not matter.  I would suggest that it would be a good thing for him and for those who speak like him if they were to take a course in simple book-keeping&mdash;single entry bookkeeping will suffice&mdash;just a mere statement of what we own and of what we owe. When they have mastered the simple process of subtracting what we owe from what we own, I trust we shall hear no more talk about this figure of £400,000,000 sterling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one purpose behind all Deputy Costello's statement and it was to divert attention from the seriousness of the position which this Government has inherited from its predecessors, and to prevent the people from studying the White Paper and the Report of the Central <Col N="718" /> Bank, because such a study would make it clear where the responsibility for the creation of the present position lies.  It would make it clear also that the measures required to clean up the mess will involve self-denial and hard work.</P>
      <P>When this Government took office it found four problems awaiting it&mdash;four problems of the gravest character: a Budget problem, a balance-of-payments problem, a currency problem and its reflection in the rising cost of living, a confidence problem, a confidence problem born of the fact that over the preceding three years the people of this country, the thrifty, prudent, industrious people of this country, had lost confidence in the way in which the financial affairs of this State were being managed, or shall I say, mismanaged. Each and all of these problems are inter-related and interdependent. They constitute the evil legacy which we have inherited.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello, as I mentioned, a little while ago, referred to the &ldquo;presents&rdquo; which his Government had left his successors.  He spoke of the revenue carry-over, for instance.  He seemed to see some merit in the fact that they had not scraped the till to the bottom, that they had not taken the linings of the barrel, that they had not completely emptied the Exchequer. That seemed to be, in the eyes of Deputy Costello, something which demanded a meed of praise from those who had succeeded him.  But the carry-over is an essential feature of the financial mechanism of the Exchequer. It has always been the practice.  The carry-over, in fact, is analogous to what, in banking parlance, is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;till money&rdquo;.  When Deputy Costello took office in 1948 the carry-over was £1.9 million, precisely the figure which he mentioned as having left in the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo;, as I think he put it, in 1951, but it did not inure to us.  After all, consideration was given to the fact that there was this till money available when the estimates of revenue were being framed.  In 1947 the amount of the carry-over was £2.4 million, and for many years it has been to the order of £1.9 million or £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> Deputy Costello left a number of other things behind him that he did not mention, and some of them I think I should retail to the House.  Here are some items which were not provided for in the Budget which was presented to the Dáil last May and which the Dáil, let me remind you, was not permitted to discuss.  There is, for instance, the additional amount required for local health authorities to provide for increased remuneration of employees and for other purposes.  Deputy Costello is the person who, as Minister for Health, was responsible for imposing that burden on the Exchequer. As I have told you it amounts to £700,000.  That is a &ldquo;present&rdquo; which he left behind, an obligation which we have to honour but for which he made no provision.  Then there is the amount required for accumulated fuel losses to the 31st March, 1952, losses accumulated over all the years when Deputy Costello was Taoiseach.  They amount to the trifling sum&mdash;after all, when people are talking in terms of £400,000,000, a million or two does not matter&mdash;of £3,079,950.  It might be of interest, and the House, I am sure, will be concerned to know, what provision was made in the Estimates against that item.  The £3,079,950 was provided for in the Estimates by a token Vote of £5.  Then we have the amount required to provide for the working losses of Córas Iompair Eireann and to meet the guarantee on the debentures issued by that company. For that a sum of not less than £2,000,000 will be required, a liability left behind by Deputy Costello, another little bill which he incurred but which we shall have to pay.  Then there is a further amount required by Córas Iompair Éireann for deferred maintenance, £484,000; a further amount required by the same company to provide for replacements of stores and materials, £241,000, and then an additional amount required, this time to meet the cash deficiency of the Great Northern Railway Company which our predecessors undertook to meet and which will amount to about £200,000. The total of these items left behind by our predecessors and unprovided for, comes to £10,387,000.</P>

      <P>Against all these items, amounting as I have said to over £10,000,000, Deputy McGilligan, in the optimism of his imagination, or in a belief in his magical powers, provided, but only notionally, a sum of £1,500,000.</P>
      <P>During the General Election Deputy Dr. Browne made a reference to the writing down of Estimates.  I do not know precisely what Deputy Dr. Browne had in mind but I do say that, having regard to the form in which the Budget was presented to the House, the information which was given to it, or the information rather which was withheld from it, by the then Minister for Finance, some such discreditable device as Deputy Dr. Browne had in mind was resorted to.  In fact, we might say that Deputy McGilligan's Budget was well and truly cooked.  It is no wonder, having regard to the facts which I have stated, that Deputy Costello dissolved the Dáil rather than submit the Budget of his own Minister for Finance to detailed discussion and debate in this House.  With this false Budget, this cooked Budget before it, Deputy Costello chose to go to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that we have not changed the main structure of the Budget. We are allowing the policy of our predecessors, as it was expressed in that Budget, to work itself out to its unholy end.  It is necessary for us to do this in order that the people may realise fully all that was involved <Col N="721" /> in our predecessors' policy because we wish their judgment upon the financial methods of our predecessors to be final and decisive.</P>

I compliment him on the accuracy of his addition.  There was one item which I omitted and perhaps I may be permitted to repair the omission now.  The item which I omitted was this: the amount required for increases in the remuneration of the civil servants, the Garda, the Army and the teachers consequent upon the Civil Service arbitration award, which amounts to £3,683,000.  Now I hope Deputy Mulcahy will be able to reconcile the figures.</P>

There is, for instance, an item of £700,000 which is the additional amount which will be required for the provision of the increased old age pensions. The House will remember that when Deputy Norton as Minister for Social Welfare submitted social security proposals to this House and when it looked as if they were going to be rejected because of the fact that they had failed to make proper provision for certain sections in the population, he indicated that the Government was prepared to give a promise that these elements in the population would be provided for, but at the same time refused to honour the promise as promptly as could have been done.  We, on the other hand, said that, as the plight of these people is urgent, it must be relieved and we proposed, as a first step in this direction, <Col N="722" /> to increase the old age pensions. For that we shall have in due course to ask the House to vote a further sum of £700,000.</P>
      <P>Then there will be an additional sum of £600,000 in respect of an increase in the amount required for the subsidisation of butter.  There will also be an increase of £200,000 in respect of the amount required for the subsidisation of bread and flour.  There will be a couple of small items like £4,300 for the Abbey Theatre and £4,140 for Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeanntracha gCúng.</P>
      <P>There will be in addition some other items.  That precious child of the former Minister for External Affairs, the Irish News Agency, is turning out to be a very expensive baby indeed, and for it I think in due course we shall have to ask the Dáil to provide further money in addition to the £25,000 which has already been voted for that particular pet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say here why it has been necessary for us to make increased provision for the butter subsidy.  The reason is that, in order to induce our farmers to remain in the dairying industry, in order to enable our people to secure supplies of butter from home sources, we have had to offer an increased price for milk to our farmers. The need for that arises, not merely because of the general policy of Fianna Fáil, which has always been to give the maximum encouragement possible to our farming industry.  There is also another reason, a reason which is manifested in the White Paper dealing with the balance of payments, and that is, that we cannot afford to buy foreign butter.  The same applies in the case of the additional amount required for the flour and bread subsidy. Having regard to the parlous rate at which the deficit on our visible balance of trade has increased, we must grow our own wheat and produce our own bread.  In short, from now on, we cannot base our economy on imported foods, whether for man or beast.  The White Paper shows that; and one of the reasons why the White Paper has been so virulently attacked in this House or outside this House by Deputy Dillon and those who are associated with him, is that the White <Col N="723" /> Paper and the Report of the Central Bank between them sound the death knell of Dillonism in this country.</P>
    <P>Having referred to the problem of the Budget, let me come to the other problem, the balance-of-payments problem. The White Paper states that problem clearly in cold, scientific, statistical form.  The White Paper was compiled, I may say, in the first place at my request for my own information. I submitted it to my colleagues in the Government for their information, and it has now been published by the Government for the information of the people.</P>

      <P>What are the grounds upon which this White Paper has been attacked?  I think they could be enumerated under six heads: First, that the deterioration in our balance-of-payments position has been exaggerated in the White Paper; secondly, that in so far as there is a deficit in the balance of payments it is due to increased home investment and stockpiling; thirdly, that our gross sterling assets determine the degree of permissible external disinvestment and have not declined; fourthly, that there has been a gradual improvement in our external trade position in recent months; fifthly, that the present value of our gross external assets is underestimated and that emphasis on the <Col N="724" /> lack of balance in our external trade is misleading, as quite a large part of our gross tourist income can be regarded as exports.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello has suggested that the size of the deficit has been exaggerated.  He suggested that.  He declared it with all the emphasis of a thundering fist.  What basis did he give for it?  What basis has he for challenging these figures?  He admits, or did admit, that, so far as he can see, with the limited resources at his command&mdash;and I am not saying that as any reflection upon him except to the extent that it may reflect upon his modesty in drawing conclusions which he in fact is not able with the material at his disposal to formulate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asks: &ldquo;What about the September figure?&rdquo; Deputy Costello referred to the September figure.  The manner of his reference, however, was typical of his methods.  It reminded me of nothing so much as the description which he gave in this House last April of the manner in which he spoke to the doctors. He managed, apparently, to deceive them by telling them that, in his view, a certain scheme was mandatory upon the then Minister for Health&mdash;<Col N="725" /> and then he came into the House and admitted that, as a lawyer, having studied the documents, he could find no justification whatever for that contention. However, just as he treated the doctors, he tried last Wednesday to dupe this House.  He referred, as has been said, to the addendum to the White Paper, added after the White Paper had been in proof and had gone to press.  Referring to the position which had manifested itself during the month of September, he read there the fourth paragraph of the addendum&mdash; but he carefully omitted to read what was the most important sentence in that paragraph.  When I challenged him to read it and not to deceive the House but to give the House the whole truth and the whole statement, he shouted me down.</P>
      <P>Here is what that fourth paragraph did say.  Here is how it opened: &ldquo;The volume of external trade in September, 1951, was affected by the shipping and dock strike at the Port of Dublin.&rdquo; Everybody knows that that shipping and dock strike was the main cause of any deviation from the general trend of the year which was manifested during the month of September.  But it is not what happened in September that counts.  The main thing that matters in this connection is the difference between imports and exports because that is what determines the size of the trade deficit.  In that connection, we have to remember that the substantial increase which has been postulated in exports during the last three months of this year and which, to some extent, will tend to neutralise the adverse trend of the earlier months, may itself not be realised. The assumption on which the deficit of £70,000,000 in the balance of payments for 1951 rests is that the excess of imports over the last five months of the year will be £10,000,000 greater than in the last quarter of 1950, as compared with an increase of £31.7 millions in the first eight months of the year over the corresponding period of 1950.  On the basis of the available figures, there is no reason, no rational ground, for changing the estimate of £70,000,000 deficit in our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already reminded the House <Col N="726" /> that when I suggested in July last that the figure would be £60,000,000, Deputy Costello made a speech outside this House and suggested that the figure was ludicrous.  The fact of the matter is that Deputy Costello is so appalled by the situation which he has created that he refuses to permit himself to believe it.  He is like the man who visited the Zoo and, on seeing a giraffe for the first time, said: &ldquo;There is no such animal.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Costello made a great ado about the use of the term &ldquo;consumer goods&rdquo; in the fourth paragraph of the addendum to the White Paper. The words &ldquo;consumer goods&rdquo; were used in order to make it quite clear that the deficit in our balance of payments did not arise mainly from the repatriation of external assets for capital investment or stockpiling. These are the excuses which have been used to justify the manner in which the nation's assets&mdash;the assets of those who have deposits in our banks&mdash;have been dissipated.  The figures which have been given in the White Paper refute these excuses completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of stockpiling, Deputy Costello referred, among other things, to the reserve stocks and supplies for hospitals and dispensaries which had been procured.  There was a certain degree of hardihood in that remark, because Deputy Costello was not responsible, so far as I can gather from my papers, for any portion of the reserve stocks of medical and surgical supplies that had been laid in.  I gather that the person to whom the credit for that is due is his predecessor as Minister for Health&mdash;but there are indications that the action of his predecessor <Col N="727" /> in laying in these stocks was not greatly appreciated by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I come now to deal with the question of the balance of payments, the external assets.  Deputy Costello referred time and time again in his speech to our gross external assets.  He stated that they had increased by £25,000,000.  He did not mention to the House the fact that this increase represented the proceeds of the external debt, the American debt which he had incurred, nor did he disclose to the House that our net investment position&mdash;our position as a creditor nation&mdash;had been undermined to the extent of which that external debt had been contracted.  He appears, in short, to regard any balance of payments deficit and any realisation of assets arising therefrom as being of no consequence whatever so long as we can have what he calls our external assets.  This attitude is completely irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As against Deputy Costello's figure of an increase of £25,000,000 in gross external assets in 1949 and 1950, an external debt to well over twice that amount was incurred in these two years.  The Budget statement of 1949 recognised that a balance of payments deficit up to £10,000,000 had disclosed itself, and in 1950&mdash;again on the admission of the then Minister for Finance&mdash;an additional deficit of £30,000,000 had been incurred and that these deficits had been inevitably covered by external disinvestment.  In the peculiar circumstances of these years, however, the external disinvestment, as I have indicated to the House, took the form of incurring dollar and sterling liabilities rather than by the realisation of external assets.  The incurring of repayable liabilities is no <Col N="729" /> less external disinvestment and no less an encroachment upon our external capital position than the sale of external investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very daft observation and the Minister knows it too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And even Deputy Dillon must know that the net increase in the external assets of the Central Bank upon which Deputy Costello prided himself was a purely adventitious occurrence and the temporary result of the receipt of Marshall Aid. Deputy Dillon must also know that, but for the abnormal addition to the sterling resources of the commercial banks, as a result of drawing on the American Loan Counterpart Fund for Exchequer purposes, the fall in the banks net external assets would have been considerably greater than the actual figure of £30.3 million in 1950. When, therefore, Deputy Costello refers to an increase in our external assets in these two years, he is either misrepresenting the position for his own purpose or&mdash;and this is, perhaps, the real position&mdash;he fails to realise that a succession of deficits cannot be incurred without encroaching upon our external reserve.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;account regarding sterling assets when external disinvestment is really the significant factor, Deputy Costello tries to support his assertion by quoting figures&mdash; selected figures&mdash;from the balance of payments statement published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i>  He quotes item (15) which shows an increase from £17.5 million in 1946 to £20.2 million in 1950, for income from investments abroad, external profits, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> There are three obvious reasons for the increase.  First of all, there is the inflation in Great Britain which has been accompanied by a higher dividend distribution on industrial and other shares.  Then there is the American Loan which temporarily reduced the realisation of our external assets; and, thirdly, the interest and principal repayments in respect of the American Loan have not fallen due but we have been reaping the benefit of the external sterling assets which we have had in the Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

I think it is merely a matter for candour, for being open and truthful in the House and for not trying to mislead the House by concealing half the truth as Deputy Costello tried to do.  The increased income from private external holdings held mainly in industrial equities has been due to higher yields.  That is an important fact. Increased income has been due to higher yields upon our holdings and has not been secured as a result of an increase in the normal value of these holdings in so far as they are held by private individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly.  Our statistical resources in that matter are meagre and limited but, such as they are, they reflect the much larger volume of business that is done <Col N="731" /> through outside stockbrokers.  I think we are entitled to say that, so far as it can be ascertained from the sources at our disposal, there has been a net realisation of securities over the two years, 1949 and 1950.  I merely mention that fact, neither by way of regret nor by way of congratulation, in order to indicate to the House how, by withholding information from it or by presenting information in a certain way, Deputy Costello endeavoured to convey to the House a misleading picture of what the situation really is.</P>
      <P>In his dissertation on the difference between net and gross sterling assets, Deputy Costello omitted to refer to one important fact, the most important fact from the point of view of the general position of this country in the international financial and economic sphere, that it is the net figure of our external holdings that really determines our creditor status.  If the present rate of external disinvestment continues, it seems very probable&mdash;I am not a prophet; I cannot put it any further than that&mdash;that we shall have lost our creditor status by the year 1954.  I do not know whether that will be regarded as a desirable consummation or not.  I think that those countries are more independent, politically and economically, who have no net obligations to outside Powers.</P>
      <P>The next point upon which this White Paper was challenged by Deputy Costello was that there had been an improvement in external trade in recent months, a gradual improvement in the trade position, he alleged, since last May.  The only favourable feature of the recent trade returns is the decline in both volume and value of imports from the abnormally high levels reached in the months of April, May and June; but it must be remembered in this connection that imports are always seasonally low in the third quarter of the year and, furthermore, that we had the general dislocation of trade occasioned by the shipping and dock strike at the Port of Dublin to which I have referred.  This factor, a very large factor, must always be borne in mind when we are considering the figures for the third quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> Stating the position as objectively as I can, I think it would be unsafe to conclude, as yet, that a secular decline in the volume and value of imports has emerged.  The really significant thing about the position is the comparison which we must make between the trend of external trade in recent months and that of the corresponding period in 1950.  On that basis we find that the trade deficit since May in each month of this year is greater than in the corresponding month of last year, although the trade deficit in 1950 represented a substantial increase over the previous year and resulted in a deficit of £30,000,000 in the balance of payments.  The figures are as follows: In June, 1950, the trade deficit was £13.8 millions and in 1951, £19.7 millions.</P>

      <P>I am sorry; the value of imports.  In July, 1950, the value of imports was £12.7 millions and, in 1951, £17.6 millions.  In August, 1950, they amounted to £11.9 millions and, in 1951, to £14.3 millions. In September, 1950, they were £12.2 millions and in this year, due, as I have said, to the strike at the Port of Dublin, they declined to £11.7 millions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>There is a great deal more I could say about the question of gross external assets, but perhaps I should refer to one other point on which Deputy Costello commented very freely and very forcibly in the course of his speech.  In the White Paper, the statement is made that our position in regard to the deficit on our balance of favourable trade is unique in Europe and he challenged the basis of that. That statement is based upon the figures which we have procured from a memorandum on the trade balances of member countries of the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation which was compiled by the Director of Statistics and National Accounts and issued in September this year.  I do not want to weary the House by quoting the figures, but I should like to say that the table shows clearly that, apart from Greece, the unbalanced state of our external trade is, as it is stated in the White Paper to be, unique amongst the countries of Europe.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> We come now to deal with the currency problem, the third of the problems which we inherited from our predecessors.  The balance of payments is inseparably interlocked with the currency problem.  Currency, as everybody knows, is an essential element in our economic system.  We live in a money economy.  That has been well said by a person much better versed even than Deputy Dillon may be in a matter of this sort&mdash;or, diffident as I may be to say it, than Deputy MacBride may be in regard to it.  In the words of a person who was long regarded as the keystone of the financial organisation which allowed prewar Germany to build up its industrial and economic strength:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The currency standard is one of the pillars of our modern economic life.  Every process of production, every exchange of goods, every service depends upon it.  Without currency the creation of productive investment capital in modern economy is impossible.  The more complicated economic life becomes in its technique, the more important the currency&mdash;the only means by which the most diverse goods are made available at any time, and we are able to buy them.  Without currency, consequently, a permanent increase in the standard of living is impossible.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the person whom I have quoted may be objectionable to Deputy Dillon, may I say he appears to have learned by experience&mdash;as I trust the Deputy may be capable of doing.  I was saying that the importance of safeguarding the integrity of the currency had been recognised by the Government when it introduced the Central Bank Act in 1942. When the bank was set up, it was given <Col N="737" /> as its principal duty&mdash;it had other duties, but this was the principal one&mdash; the taking of &ldquo;such steps as the board may from time to time deem appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and ensuring that, in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the purpose for which the Central Bank was set up.  In order to enable it to discharge that duty, it was also given certain powers, under Section 8.  I am not going to recite them at length.  The Act does empower the bank to &ldquo;make provision for the collection and study of data relating to monetary and credit problems and publish informative material in regard thereto.&rdquo;  Now, when the bank was set up it was by statute made independent of the Government.  The Oireachtas in its wisdom made it independent, it remains independent, and we desire to preserve its independence&mdash;recognising that if a Government is permitted and able to alter wantonly the value of the currency, no one can have confidence in money which is capable of being so manipulated.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech here the other day, Deputy MacBride argued that the Government should be given the power arbitrarily to alter the value of the currency.  Under us, and under the legislation which was enacted by the Oireachtas, the Government cannot do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government cannot alter the value of the currency. Deputy MacBride suggested the Government should have power to do it, to manipulate the people's currency in whatever way suited the political exigencies of the Government of the day.  That is Deputy MacBride's objective, that is his ambition.  Under the Central Bank Act that cannot be done by this or any other Government. If we want to alter the value of our currency, the Oireachtas here is competent to do it and can do it, in just the same way as it has determined the present value of our Irish currency.  It can give to our Irish £ any parity which in its wisdom it thinks the trade of the country can sustain.  This is where the question of the balance of payments enters into it.  I will, however, revert to that aspect of the problem later.</P>
      <P>What I want to make clear is that Deputy MacBride, who is to-day suggesting that the Government should be given the power to manipulate currency in whatever way it wants, was a member of a Government, the last Government, which accepted the position as it found it under the Central Bank Act of 1942 and made no attempt to ask the Oireachtas to amend that Statute in any way.</P>
      <P>I was saying that the bank is independent of the Government.  It is able under the Act of 1942 to function in freedom.  It is free to judge the policies of the politicians.  That is, perhaps, the ground upon which some people criticise it.  It is free to express its unfettered opinion on these policies and on the developments which in its view may affect the purchasing power of the currency and endanger its stability.  The Board of the Central Bank is constituted by Act of Parliament. It is broadly representative of the main sections of our people and of their occupational and other interests. I do not think, however, that it is blessed with the services of a lawyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a farmer on it.  There is on it a man who has given a lifetime of service to the national cause and to the cause of the working classes. There is a person who is an economist. There are two civil servants on it and three representatives of the banks <Col N="739" /> whose occupations are not solely confined to banking but who are engaged in industry and commerce in this country.  Then there is the Governor. None of these persons are engaged in politics.  They are all of them responsible men.  They sit and meet as responsible citizens and they are charged by the Statute with the supreme public duty of doing everything which they may deem advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and ensuring that in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole. These men are, in a sense, the watchdogs of the people.  But Deputy MacBride indicated in the course of his speech on Thursday last that he would make them otherwise.  He wants them to be the mere mouthpiece of the Government, to tell the people that all is well, no matter what the Government of the day may do.  In his speech he indicated how the Government of which he was a member endeavoured to browbeat the Governor and board to bring in the sort of report which the Government wanted.  I am going to prove that assertion by a quotation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy MacBride said and that is the proposition to which Deputy Dillon has given his assent.  Deputy MacBride went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister takes the trouble to inquire he will find that the views of the Governor of the Central Bank were modified in a number of respects.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What does that imply?  I do not know what foundation there is for Deputy MacBride's statement but it certainly implies that the Governor and Board of the Central Bank were coerced to modify the terms of the report which they had intended to submit to the Government for presentation to the people.  That is to say they were prevented from telling the people what they believed to be the truth regarding the policies which the Government of which Deputy MacBride was a member had been pursuing.  Is there any other meaning to be drawn from Deputy MacBride's statement made here in this House than that Deputy Costello as Taoiseach, Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance, Deputy MacBride as Minister for External Affairs, and Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture and a law unto himself, all conspired together to browbeat and intimidate the Governor and Board of the Central Bank in order that they might be prevented from disclosing to the public their view &mdash;and it could only be their view&mdash;of the financial economy of the country?</P>

      <P>As I have said, the Board of the Central Bank is a board with certain duties.  It is charged to take such measures as it may deem advisable to safeguard the integrity of the currency. That is a comparatively narrow function, narrower than ours.  We are charged with responsibility for the conduct of the whole nation's affairs. Naturally, we must give careful consideration to what the Board of the Central Bank states in its report, but we cannot be completely dominated or guided in our approach to the various social and political problems which present themselves to us and for the solution of which we are responsible, by the views of the Governor of the Central Bank.

      <P>Certainly by some of the Deputies opposite.  I have pointed out what responsibilities have, in fact, <Col N="742" /> been imposed on the Board of the Central Bank by the Central Bank Act of 1942.  They are limited to taking such steps as may from time to time be deemed appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency.</P>
      <P>When the Act as a Bill was before the House and Deputy Dillon, Deputy Costello and Deputy Mulcahy were sitting over there in the same seats they are occupying to-day, they took up the attitude that the Central Bank was not being given sufficiently wide powers.  They took up the attitude that the Central Bank should be given much greater powers of control and, according to column 23 of Volume 87 of the Official Reports, Deputy Mulcahy put down an official amendment on the part of the Opposition asking that the Central Bank should be given the power of &ldquo;creating and controlling credit and ensuring that in these matters the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as whole.&rdquo;  Deputy Mulcahy, of course, voted for that amendment, so did Deputy Costello and so did Deputy Norton.  They all voted to confer on the board of this institution, whose members have been held up to public obloquy by Deputies opposite, the power of creating and controlling credit.  How is it possible that men who had proposed to give to this institution supreme control over our financial and economic system could have expressed themselves in the terms in relation to that report which they have used in this House?  The reason for their criticism undoubtedly lies in the exposure which the bank's report contains of the Administration which was headed by Deputy Costello and of which Deputy MacBride and Deputy Dillon were leading members.</P>

      <P>Throughout this debate, the link with sterling and the value of external assets held by individual citizens of our State and public institutions have obtruded themselves. They have been brought forward designedly, I submit, to confuse the <Col N="743" /> issue.  Deputy MacBride was particularly active in his references to these matters.  Let us see why it is necessary for us to fix some parity for our currency. To facilitate them in their transactions, every State whose citizens engage in export trade should fix the parity of its currency, should declare rates at which that currency will be exchangeable either for other currencies or for some commodity in general use.  One may say that perhaps the United States is the only State whose currency can be described as absolutely hard in that it is based on what is taken theoretically as an absolute measure of value&mdash;the price per ounce of gold.  If such a declaration of parity were not made, international trade would scarcely be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the parity of the French franc?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Parity in general is established by declaring the relationship with that country with which the trade is most extensive.  We should have, unless Deputy Dillon wants me to believe otherwise, a parity for the purpose of external trade.  This is necessary in order that the persons from whom we purchase will have an assurance that the currency with which we buy from them will be exchangeable for goods which they may desire to purchase otherwise than from us. If we are going to establish a parity, what parity would be more convenient than parity with the currency of the country with which our trade is largest?  Naturally, therefore, when we declare the value of our currency we do so in terms of sterling.  That in no way detracts from the value of the Irish pound, any more than the French do in regard to their currency, or the Dutch, or the numerous other countries which have related the parity of their currencies to sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We say, in short, that the Irish pound is as good as the pound sterling, would buy as much as the pound sterling, and is no worse than the pound sterling.  We do that merely because it is the most convenient way of stating the relationship we desire to maintain. We could say, in other terms, <Col N="744" /> that 1,000 francs, each franc a little less than a farthing, would be equal to the pound.  The French approximate to that when they say that the official parity of the franc to the pound is 980 francs.  But it is more convenient for us to talk on both sides in terms of pounds.</P>
    <P>As I have said, when we declare our parity, we must maintain it.  Here is where the balance of payments problem enters.  For the stability of currencies a correct balance of payments is imperative.  A currency is not threatened so long as the debits and credits are properly balanced.  But, as soon as the balance loses its equilibrium, currency problems arise.  The reason for this is very clear.  Every currency must have an acceptable backing, must be acceptable to the foreign sellers and suppliers, and that is the basis of our currency problem: to try to maintain that our Irish pound will be acceptable to those from whom we buy in such disproportionately greater measure than we are able to sell to them.  In fact, we buy so much that those from whom we buy must be satisfied that the money in which we pay them will purchase what they want.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why our pound must be readily convertible into sterling.  So long as we import so much and export so little that will remain our inescapable problem.  That is why, if called upon, we have to be ready to give sterling for our currency immediately on demand, and that is why our legal tender notes must be heavily backed with sterling securities under our present conditions of trade. I want to emphasise that&mdash;under our present conditions of trade.  I hope that Deputy Dillon will take that in, because Deputy Dillon is a gentleman who has claimed the greatest personal credit for having created our present conditions of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could change the trend of that trade, if we could sell more to the United States of America, more to Germany, to Holland, to Belgium and to France, much more to these countries <Col N="745" /> and less to Great Britain, we could have a more diversified backing for our currency and we could establish a parity for our currency in terms other than that of sterling.  We would also tend to have the surplus assets available invested elsewhere than in Great Britain; instead of sterling assets only we could have dollar assets or guilder assets or kroner assets.</P>

      <P>Some years ago when world conditions generally appeared to be favourable to a development in our trading trends which would have enabled us to reduce our dependency on the British market, and to have opened up new avenues of trade and to have secured a different backing for our currency, the gentlemen who are now talking about the depreciation of our sterling assets and about our dependence upon British currency as a backing for our own deliberately turned their backs upon that opportunity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1948 these gentlemen went over to Great Britain&mdash; Deputy Dillon, Deputy Costello and <Col N="746" /> Deputy MacBride&mdash;and they made there a trade pact with that Government which included this proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland undertake that they will limit their exports of live cattle to countries other than the United Kingdom to 50,000 head in the 1948 season and to a number in subsequent seasons which shall not exceed 10 per cent. of their total exports of live cattle to all countries.  They further undertake that, in the 1948 season, 20 per cent. and in each subsequent season 25 per cent. of their total exports to all countries other than the United Kingdom shall consist of second-class cattle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the gentlemen who tell us now that they want to break the link with sterling, that they want to sever the economic relationship which they fostered and built up and which they copper-fastened.</P>
      <P>People will recall that when that agreement was being negotiated, the then Minister for Agriculture distinguished himself by a highly philanthropic gesture.  He told the British people: &ldquo;We would rather sell to you than sell to anybody else.  We may get more money from continental buyers, but we will have nothing to do with those fly-by-nights.&rdquo;  He came back here then and, having made that agreement under which he fettered and limited and restricted our right to develop our continental trade and our trade with the United States of America&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He came back here and handed that agreement to this House and he was supported, let me repeat it again, by the gentleman who was so concerned about our link with sterling and our sterling assets, Deputy MacBride.  When that agreement was before the House I ventured to criticise it.  I think it is relevant to this debate to repeat now what I said then:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" />&ldquo;Under this agreement, let us be clear about it, we link our economy more closely than ever before with that of Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can that be denied?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true that there must be close association between the two countries.  Our geographical position, perhaps, determines that, but it had been the endeavour of the Government which existed in this country from 1932, at any rate, to try to make our people more and more independent of our trade with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>That very largely was the basis of the policy which we pursued.  That was very largely responsible for the attempts which we were making to make ourselves self-sufficient in every possible degree.  That was largely responsible for the fact that, even though it did impose some hardships and disabilities on our own people, we determined to grow our own food, to make our own clothes, to produce our own fuel to the utmost extent permitted out of the resources which God Almighty had given us.  But this agreement turns back on that&mdash;make no mistake about it&mdash;in one significant important factor, by limiting our right to trade with the Continent, which, as I have said, links our economy more closely than ever before with that of Great Britain. In doing that, too, we link our currency more firmly than ever before with sterling....&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;This link that has been so often spoken about is not a link that depends fundamentally on an Act of this Parliament.  An Act of Parliament merely declares and defines the <Col N="748" /> position as it in reality exists, but the fundamental link with sterling is based on the volume of our trade with Great Britain, and the more we restrict our trade with Great Britain, the more closely we link our currency with sterling.  We shall never be able to enjoy any great freedom of action in regard to that link until we make our trade more international and more cosmopolitan, but paragraph 5 of Part A of this annex forbids us virtually to do more than a limited trade with Great Britain and says that for the next four years, when the markets of Europe are open to us, we shall not export more than 10 per cent. of our total exports of live cattle to countries other than Great Britain.  It actually goes further and says that, of the permissible exports of live cattle to other countries, a certain proportion of them shall be of inferior quality when, as everybody knows, it would be good business for the sake of our reputation and in order to build up a goodwill, to send the best possible live stock we could to continental countries.&rdquo;</P>

Those who pretend, because it is a pretence on the part of those gentlemen who signed this agreement of 1948, that they want to break the link with sterling and repatriate our sterling assets are those who by deliberate choice entered upon another course.  I may say in this connection, during the past three years it is not repatriation of our assets they have been engaged in but rather their liquidation.</P>

There were many other projects of a similar type in which our sterling assets could have been profitably invested, in which they could have been invested reproductively, and so would have placed us in a much better position to face the future than we are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come to another aspect of the matter.  We have borrowed from the U.S.A. a considerable sum of money which amounts to, I think, £46,000,000 or £47,000,000, more or less.  The agreement under which we borrowed that money was signed in Washington <Col N="750" /> by the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride.  If we had to borrow, why was it necessary for us to borrow the equivalent of £45,000,000 when we had, according to Deputy Costello, no less than £400,000,000 invested in sterling assets?  If the idea was to repatriate sterling assets, why did we not realise £45,000,000 worth of sterling and bring it back here, and why mortgage the country to the extent to which it has been mortgaged?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that this is very unpleasant, but we have heard a lot about the repatriation of sterling assets.  It is very unpleasant, and perhaps one of the reasons why the Board of the Central Bank has been so strongly criticised in the course of this debate is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it ventured to suggest that the proceedings of Deputy MacBride in Washington might not, ultimately, be to the advantage of this country.  Here is what the Central Bank said in its report for the year ended 31st March, 1948, in reference to the then projected borrowings from the U.S.A.:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The chronic heavy deficit position in the Irish balance of payments with the U.S. precludes any easy assumption that this country is likely as a consequence of the loan to be in a position within a measurable period to find dollars to cover the service of the loan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I hope that the significance of that will be borne in mind.  The report goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The raising of a loan in a foreign currency to secure supplies of consumption goods is an expedient to be adopted only under pressure of extreme necessity and within the narrowest limits dictated by that necessity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Where was the necessity in this case? We had, according to Deputy Costello, £400,000,000 sterling to play with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> Especially in view of the existing world currency situation the report goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A loan contract of this kind is a gamble on uncertain future exchange relations of the Irish pound, the pound sterling and the American dollar.  The implications of the contract are less predictable according as the term of the loan is longer. The high credit status of this country in the past affords no warrant of future credit worthiness in terms of American dollars.  The borrower in these circumstances has to accept an undue risk, and it is not altogether a sufficient answer that the lender is prepared to take it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And yet, notwithstanding these admonitions and these warnings, Deputy MacBride, the then Minister for External Affairs, the gentleman who talks about repatriating our external assets, went off to America and signed the loan.  With what consequences? These, too, are stated in the Report of the Central Bank for the year ended 31st March, 1949.  Having referred to the fact that Deputy MacBride, then Minister for External Affairs, put his signature to the agreement of the 28th October, 1948, an agreement for an authorised loan of 60,000,000 dollars, and having referred also to the fact that this loan was increased to £89,000,000 by a similar agreement of the 23rd February, 1949&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is not the point.  It is this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By reason of the devaluation which has since taken place, repayment obligations have on the present basis increased in terms of Irish currency by about 44 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We borrow, first of all, 60,000,000 <Col N="752" /> dollars when we have £400,000,000 sterling available, and we increase our borrowing to the tune of 89,000,000 dollars a few months later, having still £400,000,000 of sterling available, then &ldquo;by reason of the devaluation&rdquo; which Deputy MacBride accepted, which Deputy Dillon accepted and which Deputy Costello accepted, we read that the &ldquo;repayment obligations have on the present basis increased in terms of Irish currency by about 44 per cent.&rdquo;  There is the judgement which the Central Bank expressed upon Deputy MacBride's activities as a financial expert.</P>

      <P>Let me get on to the fourth problem with which we were left &mdash;the confidence problem.  I refer to this matter because Deputy Costello himself raised it.  When he was speaking here the other day he boasted that, whereas we had not ventured to make a public issue, his Government had made a public issue and had secured the largest subscription ever.  For sheer, unblushing audacity and misstatement, that assertion of Deputy Costello's cannot be surpassed in this House.  It is true that an issue of 3½ per cent.  Exchequer Bonds was made in the year 1950 for a sum of £14,850,000.  The general Irish public subscribed £8.7 millions to that issue. The rest of it had to be taken up by the banks or provided out of Government funds.  That is a fact, and the reason for the refusal of the Irish people to subscribe to the issue of their own Government was, as I have said, that they had lost confidence in the way in which the finances of this State were being conducted.</P>

The fact of the matter is that out of £14,850,000 asked for the Irish people subscribed only £8.7 millions. That is the extent to which the Irish people were prepared to entrust their <Col N="754" /> savings to a Government led by Deputy Costello.</P>

That is the position.  Now the only way in which this essential public confidence can be restored is by being honest with the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we take up that attitude, if they see that our Budgets are balanced, if they see that we are prepared to meet our obligations and that we are not going to squander and dissipate our assets merely for the sake of creating a fictitious appearance of prosperity in the country, then their confidence in the finances of this State will be restored &mdash;the confidence which they manifested from 1934 to 1949.  It was in 1949 that the weakness first became apparent. We should be able on the basis of an honest Budget, on the basis of honest dealing with our people, to persuade them that it is worth saving in order to build up industry in this country, that it is worth investing in this country in order that our people will be able to get employment and that every section of them will be honestly dealt with.  That is why, so far as we are concerned, the people will know the truth.  That is why we will not attempt to influence any authority which is charged with a public duty, such as the Board of the Central Bank is, particularly that we will not attempt to influence its judgement or the free expression of its opinions on the manner in <Col N="755" /> which we conduct public affairs.  We are not necessarily bound to accept its judgment, but at least we will give the public an opportunity of deciding between the judgment of this unbiased mind and that of those who are responsible for the policies of which certain financial facts are the reflection.  That is the way in which we are prepared to face the people.  And I am certain that when the people know that they have men who are prepared to approach them in that open way they will respond and help us.  Fianna Fáil wants to make this country a place in which a high standard of living should be afforded to the greatest possible number of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The most significant aspect of this debate has been the change of front which we have witnessed by the Government.  In fact, not merely is there a change of front, but there is a retreat.  I venture to say that, before the debate concludes, there will be a row.  When the debate started it had been preceded by a number of speeches made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and an earlier speech by the Minister for Finance.  These speeches were followed by the publication of the Central Bank Report and that was followed by the White Paper on the balance of payments.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce, however, introduced this debate he was careful to mark the distinction between the manner in which he introduced it and the earlier speeches that he had made outside the House. In addition, he made it quite clear that the Government did not propose to follow the remedies proposed in the Central Bank Report.  He probably was unaware that at the same time, or at practically the same time, the Taoiseach was making a speech at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, in which, by implication, he endorsed the remarks of the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lemass-MacEntee line appears to have two implications.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks and months the country has been subjected to a series of speeches calculated to create a crisis. These speeches began with the speech of the Minister for Finance when he introduced the Estimates for his own Department in July, and they have been followed over the last couple of months or six weeks by three or four speeches from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I want to quote again to the House the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 12th October. He addressed the previous day the Publicity Club of Ireland, and the <i>Irish Press</i> heading is: &ldquo;Real Crisis&rdquo;.  The Minister goes on to say: &ldquo;This is a real crisis which we are facing, and it will not be easy for us to escape.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Last week, after Deputy J. Costello had made a speech in Cork, the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced the Second Reading of this Bill.  At column 300, Volume 127, of the Official Debates of the 7th November, 1951, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have no crisis yet, but we have a problem, and the efforts which the Government has been making over the past three or four months have been to get the people of this country to realise that there is a problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder do the Government realise that whatever problem has been there has, in the main, been created by the panic speeches they have made in the last three or four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And deliberately so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>These speeches began because the Government set out to make the country believe that whatever economic difficulties were there were in some way or other created by the inter-Party Government and that whatever problems and difficulties they had to face, these problems and difficulties were a legacy bequeathed to them by their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> They began by one of the early speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which he dealt with prices.  He excused himself by saying that he was left a foot-high pile of recommendations, that he had inherited these, and that whatever responsibility for these increases was to be apportioned should be laid on his predecessors. I will come to that later.  Having succeeded in that technique in the first fortnight or month the Government apparently came to the conclusion that it was good political tactics to create a panic and scare, and, having created that panic and that scare, to attempt to apportion responsibility to the previous Government and to seek to lay the responsibility for the situation which has resulted at the feet of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In company with the other Deputies who have spoken during the course of this debate, I want to refute these worthless allegations, and to refute them by the recitation of a few simple facts.  This Government took office at a time when, during the preceding month, prices had been rising.  That situation started, according to Fianna Fáil, in August or September last year. It was caused by two factors, by devaluation and by the stockpiling which had occurred as a result of the Korean war.  I remember, this time last year, saying the same thing.  Fianna Fáil then denied it, but it may be that contact with the facts and realisation that what I said then was the truth has made them alter their opinion.  That situation was tackled by the Government in the only way in which it could be tackled.  It may be that our efforts were not as successful as we imagined. We thought that it would have been possible by controls to influence prices. Faced with that situation we set out to do two things, to have available here sufficient supplies of goods, so that if the supply position deteriorated we would be capable of meeting whatever difficulties the country might have to face, and, in addition, to control as effectively as possible within the limits of price control machinery, and to offset in whatever way it was possible to do it, the effect of rising prices.</P>
    <P>This Government inherited conditions <Col N="758" /> in which the rise had to a considerable extent exhausted itself, or certainly, over a wide range of commodities, was at any rate on the point of exhaustion and the earlier steep rise had lessened in most of the other commodities.  When the Government came in the policy, as announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and followed by the Minister for Finance, was to create a scare and a panic.  The result of that scare and panic was not foreseen by the Government because if it were foreseen they must have realised that the scare and crisis atmosphere which had been fomented by their speeches would react unfavourably if they were to seek to float a public loan.  It is obvious from the policy that had been announced by the inter-Party Government that in order to finance the capital development programme another loan would have been required in the autumn of this year.  It was the intention of the previous Minister for Finance to float such a loan but the present Minister for Finance initiated a campaign designed to create an atmosphere of crisis.  The result of these speeches, if not foreseen by him at the time, was to create circumstances in which the Government could not go to the public and ask for a public subscription, and instead of that they drew on the Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the money that has been wasted by the inter-Party Government.  Last week I asked a question to find out the total proceeds of the Counterpart Fund and Deputy Declan Costello asked a more detailed question inquiring the date on which the proceeds of dollars allocated to Ireland under Marshall Aid were first received: (b) the amount of expenditure out of such funds up to the 13th June, 1951; and (c) the amount of such expenditure from 13th June, 1951, to 25th October, 1951.  The Minister, in reply, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) Of the proceeds of dollar borrowings from the United States Government £18.1 million had been expended at 13th June, 1951.</P>
    <P>(c) Further expenditure in the period from 14th June, 1951, to 25th <Col N="759" /> October, 1951, amounted to £18.5 million.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that in the short space of four months the present Government spent more out of Marshall Aid than the previous Government had spent since the fund was first opened in January, 1949. We had better have less talk about the dissipation of our American assets, because this Government created a panic and a crisis which precluded them from going to the public to borrow money, and which would, as was announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget, have been used to finance the Counterpart Fund but which would also have had the very valuable function of lessening the inflationary effect.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report has commented at length on the inflationary effect in relation to a number of commodities.  One of the methods of dealing with an inflationary situation and of lessening its incidence is to siphon off excessive money in the hands of the community.  That can be done, as has been done in Britain, by imposing a very high rate of taxation or it can be done by a combination of taxation and of asking the people to lend to the Government for productive purposes.  We endeavoured to achieve, and succeeded in achieving, that result by borrowing and by keeping the burden of taxation as light as possible, but the present Government, instead of withdrawing this money, which was available, by floating a loan, damaged the credit of the country and the prospect of securing a loan.  Faced, however, with the need of funds to carry on the various development schemes that were in progress, they borrowed from the Counterpart Fund, thereby themselves participating in creating, and in making more acute, the inflationary position which had already been commented upon by the Central Bank.  Not merely was that situation dangerous and bad from the point of view of public finance, but an even more serious aspect of it has been the noticeable deterioration in trade. It may be that this recession, as it is euphemistically called, is not peculiar to this country, but however we may be affected by outside influences, the <Col N="760" /> present Government, with a number of speeches calculated to frighten the public and to create financial uneasiness, succeeded in influencing the banks to restrict credit.  The result has been that, despite a somewhat higher level of advances, as is shown from the banking returns&mdash;and that is only up to September and is not an actual criterion&mdash;a whole variety of smaller operators have found themselves restricted in credit.</P>
    <P>The position has now deteriorated to the extent that, for the first time since the end of the war, certainly for the first time in the last three or four years, there is evidence of rising unemployment. That position is one which should not have arisen, and that would not have arisen, if the Government had acted in the way in which the previous Minister for Finance had announced it was proposed to finance the capital development programme and if, instead of seeking to damage public credit for political purposes, they had gone to the public and said that they believed in the capital development programme, in an expansion of the resources of the country, and that they favoured the utilisation of national credit to the maximum extent and were prepared to initiate, and ask the public to subscribe to, a development loan for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, the position was allowed to deteriorate and the Government, faced with that situation, then decided to blame the inter-Party Government for the position in order to divert attention from their own inability to deal with the problem and to provide the solution which they asserted they had before the change of Government.</P>
    <P>I think nobody who has spoken in this debate has attempted to deny that the present balance of payments position is one which requires some attention and that the gap should be closed or reduced.  Deputies must, however, throw their minds back to the position as it obtained say in June, 1950, and particularly between June and December of last year.  At that time, when the Korean war broke out, it was obvious that every country in the world was engaged either in an armaments race or in trying to stockpile <Col N="761" /> raw materials.  The previous Government in these circumstances decided in the national interest that it was essential to stockpile against that situation.  At that time, day in and day out, during the autumn and winter sessions of the Dáil, and on every possible occasion, we had the then Opposition criticising the then Government because we were alleged not to be guarding against the position that was likely to arise, and urging us to stockpile and to buy up materials, whenever and wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The Government recognised its responsibility in that regard and succeeded in importing large quantities of goods.  It may be that we did not get all the goods we required or that in the course of that operation somewhat minor quantities of non-essentials were imported but, in the main, the goods that we imported were goods that were essential either for capital development or in order to guard against any deterioration in the supply position.  I invite Deputies to examine the import list given in Table V of the paper on the trend of external trade and payments.  With the possible exception of a few items&mdash;we are all familiar with the circumstances which required the importation of butter&mdash;there is scarcely a single item on that list that could be deleted.  Most of them refer to equipment or machinery or goods for capital use, or essential supplies such as tea, tobacco and coal.  I do not think there has been any suggestion in the course of the debate that it is proposed to limit the importation of these goods.  It is on that aspect that I want to try to find out what Government policy is and what they propose to do.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report is very critical of the present high rate of consumption and it says on page 14, dealing with subsidies:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true that removal of subsidy might tend somewhat to increase the cost of living but some inconvenience in this respect must be weighed against the compensating gains, including especially the reduction of consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Central Bank meant by that statement.  Nobody with any degree of regard for the necessity <Col N="762" /> of providing our people with a high standard of living would suggest that we should restrict consumption only to commodities that are subsidised.</P>
    <P>People reading that might not be aware that the four items that are subsidised are butter, tea, bread and sugar&mdash;in the case of sugar the subsidy is no longer applicable. These are essential foodstuffs. I do not think that anybody with any sense would suggest that the subsidy should be removed or that any steps should be taken, as long as the goods are available, either from home production or imports, that would reduce the amount which is available at the present time for consumption.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, at column 302, Volume 127, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Central Bank says the solution is to cut down consumption.  The Government believe that the solution is to increase the level of production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that statement everybody will agree, but will the Government point out any practical step which will achieve a substantial rise in production or any rise that is capable in the immediate future of reducing the gap in our balance of payments?  It is quite obvious that there is not any immediate step that can be taken, and that the only steps capable of expanding our production were the steps that had been taken by the previous Government to develop our resources, to put land that was not in production or was not up to the optimum fertility into that condition, to expand industry, to develop our power resources, to provide increased opportunities for employment, to drain rivers, and so forth.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant features of our economy has been the static output from agriculture.  It may be that the measures which we took in recent years had not an opportunity of showing results.  It is a reasonable assumption that the steps which were taken, the incentives that were provided, the opportunities that were made available to farmers for increased production could not show results in the short space of three years.  Some of them <Col N="763" /> had already shown results.  Our exports of live stock&mdash;the increased numbers under a number of headings&mdash;were showing the proper trend but, taking it over the years, the most disappointing feature of our economy has been the static condition of agricultural output.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a very remarkable expansion of industrial output and, despite that substantial rise, it is obvious that if we are to make any headway in reducing the gap between imports and exports, the only real solution lies in a substantial increase in agricultural output.  It is true that our agricultural and industrial exports showed satisfactory rises in recent years, but there is not any indication that the tendency which was there will increase sufficiently rapidly to enable the gap to be closed.  Therefore, we are entitled to ask the Government what remedies they propose, and what steps they contemplate.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the other aspect of the gap that we had under consideration and which could show, and I believe would show, a reasonable result if the proper methods were applied, that is, the development of tourism and the development of exports to the dollar area but, in order to export, we must first produce.</P>
    <P>The previous Government invited to this country a team of experts from the United States to advise on tourism. Having got their report, we prepared legislation.  When the change of Government took place, that legislation was ready, and the Bill had actually been introduced.  The Bill lapsed at the dissolution, and the present Minister reintroduced it.  I cannot understand the reason for the delay in the introduction or circulation of the Tourist Traffic (Amendment) Bill.  The only step taken in connection with tourism has been the establishment of a third body to deal with the tourist policy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enlarge to-night on any question dealing with tourism except to say that it does not appear to be the line likely to achieve the most rapid results merely to set up a third body instead of proceeding with the <Col N="764" /> implementation of the recommendations that have been based on expert examination, acknowledged by all who came in contact either with the report or the investigators to be an examination of competent persons.  The present Government has not announced any policy to bridge the gap.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have heard from the Ministry for Industry and Commerce that it is proposed to increase taxation, proposed to raise, by means of additional taxation, additional revenue in order to bridge some of the gap, part of which was created by the present Government.  I do not know whether Deputies realise that one of the most effective methods of increasing the cost of living is higher taxation.  We all remember that Fianna Fáil in the past believed in a policy of high taxation.  They brought in a Budget in the autumn of 1947 and imposed additional taxation amounting to £7,000,000 in order to increase the subsidy on certain commodities and in order to prevent deterioration in the situation which then confronted them. In the short space of a few months after the change of Government that taxation had been remitted without any reduction in subsidy and at the same time an increase was granted in respect of social services for old age pensioners, widows and orphans and blind pensioners.</P>
    <P>Now, with the return of the Fianna Fáil Government, we have been told that it is the policy to increase taxation.  I do not know how they expect to get the increase in output or the expansion in industrial development, which are accepted as being necessary, if taxation is increased, because, as most Deputies realise, there are only a few sources from which additional revenue can readily be got.  We endeavoured to lighten the burden as much as possible, and in the course of our period of office we reduced taxation on a number of occasions.  The present Government has announced that it proposes to increase it.</P>
    <P>There were, of course, two objects of their tax policy in the past, tobacco and beer and spirits.  It is true that additional revenue can be got by raising the tax on these two commodities. <Col N="765" /> It is possible that some small addition could be got from an increase in income-tax but it is nothing in comparison with a tax on these other commodities and it would have the additional disadvantage of reducing the incentive to business, of imposing additional burdens on industrialists, and of limiting the expansionist policy which is essential if the present situation is to be tackled effectively.</P>
    <P>Almost every Minister for Industry and Commerce and every Minister for Finance in recent years has been subjected to a good deal of criticism and comment from various bodies of industrialists, manufacturers and traders in general.  They have been complaining about the high level of taxation, criticising the burdens that have been placed upon them, commenting on the method of taxation.  From that point of view there is a good deal to be said because the present tax system is to a considerable extent outmoded but, up to the present, they have failed to convince the Ministers dealing with it that the problem was one which merited any substantial alteration.  It may be that pressure of other business prevented Ministers from devoting time to a full examination of the position. However that may be, the one predominant feature which characterised all these reports and all the representations made to the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce was the burden which taxation placed on any possibility of an expansion in business.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the present Government propose to increase taxation.  In the whole course of this debate we have not heard a single instance of any remedy which the Government proposed to adopt&mdash;with the exception of the references by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to increased taxation.  There has been no suggestion that it is proposed to cut down imports.  There has been no suggestion that there is any immediate method by which we can expand substantially exports or increase our other earnings either by an expansion of the tourist business or by an increase in emigrants' remittances.  The Government has attempted to create a crisis &mdash;although the Minister for Industry <Col N="766" /> and Commerce said last week that we have no crisis yet.</P>
    <P>They have attempted to create a crisis and&mdash;as they themselves must recognise&mdash;the result is that for the first time in three years there is rising unemployment and an absolute stagnation in trade.  To meet that situation which was created by themselves, the Government have offered no suggestion of any step which should be taken or which they believe they must take except the prospect of higher taxation next year.  Because of this situation that has been created, the Government seek to put the blame on the inter-Party Government.  In order to prevent the public from recognising that the deterioration that has occurred has been created and fomented by themselves, the present Government seek to confuse the public, and the atmosphere of crisis which has persisted over the last two or three months was designed to damage the record of the inter-Party Government. But the Government fails to recognise that their policy would engulf themselves in difficulties which they now seek to evade.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go over the ground which Deputies on this side of the House have already covered.  Time and again, we have expressed the view that as import prices rise the increase must be reflected in the cost of commodities here.  That position has been recognised only recently by the present Government.  I want to deal with three commodities whose price has been increased as a result of deliberate Government action and which was uninfluenced by any outside consideration. The price of butter was increased. When the inter-Party Government increased the price of butter by 2d. a lb. earlier this year we recognised that it was right and proper that that increase should be met by the consumer and that it would be wrong, with the high level of subsidies, to raise the subsidies still further.  The present Government increased the price of butter by 2d. a lb. but they omitted to say that they added an additional burden of £400,000 to the subsidy as well.  It was obvious that that increase could be compared with the increase granted by the inter-Party <Col N="767" /> Government and it was easy for them to say: &ldquo;We did no worse than our predecessor.&rdquo;  They omitted to tell the public that there is a burden that will have to be met and paid for before the end of the financial year.</P>

      <P>The present Government also increased the price of eggs and milk.  Probably the heaviest burden which had been imposed on any section of the community was that which was imposed in the past few weeks upon the section of the community least able to bear it.  We decided early this year to increase the old age pensions.  We did so because we recognised that the weakest sections of the community were least able to bear any increase that had occurred. We decided to give an additional 2/6&mdash; and that undertaking was honoured by the present Government when it assumed office.  However, in the past fortnight or three weeks the price of cheap fuel vouchers, which formerly cost 6d.  to people in the boroughs, was increased to 1/6&mdash;thereby reducing, in one single blow, almost the whole effect of the increase we had granted earlier this year in respect of old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed at the silence of the members of the present Government in respect of the rise in prices that has occurred, and I am amazed at the lack of interest they are displaying in this debate.  This time last year every Deputy that could be got to go to the House was supplied with notes, facts, figures and information to enable him to make a speech criticising the then Government.  The price increases that occurred in the first few months of this year, and last year, pale into insignificance beside the price increases that have taken place recently in respect of butter, eggs and milk.  The present Government decided to give these increased prices for political purposes. They did so in order to placate some of their own followers and because of the lesson which they learned during the course of the election.  The prices of these three essential foodstuffs affect the working-man's budget.  The increased prices of these foodstuffs affect the old age pensioners and the <Col N="768" /> widows and orphans far more than any of the price increases that occured during the previous five or six months. On top of all that, in the past fortnight or three weeks, the price of the fuel voucher has been increased.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the present Government or their supporters realise that they misled the public during the course of the last election.  I do not know whether they are ashamed of their attitude during the course of that election and are afraid now to come in and express the same criticism&mdash;with the same vigour and over a similarly protracted period&mdash;as they did during the course of this debate last year.  If they have any shame left, they should apologise to, and sympathise with, those on whom they have placed burdens in the past three or four months.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate, the Minister for Industry and Commerce purported to deal with price control. He attempted to give an account of the manner in which price control had been operated by his predecessor.  He purported to say that when he came into office&mdash;maybe this is a phrase which he used earlier&mdash;there was a pile of applications a foot high.  I assert now that there were only three major applications before the Department of Industry and Commerce when the change of Government took place and if the thickness is to be measured by the size of the files it would not amount to an inch.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with one or two items.  The Minister mentioned the question of meat and said that his predecessor had received a recommendation from the Prices Advisory Body for an increase of 3d. per lb. in respect of meat; that he had deferred action, and that, in addition, he had decided no prosecutions could take place while the consideration of the proposed increase was deferred.  First of all, when we got the recommendation from the Prices Advisory Body we did not automatically accept it.  It is obvious that the present Government has either accepted it or, where it is a difficult case such as the price of meat, which would involve a rise of 3d. per lb., they decided to decontrol it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> Last April, the Minister for Industry and Commerce got a recommendation from the Prices Advisory Body advising him that meat should be raised by 3d. per lb.  He decided not to assent to that recommendation and he asked that the question be further examined to see if any change in the price cuts which it was proposed to fix would enable a lower increase to be sanctioned.  It was while they were reinvestigating or while these inquiries were being made that it was decided to postpone taking any action in respect of breaches of the Order, but the matter was only under consideration and it was not decided to take any action because the Minister had refused to sanction an increase in price.</P>

      <P>The other case was an application from a brewer and because there was only one application from an individual brewer it was decided to defer it until the Brewers' Association made an application.  We have not yet heard the effect of that. I understand it is still under consideration. There were about a dozen other cases from the Gas Company.  These could be regarded as one particular form of application although there might be an application from each individual gas company in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to ask if it is possible to get from the Government an indication <Col N="770" /> of what is Government policy.  As far as this debate is concerned, it started with the Tánaiste repudiating the Central Bank because he said he wanted to make it quite clear that the line which the Government intended to follow to the solution of these problems is diametrically opposite to that which the Central Bank suggests.  That statement was made on 7th November. The <i>Irish Press</i> did not know when they wrote their leading article on 24th October that there was going to be a change of front because in that leading article they deal with the report of the directors of the Central Bank and go on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They do not speak as politicians; they are bankers, professional economists, leaders of commerce, agriculture, labour, etc., and, presumably, hold different political views.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They had been referring to a speech made by Deputy Costello.  It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Mr. Costello is consistent he will accuse them of trying to raise a scare, though no reasonable person could regard their report as anything but sober and objective.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to describe it as objective and it is sober to the point of stagnation.  At that time, the <i>Irish Press</i> did not know that there was going to be a change of front in the Government.  We have yet to see the leading article that will follow this debate or the leading article that the leader writer will be capable of writing when he decides which Minister is to be followed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance talked a good deal of nonsense this evening but he did not indicate any line of Government policy.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that they were diametrically opposed to the Central Bank approach.  It is quite obvious that if the developmental schemes the Government initiated&mdash; some of which were only partly completed and some of which were only about to begin&mdash;are to be carried to fruition money must be spent.  If the development programme of the Electricity Supply Board, land reclamation, turf development, drainage, local authorities' <Col N="771" /> works, housing, hospitalisation and all the other gigantic schemes that were stipulated by the inter-Party Government are to progress money must be made available and the money must be got.  The Department that will seek to get it as vigorously as any other Department or probably more vigorously than most will be the Department of Industry and Commerce. Apparently the sober, objective Report of the Central Bank suggests that restriction should be imposed on the various development schemes, such as housing, hospitalisation, electricity generating development and so forth. We have not yet heard from the Government how these schemes will be financed.  They have dissipated more of the American Loan in the course of four months than the previous Government spent on productive purposes during the previous two and a half years since the loan was first started. £18.1 million were spent in two years, and in four months the present Government spent £18.5 million.</P>
    <P>I know that they have sought to create this atmosphere of crisis in order to divert public attention from the serious position that has resulted because of the rise in the cost of living. They recognise that, because of the rise in the cost of living, their policy has been proved a failure.  The most notable feature of this debate has been the silence of the Government spokesmen, and even more significant has been the silence of some of those who were critical during the course of the debate last year.  Some of those Deputies were removed by the electorate. I do not know why others have been so silent, but it may be an indication that they appreciate that the present Government and those who supported them misled the public, and that at the first available opportunity, whenever an election comes, the public will deal with them as they dealt in the past with this Government when they misrepresented them, and alleged it was possible to control the cost of living, to keep prices from rising, when they recognised that the situation which had resulted was entirely outside our control and entirely due to external prices rises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> In regard to the four items I have mentioned&mdash;butter, eggs, milk and the cheap fuel voucher&mdash;prices have been increased by direct Government action for political purposes in order to placate or allay the criticism that was manifest in the speeches made by a number of their supporters.</P>
    <P>We want to see the development programme that was initiated by the inter-Party Government brought to a successful conclusion.  We recognise that the programme entails borrowing. We believe it is better to borrow the money from the people than to impose taxation on them.  We can get the money by borrowing.  You can get people who have surplus money and who have confidence in the future of the country, and who are prepared to put that money in use for development purposes who will subscribe to these loans, but because of the atmosphere of crisis and the crippling effect of these speeches upon trade and commerce, and because of the resulting rise in unemployment created by that atmosphere of crisis the present Government cannot face the public, and in order to carry on the finances of the nation they borrowed from the American Counterpart Fund.  If it is proposed to finance these gigantic schemes and if it is proposed to keep these schemes going at the rate at which it was expected when the schemes were started they would be carried on, it is essential that money should be made available, and the only way in which money can be made available is by borrowing from the public, because no increase in taxation that the public would be capable of bearing can provide sufficient funds to meet that capital development programme.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged during this debate and in speeches made by Government spokesmen over the past few months that the ordinary domestic Budget did not balance.  The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that that allegation is untrue and that not alone was the Budget balanced but there was a surplus left to pay for the increases sanctioned by the previous Government for State servants, for the Army and for the Garda and, at the same time, to finance the proposed mother and child health service.  Not <Col N="773" /> only was the Budget balanced but a surplus was available to meet the commitments which it was anticipated would arise before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>This debate has had one salutary effect.  It has shown the country that the atmosphere of crisis and the stampeding effect of ministerial speeches, the gloom and all the circumstances associated with the gloomy speeches were unnecessary and uncalled for.  It is recognised and accepted by the Opposition that the gap in our balance of payments requires to be remedied&mdash; that we must expand our output, must expand exports and increase our other earnings&mdash;but that cannot be done by spreading gloom, by creating conditions in which business men are afraid to invest either in industry or in agriculture, afraid to invest in public loans or private enterprise development.</P>
    <P>It cannot be done by creating a situation in which, not merely are business men afraid to invest, but the banks, by a restrictionist policy, and business executives, by a restrictionist policy, are bringing about conditions in which there is more unemployment at present than at any time since the end of the second world war.</P>
    <P>For remedying such a situation, we had designed a policy, a policy which succeeded&mdash;a policy of developing the country, of expanding our economy, of providing increased employment, bringing about increased exports, better housing, better hospitalisation and better social services, while at the same time lightening the burden of taxation, because wherever capital schemes are concerned, as Deputy Norton said earlier, it is nothing short of madness to expect to pay for capital development out of one year's earning or to pay for a capital development programme out of the current Budget by heavy additional taxation.  I do not know whether this debate will succeed in effecting a change of heart or a change of outlook on the part of the Government.  If it does, it will have done probably the best thing we could have expected from it, because we recognise that, so long as the present Government is in office, we cannot have the progress we would expect or the <Col N="774" /> progress that would have been possible under the inter-Party Government. Anybody who looks at the present Ministry could not but be gloomy, and it may be that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance started making these gloomy speeches, they were more affected by their colleagues than by the financial circumstances of the country.</P>
    <P>We want the House and the country to recognise that there is no reason for the crisis atmosphere, no reason for gloom and no reason for the trade recession which has been caused mainly by Government speeches, but that there is a situation which requires remedying, a situation which must be remedied by the application of the appropriate methods applied at the right time and in proper sequence.  If that enlightened financial policy which was carried on by the previous Minister for Finance were allowed to proceed, and if the confidence which had been generated in the resources of the country were stimulated instead of being stifled by the present Government, this debate on the various gloomy speeches and on the crisis atmosphere would never have come about and the people who are now out of employment and faced with the price rises which I have mentioned would not be faced with these problems.</P>
    <P>Those responsible for it will have to answer for it either in this House or whenever the election comes, and some of those who, by their action, succeeded in establishing this Government in office, will have more to answer for than they have as yet anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate concerns, first of all the Supplies and Services Bill, and, secondly, the amendment by Deputy MacBride with reference to the Central Bank Report, but it has roamed from election speeches and supposed election promises to all kinds of references to economic matters, national and international and, in the case of many speakers, in a manner which clearly shows that they have very little knowledge of what they are talking about or that they are deliberately and maliciously attempting to mislead and confuse the public as to the real situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> We have heard references to the banks and we have been told that the banks have considerable assets which they operate in a certain way and that they sometimes act on behalf of the Government in the restriction of credit to their clients.  I should like to approach this whole subject from the point of view of trying to get the ordinary individual, the ordinary man in the street, to understand the exact circumstances within which we must operate, so long as we subscribe to the principle of the rights of private property, or, as some people might say, so long as we are working within this particular system, which is not an extreme Socialist system.  We have a Constitution which protects private property and private enterprise and also every single type of individual that goes to make up the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And our Constitution directs our credit to be controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am coming to that.  It is true that our banks have moneys which come to them from their clients on the one hand.  People deposit money in the banks or have credit balances in current accounts and the banks are trustees for the people to whom that money belongs.  But they are commercial concerns and they operate also with a profit motive.  They have to be careful, in the carrying out of their business operations, that all of their depositors or all of those who have credit balances can demand their money whenever they need it or whenever they want it.  It would be ridiculous for us in discussing banks to suggest that the banks would become not only the custodians of their clients' money but that they would be entitled to lend out all this money on long-term loans and deprive their clients of their money whenever they call for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first of all to approach this matter from the point of view of trying to understand what we are talking about.  It must be admitted, therefore, that the banks have an obligation to their clients first and when they lend money they must be sure <Col N="776" /> that they lend or invest it in a fashion which enables them to pay it to their clients when they demand it.  Consequently, they have to use their wisdom and their judgment, as a result of long experience, as to how they will carry on their business and not have the situation created where the banks would have to close their doors if there were demands for money which could not be met.  I think that must be accepted by all of us as the position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will create no unhealthy fears nor fears which are not unhealthy.  Our ordinary joint stock banks control considerable assets.  They loan out a certain amount to clients by way of overdraft, they loan out a certain amount on short-term loans on reduced rates of interest, where they have a surplus of cash not earning, and they invest in what used to be called gilt-edged securities readily marketable &mdash;again a proportion of the money within their control.  They have to make a certain amount of profit in order to pay their staffs, in order to pay their shareholders a dividend and in order to make provision for contingencies which unforeseen circumstances may create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> Now, we have a Central Bank.  I was very amused when I listened partly, but read completely, the criticism of the Central Bank by Deputy MacBride.  I thought he was going to show us, first of all, how useless this institution was, how stupidly it was carrying on its affairs and how the finances at its control might have been used to better advantage for the community as a whole.  Right through the learned counsel's speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a Deputy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Deputy, the learned counsel's speech, it was quite clear that he was uncertain, that while he made references to reports and speeches he had not at any stage convinced himself that he knew anything about the real situation of the Central Bank.  Certainly, he did not disclose it here.  As I understand the Central Bank, it is set up under an Act of this House and its functions are defined and limited.  One of the functions is to hold on deposit from the joint stock banks a percentage of the money that these banks have on deposit from their clients.  This deposit with them varies.  It varies also in connection with an ever-reducing amount of paper money issued by the joint stock banks which previously&mdash;before the existence of the Central Bank or the Currency Commission&mdash;issued Irish paper money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is there a situation which the Central Bank has to keep in mind, similar to that which the ordinary bank has to keep in mind as far as its clientele is concerned.  The Central Bank has to pay a deposit rate of interest to the joint stock banks for the money they have on deposit with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank then can lend money for certain purposes, and it tries to make a sufficient margin to meet calls on it plus its operating expenses.  Deputy MacBride said here something which I am sure he will take an opportunity of withdrawing.  He said, in almost an hysterical fashion, that the Central Bank was lending its resources at a cheap rate of interest to the British to enable them to build <Col N="778" /> houses in England.  He knows that that is entirely wrong.  The Central Bank does not lend any money to Engand on a long-term basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they lend on a short-term basis.  Therefore, they cannot use that money on any long-term basis.</P>

However, I am not going to be knocked off my train of thought by these interjections.  The Deputy was quite wrong when he tried to convey to the public as a fact that the Central Bank is lending its resources to England for long-term purposes.</P>

They, of course, belong to the private individual who happens to have some portion either in the shape of cash or in the shape of investment.  That is what makes up the vast bulk of our external assets.

      <P>It has been referred to as if that were the case.  Our external assets are, of course, affected if we have a serious adverse trade balance.  There are certain ways to attempt to cure that.  You can cure an adverse trade balance by prohibiting non-essential imports; you can attempt to cure it by increasing production and increasing exports; you can, to some extent, try to get what has not been quite possible during the last few years&mdash;the world price for the items we export instead of the fictitious price which we have been getting in most of our markets, a lower price, much lower than the world value.  Our exportable commodities should have commanded a much higher price.  Obviously the trend is rapidly developing in that direction because we are now finding other markets, hard currency markets, for some of the commodities previously exported to a certain area.</P>
      <P>They are bringing in considerably higher prices and carrying in those prices a levy which is being utilised by way of subsidy to eliminate tubercular cattle.  That is quite a good idea.  That is the approach we should make to the question, and not talk nonsense here as though the politics of this Dáil affected in large measure the position to which we have been brought in matters of finance by circumstances completely outside our control.</P>

      <P>I will come to it in time.  I have my own notes here.  We want to create something in this country, and that is not new for this Party, because this Party has consistently since its inception tried to educate public thought, and direct it towards making this country as self-sufficient as it can be made industrially and agriculturally, and it has tried during its years of office to establish confidence among business men and industrialists, so as to induce them to put their money in native industries. Who destroyed that confidence?&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, having regard to the existing costs of production, the present prices paid to the producer for milk supplied to creameries and for milk sold for human consumption are inadequate and that immediate steps should be taken to increase the price so as to give the producer the cost of production plus a fair profit.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy Corry.)</P>

      <P>When speaking on this matter last Wednesday I had not the advantage of having a copy of the costings prepared by Professor Murphy, of University College, Cork, with regard to the production of milk, for the Cork Milk Producers' Association.  I should like, first of all, to bring to the notice of the house the basis of the costings as regards farm produce.  For the purpose of these costings hay was valued at £5 a ton; turnips 20/- a ton; mangels 30/- a ton.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the present Minister for Agriculture with his knowledge of agriculture would dream for one moment of saying that these were fair prices for agricultural produce even in that year.  He will remember <Col N="784" /> that on the last occasion on which we went into costings the cost of the production of beet was found to have increased by something like £4 17s. 6d. per acre and that has to be added to these items I have mentioned so that the Minister would get a fair idea of what we are driving at.  Last week we had Deputy O'Higgins telling us, as reported in column 309 of the Official Report for 7th November, that the increase in the price of butter was due to political cowardice.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We had an election campaign a short time before in which the price of butter was one of the matters upon which the last Government was being attacked.  We had these advertisements in relation to the price of butter published at a heavy cost.  Within three weeks of the change of Government the present Government itself increased the price of butter, presumably in order <Col N="785" /> to buy some support.  I do not know whether the increase in the price of butter was necessary or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a good statement from a Deputy who was only three months out of office considering some of the statements he made during the election.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I do not know whether subsidies could not have met the increased cost if it was felt that the farmers should get a higher price for milk.  I do know that the increase in the price of milk led to an increase in the price of butter and cheese.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the price of milk was increased by 1d. a gallon there was a general attack by inspired articles in the Press and by Deputies opposite on the unfortunate farmer who was going to become a millionaire out of the increase of 1d. a gallon he was to get for milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the gentleman to try to conduct himself.  I was dealing with the basis on which these costings were taken.  I have given the basis for the food.  If the Minister has a copy of this document and turns to page 8 he will find there that the net cost of the production of milk was 18.45d. per gallon during the winter period and <Col N="786" /> 8.10d. during the summer period.  That was made up at a period when agricultural wages were £2 10s. Od. per week.</P>
      <P>The increase in the cost of production, so far as labour is concerned, is £1 12s. 1d., or 62 per cent. increase, which is exactly 2d. per gallon.  The cost of concentrates has gone up by something like 75 per cent. since these costings were taken from November, 1946, to October, 1947.  The cost of home-produced food, which I pointed out at the start was far too low, has gone up something like 70 per cent. since, so that the item here of 8.64d. per gallon for food will have to be increased by something over 5d. per gallon.  Herd maintenance has certainly increased enormously.  The miscellaneous costs, such as those relating to buckets, tankards, veterinary fees and all the rest of it have also been gone into.  The total increase in the cost of milk production since November, 1946, is somewhat around 7¾d. per gallon. There is an increase on the credit side of something like 2d., which leaves 5¾d. altogether.</P>
      <P>I am sure we are all anxious that we should not be placed in the position of having to import 3,000 tons of foreign butter into this agricultural country in order to feed our people.  The fact that we have to do so is largely due to want of courage on the part of this House, in the first place, and want of courage on the part of whatever Government is in office, in the second place.  One cannot expect the farmers in five or six of our counties, and the dairy herds of this country are confined to five or six countries, to produce milk in order to supply butter to the people of the Twenty-Six Counties while milk production remains uneconomic. The amount of milk produced in the other counties does not count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that the foundation of our agricultural industry, our dairy herds, is being wrecked year after year.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day what result this cutting to the bare bones on agricultural produce has had?  Since this Government came into office we have had a continual howl about the increase in the cost of living.  In the reply I got from the Minister to-day he told me <Col N="787" /> that two-thirds of the 1d. increase in the price of sugar was caused by the high cost of imported sugar.  We have had to pay something like £4,500,000 for foreign sugar because the Government of the day, when appealed to, refused to give 4/6 a ton increase to the farmer for his beet.  The Government of the day preferred to pay the equivalent of 30/- per ton to the foreigner for foreign sugar.</P>
    <P>I appeal now to the Minister to rectify the position.  I have been here for a long number of years, longer than I wish to remember, appealing to successive Governments to find out the cost of milk production.  There are eight or nine farms run by the Department of Agriculture.  It should not be an impossible task on one of these farms, farms that are run by managers earning anything from £800 to £1,000 a year, to find out the cost of milk production. After all, a group of farmers in Cork handed their farms over to University College and got the costings calculated.  Those are the only costings available at the present time in relation to milk production and we went to the trouble of getting them. They are there now for everybody's benefit.  The first thing I did was to make a present of a copy of them to the last Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, so that he would not be working in the dark, but I am sorry to say that it had no effect on that hard-hearted individual.  Despite the intrigues of Deputy Madden and all the rest of them, he could not be brought up to scratch, but he made a death-bed repentance and threw us a penny a gallon the day before he went out of office.  This year we have to go abroad to purchase 3,000 tons of butter.  Where will we get it?  What price will we have to pay for it?</P>

      <P>It is taken from Volume 126 of the Official Report of 27th June. 1951, at column 578:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A meeting of creamery managers from all the Munster counties, members of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association, was held at the Town Hall, Mallow, County Cork, yesterday.  The following statement was made after the meeting: &lsquo;This meeting is of the unanimous opinion that the quantity of creamery butter produced this year would be at least 15 per cent. down on last year's production, and that the Government is faced with the importation of a considerable quantity of Danish or New Zealand butter to meet the country's requirements, or, alternatively, reducing the present ration to 6 or even 4 ozs. a week&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that all the indications show that the United States, Canada and Australia would probably join the other butter-importing countries this year&mdash; that is Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland&mdash;it means that butter prices are undoubtedly going to be higher.</P>
      <P>The present sterling equivalent of creamery butter prices in the United States, Canada, Belgium and Germany to-day ranged from 449/3 to 550/- per cwt.  If those prices are to be paid for imported butter to the extent of about 25 per cent. of our total requirements, it is strongly urged that an economic price be now fixed for home milk producers so as to ensure that a sufficiency of Irish creamery butter is available for our own people next season.</P>
      <P>Three thousand tons to be bought from the foreigner at, taking the lowest price quoted there of 450/- a cwt., represents £1,350,000 of the Irish people's money paid to the foreigner for imported butter.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Due to the muddling of Deputy James Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture, our present Minister finds that he has to purchase 3,000 tons of foreign butter at the prices which I have quoted.  I do not know whether or not he has succeeded in getting it cheaper, especially in view of the way in which the old pound is being walloped around.  If we are going to be placed in the position of having to pay something like £1,500,000 to the foreigner for butter&mdash;to pay him a price which, if paid to the Irish farmer would get the greater portion anyway of that butter produced at home, the position is certainly very serious.</P>
      <P>What I am anxious about is that the Minister and his Department would set up a costings board here to go into the cost of the production of milk, to set up the costings board which he very kindly guaranteed to us a couple of months ago.  What I want to know is, how far he has gone, when this costings board is going to be set up, and whether we are going to get results from it.</P>

      <P>What I want from the Minister is a definite statement as to when we are going to get the costings board, and whether, in the meantime, he can do anything that will prevent farmers from selling their dairy herds and getting out of production.  I say that because that, unfortunately is the tendency all over.</P>
      <P>I do not intend at this stage to go into all the items which went to make up these costings in the manner in which they were made up.  The Minister has a copy of them, and they are a faithful reflection of the facts as found by Professor Murphy in 1946 and 1947.  Surely, you cannot increase agricultural wages by 62 per cent., you cannot increase the price of artificial manures, you cannot increase the price of cotton seed cake and the other concentrates needed for the production of milk and at the same time expect that the price of milk is to continue at the same old level.  It cannot be done.  The farmer, finding himself, unfortunately, faced with that condition of affairs, has a remedy and is turning to it.  It is practically impossible at the present time to get a decent milch cow except in the hands of men who have refused to take the advice of the Department, and who have turned to milking breeds. I would urge on the Minister to give immediate attention to this problem, and endeavour, by some means, to rectify the matter before it is too late to be rectified, and before we find ourselves compelled to go abroad for what there should be a surplus of in this country for our own people&mdash;butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I am not only concerned with the problem of the suppliers in the creamery areas, but, perhaps to a greater extent, with the problem of those who supply milk for human consumption.  Those who supply milk for human consumption receive a higher price than that paid at the creameries, but against that they receive back no separated milk for the feeding of livestock.  In addition, they are called upon to maintain a supply of milk the whole year round, thereby involving themselves in the considerable cost of keeping up their dairy herds.  They are the people who are very frequently compelled to go to fairs and buy cows when they are at the highest price in order that they may be in a position to maintain their yearly contracts.  These people are also deserving of consideration.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that a few years ago it looked as if the milk supply in the city area, and adjoining areas, was increasing.  The fact that it was increasing was used as an argument against the producer.  At present there is no surplus of milk whatever in the Dublin district area.  As a matter of fact, there is a great scarcity in many towns in Leinster in regard to whole milk because, apparently, the producers are not finding it economic to supply the full requirements of the various towns.  The result is that we have a serious shortage.</P>
      <P>On the motion which was before the House last week in regard to agricultural wages, I took a certain stand.  It was that this matter of wages should be adjusted in accordance with fundamental Christian principles and justice: that is to say that a body should be set up to find out what would be fair and just, and that on the findings of that body the Government should act.  I would not be logical if I did not take exactly the same stand in regard to the price paid to the farmer for milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion recommends an increase. I would much prefer to see that increase come about as a result of an impartial inquiry into every aspect of the question, into every item of costings, rather than that it should come about as a result of agitation or as a result of a shortage of supply.  I think, therefore, <Col N="792" /> that if the Minister is wise he will lose no time in setting up an impartial investigation into costings in regard to milk.  That will have to be a comprehensive and complete investigation, an investigation the findings of which cannot be questioned by, or from, any side.</P>
    <P>I have seen criticisms from various places in regard to farmers who ask for an investigation into their costings. These critics say, &ldquo;Why do not the farmers themselves form some kind of an organisation which would carry out an investigation into their costings?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that would meet the situation because the consuming public would, in all probability, not accept costings prepared by the producers alone.  In regard to beet, as the Minister knows, because he took an active part in the matter, a very impartial investigation was carried out in regard to costings and that investigation was controlled, not only by the producers of sugar beet, but also by a joint committee of producers of sugar beet and the representatives of the sugar beet factories.  In the same way, we want a thoroughly impartial and objective investigation into milk costings. We farmers, I think, are prepared to accept the findings of that investigation. No farmer or producer wants to inflict any injustice upon the consumer.  We recognise that milk is the most vital of human needs and there could be no justification for a price that would be unfair to the consumer, having regard to the costs of production.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable that the House should hear the statement recently made by the Coadjutor Bishop of Cork, Most Rev. Dr. Lucey.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Until we get over the notion that farming is less respectable than trading, working in a Government office, being a civil servant, etc., we are not valuing the farmer at his true worth to God and the community. And until the prices for his produce are such as to enable him to live as well as they live he is not getting his due in justice.  The farmer is as good a man as the best in the country.  His work is skilled work; it is hard work; it is work that does not admit of an eight-hour <Col N="793" /> day, or six-day week, or closing down for a fortnight in the summer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>His Lordship did not stop at doing justice to the farmer.  He also referred to the agricultural labourer.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farm labourer, too, no less than the farm owner, is a farmer. His, too, is an honourable calling. He, too, has a right to a due return for his work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then His Lordship refers to the fact that he does not want a levelling down of the salaries and wages of persons other than those engaged in agriculture. Rather he wants a levelling up, and he concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do want a levelling up of the country labourer's wages to the urban standard.  And that can come only by way of a just price for milk, eggs, pigs, poultry&mdash;the produce of mixed or genuine farming.  At the moment, the prices for these commodities are too low to give the farmer himself or his man the standard of living others in the community have.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am not sure.  I think it is from the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Now there you have the basis of a just and fair demand by those who are engaged in milk production and, as I have said. the Minister will meet these demands in a reasonable way if he proceeds immediately to investigate these costings in a thorough and impartial way. There is, however, of course, another obligation upon the Minister which, I think, he definitely did contract when taking office, and that was, he gave an undertaking that he would meet representatives of the agricultural community <Col N="794" /> if and when it was desirable in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that one of the promises he made when the Government was being formed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not a promise but it was part of a definite statement of policy by the Government, and it is part of a statement of policy which I am quite sure the Minister will have no hesitation in honouring.  His immediate predecessor refused to meet the representatives of the creamery milk producers and he described them as a Fianna Fáil ramp.  As a matter of fact they were nothing of the kind. They were a non-political, non-party body trying to advance the interests of those engaged in the dairying industry. I am sure that the Minister will not hesitate to meet these people and discuss with them this problem of costings investigation.</P>
      <P>In the same way I would like the Minister also to take the earliest opportunity to meet the producers in the Dublin milk supply area.  These people have a very efficient and representative organisation which is not concerned with pressing any political objective but is solely concerned with protecting the interests of producers and advancing the best interests of the dairying industry.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin district the position is that recommendations in regard to prices are made by what is known as the Dublin District Milk Board, which is representative not only of producers but also of wholesalers and other persons engaged in milk production and marketing.  That board unanimously recommended an increase.  I think they recommended an increase of 4d., but an increase of 2d. has been given up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Dublin district board have unanimously recommended an increase which has not been fully granted, I think it would be wise for the Minister to meet the representatives of the Dublin milk producers and discuss with them either in what way it would be possible to give them an improved price or to bring about a reduction in their costings. There is no doubt whatever that the <Col N="795" /> costs of milk production have increased enormously over the past year. Not only have feeding stuffs and fertilisers required for the farm increased but, in addition, very substantial increases in wages have taken place. The increase in wages in the Dublin district milk suppliers' area is much larger than that recommended by the Agricultural Wages Board because, with the competition of other organisations, farmers, though they may not be too generous, have found that, if they want to keep men on their farms where there is extensive dairying carried out, they have got to pay them a wage in excess of the minimum agricultural wage.</P>
    <P>That is a good thing.  Farm labourers who milk cows are engaged in one of the most arduous branches of the farming industry&mdash;a branch which involves long hours, overtime and Sunday work.  They are, therefore, entitled to fair remuneration.  It is not so pleasant for a young fellow to have to remain at work on Sundays when his neighbours are off to football matches, to cinema shows, and to other places.  As I said before, the farm workers are entitled to fair wages, but, in order to pay such wages, it is essential that the owner of the dairy herd must be met in a reasonable way.  The seriousness of this problem will be brought home to the Minister if he has looked, as I am sure he has, at the statistics of the number of dairy cows in this country.  We have heard a lot of talk about these cows for the past couple of years.  In actual fact, the number of milch cows in this country has fallen by 50,000 in the last year; that is a very dangerous trend.  On the milch cow depends the whole live-stock industry of the country and on the live-stock industry depends the whole agricultural industry, tillage and the other branches of farming.  It is a very serious matter, therefore, to find the number of milch cows being reduced from year to year, because the whole foundation thus falls out of the agricultural industry.  I think that, from every point of view, the Minister ought to give very serious attention to the suggestion which has been made to him by Deputy Corry and which I <Col N="796" /> would like to endorse strongly.  I would say to the Minister: &ldquo;Get down to the basis and find out what are the true figures in regard to costings.  Do not take any hearsay figures Deputies, or anybody else, may give you.  Get the true facts and, having got them, give the milk producer a firm undertaking that you, as Minister, will act on those.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As a new member to the House, I have been listening to Deputy Corry making statements.  I feel, in fact, I honestly believe, that Deputy Corry is not as innocent as he pretends to be of the facts which he has placed before the House.  My opinion as to the shortage of butter at the present time is based on two facts. While we have cause to regret one, we certainly should feel pleased as regards the second one.  Deputy Corry has stated in this House that we have to import butter.</P>
      <P>I agree with him on that point, but I would ask him to listen very carefully to what I have to say; I do not know what happened in Cork, but I know very well what happened in County Clare.  Deputy Corry and every member of this House knows what the farming community suffered as a result of last year's bad weather.  In the districts surrounding my native town of Ennistymon cows which were due to calve in March or April were sold to the factories in November because their owners were unable to provide sufficient feeding stuffs to feed their stock through the winter months.  I know of two and even ten people who came to the fairs in my native town from the surrounding districts in order to sell some of their cows.  In fact, one farmer of my acquaintance had to sell four of his eight cows in order that he would be able to keep the other four alive and carry on with his business. All this is certainly to be regretted, and Deputy Corry must agree with me that such a state of affairs led to the shortage of butter.</P>

      <P>May I now say that it is quite evident that there seems to be no definite policy on the part of the present Fianna Fáil-Cogan-Cowan Government as far as the price of milk is concerned.  We have the Minister broaching one type of policy, we find Deputy Corry&mdash;one of his henchmen&mdash; speaking on different lines, and we find the man who put in the Government&mdash; Deputy Cogan&mdash;formulating a different policy.  If there is one thing that can be said about the policy of the former Minister for Agriculture it is that when we made up the Government we were behind him no matter what line of action he took.  We supported him, and we had the courage to support him and to stand over whatever he did.  I sympathise with the present Minister for Agriculture.  Indeed, he must be a very unhappy man and not too proud of a policy which does not go down with his own followers.  We have had statements to-night that Deputy Corry doubts the Minister's undertakings, and Deputy Cogan unconsciously let out that one of the undertakings that was given when Government policy was being formulated on the 12th June last was that the milk producers would get what they wanted.  If that is what is responsible for having the present set-up in office, I am glad that the inter-Party Government was defeated because so long as they were in office, it could not be said that they were there as a result of bargaining, and Deputy Cogan knows that.  Deputy Cogan is the one man who does know that.  It is extraordinary to hear Deputy Corry putting up a case for an increased price for milk, and to hear Deputy Cogan making a like appeal.  Neither Deputy Cogan nor Deputy Corry has spoken one word in favour of the unfortunate person who has to purchase milk, butter or to buy cheese.  Surely there must be someone living in the constituencies of these Deputies who drink milk, eat butter or consume cheese? Yet these Deputies have no consideration whatever for their constituents in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be prepared to support Deputy Corry's motion if the Minister will give an undertaking that if milk <Col N="799" /> producers get an increase of 2d., 4d. or 6d. per gallon, 2d. per lb. will not be added to the price of every pound of butter a poor man buys or that 4d. a lb. is not going to be added to the price of every pound of cheese.  Is it not high time that the present Government gave some consideration to the unfortunate poor person?  There is quite a large section of farmers in the constituency which I represent but, at the same time, I feel I must have some consideration for the working class who have to suffer while Deputy Corry's farmers in East Cork and certain farmers in Deputy Cogan's constituency are allowed to get fatter, and richer, while the poor grow thinner and poorer.  I am not prepared to support a policy of that kind.  I am not prepared to support an increase in the price of milk if that means an increase in the price of a pound of butter for the poor man.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Ryan, at every possible opportunity making an appeal that people should consume more butter to improve their health.  To guard against tuberculosis we are told by the present Minister for Health, and we were also told by the previous Minister, that it is necessary that children and mothers should consume plenty of butter.  Is it not sufficient for Deputy Corry and Deputy Cogan to know that as a result of their disgraceful conduct in the past six months, they have succeeded in raising the cost of living on the people, that they have succeeded in having the cost of every household commodity increased, without making further demands to-night to have the price of butter increased to such a prohibitive figure that no agricultural worker, civil servant, school teacher, garda, businessman or any section of the community other than the wealthy rich farmers whom Deputy Dillon made millionaires can afford to eat it? I make that statement with a full sense of responsibility, knowing that there are milk producers in my constituency.</P>

      <P>I make the statement knowing and believing that when Deputy Corry in this daft motion, asks that the present prices paid to the producer of milk supplied to creameries and for milk sold for human consumption, should be increased, it will mean an additional imposition even for the half-pint of milk that goes into the workingman's house where the worker, his wife and seven, eight or ten children, half-fed and half-naked, are endeavouring to exist.  To-night this House is asked to deny them that half-pint of milk by making the price prohibitive for the father, mother, or unfortunate widow.  If the Minister for Agriculture can increase the price of milk without its affecting old age pensioners in the city and in towns like Tullamore.  Birr, Portlaoighise, Mount-mellick and other areas in my constituency, I shall be with him and with Deputy Corry but if I find that the money which will be jingling in Deputy Corry's pocket for his milk is going to be taken out of the pocket of the road worker, the industrial worker, the civil servant or the businessman in my constituency, I shall oppose this proposal in the strongest possible manner.</P>
      <P>It will be observed from the motion that Deputy Corry wants the price increased so as to give the producer the cost of production &ldquo;plus a fair profit.&rdquo;  Anybody who knows Deputy Corry knows quite well that he has no idea of what a fair profit would be. Why has Deputy Corry not given us a specific figure so that we shall know what he means by a fair profit and know the amount by which he asks the Minister to increase the price of butter and cheese?  If he had done that, we would know what the unfortunate poor in the towns and cities are to be asked to pay for their butter.  It is necessary for us to have these figures but the Deputy characteristically puts forward this motion in its present form, in order to pull the wool over the eyes of the people.  I challenge Deputy Corry to let us know what he considers a fair profit.  I am sure it would be of some assistance to the Minister also if the Deputy would indicate what his idea of a fair profit is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> Deputy Corry referred to the fact that Deputy Dillon when Minister for Agriculture increased the price of milk, and unfortunately that was followed by an increase in the price of butter.  For that he was cried down by members of the Opposition in every town and city in the country, and the present Minister, Deputy Corry and other members of his Party promised the country to bring down the cost of living.  So far from doing that they added another 2d. per lb. to the price of butter immediately they got into office.  If that is Fianna Fáil's method of bringing down the cost of living, it is one that could only be conceived by a Government coming from a mental hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has given us a quotation from a speech by Most Reverend Dr. Lucey.  Of course we do not know where he got that quotation.  He does not know what paper the report appeared in.  He does not know the date of issue; he knows little about it beyond the fact that he is introducing the name of Dr. Lucey for the purpose of making a certain case in this House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry referred to imported butter, and asked why we should import any butter.  He said there would be no necessity to import butter if our farmers were given a reasonable price with a fair profit.  There would be no need to produce any butter because nobody would be able to buy it, if the price were fixed according to the manner in which the present Minister would fix it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Corry was on this side of the House for three and a half years, every time he spoke on agriculture he referred to the imported butter.  His nostrils went to the back of his head every time he pictured a pound of imported butter.  He once referred to it as bad car grease.  He referred to the distasteful odour that came from the <Col N="802" /> butter and said that it used to walk off the table by itself.</P>

      <P>If the imported butter was bad, if it had legs and walked when the inter-Party Government brought it in, the same must happen to it now.  The only difference is that, since they went to the other side of the House, Deputy Corry and Deputy Cogan have lost the sense of smell as well as other senses.  I say, without fear of contradiction, that it is only right and proper, when fixing prices, that the House should not accept a motion so vaguely framed as this one is.  Consideration should be given to the very large section of our people who consume butter, milk and cheese.  When our standard of living is raised sufficiently by way of improved social services, improved health facilities, all-round increases in wages, then probably consideration should be given to the application of the milk producers for an increase in the price of their butter, but, with the present trend in the cost of living and the decline in our standard of living, and having regard to the gloomy report submitted by the Central Bank and the disgusting, disgraceful White Paper submitted by the Minister for Finance that tells us to take off our good clothes and put on our rags and to remove the smiles from our faces and to get tears and cry again, is it not up to us to see that the people who are principally concerned with the cost of living, namely, the working-class people, do not have a further burden placed on their shoulders and that this House will not consider giving any further increases to the section that Deputy Corry speaks for until the greater section that Deputy Corry has forgotten, the working-class <Col N="803" /> people, and every citizen who consumes butter, milk and cheese, are provided for?</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Agriculture gives an undertaking that the acceptance of this motion will not mean an increase in the price of those commodities, I will vote for it and I will support it. Deputy Corry will have performed a useful act if, in respect of this motion, the Minister will tell us that he is prepared to increase the price of milk without increasing the price of butter and cheese.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the fact that the milk producers were not received by the former Minister for Agriculture. If my memory serves me aright, shortly after the present Minister took office he received some of these people and there was a statement made in some of the papers to the effect that they were dissatisfied and discontented and that the interview was not a success.  That is more than they can say about the former Minister for Agriculture because they did not get in to see him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry or Deputy Cogan&mdash;I get mixed up because these two Deputies can be referred to as the twins of the House&mdash;referred to the Milk Producers' Association and said that the former Minister for Agriculture made a statement to the effect that it was a Fianna Fáil ramp.  The former Minister for Agriculture has made many true and many wise statements but the truest and the wisest statement he ever made was the statement to the effect that the Milk Producers' Association was a Fianna Fáil ramp.  It is quite true.  They were such and they are such to this day. For that reason, I believe the former Minister for Agriculture was wise and right in refusing to receive them.  Now a plea is being made by Deputy Corry to the present Minister to receive those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure he will not refuse to receive his own friends and his own supporters. I am sure the Minister will agree within the next seven days to make room in his office for the representatives of the Milk Producers' Association whom Deputy Dillon refused to see.  If he does not do it, I am sure Deputy Cogan will have him removed <Col N="804" /> from office forthwith.  I am sure no time will be lost in seeing that the most comfortable chairs will be made available in the Minister's office for Mr. Fletcher and the members of the Milk Producers' Association and that Deputy Corry will see to it that the Minister will have a box of cigars for them and that every entertainment will be provided for them and that the Minister will hear what case they have to put forward for an increase in the price of milk.  I am sure no time will be lost in sending for those people by telegram so as to comply with the wishes of Deputy Corry and Deputy Cogan.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to take up the time of this House any further.  I rose to express my disgust at hypocrisy.  St. Paul once said that much is expected of those who know much.  One of the reasons why we expected so little from Deputy Corry and Deputy Cogan to-night in relation to this motion is that they know so little.  I protest in the strongest possible manner against any attempt by this Government to have butter made a commodity for the high-class people, a commodity which can go only on the rich man's table.  Milk that was once consumed by all of us is to-day becoming a rich man's luxury. Cheese can no longer be used by the poor man, even as bait in a mousetrap. To-day it is only swanks who can have cheese and biscuits after dinner because Fianna Fáil, Deputy Cogan and his colleagues have seen to it that cheese is for the rich only.  They are now seeing that butter will be for the rich and that milk will not go into the belly of the poor man's child but will make the rich man's child hardier and stronger.</P>

      <P>Since this motion appeared on the Order Paper I have been around the country to committees of agriculture and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made statements in connection with this costings organisation to which Deputy Corry and Deputy Cogan referred to-night.  I have told the farmers in the various counties that it is my intention to set up a costings organisation.  I can now tell the House that I have made headway in the setting up of that organisation, and <Col N="805" /> I hope, within the next two or three weeks, to be in a position to announce the personnel of the organisation itself.</P>
    <P>This question of the price of milk is not a new one.  In 1947 the price of milk was 10½d. per gallon.  In that year the present Minister for Local Government, who was then Minister for Agriculture, fixed a price for milk. The price fixed then was 1/2 per gallon for the summer months and 1/4 per gallon for the winter months.  That price obtained between 1947 and April, 1951.  A motion was moved here about 12 months ago, and some of the people who, I am sure, are now preparing to support this motion to-night, had an opportunity then of asking the Minister of the day to give an increased price for milk.  Yet, when it came to the division, these people walked into the lobby and voted against an increase in the price of milk.  I hope that during the discussion on this motion some of those people will not have the temerity to ask me to accept it&mdash;but such has been the case.</P>
    <P>Some 12 or 18 months ago my predecessor in office, Deputy Dillon, went to Waterford.  He asked the milk producers there to produce milk for a period of five years at 1/- per gallon. Naturally, there was an outcry&mdash;because the price had been fixed by the present Minister for Local Government, when he was Minister for Agriculture, at 1/2 and 1/4.  My predecessor, Deputy Dillon, asked the farmers to reduce the price of milk.  Instead of giving them an increase, he offered them a reduction. Of course, it was not acceptable, and we had the agitation which had been going on for some time prior to that and which lasted until April, 1951.</P>
    <P>Immediately before the general election, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, decided&mdash;I am sure as a sop to the milk producers in this country&mdash;that it would be a wise thing to give an increase of 1d. per gallon. Consequently, the price of milk for the summer period was increased by 1d. from 1/2 to 1/3&mdash;but between 1947 and 1951 the price was not increased.  I am sure many people on the benches opposite are now shedding crocodile tears for the dairy farmers.  However, when they had an opportunity of supporting <Col N="806" /> a motion put forward by Deputy Cogan about six or eight months ago they walked into the Division Lobby and voted against it.  Such is the sincerity of some of the people who, I know, are prepared to support the milk producers to-day&mdash;not for the purpose of supporting the milk producers, but just in order to gain some cheap popularity for themselves.</P>
    <P>When we came into office we published a 17-point programme.  Included in the 17 points was one which stated that we would give adequate prices to producers&mdash;milk producers, wheat producers, beet producers, and so forth.  Only two commodities are produced on the farm for which the Government has the responsibility of fixing prices, namely, milk and wheat. The first action of this Government was to examine the price of milk in an endeavour to see in what way the lot of the dairy farmer could be improved, because we voted for an increase eight months before that.  We knew an increase was justified and, because of that, I would say that the first action of the Fianna Fáil Government when they came back into office was to increase the price of milk, not by 1d. for the whole year round, but by 1d. for the summer months and 2d. for the winter months.  I may be asked: &ldquo;Why differentiate between the summer months and the winter months?&rdquo;  My predecessor forgot that it costs more to produce a gallon of milk in winter than in summer.</P>
    <P>In order to compensate the farmer who is producing milk in the winter months we stepped up the price by 2d. in the winter months.  The present prices are 1/4 in the summer months and 1/6 in the winter months.  These prices obtain until next April.  The price fixed last April by my predecessor, Deputy Dillon, was for a five-year period.  In announcing the new prices of 1/4 and 1/6, I pointed out that they would apply until the 1st of April, 1952. Of course, the price will be reviewed between now and April next.  I hope to have the costings organisation I have spoken about in operation long before then.  As a matter of fact, it will be in operation after Christmas.</P>
    <P>By setting up this costings organisation <Col N="807" /> I think I am fulfilling a duty to the milk producers and a duty to the consumers.  It may be argued that the present price of milk is not economic. Although I am a farmer myself, I do not know whether the present price of milk is economic or not.  I do not know if anybody in this country knows what is the economic price of milk, because so many factors have to be taken into consideration in arriving at a price.  The only way to find out is to get down to hard facts through a proper organisation set up for the purpose.  As I have said, I have already got the person who is prepared to carry out that work.  We have no proof that the present price is not an economic price and, on the other hand, we have no proof that it is an economic price.  Until such time as it can be proved or disproved that 1/4 and 1/6 is an economic price, we are just groping in the dark when we offer a price.  That has been the position in the past but I hope it is not going to be the position in the future because we shall determine the price through the costings organisation.</P>
    <P>To-night, some Deputies mentioned that we imported butter.  Yes, we did import butter and we shall have to import butter this year.  The reason for the importation of butter is that our people, possibly over a period of four years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They were eating more butter in the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only one of the reasons.  The consumption of butter has increased by 1½ ounces.  That is not the reason why we are importing butter.  If the Deputy thinks that it is, I may assure him that it is not.  The reason is because we have developed an export trade for chocolate crumb, dried milk and condensed milk.  That trade is developing.  We have developed it in this present year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not accelerated to any great extent.  I know the factory the Deputy is referring to.  It has not been extended in the last four or five years.  The diversion of milk has been greater in the past summer than heretofore. We have not had a reduction in the production of milk this year.  The production in the month of October has gone up by 15 per cent., strange as it may appear, compared with last year. Deputy Murphy, when he was speaking to-night, gave reasons&mdash;genuine reasons &mdash;why the milk production went down last year.  It was due to a bad winter and a bad spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one of the reasons.  I am not trying to make political propaganda like the people on the opposite side.  We approach these matters honestly and truthfully.  I am giving all the facts as I see them.  When I meet people like some of the Deputies on the far side of the House who have got into these positions through trickery, I am not going to listen to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards milk production, one of the reasons&mdash;there are others&mdash;why the production of milk went down was, as I have said, that much of the milk is being diverted to other non-butter products.  This year we are going to import 6,000 tons of butter at a price of 376/- per cwt.  I hope it will not be necessary to import butter next year. It may be.  If we can develop our export trade in non-butter products we will do so, as it would reduce our adverse trade balance.  The price of milk to produce butter must be lower than the price of milk to produce chocolate crumb which is the least economic of all the products that can be produced from milk, strange as it may appear.  That is not getting away from the fact that the farmer to-day is not satisfied with the price he is getting for his milk.  I cannot, at this stage, add anything further to what I have already stated regarding what the price may be next year.  I must depend upon getting a proper answer&mdash;a correct answer&mdash;from the people in so far as the cost of producing a gallon <Col N="809" /> of milk is concerned.  When that has been done then it will be a question of fixing a margin of profit for the producer.</P>

      <P>Not as soon as you think.  You thought you were staying over here for a long time.  When I was down the country talking to the people in the creamery districts, a most surprising thing happened.  I was speaking on the price of milk, just as I am to-night, when one gentleman got up and said he was prepared to take 1/6 per gallon for milk.  I was rather surprised.  Another gentleman, who was also a member of the committee of agriculture, got up and said he could not produce milk under 1/8 per gallon. I was between the devil and the deep sea.  I did not know which one to believe.  However, I had at this particular time the prices that had been paid in the various creameries in that county.  I knew the districts from which the members had come.  I looked up the figures and found that in the case of the man who was prepared to produce milk at 1/6 he was actually getting 1/6½ per gallon in the month of September.  The other man, who said he could not produce it under 1/8 per gallon, was actually getting 1/7.  We hear a lot of talk and a lot of nonsense to-day all over the country about the price of milk in many of the creameries.  I am sure it would surprise Deputies to know that the price of milk is far in excess of 1/4, that it is actually making 1/6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On last Thursday I asked the Minister for Social Welfare the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state, in regard to the position of Adviser to the Minister for Social Welfare, the reasons for the establishment of the position.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I did so because I regard the establishment of this new post as such an extreme departure from the accepted Civil Service position that it was a matter which should be inquired into in this House.</P>
      <P>There has unfortunately been a background to this position which has caused considerable uneasiness throughout the country.  Had I received from the Minister a satisfactory answer as to the reasons which prompted him and the Government to establish this position and make this appointment, I would not have regarded it as necessary to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  The Minister replied to my question:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" />&ldquo;I considered it desirable to have such an adviser on the staff of my Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pressed him further as to why, in view of the fact that for over 28 years his Department had consisted of a principal officer, who was the secretary, a staff of civil servants and the usual machinery of a Department, this new post should have been created and the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have given the reason.  I do not know what the Deputy wants more than that.  I considered that an adviser for a certain part of the work of the Department was necessary, if a suitable person could be got, and I consider that I got such a suitable person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regard the Minister's attitude in relation to this question as being characterised by evasiveness and I regard the establishment of this post as being completely unjustified, so far at any rate as the Minister is concerned.  It is a serious matter in relation to the proper regulation and discipline of the Civil Service that any upheaval should take place in the matter of the grading, the functions or the duties of different officers.  It also is a matter of considerable concern in this country, to the people who have to foot the bill, that a person should be appointed to a post in which he receives a yearly salary of £1,880 and it is a serious matter that such a post should have been established for the first time in 1951.  It is further, a serious matter that that post has been created merely to pay a reward to a particular person against a background the history of which we all know.  I do not think that anyone on this side would take any exception to the establishment of any post in the Civil Service, provided we were satisfied that the person appointed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only thing the question asks is the reason why the Minister made the appointment.  That <Col N="813" /> is the only matter we can deal with. No appointee or person appointed to the position can be discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <P>I am not making any reference to the appointee.  I am saying nobody on this side would take any exception to the establishment of a post, irrespective of the salary paid or what remuneration might be obtained, or who might be appointed. provided we were satisfied that the post was being filled by a person who was discharging some new service or giving some assistance not previously available to the Department.  In regard to this particular matter, the fact is that, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, the different Departments were established and they consisted of a principal officer who was, and is, the secretary of the Department, with, under him, various other officials and grades.  Never before in the history of this State, and, I am certain, never before in the history of any country with a civil service similar to our own, has it been found necessary to establish the position of adviser to the political head of a Department, in this case the Minister for Social Welfare.  It is such a grave depárture from the accepted procedure of the Civil Service that I should have expected the Minister concerned would have given to this House, consisting of the representatives of the people, a satisfactory explanation as to why this new post was created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer the Minister to some of the matters which I think are worthy of comment in this regard.  It appears from the answer given by the Tánaiste. acting for the Taoiseach, on the previous day that this post was established under the provisions of the Civil Service (Regulation) Act of 1926, Section 6 of which amended Section 2 of the earlier Act.  Under the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1924, as amended by the Act of 1926, it is important for the House to appreciate, the Civil Service Commissioners were established.  They were established 26 years ago to ensure that never in this State would the Civil Service machinery be corrupted purely by political considerations.  The commissioners were established as a bulwark between the political head of <Col N="814" /> each Department and the Civil Service machinery functioning below him.</P>
    <P>There was a particular exception made in relation to the functions of the commissioners by the Act of 1926, under which the Government could, for very special reasons, where it appeared in the public interest that a particular person should be appointed without being qualified by the Civil Service Commissioners to a particular post, make such appointment.  In the matter of this post of adviser, the Government have taken the unprecedented course of availing of that exception under the Act of 1926 in the public interest to establish this post and make this appointment.  By doing so, they have swept aside the protection given to the Civil Service by the Civil Service Commissioners.  They have ensured for the first time that an element of politics creeps into our Civil Service.  They have established in this Department two principal officers having the same grade in the Civil Service, according to the reply of the Tánaiste, with the same salary and with the same superannuation benefits.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to rule too rigidly on the Deputy, but is he not departing from the terms of the question?  The sole question is why the Minister made such an appointment.  The terms of the question are the only guide I can have as to what the Deputy intends to talk about.  The question put to the Minister for Social Welfare was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to state in regard to the position of adviser to the Minister for Social Welfare the reasons for the establishment of the position.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The method he adopted, if he did adopt an irregular method, does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly abide by your ruling and I do not want to depart in any particular from the question I put, but I as a Deputy of the people of the country find now, in relation to the Department of Social Welfare, that there is paid by the people a principal officer who is the Secretary of that Department, who is, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the head of the Department; and <Col N="815" /> there is also, by reason of this new appointment, an established post carrying the maximum of the salary applicable generally to Secretaries of Government Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am trying to ascertain from the Minister&mdash;and I hope the Minister, in reply, will deal with it&mdash;why it has been found necessary&mdash;it follows from the making of this appointment&mdash;to have in the Department two officers who are of principal officer grade, both paid the maximum salary applicable to the permanent head of the Department and both functioning under the one political head.  That is a problem which arises immediately from the creation of this particular post.  I want to know further from the Minister what his view is with regard to the effect of this appointment on the Civil Service generally and in particular on the members of the Department of Social Welfare. There is a high code of discipline, a high code of honour in the Irish Civil Service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an uncommon suggestion from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a course I did not want to follow.  I am prepared to advance what I believe to be the reasons for the establishment of this position.  I was prepared to point out to the Minister and the House the consequences which I see following from this appointment. The Minister has not given me, so far, and has not given the House, the reasons for the appointment.  I am prepared to deal extensively with the background which led up to it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to do that.  This is not, perhaps, the place to do it.  It is impossible for the House to close its eyes to the matters which led up to the appointment of the present Secretary of the Department, to the discharge of the former secretary and, as a result of a change of Government, to the establishment of this new position of adviser to the present Minister and the consequential appointment of the former secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had told the House the reasons, this matter would not have arisen.  What he did say was that he considered it useful in relation to pending legislation to have this post established. I want to describe that as nonsense&mdash;sheer, unadulterated nonsense. Furthermore, I regard the Minister's attitude in relation to this as being evasive in the extreme.  He says he wanted an adviser in relation to pending legislation.  Before this appointment was made, he had the advice and assistance of the entire Civil Service machinery that had been there for many years before.  I do not believe that the securing of advice in relation to pending legislation was the reason for the establishment of this post.  I believe there is another reason and I think the House is entitled to know the correct reason.  The House and the country generally must regard the establishment <Col N="817" /> of this post as a sorry and sordid business&mdash;sorry and sordid because, for no reason whatsoever, the Minister has established a top Civil Service post, paying the top Civil Service salary, to fulfil a function previously being discharged in a very efficient manner by a qualified staff of civil servants; a sorry business also, because for the first time an element of politics has been introduced into our Civil Service; and a sorry business because, for the first time ever, a purely temporary post has been established in our Civil Service.  I can promise the Minister that, in the next six months, when his successor is sitting where he is sitting, this particular post will no longer exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I did not get notice of this question and so I have no papers with me, but I think I am able to answer any question raised. The Deputy says there was never such a post created before.  There was.  In 1933, when I was Minister for Agriculture, I established the post of advise to the Minister for Agriculture, although that Department had been in operation for 11 years.  At that time, we had perhaps a more reasonable House here and no fault was found with the appointment.  As a matter of fact the person appointed to that particular position of adviser to the Minister for Agriculture afterwards became secretary of the Department and served the Department well so that so far as a precedent is concerned there is a precedent and that precedent was established by me.  The Department has been in existence for four years and the appointment of adviser has been made now.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that that appointment was in order to reward the particular person because the person the Deputy has in mind could have found employment in some other Department if I were willing to release him to any other Department. Rather, I should say, I considered that that particular person would be a most important and very necessary acquisition to my Department and for that reason he was appointed to this particular post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> At the same time I would not like any Deputy here to think that I would cast any reflection on the higher officers of the Department of Social Welfare's hierarchy, if I might call it so.  They compare favourably with any other Department here or elsewhere. I might say that I was the person responsible for gathering the men who took charge of that Department in 1947 and I certainly have no cause to regret the appointment of any person as a higher officer in that Department. They have done their work very well. It would not be within the rules of order, I take it, to discuss why this particular person was appointed in the Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be done at another time if the Deputy likes to put down a question but as far as the question of why the post was made is concerned, I made him, not an evasive-answer, but an answer in accordance with the facts.  I told him that I considered the creation of that post essential and that I considered the person appointed to it a suitable person to fill the post.  I do not think I can add to or subtract from that.  I regard it as a complete answer to the question the Deputy put on Thursday.</P>
      <P>One other point.  He wants to know what effect this appointment will have on the Civil Service generally.  I can only say that I believe personally that the effect on the Civil Service generally is that they can be assured that as far as this Government is concerned, justice will be done.</P>

      <P>The prices of fishing boats depend on the materials used, the equipment installed and the general layout of the vessel.  It is not possible in the circumstances to give figures of cost for boats built in different yards which would be strictly comparable. The experience of the association is that the cost of boats of the 50-foot class supplied by boat-builders in Scotland compares favourably with the cost of boats of that type produced for the association in yards within the State.</P>
