    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will indicate whether, in view of the substantial increase in the cost of living and the consequent hardship suffered by recipients of old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment assistance, he will take immediate steps to increase their pensions and allowances, which are entirely inadequate to enable them to exist under present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of old age pensions, blind pensions and non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions were increased by the Social Welfare Act, 1948.  The Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950, includes provision for improved pensions payable on retirement at an earlier age than the present age for old age pensions and also for improved widows' and orphans' pensions, both on a contributory basis.  All the assistance schemes are being further considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that no provision is made for people who are not insured under the <Col N="208" /> Bill and that it is only for insured workers that any provision is made? Does the Minister not realise that it is impossible for people to live, with the present high cost of living, on 17/6 a week?  I have asked the Minister if he intends to introduce legislation or to increase the present pensions to those people, especially those who are not being provided for under the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will consider treating drift net salmon fishermen on the Donegal coast as wage earners during the fishing period and not assess their takings against their means for the purpose of obtaining qualification certificates under the Unemployment <Col N="209" /> Assistance Act, 1933; and, if necessary, do so by the introduction of proposals for legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fishermen who use their own boats or gear must be assessed with their net profits in the same way as other self-employed persons. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inequitable to provide for preferential treatment in respect of a particular group or class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is discrimination in so far as herring fishermen are concerned? Salmon fishermen are being victimised, whereas herring fishermen are being treated as employed during the period in which they are fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case law in all this matter.  That case law has established this fact over the years, that fishermen who own their boats or gear are assessed on net profits, in the same way as any other self-employed person.  The Deputy's question is that, while self-employed persons generally are assessed in the same way as fishermen who own their nets, boats or gear, for the first time, these fishermen should be exempt. This matter has been ruled on over and over again.  If there is to be any reconsideration in the matter, it has to be not merely for fishermen but for anybody else who is self-employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will treat all islanders on the Donegal coast as unsuitable for turf production work and thereby obviate the necessity of disallowing them unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No offers of employment on turf work in connection with Bord na Móna hostel schemes, to which I presume the Deputy refers, are at present being made by local officers of my Department to islanders on the Donegal coast.  The islanders are, however, free to apply for such work should they so desire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of applicants for <Col N="210" /> unemployment assistance have been refused such assistance because they rejected employment with Bord na Móna on work of which they have absolutely no experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will let me have particulars of that I will be glad to investigate these matters, but the position at the moment is that no offer of employment with Bord na Móna is being made by local officers of my Department to islanders on the Donegal coast.  Bord na Móna at the moment, I think, have recruited, or are on the eve of recruiting, their full immediate requirements.  If, however, islanders want to work in Bord na Móna hostel schemes they are quite eligible to apply for work in such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether it is a fact that in reply to representations made to him by the central executive committee of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation for an increase in the fuel grant for schools he has stated that, from inquiries made by him, he has concluded that no increase in this grant would be justified; and, if so, whether he will further state the inquiries he made that enabled him to arrive at this decision.</P>

      <P>Following the receipt of representations from the central executive committee of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation for an increase in the fuel grant payable to the managers of national schools arising out of the position in rural schools which depend for heating mainly on the supply of turf available, I had inquiries on the matter made through the inspectors whose districts include the turf-producing areas.  On consideration of their reports in relation to the fuel position in the country <Col N="211" /> generally, and having regard to the fact that the responsibility for the provision of funds, in supplement of the State grants, for the adequate heating of schools, devolves on the locality, I am satisfied that the situation was not such as to call for any special action on the part of the Department.</P>

      <P>The County Donegal Vocational Education Committee has already signified its willingness to provide instruction in marine engineering and navigation for fishermen in centres in its area where a demand for such instruction is found to exist, and where the services of competent instructors can be obtained.  A recommendation from me does not, therefore, appear to be necessary.  No specific proposal for the establishment of such classes has yet been received from the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that local authorities compulsorily acquired some years ago portion of a large number of agricultural holdings, which are held from the Land Commission, and that the former owners have not got any reduction in their annuities in respect of the land so acquired; and, further, if he will state whether the Land Commission will credit tenant-owners with the portion of the annuities due on the lands referred to in respect of the period, from the date of entry by the local authority to the time when the Land Commission will have decided on the revised annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that local authorities acquire building sites all over the country, a large proportion of which are portions of holdings held by tenants from the Land Commission, When sub-division has been granted and title cleared, the annuity is always apportioned by the Land Commission, but this cannot be done until the local authority furnishes particulars of each case.  If in the meantime a tenant purchaser pays the annuity on the land acquired by the local authority, it is <Col N="213" /> open to him to apply to that authority for recoupment dating back to the date on which he surrendered possession of the acquired portion.  The adjustment of liability for the payment of annuity as from the date on which a site is acquired is a matter for arrangement between the former owner and the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.  The position is that the county council usually take over a particular plot of land which is portion of a man's holding and from the date on which that portion is acquired the former owner should not be liable to an annuity.  If he pays it in the meantime, it should be a matter of easy adjustment between him and the acquiring authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unusually big estate comprising approximately 13,000 acres.  The full extent of the claims to turbary and grazing rights will only be ascertained as the detailed investigation of the various sections of the estate proceeds.  It is possible that it may be found that there are as many as 1,000 claims involved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy, I am sure, will appreciate the difficulties in dealing with such a big estate involving so many claims.  Notwithstanding these difficulties and the fact that possession of the estate was obtained only a comparatively short time ago, I am glad to be able to say that the work of afforestation will commence on a reasonably large area fairly soon.</P>

      <P>Unavailing efforts were made to locate a new industry for establishment at Annagry and the question of setting up an extension of an existing Gaeltacht industry was considered.  The present world scarcity of raw materials and machinery has worsened the position and any extention of an existing industry could not be undertaken without curtailing the output of the parent factory and, perhaps, jeopardising the whole industry. The establishment of a factory at Annagry would not be justifiable unless the supply position improves sufficiently to ensure its satisfactory working.</P>

It will be observed that creamery butter production has increased by 42 per cent. since 1947 and the existing facilities are ample to deal with all the milk which is likely to become available.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> (d)  It is considered that a more realistic comparison would be the exquay cost of imported cement with the net ex-factory price of home produced cement.  On this basis the average difference was approximately £1 19s. per ton.  On a c.i.f. basis the difference was approximately £1 13s. per ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a), (b) and (d) of the Deputy's question, the answer is yes.  As regards (c) and (e) I have been in communication with the Cork Corporation with a view to securing their co-operation with the county council in this matter as the work would be carried out much more economically in conjunction with a section of the main drainage scheme for Cork City and a joint scheme would be advantageous to both local authorities. The matter has been under constant consideration and the financial issues have been discussed both in correspondence and locally with the two managers concerned.  The county council have been informed of the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I put down this question because of failure to answer letters sent on the 9th April last year, in December last year and in January of this year, and that no reply was sent to the South Cork County Council until three days after I had put down the question?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for a main drainage scheme for the City of Cork have been under consideration for a number of years.  A scheme has been prepared by a consulting engineer, but the local authority are reluctant to embark on its execution for financial reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter became urgent when the proposals referred to in this question were submitted, as these proposals could most readily be put into operation in conjunction with the authorities of the county borough. The borough surveyor has suggested that a section of the main drainage should be undertaken now.  This section would drain the Wilton area of Cork City and also provide an outfall into which sewers laid in the adjoining area would be drained.  If this suggestion is not acted on it will be necessary for the county council to provide and maintain a separate disposal works to deal with the sewage of the area administered by them.  The joint scheme would obviously be advantageous to both local authorities.  It would initiate the main drainage scheme for the city which must be carried out at some time and it would <Col N="238" /> avoid the necessity for maintaining disposal works in a built-up area.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is desired to explore every possibility of securing agreement with the city authorities before agreeing to the county council's proposals for a completely independent scheme.</P>
    <P>The matter has been under constant consideration and the financial issues have been discussed both in correspondence and locally with the two managers concerned.  Any delays which may appear to have taken place have been caused by these negotiations, which have not yet resulted in a decision by the Cork City authorities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that the cul-de-sac roads in County Roscommon are badly in need of repair and that the local authority, although willing and anxious to improve these roads, are prevented by statute from doing so unless the roads were repaired in the grand jury days prior to 1898; and, if so, whether he will take steps to remedy this position, if necessary by the introduction of proposals for legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I intimated in reply to a similar question put down by the Deputy in November, 1949, it has long been the practice for the local people primarily interested in the improvement and repair of the type of road to which he refers to co-operate in the <Col N="243" /> preparation of proposals for which grants may be made available by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance through the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
      <P>Roads may be taken over as public roads by road authorities in two ways:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  under Section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  Cul-de-sac roads cannot be taken over as public roads under this section, as one of the conditions laid down is that the non-public road shall connect two public roads:</P>
      <P>(b)  under powers arising from a number of legal decisions a cul-de-sac road can be taken over provided it is of general public utility.  General public utility is a question of fact which must be decided by the road authority in each case, the decision being subject to review by the auditor.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that the Deputy will appreciate that a very high mileage of public roads is already being maintained by road authorities and that these roads must of necessity be accorded priority of claim on the funds available for maintenance.  To add at present to the existing public road mileage would not improve the condition either of the existing or of the additional public roads.  The volume of road works to be done in any year on public roads must be limited by the amount which can be made available from the Road Fund and from local rates.</P>
      <P>Having regard to existing and future commitments on the Road Fund, I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by conferring further statutory powers on road authorities to deal with the question of cul-de-sac roads, but that road authorities in dealing with these cases must examine in each case the question whether or not a particular road which they propose to take over is in fact of general public utility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that in my question I stated that the local authority were willing and <Col N="244" /> anxious to repair these roads if the power and the authority to do so was given by the Department. Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the position that exists in that county at present is that you can have two villages side by side with an equal number of families in each village; that the county council is empowered to repair the road leading into one village because the road had been repaired prior to 1898, in the time of the grand jury, but that the county council has no authority to repair the road leading into the other village, although it serves an equal number of families, just because the road was not repaired prior to 1898?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that that is a fair state of affairs?</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there is a legal obligation on a local authority to distinguish between roads which were repaired before or after the passing of the 1898 Act.  The Deputy suggests that the Roscommon County Council are willing to repair these roads.  In reply, I would suggest that they have ample power to do so if they wish, under the Act of 1925 which I quoted.  The local authority are empowered to take over a cul-de-sac road where, in their opinion, the road is of general public utility.  It may be then repaired, maintained or reconstructed. Of course, the expenditure on such work is subject to review by the auditor, but expenditure on any other road, whether a county or main road, is subject to the same scrutiny by the auditor.</P>

It is not subject to the approval of the Minister. Expenditure on the road is, of course, subject to review by the auditor, as is expenditure in every case.</P>

      <P>No information is available in my Department regarding voluntary hospitals which do not submit returns to the Hospitals Commission.</P>
      <P>Dublin voluntary hospitals which submit returns to the Hospitals Commission do so on the basis of calendar years.</P>
      <P>The number of patients who received hospital treatment in such hospitals during the years 1948 and 1949 in respect of whom no direct payment was made by the patient himself to the hospital authorities or, on his behalf, by a local authority or otherwise was, during the year 1948, 15,399, and during the year 1949, 15,073.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that Dublin Corporation pays lump sums to the Dublin voluntary hospitals amounting in recent years to over £105,000 per annum towards the cost of treating poor persons resident in the Dublin County Borough.  Dublin Corporation, therefore, contributes indirectly to the cost of maintenance of numbers of the patients referred to above.</P>

      <P>In page 7, after sub-section (4), a new sub-section as follows inserted:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> (5)  Where a disqualification for holding a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act, 1933 (No. 11 of 1933), is remitted, in whole or in part, under this section, notice of the remission shall be published as soon as may be in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection to taking it now, but I want to say something about it.  I am glad the Minister has gone so far, though he has not gone as far as I expected he would go. I want to make one suggestion: I think it would be advisable for him to consider the possibility, before he remits any disqualification in respect of an offence against that particular section of the Road Traffic Act, of his strengthening his own hand by having some sort of advice, such as the advice of the President of the Circuit Court, or a judge of the High Court.  I suggest he should not do this by his own Order but on advice given to him by a competent authority as to whether he ought or ought not to do it.  I make that suggestion purely as a matter of administration.  A very serious offence is involved under this section; it is an offence about which the public generally are becoming very alarmed.  The Minister knows that there is a demand for more drastic treatment to be meted out to those people who drive cars while under the influence of drink.  The Minister has taken power which no other Minister has ever had hitherto. That is a very serious step for him to take.  I ask him for his own sake and for the sake of those who will come after him to fortify himself in his position by having some sort of advisory body; that body may consist of only one judge, but if he has that advice he will safeguard himself and put himself in the position of being able to stand over everything that he does.  I admit that the Minister has gone a good distance in agreeing to publish notification. That is a useful amendment.  The matter will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, that the Minister would be well advised, to set up some <Col N="252" /> machinery of the kind I am suggesting. I think it is desirable he should have some person to advise him, the President of the Circuit Court or a judge of the High Court, as to whether he ought to remit the disqualification under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has decided to accept this amendment.  I think it meets the Bill. I would not advise the Minister to go as far as Deputy Boland suggests he ought to go.  In matters of this kind I think it is well sometimes to leave the decision to a competent Minister. There is considerable public feeling, as has been stated, concerning the proper punishment of persons who drive motor cars while under the influence of drink.  That very natural reaction has in some cases worked in such manner that there has been an inequality of punishment in respect of the same offence.</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendment because I think it protects the Minister.  I hope that one of the results will be that the Minister will ensure that in cases where the punishment is altogether disproportionate to the crime some mitigation of the penalty can be sought.  Those who offend under this particular section fall into two categories.  There is the private driver, perhaps a wealthy driver, whose livelihood does not depend on his licence to drive; in all such cases I would be very slow to suggest to the Minister that he should interfere under any circumstances. To my own knowledge, however, there have been punishments meted out which have had results not contemplated by the judge imposing the punishment and which have been altogether disproportionate to the offences committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy and other Deputies to look at the amendment before the House, which is simply that notice should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is this, that I think the amendment is desirable because I believe the publication is a protection for the Minister and will enable him to <Col N="253" /> examine the type of case to which I am referring.  In the particular type of case to which I refer, publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> protects the Minister.  It would enable the Minister to do what, so far as I am aware, the Minister has not yet done, namely, remit a portion of a sentence involving a suspension of a licence to drive.  I have in mind the type of case of the individual who has been disqualified for a period of years and whose living depends on driving a car or driving a lorry and who, as a result, may be forced to leave the country. I know of at least two cases where men who have driven all sorts of vehicles for a number of years in England and who have come home have still been unable to get the Minister or the officials of his Department to agree to any reduction in the period of suspension.  In so far as the amendment protects the Minister against misrepresentation; in so far as it will encourage the Minister that disproportionate punishment is not meted out in respect of such persons, I think the amendment is useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having originally thrown out the suggestion of publication, and it, like some of the other suggestions I throw out here from time to time, not being accepted, I am very pleased to know that somebody else has succeeded in convincing the <Col N="254" /> Minister that this was a wise thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is good to know that one has bright ideas now and again.  I am glad that this is done, but I do not like the approach of Deputy Kissane.  I think Deputy Kissane should look on this not just from the point of view of the particular Minister who is in office at the moment but from the point of view of any Minister for Justice in the future. It is obvious that before a Minister for Justice exercises this power he will have consulted the Guards and the judge.  He will be fully advised of all the circumstances, and, having fully considered all those circumstances, if he desires to remit, the fact of publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> will be important, because it will, in the final analysis&mdash;it has been laid down very often that not only must justice be done but it must appear to be done&mdash; be an indication to the people who read it&mdash;and they will not be very many&mdash;that the matter has been judicially considered by the Minister, that he has exercised his functions and that he has, on good grounds, remitted the punishment.  I think that the very fact of publication will prevent any Minister coming to a decision to remit without giving very serious consideration to all the matters and factors involved.  I am glad that this amendment has been agreed to, as it apparently is being agreed to by the House, and I think it does mean that the Bill as a whole has the complete approval of everybody in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with this amendment, but I am afraid I could not agree with the Deputy who required the assistance of a judge or a justice.  As the matter stands, the Minister gets the assistance of the justice or the judge and also from the Garda, and the matter is thoroughly considered by the competent officer in the Department itself.  On the opinions of those various people, the Minister has to make up his mind.  I think that is a very good safeguard.  I also think that the question of publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is one that we should all support.  In many cases, the very fact of publication there in itself would be a form of punishment, so that I am sure there will be certain people who will have to decide whether they will go forward with their sentence quietly and without any publicity, or appeal to the Minister, knowing that if they succeed they will have the publicity of publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  That, in itself, is a form of sentence and will be such to certain people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask whether the Minister has considered the contents of this notice which he is empowered to insert in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> I think that is what was exercising Deputy Kissane's mind when he put the question whether the circumstances surrounding the offence and the removal of the disqualification would be set out in the notice.  The amendment is obviously being accepted and provision is being made for publication of the notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I suggest that the minimum of information should appear in that notice.  I assume the Minister has considered the form and contents of the notice, but I do not think it would be out of order to suggest at this stage that the bare essentials only be given.  It is obvious that the name and address will be given, as well as the date of the disqualification and the period for which the disqualification was made, but, apart from these bare essentials, I think it important that there should be no undue verbosity, so to speak in the notice.  With all due respect to <Col N="256" /> officials preparing these notices, there is a tendency to say more than need be said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, and while I approve of the idea behind the amendment, and, for the reasons given by other Deputies, think it a good thing, I urge the point of view that the minimum of information be given.  As Deputy Cowan has said, there are not very many constant readers of <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> and, save and except the individual concerned, I do not think many people will be aware of the publication of this notice at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Timoney has put a bad thought into my head about this section.  I, like the rest of the Deputies, was prepared to accept this proposition as a very desirable thing from the point of view of counterbalancing the temptation to a Minister to favour his political friends; but it struck me from what Deputy Timoney said with regard to the contents of the notice that the amendment will not mean very much if we are to get a notice something like this: &ldquo;The disqualification imposed by sentence of the Circuit Court, Record No.&mdash;is hereby remitted.&rdquo;  That is not going to be much good.  We would like to have the Minister's assurance that the notice will contain the name and address of the person disqualified and whose disqualification has been removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these notices are published bilingually.  The purpose of this section is to remove or to obviate the temptation, or, what is very important, to obviate the appearance of temptation.  We all know the old adage that it is not sufficient that justice should be done&mdash; it is necessary that it should appear to be done.  That is a very important principle of administration and I ask the Minister in making this gesture to us of having the appearance of justice done, in addition to having justice <Col N="257" /> done, to give us an undertaking that the notice will set out the name and address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will remember that, when this section was before the House, I undertook to re-examine the question of giving publicity to the remission of forfeitures and disqualifications granted under the section.  The case was made very strongly by Deputies and I came to the conclusion that there was something to be examined.  I undertook to make that examination and I moved this amendment in the Seanad as a result, to meet the wishes of Deputies.  I think I have gone a long way to meet them.  This amendment deals only with the Road Traffic Act and in reply to Deputy de Valera, here is what it will do.  The notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> will show all interested parties&mdash;licensing authorities, insurance companies and so on&mdash;that the disqualification is taken off, and therefore the name and address of the person whose disqualification has been removed will have to be stated.  The only thing I am not going to say is the reason why or what the offence was.  I am just going to say: &ldquo;The disqualification imposed upon X of such an address on such a date has been removed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me point out, once and for all, that the power given in this section is given to the Government to carry out all the remissions.  Perhaps I should read the section again.</P>

      <P>Will you, then, please interpret it as it can be and will be interpreted by the Government? &ldquo;The Government may delegate all or any ...&rdquo;.  Can you not visualise a situation in which, in regard to cases like this, the Government would not delegate this power to me at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose, as I said here already, it were a power I did not like.  What I said to the House was that the power must be vested somewhere <Col N="258" /> and it is being vested under this section in the Government, and the Government may delegate that power to the Minister for Justice.  Everybody is so anxious to protect me and future Ministers, and I have made such a case against it, that, if the Government read the Dáil debates, as I hope they do, they will say: &ldquo;To protect the Minister, we will retain this power to ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>And instead of the Minister removing the disqualification, the same procedure would have to be adopted as is adopted in the case of the commuting of the death penalty. Now, it is argued that this power was not there.  I say it was there and I say that there was no disqualification that the court put on, even including capital punishment, that the Government could not advise the President to remove it.  It is true that none of my predecessors exercised the power&mdash; neither did I.  We did remove the disqualification in certain cases&mdash;I cited them last year and need not weary the House with them again&mdash;when my predecessor removed one very quickly and I removed one later, after ten years; and I think they were both correct cases.  Under these circumstances, what is the point in hampering the Minister for Justice, protecting him, while the section says: &ldquo;The Government may remit in whole or in part&rdquo; various things and sub-section (3) says: &ldquo;The Government may delegate.&rdquo;  When Deputy Boland was putting in this amendment, I thought he would say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and make it mandatory on the Government to delegate the power to me, but he used &ldquo;may&rdquo; and left it permissive.  The Minister is not taking any power that was not already in existence.  I want to get that point over for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have gone a long way to meet the wishes of the House and I may say at this stage that I feel the Bill has been vastly improved from its initiation. The way the House has dealt with this Bill shows the value of the deliberative assembly getting down to work upon a measure of this sort.  It would be a <Col N="259" /> great thing if every measure introduced here could be approached in the same spirit.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  This Bill might be said to have its origin in certain proposals for the amendment of the law relating to torts contained in a Private Member's Bill which was moved in Dáil Éireann as long ago as 1941 by the present Taoiseach who was then a Private Deputy on the Opposition side of the House.  The fate of that particular Bill need not, I think, concern us now, except that I might say my predecessor accepted the principle of the Bill.  The present Bill deals in a somewhat more comprehensive manner with the matters affecting the common law relating to torts that were covered by the Bill introduced in 1941 by Deputy Costello as he then was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of necessity the Bill is, by reason of its subject matter, somewhat technical in character.  Deputies will no doubt have read the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill, and I feel that there is not much that I can add by way of explanation to <Col N="260" /> what has been said in the memorandum. There are a few points, however, which I would like to make, if the House will bear with me for a little while.</P>
    <P>The principal change which the Bill proposes to make in the existing law is to provide for contribution between tortfeasors.  Under an archaic and outworn principle of the common law which we have inherited, there can at present be no contribution between tortfeasors.  This is a serious defect in our law, which is capable of working considerable hardship and of being made the subject of grave abuses.  If, for example, a passenger in a motor car receives a serious injury as a result of an accident involving the car in which he is travelling and another vehicle and, if he obtains judgment for damages, which may be substantial, against the owners of both cars, he can if he likes look to one of the owners for the whole of the damages and costs in the action and that particular owner, though he may have been by far the least culpable party in the accident, has in the present state of law no redress whatsoever against his co-tort-feasor who was far more to blame than him.  This kind of case has been known to happen.  Still worse, the present state of the law permits of, and indeed encourages, positive abuses because one of two or more defendants, against whom substantial damages may have been awarded, can bribe the successful plaintiff to pursue another defendant or defendants for recovery of the whole of the damages or costs.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the House will agree that it is time that the law in this matter was changed.  The remedy proposed in the Bill is to provide for contribution between tortfeasors.  The two possible kinds of cases are provided for, namely, the cases in which all the tortfeasors are joined as defendants in the one action, which is covered by Section 4, and, secondly, the case in which separate actions are taken against the tortfeasors, which is provided for in Section 5.  In the first type of case it is provided by Section 4 that the full damages and costs may be apportioned among the defendants according to the extent to which they <Col N="261" /> are respectively found responsible for the injury.  It may be noted that, where the action was tried with a jury, the power of apportionment will lie with the jury.</P>
    <P>In the second type of case, that is, where there are separate actions, any tortfeasor who has paid any sum on foot of a judgment obtained against him is given the right, under Section 5, to recover a contribution from any other tortfeasor who may be held to be liable.  I would like to stress that the right to recover a contribution under Section 5 will operate against a person who may not have been sued at all by the injured party so that there will be no possibility of one of the tortfeasors escaping liability through collusion between him and the injured party.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deprive an injured party of the right which he now has to look for the whole of the damages to any one or more of the persons responsible for the injury, but, as I have explained, the position of the tortfeasors is being improved by the conferring of the right of contribution between themselves.</P>
    <P>The other amendment of the law which is being made by the Bill, while important in itself is, in a sense, incidental to the main change which the Bill proposes.  This is the provision in Section 2 which seeks to do away with the rather artificial distinction that exists under the common law between the case in which the wrongdoers are joint tortfeasors and the case in which they are not joint tortfeasors. Where the wrongdoers are joint tortfeasors, an action against one of them resulting in a judgment for the plaintiff operates as a bar against further proceedings against any of the other tortfeasors, even though the injured party may have failed to recover anything from the person whom he has sued.  Section 2 remedies this position.</P>
    <P>The Bill, being, as I have said, a somewhat technical one can, perhaps, be more appropriately discussed on Committee Stage, when any points of detail which Deputies may wish to raise can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I suppose I should congratulate the Minister on producing this Bill at last.  When he referred to the fact that I, on behalf of the last Government accepted responsibility, I did not realise how long ago it was&mdash; nine years ago.  I was abused in, I think, 1947 by the present Taoiseach when he was on this side of the House; he accused me of breaking my word and said that I had taken refuge in referring this matter to some nebulous law reform committee.  I looked up what the Taoiseach said when he and the then Deputy McGilligan introduced the matter.  In his Second Reading speech the then Deputy Costello recommended that we should set up a law reform committee in order to examine different types of Bills of this kind and to advise as to what reforms they thought necessary in the common law.  The Government of the time was actually engaged in that; we were thinking of this thing and had it under way, but there was not quite time to have the thing done and, unfortunately, it was not quite set up when the change of Government took place.  I certainly thought that when he was so keen on it the Taoiseach would have gone ahead with that idea and set up a law reform committee. The Bill was actually drafted before I left office.  I referred to it on that occasion, but unless I am mistaken it was not the same Bill as the Minister has introduced now.  He said this one was more comprehensive; it may deal in more detail with joint tortfeasors, but it leaves out an important feature of the Bill which was introduced in 1941.  As a matter of fact, I thought that the Bill we had prepared included Section 2 of the original Bill and other items that required to be dealt with. Section 2 was a very important section of the old Bill, but some of the ladies must have got after either the Minister or the Taoiseach, because Section 2 of the Bill read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The husband of a married woman shall not, by reason only of his being her husband, be liable&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  in respect of any tort committed by her whether before or after her marriage, or in respect of <Col N="263" /> any contract entered into, or debt or obligation incurred, by her before the marriage; or</P>
    <P>(b)  to be sued, or made a party to any legal proceedings brought, in respect of any such tort, contract, debt, or obligation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no reference whatever to that in this Bill.</P>

      <P>A person said to me: &ldquo;Whatever else I am held responsible for in regard to my wife, I should not be held responsible for her tongue.&rdquo; It is bad enough to be responsible for one's own tongue and we often say things that we are sorry for afterwards, but if we are to be responsible for our wife's tongue as well it is a very bad thing&mdash;though it is not a thing that I am worried about personally.  I thought, perhaps, that undue pressure had been brought to bear on the Minister or the Taoiseach to get them to mend their hand in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was abused here by the then Deputy Costello at the time and he accused me of breaking my word in not producing the Bill I had promised.  He was a large factor in that himself, because he undertook to come to the office of the Attorney-General to help him in drafting the Bill so that the points which he and the then Deputy McGilligan had in mind would be covered, and he did not do so for 18 months.  Therefore, he had responsibility for the delay. After these years we get part of the Bill that was introduced in 1941, so I am entitled to say, I think, that he was not so very keen on it and was talking with his tongue in his cheek when he accused me of breaking my word.  I <Col N="264" /> actually did not do so.  We thought it would be a good idea and a help to the Minister&mdash;I would say a help to the present Minister, a help to a layman who is not a member of any branch of the legal profession&mdash;to have the advice of a good, competent law reform committee.  It is a pity that the Minister and the Taoiseach himself, who advocated it so strongly when he was a member of the Opposition, did not see fit to go ahead with it.  We were kept back by one of the usual finance stalling actions that prevented it from being set up by the time I left office. We were on the very point of launching it when we went out.  It would have helped the Minister considerably, because I am sure that there are any amount of other things in the law that require reformation and he would be well served by a good, competent committee such as the one we had intended to set up.  He has all the papers in his office.  We are certainly not opposing this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. The feature of the Bill I welcome most is that which provides redress, as stated by the Minister, for the plaintiff who unfortunately elected in the case of joint tortfeasors to sue the worse mark of the two from the financial point of view.  To the knowledge of all of us very many hardships have been inflicted in the past on successful plaintiffs who could not recover damages.  From the practical point of view the biggest thing the Bill does to my mind is to end that situation and that is the thing which will affect the most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a good thing, too, that the possibility of collusion between plaintiff and one or two defendants is ended by the Bill.  Deputies may think that that was something that did not come within the realm of probability very often but many Deputies in the House will be aware that you had the possibility of the prospective plaintiff making an arrangement for a certain sum for damages with an insurance company representing one of the defendants and agreeing with that insurance company that proceedings would be initiated against the other defendant but that in the event of its <Col N="265" /> being unsuccessful against the other defendant they would be compensated to the amount agreed upon with the party first approached.  Deputy Peadar Cowan says that it is very seldom that that happens.  I think that there are other Deputies in the House who know that that type of thing happened frequently. It was an abuse of the ordinary process of the law and it is well that it should be ended.  The Bill puts an end to an anachronistic position and for that reason it should be welcomed also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland referred to the Law Reform Committee.  It may not be strictly relevant to the Second Reading of this Bill but I wonder if the Minister could give us any indication, when he is replying, of the prospect he can hold out of the ending of similar anachronisms in other branches of the common law.  I do not know to what extent the Law Reform Committee is working at the moment at all.  Apart altogether from this Bill, if it is permissible for him to do so, I should be glad if the Minister would refer to the position generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy G. Boland and Deputy C. Lehane in welcoming this Bill.  It is noticeable that this is, I think, one of the very rare proposals for law reform which we have introduced into this Parliament since 1921. As the Minister indicated in his opening speech, much of our common law and much of the law under which relations between our citizens are regulated to-day has been inherited from older days, with notions and principles that have really very little application in modern times.  The British common law, which is our common law, has been amended and changed radically by the British Parliament over the past 25 years.  In that same period it is unfortunate that we in this country have taken no steps to regulate and bring into accord with modern conditions the principles of the British common law.  In England the whole property law was changed in 1925.  We still operate an antiquated and feudal form of property law.  In England also the particular proposal with which we are dealing here&mdash;and <Col N="266" /> other matters with regard to torts generally&mdash;has been amended by the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which is a very notable statute introduced in the British Parliament.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to certain Deputies in this House to learn that in the British Parliament there exists a Parliamentary Law Reform Committee under the chairmanship of Sir David Maxwell Fyfe.  That committee is composed of practising lawyers and people interested in social conditions who are members of the House of Commons.  Of course, there is a far larger membership of the House of Commons than there is of this House. However, the purpose of that committee is to ensure that law reform is kept abreast of the times and of current difficulties in Britain.  Accordingly, many of the things that irk us here in our legal system have been remedied by statute in Britain.  It is a very serious black mark against our Oireachtas that, while our volume of legislation, comparatively speaking, is quite great for a small Parliament, we have never bothered about the things that really matter to our people.  The ordinary legal principles that govern our people's relations as citizens one with another are something that, apparently, very seldom, get our attention here.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of Parties, Government or Opposition, irrespective of the political views which any of us may hold, I think a great tribute is due to our present Taoiseach.  I am not certain, but I think that he is the only Deputy who ever introduced a Private Bill into this House aiming at law reform.  His Joint Tortfeasors Bill, introduced in 1941, was the first step in law reform which was taken by this Parliament.  It is regrettable that that first step should not have come to fruition until ten years later.  I think that appreciation should be expressed of the work of the present Taoiseach and of the step which he took in those days when he was Deputy Costello and the foremost practitioner at our Bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, with regard to the Law Reform Committee&mdash;and I hope <Col N="267" /> that members of that committee will not take offence at what I am going to say&mdash;that I have no faith in law reform committees the membership of which we do not know much about.  I am sure that they consist of very able members of the Department of Justice, very skilled lawyers.  However, they are men who, by reason of their official position, are not practising lawyers in touch with the difficulties that are met each day in our courts.  This is a small measure.  It is only one fraction of the law reform that is needed in this country.  It seems extraordinary to me that this measure should have taken ten years to come from the Law Reform Committee.  It also seems strange to me that that committee has not a wider composition.  I know that this particular Bill has been considered by the General Council of the Bar of Ireland and also, I am sure, by the Incorporated Law Society.  However, I think it would be far better if we had a law reform committee composed of practising lawyers and people interested in social problems&mdash;because the law, after all, is merely a set of rules regulating social conditions.  I think it would be far better if such a law reform committee, in touch with current problems, considered the question of law reform in relation to this country.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that should be dealt with by Bills of this nature. The question of introducing what is known as the admiralty rule in negligence, in the settlement of negligence claims of torts in our courts, is of vital urgency.  In many of the cases tried each day by juries in the Four Courts and by the judges in the Circuit Court, in connection with claims arising out of road accidents or torts of that kind, we are operating under a common law set of rules dealing with negligence which is quite out of keeping with modern conditions and the requirements of our times.  The apportionment of negligence has been statute law in England for many years now. I think that that matter should, and I am sure it does, engage the attention of the Law Reform Committee but I should like to see a proposal in the form of a Bill introduced here.  There <Col N="268" /> are other matters also such as the complete reform of our law with regard to married women and the Married Women's Property Acts.  They require the urgent attention of the Law Reform Committee and of this House. However, the measure before us is the first step and it is welcome.  I hope and feel sure that this Bill will be followed shortly by a number of similar Bills which will rectify incongruous rules at present applying in our law, stop certain gaps and generally bring our Irish law into conformity with the conditions or requirements of the times.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera may be flippant if he wants to be.  The fact is that if one examines the progress that has been made in legislation in the British Parliament, in an imperial country, and compares that with the legislation in important matters in a country that started off with a Republican Constitution, one is entirely amazed.  As Deputy O'Higgins has said, in the matter of the law of property, we are still under the old feudal system.  I would not mind, but 26 years ago the matter was dealt with in the British Parliament.  The British Act is there to be a help and a guide, but nothing has been done in regard to it.  I know that when the Minister comes to reply he will tell us that they have set up a new sub-section of the Attorney-General's Department to deal with the question of the revision of the laws.  Who is in that sub-section? When is it going to operate?  When is it going to produce anything?  Will we wait for another nine or ten years until that particular portion of this <Col N="269" /> original Bill dealing with married women will be introduced?</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister has the best intentions in the world in regard to it. I know that his predecessor had the best intentions in the world with regard to these matters.  Intentions are no good.  This House has been unduly patient.  Our judges and lawyers and the public generally have not thrown enough effort into this matter of having our laws brought up to date.  I am glad that the opportunity arises on this Bill to make those observations.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has thrown out a very useful suggestion, that there might be formed in this Parliament, from amongst those who are competent, a law reform committee which would keep an eye on progress made elsewhere, review legislation that we know is antiquated and out of date and suggest and, perhaps, draft legislation. I hope the Minister will be instrumental in bringing about the formation of such a committee.  I think I speak for a number of people in this House in saying that they would be prepared to co-operate in every way in making a success of such a committee. Apart entirely from this question of law reform, which is vital and necessary, there is the matter of what I might term law revision, codifying statutes.</P>

    <P>I, like the other Deputies, welcome this Bill.  We hope that it is the spearhead, the first step, in bringing about this long-awaited law reform. The Minister can count on the co-operation and assistance of the House <Col N="270" /> in any steps he takes to bring about law reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>A Bill of this nature is not a matter of urgent national importance.  My first reaction when I saw it, in present-day circumstances, was that surely we could have more urgent and useful business to do than this.  Nevertheless, from another point of view, I suppose this type of reform is of some importance but this, in a sense, is a very, very trifling bit of law reform.  In saying that, I am not in any way minimising, or throwing aspersions on, the arguments advanced, for instance, by Deputy O'Higgins, as to why such a Bill should be passed.  It is desirable, in fact, that such a change should take place but it is a relatively minor thing and one's first reaction to it is that, with so much of importance to be done, it seems to be trifling, fiddling while something is burning, to be dealing with this sort of thing.  However, it is here now and we had better deal with it.  I am a bit disappointed that, if we are going to deal with law reform, such a trifling and relatively unimportant matter of law reform should be able to come here for consideration so quickly when there are more urgent matters of law reform awaiting attention.  For quite a considerable amount of time we have been waiting for a revision, say, of the landlord and tenant code.  The delay in dealing with the rent Acts has been the subject of comment already. Apparently, there will not be any amendment of the Rent Restrictions Act for quite a long time.  There are other aspects of landlord and tenant law that, under present circumstances, are urgently compelling attention and even in priority to such a Bill as this there is the matter which Deputy O'Higgins mentioned&mdash;I am glad he did mention it&mdash;the question of contributory negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will admit that the reforms that are suggested in this particular Bill have a case to be made for them.  The Minister has made the case.  This Bill in fact is, in our particular way of doing the job, largely enacting a reform which was enacted in England providing for <Col N="271" /> a modification of the old common law rule in regard to joint tortfeasors.  That was effected by statute in England a considerable time ago.  You do meet an odd case&mdash;I think I heard Deputy Cowan say that he questioned whether the practice of collusion was a regular one.  I think he said it <i>sotto voce</i> but I think he did question whether there was any abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  An odd case turns up, but where a plaintiff gets competent legal advice it is very infrequent indeed that a gross injustice occurs because of the common law rule in regard to joint tortfeasors.  In fact, there is, perhaps, a case to be made the other way.  I know the Taoiseach introduced this Bill and it was seconded by Deputy McGilligan, both of them lawyers, and they were probably taking the point of view that was adopted in England in the arguments that were put up here.  I am not sure, if we were to stand back and forget England, that we might not look at it in another way.</P>
      <P>Why should you come to the relief of a person who is a tortfeasor, anyway&mdash;by contribution?  If they are wrongdoers in principle, for a start, why come to their relief?  I am not going to develop that argument in detail for the reason that probably on the balance of that argument there is a case to be made for this Bill and I think we should take it.  But I think it is a pity, if we are going to deal with law reform, that we do not do what Deputy Cowan or Deputy O'Higgins suggested, and that is to get down to really urgent law reform, down to things that are socially necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned landlord and tenant and contributory negligence.  For the odd case where you may have complications because of the common law rule, because of the joint wrongdoers that may turn up, you have in questions of negligence an issue that has been causing a considerable amount of trouble, even quite recently, owing to the fact that our <Col N="272" /> legal system has turned what should be a pure issue of fact into a sublimated issue of law.  In the Irish Law Reports you have one whole issue devoted to a case dealing with who is to be blamed in a running-down action. There is a matter where I would commend the Minister to take action.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill we should not delay on.  It is a relatively trifling one.  The question of procedure in regard to law reform has been touched upon.  The suggestion has been made to appoint a committee of the House to consider law reform.  There is a practical difficulty. I am not quite so sure whether the Minister will not get the best service through the machinery of his own departmental officers.  They can easily get in touch with the practice side of it.  The difficulty is the amount of work and the time involved for a committee to do the job properly.  I happen to be one of the members dealing with a Consolidation Bill at the moment, and I am convinced from experience of that Bill that it would be almost impossible for an individual Deputy to deal with a reform or a consolidation matter in the thorough way that a departmental committee can deal with it.  The question of external consultants is another matter.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that it is largely a question of balance.  I am not sure that we have a solution yet, but perhaps the best method is the method which the Attorney-General has adopted, namely, consolidate what you have, first, where you have a mass of statute law, and on that build your reforms.</P>
    <P>I think I am trespassing very much beyond my proper domain and if I do appear to have a cold welcome for this Bill it is not that there is anything wrong with the Bill or that reform is not desirable.  It arises out of a sense of disappointment that we cannot be doing something more socially worth while.  There is a sense of disappointment that here we have a Government dominated largely by lawyers and you would imagine that if law reform were to come that there would be some direction from them and that there would be some practical change in the law in relation to big things such as <Col N="273" /> landlord and tenant.  We have not got that and I must confess my disappointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I would like to refer to in connection with this small measure.  While I welcome the measure for what it is worth, still, as Deputy de Valera said, I do not consider it any great advance towards law reform.  There is one thing I can see in it and that is that it is likely to bring further grist to the lawyers' mill because, in certain circumstances, there will now be two actions instead of one.  Naturally, that will be to the benefit of the legal practitioners. If a plaintiff fails in one instance he can bring an action against the second joint tortfeasor.  Is that not correct?  If a plaintiff fails in one action for damages against one tortfeasor, or if it turns out that that tortfeasor is not a good mark, that he has nothing and that no damages can be recovered from him, then the plaintiff can proceed against the second one, or there is a contributory right.  Therefore, there can be more than one action.</P>

The Government has to approve of these Bills but you can take it that they will come before the House fairly speedily and I do want the House to assist me in dealing with them.  On the question of the law reform committee, Deputy Cowan mentioned what I had stated in the Seanad, that we have a special branch of the Attorney-General's office to deal with this particular matter.  It was to relieve the parliamentary draftsman's office that this special branch was set up.</P>

      <P>Every single one of these branches is under consideration. As I have said I do not wish to delay the House.  If there are any changes to be made, that is a matter for the Committee Stage.  Deputy C. Lehane referred to the great hardships that exist and said that this was the first step in a practical way to get rid of them.  Deputy O'Higgins suggested that we might establish a committee composed of members of the House.  I do not think that would work very satisfactorily but, however, it is a matter that could be considered.  I know there are some Deputies who are great workers but I do not think it is fair to put this obligation on them. However, it is a matter that I shall take into consideration and see what we can do in that respect.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Rent Restrictions Act, which has been mentioned, I think everybody should commend the committee for the speed with which they are trying to deal with that particular question.  Anybody reading the evidence can see that it is not just as easy to deal with the matter as the Opposition would suggest, that there are very serious factors to be taken into consideration and that no Government, unless there was a complete dictatorship, could undertake to <Col N="276" /> proceed one way or the other without having all the facts before it.  However, this Bill represents a good start. We shall, as quickly as possible, bring the other measures before the House, and I hope that when I introduce the next Bill, I shall not be met with the taunt that I should have brought in another one instead.  I hope that each measure will be taken as a token of our endeavour to deal with the reforms necessary in the existing statute law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill might need some qualification in this section and I recommend the following to the Minister for consideration.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The recovery by a person (in this section referred to as the injured person) of judgment against a tortfeasor (in this section referred to as the original defendant) for damages in respect of an injury occasioned by a tort shall not be a bar to an action by the injured person for damages in respect of that injury against any other person, whether that other person is or is not alleged to be liable as joint tortfeasor with the original defendant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that some restriction might be desirable there.  It means that a person can take an action against anybody allegely in respect of a tort, that is, of a civil wrong, and if he fails in that, he can proceed against another person.  Look at it from another point of view.  Is it a desirable thing to give a prospective plaintiff such a wide choice in the beginning?  Is it, in practice, not going to lead to a certain carelessness, perhaps, in the launching of an action, particularly in the case of a particular kind of action?  If an action is started and fails, another action may be brought against, as it <Col N="277" /> is stated in the section, any other person,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;whether that other person is or is not alleged to be liable as joint tortfeasor with the original defendant&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to go into Section 3 about that.  That is my difficulty in confining myself to the section here.  I cannot see why you deal with the stage of recovering judgment because you can still always do what was done heretofore, and that is join everybody.  You do it at a certain risk of having one or other of them dismissed.  Would it not be better to provide an amendment dealing with it that way: that, whereas this does certainly meet the point that has been put up, does it, on the other hand, go a little bit too far in the opposite direction? I still feel that, instead of doing it in this particular way, if you were to deal with the execution stage and, if necessary, provide against the costs of failing against a defendant, it might be a better provision than this particular mode of attack which, as far as my recollection goes, is the mode of attack adopted in the British Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will now appreciate the force of what I had to say on the Second Reading because it seems to me that a Committee Stage discussion of matters of interest to lawyers only is quite impracticable in this House. The various matters referred to by Deputy de Valera which can arise on this section and on Section 3 are of considerable interest to lawyers, and could be discussed here <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Deputies interested in them.  For that reason I did suggest on the Second Reading that it would be of assistance if these various matters could be discussed by lawyer-Deputies before the Bill was introduced in the House.  I do not think that a discussion in Committee on a purely legal Bill can be considered in the same way as a discussion on Bills of a different kind.  I think that the swopping of views by Deputies interested in matters of this kind can be quite fruitless. I would suggest to Deputies that they should regard this Bill as being something more than a bit of legislation. It is a Bill containing a principle which was suggested in this House in 1941, and which was referred to a special committee, then to the <Col N="279" /> Law Reform Committee and eventually it comes before us in Bill form ten years later.  That is a point which all Deputies should consider.  They should realise that each proposal in this Bill has been studied very carefully and its repercussions considered.</P>
      <P>I have read the Bill carefully, but I do not want to say that I would be prepared to support every line and comma in it in absolute confidence.  I have no intention of discussing the Bill from the legal point of view.  All of us, whether lawyers or not, know well of cases where an action has been taken by an unfortunate injured person against a particular defendant.  Some fatality of that kind may have taken place with regard to a particular case, and the injured person has been unable to collect the amount of compensation which the court declared he was rightfully entitled to.  If his action had arisen in such circumstances that two or more people caused him damage, as the law stands to-day if he goes into court and sues John Jones or anybody else, he has to elect to make John Jones his paymaster.  If, by reason of something that happens, he cannot recover from the defendant he is deprived of all right of action against anybody else.  This Bill attempts to cure that.  It only applies to successful actions because it is only there it could arise.  Section 3 ensures that no injustice, such as Deputy Kissane has in mind, could possibly arise.  I suggest to all Deputies that we might regard the provisions in this Bill as provisions which have been arrived at after considerable thought and research by the members of the law reform committee. It is not going to be fruitful if we attempt to parse each line and section of the Bill, and I think we could let it go at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not often that I find myself in general agreement with Deputy O'Higgins.  I do agree with him in regard to what he said as to the futility of our going into these matters in detail.  There is a great deal of force in his argument that this Bill has been specially considered. Nevertheless, we have our responsibilities in these matters in this House, <Col N="280" /> and, when a Bill comes before us, we should discharge that responsibility.  I quite realise that the approach which I have suggested to this section would mean a radical change in the Bill.  It is not a change which could be easily dealt with by way of amendment.  For that reason, I do not want to pursue my own attitude on this as it is a relatively unimportant matter, but since it is before us it should be done properly.</P>
      <P>The only criticism is that there can be a multiplicity of actions.  That possibility is there and my purpose in getting up was to bear out what Deputy Kissane said in that regard, since he was challenged, that it was possible to have a multiplicity of actions under this and the question arose as to whether that was a desirable course or not.  I think that will be conceded now.  Beyond that, let us hope that the bringing in of a Bill of this nature will not lead to too much litigation. The trouble about law reform Bills generally, especially when they are taken in this way, is that they tend to bring about litigation, which is not so good for the community.  In this case I think there is that danger and that danger arises under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Major de Valera, it appears to me that it is very desirable to have a multiplicity of actions with the result that justice ultimately will be done, rather than to have just one action which is in effect unsuccessful and therefore results in injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are going to regard a multiplicity of actions as an evil, I think it is clear that the plaintiff's failure to recover in the first action is also an evil and, consequently, taking this at its worst, you are choosing the lesser of two evils in adopting the machinery given by this section rather than allowing the law to remain as it is.  There may be some method, for further examination, of curtailing the number of possible actions, but, facing up to the realities of life as we know it, I do not see that there can be such a very great number of actions, <Col N="281" /> that the number involved would be a real evil.  If there were three actions it would be about the limit, I think, in 99 per cent. of the cases that we can visualise.  Therefore, I suggest that there is not the weight in the point made by Deputy Major de Valera which, at first blush, might appear to be there.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that some of the Deputies who listened to me on the Second Reading did not grasp the point I was driving at.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>No, successful, and that it would be found that after being successful no damages could be recovered from the named defendant.  Another step in the same action is to have a joint tortfeasor named as defendant and damages recovered from him, or if damages could not be recovered from him and if there is another one, well and good.  But I understood Deputy O'Higgins to say that that would not increase the costs, that the costs would be the same.</P>

      <P>There are other matters which I would like to take this opportunity of urging upon the Minister. <Col N="284" /> If he will look at the <i>Irish Reports,</i> 1949, at page 91 and subsequent pages, he will find a good deal written there as to what should be a simple issue of fact and a simple question of determination as to who is to blame for damage caused.  As a result of a long series of judicial decisions this has now become a highly complicated and technical question of law.  The result is that a very common form of action has become a hazard for the injured party and a gamble for the litigants.  It is wrong to have our law in that position.  It is wrong that one should read in a judgment where a judge with the voice of common sense says one thing but must come to a different conclusion having regard to the law.  When the law gets to that stage, as it sometimes does, after a long train of decisions, one grafted over the other, there is only one cure; that cure is speedy legislation.  If there is one case for law reform apart from landlord and tenant and social legislation, that case is contributory negligence.  I might mention that that has also been dealt with in England. Let us hope that this Bill is the forerunner of more substantial contributions in the future.</P>

      <P>Following on the line taken by Deputy Major de Valera, in at least eight courts every day in the City of Dublin cases are decided in actions turning upon negligence. The lawyers engaged in these cases, the litigants and the judges have said time and time again that they are operating a system of common law which inevitably works injustice to litigants and to citizens generally. That situation has arisen as a result of legal sophistry over the centuries. Its effect is now being felt in our common law.  It is something that cries out for immediate reform.</P>

That leads to confusion.  Surely it should be possible to have one time so that everyone will work and sleep during the same hours.  The present <Col N="286" /> system makes people late for trains and buses and causes endless annoyance and confusion.  I think it is a bad system and it should not be allowed to go on.  Some years ago a special commission inquired into this matter and made some recommendations. I think they suggested sunset and sunrise and no dependence upon Northern Ireland or Great Britain.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that some difficulty arose in regard to the actual procedure. The Minister indicated that it was the intention to abolish county officers as soon as possible and to transfer the functions to the county secretaries and, in time, all this administrative and executive work would be carried out by the county secretaries.  In moving the amendment, I asked the Minister to indicate how soon it was proposed to bring about what I might term the final evolution under this particular Bill.  I think that is what gave rise to the discussion then on the section.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Bill provides that county managers will become county officers.  In four instances, there will be vacancies and the point I want to be clear on is whether in those four instances the county secretaries will become the principle officers right away, or whether they will only be appointed to these four particular offices as a temporary measure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  The amendment provides that if that is so, the moment there is a vacancy and there is no county officer, the functions may be transferred to the county secretary. If that is so, then my amendment provides that the county council shall make the order instead of, as in the section,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" />&ldquo;the Minister, after consultation with the county council concerned&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the difficulty I am in regarding Section 15.  If it is the intention of the Minister that there will be a period when any vacancies will be filled by county officers, then I know where I stand and if it is the intention that they will not be so filled, I also know where I stand, but if it is the intention that they will not be filled, then there should be no necessity for the provision already in the Bill and dealt with for the appointment of county officers by the Local Appointments Commission. However, I think the House will understand my difficulty, and I hope that if there is any further discussion on the amendment, that that difficulty will be appreciated.  In any event, my view is that if we decide in this Bill to bring about that particular evolution to the county secretaries and that decision is taken now and by statute, then there is no reason why the Minister should have to consult the county council.  Why should he have to consult the county council if it is the intention to do that? If it is the intention to do that and there is a vacancy, let the local authority make the order transferring the functions to the county secretary. For those reasons, I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan argued earlier that because the Minister had agreed to the temporary appointment this ought to go on the same principle; but it is not the same principle.  Section 15 relates to permanent appointments and, apart from the grouped counties, there will be other permanent officers appointed.  The Deputy's proposal is that the appointment would be automatic; that the county secretary would be automatically appointed by the county council and that he would automatically step up to be county officer. That is the proposal in the amendment, and, as I have already pointed out, there are objections to that.  The Minister is the man who has the sanctioning of appointments and removal from office, if a man is considered unsuitable.  A man may have been functioning for ten, 15 or 20 years and he may not feel like taking on the responsibilities <Col N="290" /> of the new post, even if it carries additional salary.  Under this proposal, his consent is not secured&mdash; he is automatically transferred by the county council&mdash;whereas the Bill suggests what I think is a more elastic and commonsense way.  In the normal course, the filling of the vacancy is a matter for the Local Appointments Commissioners.  It is only in the initial stages that there is a panel from which they may draw, but, in the case of the grouped counties, it will be automatic to the extent that the county manager will become county officer in one of the two grouped counties. In the normal way, it would be filled by the Local Appointments Commission, and I suggest that the method proposed in the amendment is unfair to the individual, to the county council and to the general administration of the council's affairs.  There ought to be discussions as to suitability and as to a man's desire to take the position.  He ought not to be forced into the position.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be able to envisage cases in which a man would have been functioning for quite a number of years and would not be anxious to take on these added responsibilities, even though, as I say, they might carry additional salary.  The Bill provides for consultation with the county council by the Minister as to the suitability of the officer, so that in a general atmosphere of agreement the appointment would or would not be made.  I can see&mdash;and I am sure every Deputy can see&mdash;that there could be circumstances in which this automatic method could be disastrous, or at least disadvantageous, and the more fluid method of consultation between the Minister and the county council as to the person whom they will have in this very responsible office and the consent and agreement of that individual would make for more effective working. There could be very poor results, and even bad consequences, from having it applied automatically.  It might work in some cases and might not work in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what objection there can be on the part of the Deputy to having the name of the Minister included, but <Col N="291" /> whether you try to exclude him or not, you cannot deny that he is the person who must say whether a man is to be removed from office.  If he has the right to say that a man should be removed because of unsuitability, is there anything wrong in saying that there should be consultation with him as to the suitability of a gentleman going into a particular office?  That, coupled with the fact that we believe it should not be forced on a man against his will, that he ought to be a consenting party, should convince Deputies that the proposal in the Bill is more acceptable and calculated to lead to better working than the proposal in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making this matter more complicated than ever.  Where there is not a county manager at present the position of county officer is to be filled, so far as I can gather, by the promotion of the county secretary if the Minister is satisfied with regard to suitability, but he says further on that he is to be county secretary.  Sub-section (2) of the section sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where an Order is made under sub-section (1) of this section transferring functions to a county secretary, the Order shall provide that the title of the office thereafter to be held by such county secretary shall be ... county secretary (with the name of the county prefixed).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To what is he going to promote the county secretary?  To be county secretary, which he is already?  I never saw a more cockeyed Bill in my life. He takes power to appoint county officers, and, on the other hand, he says that the county officers will become county secretaries.  Which is it to be?  I have a kind of feeling of envy with regard to the four areas, seeing what the position in other counties is to be under this section, and I suggest to the Minister that he take the Bill home, spend a couple of nights over it and bring it into some kind of shape before putting it before the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is in doubt I might explain that the intention is to pass from the position of county manager and, if that title is essentially altered in a kind of transition period, it will eventually become county secretary.  It is left to the councils that they should effect an economy by merging two offices&mdash;the county manager taking up the duties of the county secretary or the county secretary taking up the dual position of county manager and secretary under the title of county officer.  That is the main principle.  There could be circumstances in which the county council would feel that the work of the county was too big and that they could not afford to dispense with an officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the county councils feel that they would not be able to carry out the work on the basis of one man discharging these functions, they are entitled to apply for an assistant county secretary on consultation with the Minister, but they have the option of merging the two posts, and surely that discretion ought to be left to the county council&mdash;to make a saving, if they feel they can do so, or, if they feel that it would be necessary, they are entitled to appoint an assistant county secretary.  There is nothing very illusory about that.  From what Deputy Corry said last night one would think that we were going to pile additional officers on the county councils.  The reverse is the fact. Two posts are to be merged and not another officer is to be added unless a county council feels that they ought to have a man to replace the county secretary.  There is no additional officer in question.</P>

      <P>I just wish to say a word, strictly on the amendment.  I do not know if this is another manifestation of what Deputy Cowan would describe as popular democracy.  I have many objections to the section and to the principles involved, nevertheless it is a salutary thing, perhaps, and at least a concession to the proprieties, that before the Minister exercises his <Col N="293" /> powers under Section 1 he should do the council the courtesy of consulting them.  Deputy Cowan, like the strong one-Party-State man that he is, wishes to brush all that aside, to have a dictator in the Custom House and, under the guise of giving the council some powers, he would make it mandatory upon them to transfer the functions automatically.  Is not that a mockery, is it not merely flouting the self-respect of the council?  If the Deputy is really in earnest about this, it would seem to me that the right type of amendment would be to delete the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and say that &ldquo;the council may&rdquo;.  The Deputy has put it that the council &ldquo;shall by order&rdquo;.  They will not have any option in the matter.  It does not matter whether they consider that the officer to whom it is proposed to transfer the functions is fit to discharge them or not.  They simply have to carry out the obligation which Deputy Cowan would impose on them and for that reason the amendment is a thoroughly bad one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>I might suggest, through the Ceann Comhairle, to Deputy Childers, who has been making a very constructive effort to improve this Bill as far as he can, that he might advise his present neighbour to go off and enjoy a cup of tea. Since Deputy MacEntee has come into this debate, he has done me a signal honour in selecting me for considerable abuse.  Obviously, a person who is attacked continuously&mdash;last night and starting off now to-day&mdash;is not a nonentity.  If he were, he would not be worth so much attention from a person of Deputy MacEntee's capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put the amendment before the Minister and the House and I had no doubt whatsoever as to the exact meaning of every word in it.  It was framed deliberately in that way, for this reason, that if the intention is to transfer these functions as soon as possible to county secretaries, the proper people to do it, in my view, are the local authority, the county council and nobody else.  However, the Minister wants, in the way all these things are drafted, to have the power. He says: &ldquo;I want to have the power <Col N="294" /> to appoint and remove, and if I have the power to remove I should have the power to appoint.&rdquo;  What precise powers of removal the Minister will have in regard to a county secretary might be considered.  Obviously, he would have power under some Local Government Act in relation to any official of a county council.  When he uses that phraseology, however, he is himself making the mistake of confusing the county secretary with the county manager&mdash;who is in a special place in regard to appointment and removal.  The county secretary, under the new arrangement, will have vested in him or transferred to him all the functions of the county officer or, in other words, all the functions of the county manager at the moment.  I think, on principle, that that is a power which ought to be exercised by the local authority, who are more capable of knowing whether their county secretary is fit for the job or not.  If he is not fit for it, he should not be there at all.  It is an important appointment and if he is not fit to exercise these additional functions he is not fit to be a county secretary.  I am working on the assumption that he is fit and that it is the Minister's intention that this system of management, whether by managers or by county officers, will be abolished as soon as possible and that the functions will be exercised by a county secretary.  I say that that is a power which ought to be exercised by the local authority and not by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A peculiar provision in the section is that the Minister may be order, after consultation, decide this.  When a county officer dies or resigns or there is a vacancy, the Minister, whoever he may be, may say: &ldquo;We have codded the Dáil in passing through this County Officers Bill.  We have no intention of transferring the functions to the county secretary.  We will not consult them and they will have to appoint, through the Local Appointments Commission, another county officer to fill the vacancy.&rdquo;  That is why I think this amendment is important. If members of local authorities who are in this House are not <Col N="295" /> frightened off by Deputy MacEntee's great love for me, possibly they would agree that there is a lot to be said for the amendment.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept it as it is written, he might put it in a way that would commend itself to all members of local authorities who understand clearly what is provided by the amendment and what is important.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that as he has the power to remove he should have the power to appoint.  It is the local authority that foots the bill and it is the people who pay it who should have the power and authority.  They should not be left in the position that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; be consulted by the Minister if the Minister chooses to consult them. They are working every day with the county officer and know whether he is efficient or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will consult &ldquo;the county council&rdquo;.  It would be interesting to know how he will do that.  Would he go down and meet them, in meeting assembled?  Would some officer of his Department write a letter?  Obviously, it could not be to the county secretary, to ask whether the county secretary was suitable or not.  If the county officer was dead or had resigned, would the Minister communicate with some junior official or would he send down some letter to be read at the next meeting, saying he wanted the opinion of the council as to whether the secretary was efficient or not?  Is that a sensible thing to do?  That letter would be received by the secretary in the ordinary way.  It may be that the Minister might go to the county council chairman instead.  I think however that the more you consider the implications of that section regarding the appointment the more objectionable it becomes and the clearer it is that my amendment is the better amendment notwithstanding what Deputy MacEntee may say.</P>

      <P>Before you take the section, might I make a statement?</P>
      <P>In connection with sub-section (2) of Section 15, I should like, with the permission of the House, to refer back to the discussion yesterday on amendments numbered 1 and 2 in the name of Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain.  If the amendments were made as proposed by the Deputy to change the title of county officer to riarthóir contae and assistant county officer to leasriarthóir contae I am advised that they would have no effect unless supplemented by corresponding amendments throughout the Bill.  I am also advised that the official translation of county officer will be oifigeach chontae and of assistant county officer leas-oifigeach chontae.  To write these titles into the Bill as a whole would necessitate hundreds of amendments, the names of the officers being so frequently mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> I have no objection to amendments which will ensure that the titles of the holders of these offices shall be oifigeach chontae and leas-oifigeach chontae and I am advised that this can be achieved by amendments of Section 8 and Section 13 (6) without consequential amendments in the remainder of the Bill.  I propose to put down amendments for the Report Stage of the Bill accordingly and in connection with Section 15 which we are now discussing I shall have a corresponding amendment put down to change the title of the county secretary when the duties of county officer are assigned to him by providing that the title of his office shall thereafter be the appropriate Irish version of the title.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 15.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might, as a preliminary to further discussion, indicate to the House what is the significance of sub-section (9) of the section.  Sub-section (9) reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an Order is made under sub-section (1) of this section, the reference in sub-section (3) of Section 9 of this Act to the making of an appointment of a county officer shall have effect as a reference to the making of the said Order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the office of county officer for a county (including Dublin) is vacant, the Minister shall appoint a person to be county officer for the county until an appointment to the office is or is deemed to be made by the council of the county or, in the case of the County of Dublin, is made under sub-section (5) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I really want to know what is the effect of sub-section (9) before we proceed to discuss the section further.  It is rather obscure and difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (9) links with sub-section (3) of Section 9.  It enables the Minister whenever there is a vacancy in the office of county officer <Col N="298" /> to appoint a person to hold temporarily the office of county officer until a permanent county officer is appointed or until an order is made under this section amalgamating the office of county secretary with that of county officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for clearing that point up because at first sight it might be thought that the effect of sub-section (9) was to reduce all the appointments made under sub-section (1) to the status of temporary appointments, but I gather that that is not in fact the effect of the sub-section, and that appointments made under sub-section (1) of Section 15 will be permanent appointments.  I trust I am correct in this interpretation.</P>
      <P>This is a most peculiar section and I asked last night that the Minister might explain its effect fully.  I say it is most peculiar first of all because it does not relate merely to group counties; it relates to all posts of county officer because it says here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the office of a county officer for a county is vacant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is most peculiar because if we turn back to Section 9 we find that sub-section (1) prescribes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The office of county officer shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, applies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently it does not apply to appointments which are to be made under sub-section (1).  It would look as if the real purpose of the section is by a side wind to get rid of the obligations which the Local Appointments Acts impose on local authorities and of course upon the Minister, and to vest in the Minister all power of appointment which under the Act is exerciseable by the Local Appointments Commissioners in relation to the post of county officer, and to vest power of appointment in the Minister in the case of the post of county secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>Section 15 provides that where the office of county officer is vacant or becomes vacant the Minister may by order transfer the functions of county officer of the county to the county secretary of the county, and in the case of a county having one or more than one assistant county officer to either an assistant county officer or to the county secretary.  I was going to say when Deputy Sweetman interrupted me that it is true that the power of appointment is limited to the extent that the Minister may only appoint the county secretary of the county or, in the case of a county having one or more than one assistant county officer, either an assistant county officer or the county secretary of the county.  He has a very restricted option in the case of a county secretary and he has a choice of options in cases where there is an assistant county officer.  But what is the purpose of providing in the Bill&mdash; in what might be described, if it were not for some things that have emerged in the course of the examination of the Bill, as the principal section of the Bill, Section 8, Part II&mdash;that there shall be a county officer for each county, whose title shall be county officer, and going further and providing that under Section 9 the office of county officer is one to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, applies, namely, that it is a post which must be filled through the Local Appointments Commission, and then going on, by Section 15, to reduce Section 8 to a farce because, under Section 15, the Minister can abolish the post of county officer by his own Order.  There must be some object behind this.  What is that object?  So far, the Minister has not disclosed it to the House.  Surely this elaborate machinery is not brought in merely for the purpose of changing the name of the post of county officer to that of county secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an elaborate section containing ten sub-sections.  Surely it is not brought in merely in order that the Minister may change the name of the post of county officer to that of county secretary, without any change in function.  Note that in every case, but particularly in sub-section (1), there is a wholesale, comprehensive transfer of <Col N="300" /> functions from the county officer to the county secretary.  What is the purpose of this elaborate machinery for doing that?  Surely if it were merely a desire to change the name, a simple section might be inserted in the Bill saying that the Minister may at any time, notwithstanding Section 8 of the Bill, change the designation of the post of county officer to that of county secretary.  There must be something more than that simple operation envisaged by this sub-section. If we read it we see that the Minister&mdash;where it happens to suit him, or, shall we say, his political machine&mdash;if he thinks that he has a suitable puppet serving in one or other of these posts, can transfer, as soon as the county officership becomes vacant, the functions of the county officer to the county secretary or the assistant county secretary, as the case may be.  Of course, that fortunate individual will enjoy a commensurate increase in his remuneration.  That is the implication which I think this sub-section legitimately leaves the Minister open to.</P>
    <P>Then consider the effect of sub-section (2).  Remember that under sub-section (1) the Minister is transferring all the functions of the county secretary or, where there is an assistant county officer or a county secretary, to one or other of these persons, whomsoever he happens to favour.  But there is no change whatever in the general character of the post.  Notwithstanding that, we then find that the Minister is solemnly bound under sub-section (2), wherever he makes an Order under sub-section (1), to change the title of the office thereafter to be held by such county secretary to that of, say, the Laoighis county secretary or the Kildare county secretary or the Dublin county secretary&mdash;the geographical name of whatever county this functionary happens to operate in.  We have all been intrigued, if not particularly edified, by some recent scandals that have come to light&mdash;the cases of <i>Newtown Rock, Smiling Marcus,</i> and so forth.  Does this not seem to look like the same operation?  Here we have the old horse running under <Col N="301" /> a new name in order that this sort of a trick may be perpetrated upon some simple folk who follow the Minister, who think, as I think it was Deputy Cowan who thought, that some great administrative convulsive revolution in local government is going to take place by transferring the functions of the county officer to the individual who is going to be called a county secretary. Is this not all part of the sham?</P>
    <P>So far as sub-section (2) is concerned, a really significant change is going to be made in local administration: that is the sham.  The only significant change I can see which will be made by Section 15 is the one which is envisaged in sub-section (1)&mdash;that which enables the Minister, whoever he may be&mdash;and I do not want the Minister to think that I am ascribing to him and to him only the frailties to which most politicians are heir&mdash;to have a right of appointment, independent of the Local Appointments Commissioners, which he has not at present.  This is, if you like, an increase, an extension of the limited powers of patronage which the Minister for Local Government makes. This power is being made in the name of democracy and of clean government. For that reason, if for no other reason, I think that this section ought to be resisted.</P>

Of course, the Minister is doing no such thing.</P>

      <P>He did say that when I interrupted him.  I may say that I interrupted him because what he was saying was obviously incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that what is being done under this section is perfectly <Col N="302" /> obvious to anyone.  I believe it is perfectly obvious to Deputy MacEntee, although he does not want to admit it. This section is providing that, as soon as possible, bearing in mind existing contracts of service, the positions of county officer and county secretary are being amalgamated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly obvious that where you have in a county a person with an existing contract of service as county manager and another person with an existing contract of service as county secretary, you can only do one of two things.  You can provide that they will have services to perform under the new system or you can do what Deputy Corry last night said that we ought to do, namely, throw them out on the wayside and pay them compensation for throwing them out.  Deputy Corry last night told us that he believed the best thing to do was to get rid of them, to pay them what was coming to them&mdash;I think was the phrase he used&mdash;and not to use them any more.  I believe that it is better for the ratepayers, when you have to pay a man by reason of his contract of service, to use him while that contract continues.  It seems to me that it is perfectly obvious that that is what this section does.  So long as you cannot provide to break an existing contract unless you are going to pay compensation, it is better to continue the contract and get the service rather than to pay the compensation for nothing.  In this section you will get, in the only way it can be got, the amalgamation of the two offices in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear whether Deputy MacEntee was or was not following the line of Deputy Corry that it was undesirable to amalgamate the two offices.  I want to suggest to other Deputies who have much wider experience of local authorities than I have&mdash;because I only have experience of a county that is one of a grouped pair of counties and where, therefore, so to speak, there is only half a county manager&mdash;that this section provides for the amalgamation of the offices of county officer and county secretary. <Col N="303" /> I want to suggest that, certainly, so far as our county is concerned&mdash;and I think, from what I can gather, the same applies in other counties&mdash;amalgamation would be entirely desirable, coupled with a more direct delegation by the council to the technical officers of the council, that the two things must go side by side.  One of the flaws in the existing scheme is that every recommendation of the county engineer and of the chief medical officer must go through the manager to the council rather than direct from the engineer or chief medical officer to the council. When you get that, as you get it in a later section of this Bill, you will approach the situation in a far better way.  You will cut out a lot of the paper work and a lot of the unnecessary reports, referring the matter from one officer to another, that have become the bane and the nuisance of local government administration.  In that way you will arrive at a situation in which it is desirable to amalgamate as soon as possible the positions of county secretary and county officer.  I believe that this section does it, and I believe it is better to do it this way than to adopt the suggestion that Deputy Corry made last night, namely, to pay the people who have a contract of service compensation for doing nothing in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolve the Minister now that we have heard this section described by a legal luminary.  That legal luminary was here when Section 8 of this Bill was passed by this House.  Section 8 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be a county officer for each county whose title shall be .............. County Officer (with the name of the county prefixed).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 9 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The office of county officer shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926), applies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that the position must be filled by the Local Appointments Commission. The law, as already passed in Section 8, states that there must be <Col N="304" /> a county officer but Section 15 abolishes the county officer and turns him into a county secretary.  I do not happen to be a lawyer.  I happen to be an old farmer but I have had pretty long experience of local administration and I can see the unfortunate Minister himself tied up in a knot.  If, as Deputy Sweetman alleges, the purpose of Section 15 is to amalgamate the two offices into the office of county secretary, and if that is done under Section 15, you are not complying with the law under Section 8, which states that &ldquo;there shall be a county officer&rdquo;.  If, when the county officer goes, you do not fill his post but transfer his functions to a county secretary, what is Section 8 for and what is Section 9 for?  I suggest that you send the problem to one of those newspapers that publish crossword puzzles and offer a prize for whoever would elucidate the problem as to what will happen when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Under Section 13 the Minister may by Order increase the number of assistant county officers for the County of Cork.  In Section 15, he is going to abolish them and transfer their functions to the county secretary.  If the Minister is of opinion or if the Government are of opinion that the county secretary at present is half idle and that the county officer will be half idle and that the two of them together will do only one man's work, the Government will bear out what I always knew of them, that is, that they have complete disregard and disrespect for the ratepayers, if they continue the two of them in office.  According to Section 8, the county manager will become a county officer.  According to Section 15 he will disappear and become a county secretary.  Which of the two will he become?  Which of the two things will happen?  That is what we want to know.  This Bill is like something that would emerge after an all-night sitting that would not be too dry.  That is the only description I can give of it.  If the Minister believes in Section 15, and if Deputy Sweetman believes in it, then they are robbing the ratepayers of Kildare and every other county to the extent of the <Col N="305" /> county officer's salary.  If the Deputy believes that the secretary can do the work of both, why have the county officer?  What is he for?  What work has he to do when the other fellow goes, or when one of them goes?  And when one of them disappears from the scene, how is it that one man is then going to do the work of the two, as will inevitably happen under Section 15?</P>
    <P>Now, we have three assistant county officers and a county manager and their total salaries will be roughly about £5,000 a year, between the four of them.  I do not know whether there is any more, and I am only making a rough guess.  They are all pretty young men.  I would not like to see any of their lives shortened.  Judging by form, any one of them is good enough for ten years more, and during that ten years the ratepayers of Cork County will be asked to pay £50,000 in rates&mdash;and that is not making any allowance for the brainwaves we frequently get from the the Department of Local Government, that some fellow's salary should be doubled.  In ten years the ratepayers of Cork County will have paid them £50,000.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill with no single fundamental principle underlying its provisions but which deals rather with a number of separate and quite distinct matters, and it is consequently the sort of Bill upon which I venture to think the House will not find it necessary to dwell at any great length on Second Reading.  It may well be otherwise on Committee Stage when the House comes to consider in detail the separate proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide the necessary legislative authoity for the establishment of existing District Court clerks.  I need scarcely recall that the position of these clerks has been frequently the subject of discussion in this House, and Deputies on <Col N="306" /> all sides of the House have been vocal in their support of the claim of the clerks to be given established status.  I may, perhaps, be permitted to express my personal gratification on introducing this Bill, which will, I hope, go far to remove any sense of grievance which the District Court clerks may have in consequence of their present, admittedly unsatisfactory, position.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 of the Bill it is proposed to take power to enable clerks who are regarded as being employed whole-time to be established without the necessity of undergoing a competitive or even qualifying test at the hands of the Civil Service Commissioners. Furthermore, power is being taken to enable certificates of qualification granted under the section to be ante-dated so that unestablished whole-time service may be reckonable for pension purposes.  Provision is also made for the payment of gratuities on retirement to any whole-time District Court clerk who may for any reason not secure establishment under the section, as, for example, in the case of a clerk who might be considered ineligible for establishment on account of his age or for reasons of health.</P>
    <P>The section follows generally the lines of Section 62 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, with one important difference. A serious defect in the 1926 Act provision was that it stopped short at providing for persons who were employed in a whole-time capacity at the date of the passing of the Act. Since the Act was passed a number of clerks have become whole-time, but it was not possible to establish these clerks because of the defect to which I have referred.  In Section 3 we now propose to provide that any clerk who is at present only a part-time clerk may be established under the section if at any time subsequently he becomes a whole-time clerk.</P>
    <P>Deputies will doubtless wish to know how exactly the provisions of the section are going to operate in practice.  One thing I want to make clear at once is, that the enactment of these provisions is not going to mean that every existing District Court clerk is going to secure establishment, because there are some <Col N="307" /> clerks who cannot possibly be regarded as fulfilling the requirement of whole-time service.  On the other hand, I can assure the House that the powers under the section will be operated in as generous and liberal a manner as is consistent with the preservation of the idea of whole-time service as a <i>sine qua non</i> for establishment, which idea it is necessary to preserve because of the reactions which any departure from that principle would have on the Civil Service generally.  While certain final administrative details have still to be worked out, I think I can say that the majority of the existing unestablished clerks will secure establishment and in all these cases establishment will carry with it recognition for pension purposes of some at least of the clerk's previous unestablished service.  In many cases unestablished service for as far back as the 1st January, 1927, and in other cases for as far back as the 1st January, 1931, will count for pension.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this particular part of the Bill, there is only one other observation I wish to make and that is with regard to those clerks who may not secure establishment under Section 3.  By agreement with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, I am in a position to state that the request of any such clerk to be retained in the service after attaining the normal retiring age will be sympathetically considered and it may be taken that in practice any such clerk will be retained for so long as he continues to be capable of efficiently and satisfactorily discharging his duties.</P>
    <P>I propose now to deal briefly with the remaining provisions of the Bill, most of which are minor technical amendments of the existing Court Officers Acts which experience has shown to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is intended to remove any possible doubt as to the liability of a county registrar to surrender to the Exchequer any fees which he may receive in his capacity as under-sheriff. As Deputies are probably aware, Section 54 of the Court Officers <Col N="308" /> Act, 1926, provided that when an under-sheriff died or otherwise ceased to hold office, his duties should automatically become transferred to and vested in the county registrar for the county.  The under-sheriff's remuneration consisted in the main of the fees which he collected under the Under-Sheriff's Fees Orders in connection with the execution of court orders, and under the provisions of Section 54 of the 1926 Act it might conceivably be arguable that the right to collect and retain such fees was a right that became transferred to the county registrar. The county registrar, unlike the former under-sheriff, is a whole-time officer whose remuneration is fixed on the basis that he will perform all the duties of the office including the duties of under-sheriff and the practice in fact is to specify a particular portion of the gross remuneration as an allowance in respect of the performance of the under-sheriff's duties.  Every county registrar has, in point of fact, at all times surrendered to the Exchequer the fees collected on foot of execution orders but it is considered desirable, nevertheless, to avail of the present opportunity to remove any doubts that may exist as to the strict legal position in the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill scarcely calls for any comment as it is self-explanatory. It sometimes is necessary, as Deputies may well imagine, to appoint a deputy for a District Court clerk during the latter's absence through illness or other cause or pending the filling of a vacancy.  As District Court clerks, by virtue of their office, exercise functions under statute and rules of court, it is important that there should be a clear power to appoint a deputy and that there should be no doubt as to a deputy's power to exercise all the powers of a clerk.  The section provides for these matters.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is intended to remedy a technical defect in the existing law relating to district probate registries. There are in all seven such registries, namely Castlebar, Cavan, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick, Mullingar and Waterford. Since the passing of the Court Officers Act, 1926, according as vacancies occurred in the office of district <Col N="309" /> probate registrar, the duties of the office were transferred to the county registrar.  It was always considered very doubtful whether, in fact, there was strictly any power to do this and, accordingly, a provision was included in Section 9 of the Court Officers Act, 1945, which, in very general terms, empowered the Minister for Justice, in the case of a vacancy in an office attached to any court or in case the holder of such an office was absent or incapacitated, to require and authorise any officer attached to the same or any other court to perform the duties of such office for a specified period or until otherwise directed.  This power has been relied upon to enable the duties of the district probate registrar to be discharged by the county registrar. Incidentally, Section 9 of the 1945 Act validated the acts of county registrars, prior to the passing of the 1945 Act, in purported execution of the office of district probate registrar.</P>
    <P>It was, however, overlooked in 1945 that Section 33 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that for the purposes of that Act (save as regards one particular section) none of the district probate registries should be deemed to be an office attached to the High Court.  The Court Officers Act, 1945, in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 (3), must be construed as one with the Act of 1926 and, consequently, it would appear as if the district probate registries are not offices attached to the High Court (or, indeed, any court) for the purposes of Section 9 of the 1945 Act.  This is a serious defect, and one which must be remedied with retrospective effect, and the simplest way of doing this is to provide, as proposed in Section 5, that the district probate registries shall, for the purposes of Section 9 of the 1945 Act, be deemed to be, and to have been since the passing of the 1945 Act, offices attached to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Finally, in Section 6 of the Bill we are providing for two amendments of Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945, which deals with the office of sheriff.  The first of these amendments, set out in sub-section (1) of the section, remedies a flaw in sub-section <Col N="310" /> (4) of Section 12 of the 1945 Act.  The matter is somewhat technical and, if the House will bear with me, I shall endeavour to explain it as briefly as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 23 (3) of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, provided that, so long as the then under-sheriff of the County of Dublin held office, his area of jurisdiction should continue as if the Act had not been passed, but that upon his ceasing to hold office the added urban districts (Pembroke and Rathmines and Rathgar) and the added rural area (as specified in the First Schedule to the Act) should be detached from his area of jurisdiction and he added to the area of the city under-sheriff.  The Local Government (Dublin) (Amendment) Act, 1940 (which provided for the inclusion of Howth Urban District in the City of Dublin) contained a similar provision (sub-section (2) of Section 9), which preserved the area of jurisdiction of the county under-sheriff until a vacancy occurred in that office.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945 (which, in practice, resulted in the creation of a new office of sheriff in the City of Dublin), contained a provision (sub-section (4)) designed to preserve the <i>status quo</i> in so far as the existing county under-sheriff's area of jurisdiction was concerned by providing that the operation of sub-section (3) of Section 23 of the Local Government Act, 1930, should not be affected by any Order in relation to the county borough made under Section 12.  Through what appears to have been a pure oversight, sub-section (4) of Section 12 of the 1945 Act made no reference to Section 9 (2) of the Local Government (Dublin) (Amendment) Act, 1940, so that it is a moot point whether, when an Order was made in 1945 under Section 12 of the Act of that year which resulted in the creation of an office of sheriff for the County Borough of Dublin, it did not operate, notwithstanding Section 9 (2) of the 1940 Act, to transfer the Howth Urban District to the area of jurisdiction of the city sheriff.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to remedy this situation and, in order to remove any possible doubts as to whether or not <Col N="311" /> the Howth area has continued, since the passing of the 1945 Act, to be included in the area of jurisdiction of the county under-sheriff, it is proposed that the amendment of sub-section (4) of Section 12 of the 1945 Act should be given retrospective effect as from the date of the passing of that Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 6 seeks to make provision of a purely <i>ad hoc</i> character in relation to the retiring age of the present Sheriff of the County Borough of Dublin, who is due to attain the age of seventy years in April next and who would then, as the law stands, have to vacate office.  The present sheriff is the first holder of that new office which was created under the Act of 1945, having been appointed in that year to the office by the then Government.  He has given very satisfactory service and, as he enjoys excellent health, both bodily and mentally, it is proposed that he should be retained in office until he reaches the age of seventy-two, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12 of the 1945 Act.  I do not think that this is a proposal to which the House is likely to raise any objection.  I might mention, in order to anticipate a query as to the possible effect in other directions of the proposal, that there are only two other sheriffs and there are never likely to be more than four sheriffs in all, and the question of the retiring age in the case of these officers is not likely to arise again for another twenty-five years.  I suggest that what it is proposed to do now is, in these circumstances, not calculated to have any repercussions in other directions with which we, at all events, need to concern themselves.</P>

      <P>I must congratulate the Minister on finally bringing this vexed question to a satisfactory conclusion. I know there was a strong agitation in favour of it during most of my time as Minister.  I had several deputations both from my own Party and from other sides of the House. Apparently, it has taken an extra three years to bring it to a finish, but better late than never.  I congratulate the Minister on getting over the difficulties <Col N="312" /> which I am sure he had to face.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that I would like to mention.  During our time there was always exception taken to retrospective legislation.  I want to point out that we have it here again.  That being the case, I think the Minister ought to make another attempt to bring into the Order that he made concerning guards who are injured going on duty, the four in respect of whom the whole case was raised.  They were left out of the Order which is quite satisfactory now.  It is too bad, however, that these four should have been left out.  As the Minister had power and influence enough with the Department of Finance to get over the retrospective aspect of this other question, he ought to be able to do the same in the case of these four men.  They had to retire as a result of injuries they sustained on their way to work.  I would ask him now to make a special effort in their regard.  I raised it before, but apparently he took no notice of me.</P>

      <P>The certificates in the case of these men say that they were retired through incapacity.  Therefore, they are in the position that, when they go looking for a job, they have to show their discharge, and the discharge paper indicates that they were retired through incapacity.  That is a real handicap on them so far as getting work is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 6, I think the Minister is expecting too much if he thinks that we are going to approve of what it proposes.  In the last Courts of Justice Act that was passed in my time, we actually got strong support from the Labour Party for the proposal to reduce the retiring ages of future Circuit Court judges from 72 to 70.  The age of 72 was the limit that was fixed in that Act.  There was a somewhat similar proposal many years ago to what we find in Section 6.  It happened before our time as a Government. It was the case of a particular judge.  In order to give him sufficient time to qualify for a pension, the age for the retirement of all Circuit Court judges was extended to 72.  As I have said, in our time the retiring age for <Col N="313" /> Circuit Court judges was reduced from 72 to 70 years of age.  There was general agreement that 70 is a good retiring age.  When that proposal came before the House we got strong support for it from the Labour Party. As well as I remember, there was not a division on it.</P>
    <P>Under the Land Bill which was passed last year, the retiring age for Land Commissioners in the future was reduced from 72 to 65 years of age. Previous to that they could remain on in office until they had reached the age of 72.  They held office on the same tenure as a Circuit Court judge. The Government knew then that they were entitled to hang on to office until they had reached the age of 72 years. But, as I say, under the Land Bill the Minister for Lands took power to retire future Land Commissioners at the age of 65.  In this Bill we have a proposal to extend the tenure of office of the Sheriff of Dublin City from 70 to 72 years.  I know the sheriff personally. He is an old acquaintance and an old friend of mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any case for this proposal at all. Not only is he a friend of mine, but he is a friend of people on the other side of the House.  He is, and always has been, a very efficient and painstaking officer.  He has been very well treated indeed.  He retired as county registrar at the age of 65 years. I suppose we were not justified in it, but for special reasons he was appointed part-time to this position, as well as I recollect, and allowed to remain on with an extra salary up to 70 years.  I think that was treating him handsomely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What case can there be now for reversing engines and for keeping an official on until he reaches the age of 72 when we find other Ministers under their legislation reducing the retiring age from 70 to 65?  I certainly cannot understand that.  I think the Minister made no case at all for this proposal. He expressed the wish that it would <Col N="314" /> not be objected to.  I say there is no case for it.  There is the belief, I understand, that the expectation of life is increasing, and that people are more virile now at 70 than they used to be at 65.  We must not forget, however, that civil sevants, and very efficient civil servants, have to retire at the age of 65.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that some months ago the Government brought in a Bill providing that people who could remain on until they were 72 will in future have to retire at 65, what case can the Minister make for sub-section (2) of Section 6?  We are certainly going to oppose that section.  We are not voting against the Second Reading of the Bill.  We accept the Bill in the main as being a very satisfactory one, but we will not stand for that proposal. This is not a question of personalities but a question of principle.  As far as the personal side of it is concerned all my inclination would be in favour of it, but as I say it is not a question of personalities but of principle.  Therefore, I say it is a bad move and one in the wrong direction.  As I have said, in one case we have the Government legislating to retire people at 65, while in this Bill they are proposing to increase the retiring age from 70 to 72. This Party is not going to support that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>For years the District Court clerks throughout the country have been waiting with patience for a Bill to be introduced which might be regarded as easing their grievances in a satisfactory manner.  Their patience was conditioned by the fact that they had assurances from successive Administrations that their claims would be reasonably considered.  Those of them who will qualify under Section 3 will, naturally, receive this Bill with gratification.  I would like to say a word, however, on behalf of that considerable number of District Court clerks who, as indicated by the Minister, will be left outside the the scope of this Bill.  It has been a pleasing feature of debates here during my time, whether on the Estimate for the Department or on other special occasions, to find members of all Parties taking an interest in this small body of men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> They have given very valuable service to the country over the last 25 or 26 years, and tributes have been paid to the manner in which they organised and administered the work of the courts.  There are records in the Department of Justice as well as declarations to the effect that, at a certain stage, they would be more or less entitled to pensions.  Naturally, they have been waiting for the introduction of this Bill and for the fulfilment of the promises made to them.</P>
    <P>I want to say with Deputy Boland that the Minister is to be congratulated in bringing forward the Bill.  It has been his pleasure and privilege to do so.  It is a Bill which will go a long way towards easing the grievances of a number of those men.  But, neither I nor any other member of the House, knows how many of them are being left outside the scope of the Bill.  There are two omissions to which I want to refer. Section 3 refers to the question of certificates of qualification.  There is no standard set in the section as to what the qualification will be.  I am at a loss to know whether in fact, that standard has to be written into the Bill and, if so, at what stage.  The Minister only touched lightly on that.  The second omission is that we do not know how many men will be left outside the scope of the Bill.  I think the Minister's phrase was that not every one will be entitled to be established.  That statement indicates that some will be left outside its scope.</P>
    <P>It was the fear that there would be such a section in the Bill when introduced which created the feeling all round this House that justice should be done even to that small minority.  The Minister has indicated, and there will be a certain amount of relief as a result of the statement he made, that their case will be dealt with sympathetically. He went on to indicate how it might be dealt with by retaining them in the service after the normal retiring age.  I suggest that has certain disadvantages.  If a man, having given long service, finds himself incapacitated or in bad health and is forced to retire, there is nothing in this Bill or in the Minister's declaration to indicate <Col N="316" /> that he will get a gratuity on retirement.  There is a provision in the Bill that certain clerks will get a gratuity in the event of their not getting a certificate of qualification; but the people who will get that gratuity must have been established whole-time officials.  I repeat that a number of them, notwithstanding the change that has been made, will remain outside that category.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister do what he did when he became Minister for Justice, will he take into consideration the representations of the people who are competent to deal with the grievances of these officials?  There is a very well established organisation which is conducted on very good lines, the District Court Clerks' Association.  I have had preliminary word from them, at any rate, that they are disquieted on account of the terms of the Bill because of the number of people likely to be left outside it.  Their disappointment in that respect can be understood because they had not the benefit of hearing the Minister's statement in the matter.  Is it possible to have from the Minister an indication of what will be the qualification for a certificate and whether he is prepared to deal with the section who will be left out in a manner which will ensure that, if there is disability owing to illness or otherwise, a person beyond a certain age will be entitled to a gratuity and that the dependants of those who die after giving long service will get a gratuity as well?  While this Bill was being drafted I believe there was a number of cases of such individuals dying and their dependants getting no gratuity.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should receive, through the All-Party Committee of the House which has been functioning for some years, representatives of that organisation so as to ensure that the defects in this Bill will be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  If amendments are put down in the name of a private Deputy they might be ruled out of order because they may impose a charge on the Exchequer.  The only person who has that prerogative is the Minister.  If the Minister would be prepared to <Col N="317" /> meet Deputies in the way I have suggested, with representatives of the organisation, this matter might be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The people who understand the grievances will be able to put them before the Minister.  That is a democratic procedure and it would ensure that there would be no bitterness afterwards and that provision would be made for those who may possibly be left out under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as it goes, I welcome the first part of the Bill.  As the last speaker pointed out, some of us for many years have been endeavouring to get something like this over the Department of Finance.  If I have to express any regret about the first part of this Bill, it is that I got undertakings both from the Minister and his predecessor that when a Bill of this kind was being introduced the Circuit Court officers, who are nobody's children, would be covered.  I see no reference to them in this Bill, and I regret that the Minister did not include them. Like the last speaker, I am not quite sure and I do not know whether it is clear to the House who are the people who will be covered by this Bill.  There is a completely woolly expression in Section 3, about a District Court clerk being employed during the whole of his time as a District Court clerk.  I should like the Minister to give some of his time explaining what that means.  Does it means that a clerk has to get his wife and family into the office and live there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to deal with this Bill from a common sense point of view and not from the point of view of the Department of Finance.  Due to the complex legislation which this House has been passing, the functions of a District Court clerk have become more complicated and involved year after year.  A District Court clerk's job to-day is a different proposition from what it was 15 or 20 years ago. They have even to draft summonses for Civic Guards.  They have to draft charges and they have to be on tap all the time in their office.  Where a District Court clerk's job 20 years ago was a sinecure, it is now a different proposition.  He must of necessity be <Col N="318" /> a hard-working man.  I fail to appreciate what is meant by this expression &ldquo;the whole of his time&rdquo;.  The House should insist on some explanation of what is meant by this wide and woolly expression.  Is he supposed to work eight hours or 18 hours or 24 hours a day?  What functions is he supposed to perform?  Who are the people to decide whether a District Court clerk devoted the whole of his time to his job?  I want the Minister or the Department to decide it.  I certainly do not want it left to the tender mercy of the Department of Finance because I have a shrewd idea as to how these people would decide this question.</P>
    <P>The section puts Deputies in this position, that we do not really know what is going to be covered by Section 3.  Before the Bill comes to the Committee Stage I hope the Minister will be able to elaborate what is meant by a man devoting the whole of his time to the performance of his functions as a District Court clerk.</P>
    <P>Up to Section 6, if we knew who was to be covered by the Bill, I do not think the House will have many quarrels with the Minister.  But when it comes to Section 6, which makes special provision for one individual, I think the House will quarrel with it. I do not mind whether the individual is a golfing pal of the Taoiseach or not, but his handicap is being raised to 72 under this Bill which is called the &ldquo;Court Officer's Bill, 1950&rdquo;, and I take exception to that.  Why should this special provision be made in this Bill for Mr. O'Connor?  What about the other officers of the same type throughout the country?  Why should the House be asked to shove in this particular provision here for this particular sheriff, increasing his handicap to 72?  I do not think any case can be made for it.  Notwithstanding the rather technical explanation offered by the Minister, I still maintain that what the Minister proposes to do under this particular section is to pick out a particular individual for special treatment. That is what the House is being invited to do by the Minister.  Why should there be a special section for the sheriff in Dublin while the other sheriffs throughout the country are put in an <Col N="319" /> entirely different category?  If there is some argument to be advanced for this provision, then let the Minister make it.  If there are special reasons why the Minister should make a special case for Mr. O'Connor, let the Minister give those reasons and make that case. All he has done up to this is to shove him in under this particular section without advancing any arguments other than those he advanced to-night.</P>
    <P>None of his arguments has convinced me, and I am sure they have not convinced the House.  This is a deliberate attempt to mete out special treatment to the sheriff in Dublin and to carve out a specially comfortable niche for this particular officer.  There is no logical or sensible reason why that should be done.  I think the House should reject Section 6 in so far as it applies to an extension of the age limit for a golfing pal of the Taoiseach's.  I propose to put down an amendment on the Committee Stage to ensure that this section will be rejected.</P>
    <P>This particular provision is unique in legislation.  I see no reason why one particular individual should be covered. There are many individuals that I want covered.  I want the District Court clerks, whose position is still doubtful under Section 3, covered.  I want certain categories of certain court clerks to be covered.  I have been agitating to have some provision made for them for years past.  I will oppose this Section 6 in so far as it applies to the Sheriff of Dublin when the Bill comes to the Committee Stage.  Evidently, the Minister is anxious to put the Sheriff of Dublin out of his worries.  I would appeal to him to put the coalition supporters in Mayo out of their worries and give us a county registrar in Mayo, if the Minister is capable of making up his mind as between the opposing factions down there.  That will lead to peace in Mayo and, possibly, to better administration too.  If the Minister can make up his mind so definitely about the Taoiseach's golfing pal, surely he can make up his mind about the county registrar in Mayo.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Moran is to be congratulated on the very careful examination he has made of this Bill, though his concluding remarks detracted somewhat from the benefits his contribution might have had in regard to this discussion.  Be that as it may, I think we can give a qualified approval to the Bill as it stands and an unqualified approval to the action of the Minister in introducing this much-wanted measure. Judging by the remarks made by Deputy Moran, this Bill is very badly needed.  The defect in the Bill is that it does not state fully and explicitly all those whom it is proposed to cover under its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider broadening the basis of the Bill to include a very deserving class of functionaries who seem to have escaped his notice.  The Bill proposes to establish certain officers of the District Courts and it proposes, by granting certificates of qualification to these officers, to enable them to qualify for pension.  There is, however, a class of functionary which did good service to this country in the past and I think it is a shame that they have been omitted from the scope of this particular measure.  I refer to the clerks of the courts of the First Dáil and to the registrars of those courts.  It should be possible to bring these in either under the present Section 3 or under a new section in the same way as the Courts of Justice Acts from 1926 to 1945 dealt with the British clerks of petty sessions. I think the officers of the courts under the First Dáil are deserving of recognition under a Bill such as this in which there are miscellaneous provisions covering certain types of persons, notably Section 6.  Section 3 applies to those persons who at the passing of the Act are employed whole-time. I think we can agree generally with Deputy Moran's scathing indictment of that form of expression, particularly in a measure emanating from the Department of Justice which has <Col N="321" /> available to it not only the benefit and advice of the legal luminaries but also the full co-operation of the drafting office and a number of precedents in other Departments.  For instance, there is a distinction drawn here between a whole-time District Court clerk and a part-time District Court clerk.</P>
    <P>The part-time District Court clerk can accede to the position of whole-time District Court clerk and in doing so he becomes qualified if he has so acceded after the passing of this Act.  As an analogy to put before the Minister, to make constructive criticism, there are part-time teachers and whole-time teachers, particularly in the vocational education service, and it is laid down in the Department's regulations which is which.  It is measured as it should be measured in a term of years.  I think the Minister might consider incorporating some such expression either in the Bill or in the regulations made by him to the effect that the whole-time clerk is one who gives at least 800 hours per annum or 1,000 hours per annum to his duties.</P>

      <P>As long as we have that undertaking from the Minister that this is a device by which we can overcome the frustrating tactics of the Department of Finance, we will all withdraw the objection.  We will conspire with the Minister if it is intended that such is the purpose of this Section 3 and sub-section (a).  It has, of course, its dangers.  If this thing is to be done properly by the Minister, then there may be some substance in taking us into his confidence as he has done.  Of course, there are other Ministers for Justice to come and if he unduly delays the implementation of this measure how can we rely on the good wishes of any succeeding Ministers for Justice?  We might have the utmost confidence in the present occupant of that office but we do not know who might succeed him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Apart from that, I would like to emphasise that it could be granted by the Minister that there is a case to be made for these clerks of the First Dáil and I strongly urge him to give his favourable consideration to incorporating them or having some measure to deal with the cases of the not very many who remain of that category.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say in regard to Section 6 that I am in accord with the line of Deputy Moran while of course, I do not in any way approve of the personal bias of the words that he used in the matter.  I think he detracted from the value of his statement&mdash;completely so.  I object to this.  I know the gentleman who holds the office, as Deputy Moran gave his name.</P>

      <P>A most estimable gentleman he may be.  It is a most extraordinary development of legislation, as a layman it occurs to me, to have this incorporation of a one person position by legislative action.  It may be necessary, but I think the general principle of all or none should apply to cases like this.  It is a very weak argument put up by the Minister to say that we will not have any further cases of this kind troubling us for 25 years to come, but our successors may be troubled by it.  That is a very weak argument because what is good for the gentleman who holds the office at present&mdash;what argument may be adduced to extend his time of office by a couple of years&mdash;could surely with equal force apply to the other gentleman who may come under the view of this matter in 25 years' time.  As Deputy Boland said, in 1951 evidently, owing to the greater expectation of life, we can assume that a man at 72 years of age is much more active than a man some years ago was at the age of 65.  If you carry that line of argument to a proper conclusion, in 25 years from now, in 1976, a man at 72 years of age, will be just coming to maturity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the advance of medical science, we may make these judges, etc., properly inoculated with glandular treatment to have extreme longevity.  It <Col N="323" /> is a very bad legislative instrument that a paragraph or a part of any Act should come before the House dealing with one individual and one individual only.  It was also commented upon that the reason for it, according to the Minister, was due to an oversight&mdash;a complete oversight&mdash;in the drafting of a previous Act.  That is a serious matter indeed, with which members of this House should concern themselves, that owing to the lack of attention to their duty on the part of the officers who are employed for the purpose of drafting these Bills it becomes necessary, in a short Act of this sort, to draft a section and a couple of subsections&mdash;altogether about 28 lines&mdash; dealing with one particular man's case.  This individual legislation is one which this House should hold against.  Unless we have very much stronger reasons from the Minister in support of Section 6, I think we should record our disapproval of it.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to say on this measure, except that I am glad that steps are being taken to improve the position of certain court clerks in the country who heretofore had no chance of superannuation. Whether this difficulty about whole-time service can be got over I do not know.  It is very hard to draw the line sometimes.  Deputy Connolly has mentioned the officers who officiated under the First Dáil.  As far as I know, some of these were reappointed in 1922 as District Court clerks.</P>
      <P>The question is: will they get credit for the amount of service they rendered during the time they operated as officers under the First Dáil?  If they do, it will be just in keeping with what has been done for certain civil servants, for people who were brought into the Civil Service and who officiated under the First Dáil.  They were given recognition for the service they gave at that time, and, not merely that, but in some cases a number of years were added on to their service. It is only right that these officers&mdash; there cannot be many of them&mdash;should be given the same consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Section 6, the Minister should <Col N="324" /> realise now that there is great hostility to it.  I do not think it wise to drag in personalities, but it is the principle of the thing which should be attacked. It is a very undesirable principle to follow to pass legislation here for the sake of one individual, no matter who he is, and no matter whether he lives in Dublin, Cork or Kerry.</P>

      <P>He should be a great golfer if he can keep going when he has reached the age of 72.  In any case, apart altogether from the age limit mentioned here, the principle is wrong, and it is only in very exceptional circumstances, in cases of real hardship, that any exception should be made for the sake of any individual, no matter what part of the country his office may be in.  If the Sheriff for the <Col N="325" /> County Borough of Dublin is entitled to this consideration, should not every registrar be entitled to consideration of the same kind?  No registrar will be allowed to continue in office, so far as I know, up to the age of 72, and, of course, civil servants, teachers and dispensary doctors are all compelled to retire at the age of 65.  There is a great difference between 65 and 72 years.  I suggest to the Minister that he reconsider the section, because he can see that, not merely is there opposition from this side, but there is opposition from the other side, because it is a bad principle.  I hope that between now and the Committee Stage he will be able to settle the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that Deputies will occasionally say things which tend to bring the country into disrepute.  Every Deputy, in approaching the problems that confront us here, should be careful not to say anything that may reflect on the country.  I make these observations because of the concluding words used by Deputy Moran in his speech.  It is entirely wrong that, whenever any matter comes up for discussion here, there should be a suggestion that a thing is being done simply because a particular individual happens to be a friend of another.  It is a very thwarted mentality that can use the Parliament of the country for the purpose of aspersing the country.</P>
      <P>I want to say that I entirely adopt all the arguments so forcefully put before the House by Deputy M. O'Sullivan, and there is consequently no necessity for me to repeat those very able arguments.  I should like to mention, however, that we have in the City of Dublin a number of temporary District Court clerks, men who served in the Defence Forces during the emergency, men who have been doing excellent and efficient work for a number of years, whose appointment is, on the basis of six months at a time, and who have gone past the age at which they can obtain a certificate under the Bill and who may be in some danger of losing their employment in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan has said, the position of a private Deputy in regard <Col N="326" /> to this Bill is difficult.  We can request and urge the Minister to make provision for a particular class, but we cannot put down any amendment to make provision for that class, because it would be ruled out of order.  Consequently, all I can do now is to urge on the Minister that some provision ought to be made for these individuals who, I know, and who every other Deputy who has experience of the working of the Dublin District Courts knows, are doing invaluable work, so that they will not, perhaps in the very near future, become unemployed.  I know some who have wives and large families and I should like to see some guarantee written into the Bill to give them security.</P>
    <P>There has been a long discussion on the age limit.  At some stage, we should face up to this question of the age limit in regard to officials.  I hear declarations that when a person reaches 65 he is fit for no further work. That is absured.  The heaviest work that could fall to an individual has fallen on one individual in this city in the last year and he is much older than 65.  A couple of nights ago, I read of a man who was despondent at the age of 62, who felt that his life had been a failure.  He was an ordinary priest living in an oratory in Birmingham. That man lived for another 25 years and became a distinguished cardinal of the Church.  We need not decide the point here now, but I do not think it is right that we should say that a person on reaching 65 should be compelled to retire from an office or occupation in which he may be rendering the most valuable national service. There are too many instances around us of people who have passed the 70 mark and who are still rendering excellent national service.  It is not a good thing that the nation should be deprived of their invaluable experience and ability.</P>
    <P>As far as the particular county sheriff is concerned here, I have known him for many years in his official capacity.  He is a most humane individual, who carries out certain distasteful duties with a sense of humanity and justice.  As far as he can, he <Col N="327" /> eases the burden of the unfortunate people whom he, because of his office, may have to evict from their homes. He goes out of his way to try to meet any reasonable request.  I would like to see an individual with that humane approach to human problems in office every year if he were to live to be 100, rather than have, perhaps, some younger man who would carry out the duties in accordance with the letter of the law, no matter how harshly it may react on individuals.</P>
    <P>This is no precedent.  I can instance two cases myself in my own recollection in the last 25 years, in which Acts of Parliament were passed specially to keep able individuals in office after they had passed the age of 70.  In providing this, the Minister is creating no precedent.  The precedent is well established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a bad one, but let it be examined as a principle and let it not be said that a precedent is being created here&mdash;since that is not so.  Like other Deputies, I welcome the Bill.  Our powers of amendment will be exceptionally slight.  Nevertheless, I am glad to see that the Minister, within a reasonable time, has carried out the solemn promise he made to the House.</P>
      <P>To-day we have passed two other important Bills which were introduced by the Minister for Justice.  In the previous session, we dealt with important Bills introduced by him also.  I only wish that the other Ministers would show the same activity in bringing before the Dáil important Bills of this kind that have the intention and object of doing good to a considerable section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined at the start, this has been a most contentious and difficult measure to get introduced and to get to this stage.  It has been on the table of every Minister of Justice since this State was established, and I am the first one to hope to be able to bury the file.  In this Bill, we deliberately avoid stating what constitutes whole-time service, since if I <Col N="328" /> take any hours of service for a week I will exclude somebody.  I am trying to get a definition, without creating precedents, for this particular section.  I hope this will never arise again, since it is only a small section of the community who are occupying these services and when they are dealt with such a situation could never arise again. Every future appointment will be made under conditions laid down as to what will constitute whole-time service.  The future appointments will depend on the size of the area to which they will be allotted.  It is intended in the future&mdash; not under this Bill&mdash;to amalgamate areas, so that whole-time service can be established.  This Bill deals with a certain number for whom no provision can be found in the existing law to define part-time or whole-time service. Therefore, I am doing something that is unique for these 82 people.  Where the hours are too few we are doing certain things.  We are not going to push a man out at 72, at 82 or at 102 if he lives.  If he is able to go on he can go on until he drops, but if he is a wise man and feels he is getting a little delicate I hope that he will take his gratuity a few days before he passes off so as to get the benefit of it.  I cannot take in all of them, and it is not my heart that hinders me nor a decision of the Government, but precedents would be established and I do not think it would be wise to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my speech there was never a more elaborate or expansive feeling towards people than there is towards these old-timers.  They are people who started with the State and for that reason these unique provisions are being brought in.  I am doing that at the behest of every section in the House and I trust that this will be accepted.  When I was doing that I found other gaps that had to be filled and I decided to make use of this in order to fill them.  I have covered that in my speech on the Second Reading. I do not want to say the number that will qualify but it will be the highest possible number that can qualify.  It is deliberately drafted to make that possible without having to tie yourself down by statute because if you tie yourself down by statute you certainly <Col N="329" /> will not be able to go across that and there will be no way by which sympathetic action can be taken.</P>
    <P>It is a rather peculiar situation.  I could indeed in this Bill say that the age of sheriffs could be extended to 72 and not specifically mention this officer. There are four sheriffs as I have told you.  Prior to the recent appointments and this man who was appointed in 1945 they were appointed under the 1920 Act and the Lord Lieutenant could extend the date of their retirement to any age and to-day one sheriff is acting who is now 72 but because he was appointed under the Lord Lieutenant he can go on and without any hesitation he can be extended until he is 102.  One person was appointed under the law of this country which was passed by this House and was appointed only a few years ago.  One man who is 72 and is still in office can go on if the Lord Lieutenant, or rather the Minister for Justice who now takes his place, decides to extend him and another person who is appointed by the power of this House must go when he reaches 70.</P>

I do not name the person.  I think it is the best and straightest way to do it without beating about the bush at all. If the House decides that they will not do it I am perfectly satisfied, but I appeal to the House not to leave it possible for a man who was appointed by the Crown to stay on while a man appointed by this State has to go.  That I think is a reasonable way to put it. <Col N="331" /> Nobody will go beyond 72 in the future and I think it is reasonable that we should give this provision to this man. That is why I ask you not to tie yourself down by voting against it.  These are facts and I think that on consideration you will accept this proposal.</P>

Is there a single man in the world who would say that one should be let stay on and the other should get the push?</P>
      <P>I feel that the question of District Court clerks is covered.  If the clerks in Dublin district to whom Deputy Cowan referred are still there they come under this&mdash;I believe there were only four and I do not know if they are all there now.  They occupy a different position to that of District Court clerks operating in towns like, say, Banagher or in rural areas where the District Court area is very small and where in some cases there is hardly eight hours a week and in others eight hours a month.  It is very hard in such circumstances to constitute full-time service.  If I started to lay down hard and fast rules there would be a huge number of exclusions and I want to bring in the largest possible number.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where an order is made under sub-section (1) of this section transferring functions to a county secretary, the order shall provide that the title of the office thereafter to be held by such county secretary shall be ................County Secretary (with the name of the county prefixed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 8, the law is going to be that there must be a county officer and that he must be called a county <Col N="334" /> officer.  Nevertheless, under this section, Section 15, he is going to be called a county secretary.  Which of the two is he going to be called?  This is not an honest Bill.  It is completely contradictory, in these two sections, at any rate.  If the Minister's intention under this Bill is what it was alleged to be by his legal adviser, Deputy Sweetman, then why continue paying two officials to do one man's work and put a burden of some £50,000 on the ratepayers of County Cork?</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am very sorry that Deputy Cowan has left, or that some representative of Deputy Cowan's Party is not here now because the particular Minister whom Deputy Cowan sent into this House, the Minister for Health, Dr. Browne, spent six months in communication with Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly, the President of University College, Cork, under the impression that he was the hospital authority for South Cork.  I have here a copy of the interview that we had with the Minister in which he made that statement, lest my word be doubted.  It is rather extraordinary, if this hatred of county managers is so fully in the minds of the Government of to-day, that elected representatives were not chosen in connection with the national mass radiography scheme.  They put seven county managers as seven directors in charge of it and not one elected representative of the people was chosen.</P>

I want that information for the benefit of the ordinary representative down the country.  Is it Section 8 or Section 15 that is to be the law?  That is one thing I would like to know from him. Secondly, I would like to know from him, if it is his intention to operate Section 15, can he give any justification for the continuance in office of county officers, can he tell us what the duties of those county officers are to be, can he give us any instance in which the county secretary is not fully employed at present, and can he tell us by what means he intends that the county secretary shall be able to do the whole-time work, the functions that he is now assigning to the county officer, along with his present work? If he can explain that to me, we might get this section through a little quicker.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister deals with that point I would like to say that I very seldom find myself in agreement with Deputy Corry, but that it does seem, as Deputy Corry has mentioned about 20 times within the last few minutes, that there is a drafting error in the Bill, in that Section 8 does seem to specify in very definite terms that each county shall have a county officer and that Section 15 which we are now discussing makes provision for the county officer fading out, so to speak, and the duties being performed by a person who will be called the county secretary.  Unlike Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Corry, I do not think there is any evidence that there was anything sinister in the mind of the Minister or of the parliamentary draftsman in relation to that.</P>

In any event, if there is any necessity to correct a flaw in the wording of this Bill, I suggest that it must be done on another stage, because the amendment is necessary to Section 8 and not to Section 15.  I think Deputy Corry is correct in calling the Minister's attention to that particular matter and I would be glad if the Minister would indicate that it will be rectified.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said, at column 127, Volume 123, Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If this Bill did nothing else than to change the title from &lsquo;county manager&rsquo; to &lsquo;county officer,&rsquo; it would be a good thing and would have a good effect on the people.  I do not think it is right to represent any man, as the county manager has been represented, as the actual manager of a county council, urban district council, corporation or town commissioners.  The name has a ring of dictatorship about it, whether there is dictatorship or not and in many cases the manager was regarded as a virtual Pooh-Bah in his own county.  I hold no brief against any man.  I have met the majority of managers and found them all reasonable men but, unfortunately&mdash; this is my personal opinion&mdash;because they were given the title &lsquo;county manager&rsquo; they were boosted to such an extent that nothing could happen in the county, town or village without the manager being consulted.  It was bad from that point of view because it gave those officers an air of responsibility which it was never intended to give them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An air of responsibility.&rdquo;  The public consulted them because they happened to be called county managers.  They will now be be called county officers, and we take it that it is the Minister's desire and the Parliamentary Secretary's desire that they should not be consulted and that they should not be considered responsible people in their own county by the people who live in the county.  Is that what this section is meant to do?  I just want to put that to the Minister.  I thought the Minister made the statement.  I now find that it was the Parliamentary Secretary. I think it bears out what I said originally on the Bill and what I reiterated last evening&mdash;that the object of this was to belittle and to lower the <Col N="338" /> status of the principal administrative officer in each of the counties.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we are not concerned very much whether you call him a manager, an administrator or a county officer, but if the concern of the Minister and his colleagues beyond is to belittle the status of an important officer in the local services, I think that is bad.  It must be bad generally, bad for the whole community.  The principal officers of the State service are respected in the community in every way, and if they live up to that and act accordingly there should be full respect for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 15, this is an objectionable section, every way you take it.  I want to ask the Minister, definitely and deliberately, what is the final object in making every chief officer of the county a county secretary?</P>
    <P>You first make them county officers and some of these persons may remain in office for quite a long period.  In some counties you may have a county office for the next 30 years.  You cannot prevent it happening unless you alter the law.  You may have in neighbouring counties the chief officers as county secretaries.  Is that a desirable thing in local government as a long-term policy?  I say it is not. For one thing, it must lead to confusion: Let them all become county secretaries or have them all county officers; let them be known under the one name.  They will have the same status and they will be performing the same functions.  Otherwise, this procedure that is proposed will lead to all types of confusion&mdash;there is no doubt about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. On this side we are satisfied to leave them as they are.  If the majority of the House want to make a change, do not make one that will lead to confusion, as you are doing in Section 15. Have all these officers known under the one name right through the State. In Section 14 the proposal is to appoint assistant county officers. Even when the principal officer <Col N="339" /> becomes county secretary you can still have assistant county officers in the same county.  There is nothing in Section 14 that will make an assistant county officer an assistant county secretary.</P>
      <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this matter. There should be some uniformity in the local government service, and you should have each officer of a particular status known by the one name.  There is nothing unreasonable in that.  Why we should be setting out to make for confusion, I cannot understand.  I am surprised we have not heard Deputy Cowan referring to sub-sections (8) and (9) of this section.  I am surprised he has not made the welkin ring about that.  The Minister is taking power to alter the law, either the existing law or the law when this Bill becomes an Act; he is taking power to alter it by Order.</P>
      <P>I do not think there was ever a provision in any legislation that went through this House that is so far-reaching as the proposal set out in either sub-section (8) or sub-section (9).  The Minister can modify any provision under this or any other Act.  It may be good law, but we definitely object to the Minister's proposal to have two types of officers.  You may have a county secretary in one county and a county officer in another.  I do not think it is desirable that the chief officer should, in addition, be the secretary of a council.  I cannot see any advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The secretary of the county council is responsible for all the payments, for the thousands of payments&mdash;and there might be almost a million payments&mdash; in the year.  To perform that function alone would take a considerable amount of his time, if he performs it as he should.  He has to take full responsibility. When this Bill is passed he will have as many functions to perform as the county manager has at the present time; actually he will have more functions to perform than the county manager.  In addition to that we are going to make him county secretary.  He will be responsible to the auditor for every payment made. <Col N="340" /> There are many other important functions that will be handed over.</P>
    <P>Already provision is made under which the Minister will appoint assistant county officers.  According to this Bill, you can have an assistant county officer in every county if the Minister so desires.  He does not need to consult anyone.  He can create one or more assistant county officers in any county.  Why should we have all this confusion?  Let us have one set of officers, managers, administrators, county officers or county secretaries, but call them by the one name, whatever name it may be.  Call them anything you like, any name that this House thinks desirable.</P>
    <P>We know the functions they will have and I say that under this Bill they will have to perform more functions than they have at the present time.  They will have the executive committees and whole-time county councillors.  Maybe some people would like that.</P>

It is very important in the discussion of this section to have some idea of what is in the Minister's mind as a result of the changes contemplated. We could proceed to discuss the section more satisfactorily if the Minister will answer that question in regard to the non-grouped counties.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised at Deputy Allen's objection to the section. He must be aware that the secretary of the council of which he is a member has acted on several occasions as county manager.  The Deputy says a lot of work will be thrown on the county secretary.  He must also be aware that the county manager of that county has appointed three staff officers and on several occasions when meetings were held and the manager was away sick, the secretary acted for him.</P>
      <P>To my mind, we have too many officers in all the counties.  I think the Minister has not gone far enough.  We do not agree to the present position where we have county managers.  We never stood for it as a Labour Party. The people who are objecting now to the change of name are the very people, under the ex-Minister who is now sitting on their Front Bench, to put in a county manager in my county in 1942.  Deputy Allen knows that as well as I do.  They put in a dictator who told us what to do and that we should do this or should do that.  On the Fianna Fáil Benches there are people talking and they are not sincere in what they say.  If they were sincere we would never have county managers to take away the rights of the people. I would not call him a county manager. I would call him a public servant paid for by the ratepayers.  Deputy Allen thinks that it is offensive to change his name from manager to that of county officer.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The purpose of this section is to enable the offices of county officer and county secretary to be amalgamated under the latter title according as vacancies arise.  In the case of existing managers and county secretaries amalgamation will not take place without their consent.  The local authority will be consulted in each case before amalgamation takes place.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to repeat that once more for Deputy Corry.  There is no question of creating additional offices nor do we propose to wipe out, without the consent of the elected representatives of the people, any of the existing offices. The representatives of the ratepayers will say if it is possible for them to carry on the work by amalgamating two posts into one.  Nothing will be done without the consent, agreement and consultation of these representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have introduced a Bill here, which is now the property of the House, and which has been accepted in principle unanimously by the House.  To my mind, every member of the House has equal responsibility in making this an effective instrument for the carrying on of local government in the country.  Local government is one <Col N="343" /> of the most important, if not the most important, function that can be entrusted to elected representatives. Many members of this House are also members of county councils and of urban authorities.  I am sure it is their desire that the best possible instrument should be forged in this House to carry out the functions of local government.  It has been decided to alter the management system, as we know it, but in doing that we want to alter the system with the least possible dislocation and to ensure the maximum of efficiency.  It was felt that the elected representatives did not have sufficient power under the existing system, that too much power was vested in the managers and the House has now decided, by giving a Second Reading to this Bill, to alter that system.</P>
      <P>This Section 15 is a very important section because in that section and in the Bill generally, we aim at having the chief officer administering the affairs of the county, instead of being called a manager, eventually called the county secretary as he used to be known in the old homely days when county councils were first set up.  The secretary was then the chief officer and there was no manager.  We are aiming to restore that system.  There is, however, a transition period in which we have to utilise the services of officials called county officers.  We do not want to inflict any hardship on the existing managers.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that accusations should have been made&mdash;Deputy Allen has graciously withdrawn them but Deputy Childers had previously made these accusations&mdash;that this Bill was directed against county managers and was intended to victimise them.  I have repeatedly stated that I have nothing but respect for county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I opposed the County Management Bill in principle I have never reflected on the managerial personnel. I spoke in opposition to the County Management Bill, when it was passing through this House but, as I said repeatedly, I have had nothing to <Col N="344" /> say against the personnel of the managers.  I worked with a manager in my own City of Limerick since 1934.  I was mayor of that city for a couple of years and I have never used anything but the highest terms of praise for the managers.  I regret very much that anybody should try to mislead the public into the belief that this Bill is directed against managers as such.  It certainly is not.</P>
    <P>Deputies' memories are not so short that they cannot remember that on this measure on Second Reading I stated, as reported in Volume 123, No 1. pages 67-68:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have every confidence, therefore, that the public representatives will welcome their new responsibilities under the Bill and that they will carry out their public duties with conscientiousness and zeal.  The managers are men of experience and ability.  It is not their fault if they are given an unpopular status as a non-representative part of the corporate entity of the local body. Under this Bill, they will be integrated into the local service as officials employed and controlled by the elected bodies.  I have every reason to believe they will welcome their new positions and that they will give good service to their local authorities. So I am sure, will all the local staffs whose establishment, mode of recruitment and conditions of service have been improved so materially in the last 25 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, as reported in Volume 123, No. 4, on 9th November, columns 653-4, I stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I participated in local government before the Management Act was passed, and neither in this House nor outside of it have I ever made a personal attack upon any manager.  I have never said a word against the individuals who took office as managers under the system, but I did object to the principle of that Act.  I think that these gentlemen have given very good service and are capable of giving very good service under the new conditions. But, because I have introduced a Bill which is not in accordance with <Col N="345" /> the expectations of the Opposition, it is denounced as being a deceitful and fraudulent Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the statements which I made in connection with the gentlemen who are county managers.  Last night Deputy Allen referred to the fact that these men had given very patriotic service in times of emergency when called upon to accept big responsibilities. I endorse that heartily, but I think it is a back-handed compliment to these gentlemen to put a condition on their loyalty by the insinuation that they would not render such service if they were not managers.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly confident that they will give equally loyal service as county secretaries or county officers or whatever their title may be.  I am perfectly certain that they will discharge their duties faithfully.  That is one point that I should like to stress particularly, that neither the Dáil nor the Minister has anything against the managerial personnel.  This is just an attempt to alter the system and we have already accepted the principle on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There were a few points raised in the discussion to which I should like to reply.  Deputy Childers asked about the non-grouped counties and as to whether the county secretary can do both jobs together.  That will be the subject of consultation between the Minister and the councils.  I am thankful to Deputy MacEntee for having corrected an error of which both Deputy Corry and Deputy O'Higgins were guilty, in regard to Section 15 and Section 8.  This matter is covered in sub-section (10) of Section 15 which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The provisions made by or under this section shall have effect notwithstanding any other provision of this or any other Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might also refer to the fact, in connection with the amendments proposed by Deputy Ó Briain on Section 2, that we propose to alter the title of county officer so as to give a suitable Irish title as we will also give to the assistant county officer and to the county secretary on amalgamation under Section 15.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> That was read for the House this evening and accepted.  I am bringing in an amendment to give an Irish title to the assistant county officer and the county officer and to the county secretary appointed to replace the county officer.  There will be no other title except that.  It will be a title given to him by statute and so he can only be known by that particular title.  In this section power is being given to enable county councils to decide for themselves, if they feel that the volume of work is too great to be entrusted to one man, to retain the services of another.  There is nobody going to compel them to do that, but they will be perfectly free to do so if they wish. They can, if they desire, revert to the position which obtained prior to the managerial system and carry on the duties with one chief officer, the county secretary.  I believe you will have more effective work done by having one chief officer.</P>
    <P>It is not unknown in this country at the present time that, where you have a county secretary and a county manager, there is not that harmonious working that ought to obtain.  It is not unknown that a certain amount of friction has crept in where you have the two.  We are aiming to have one chief officer, and we hope that eventually his title will be the homely old one of county secretary.  If the chief officer fades out, the Minister, in consultation with the county council, can promote the assistant or the county secretary as the case may be, to fill that office.  It was suggested in an earlier amendment that that ought to be done automatically.  In my opinion, it ought to be done in consultation.  If he is an old officer he may not like to take on the post.  If the county secretary is not a candidate for the job, then the Local Appointments Commissioners will fill it.  Deputy MacEntee suggested that this was side stepping or walking around the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Of course, if I were doing that I had got a fairly good headline from the Deputy himself in Section 36 of the Local Government Act of 1946.  Under that section, Deputy MacEntee provided for by-passing the Local Appointments <Col N="347" /> Commissioners by the amalgamation of offices.  We are not doing anything unheard of in this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee professed to be in difficulties about the section.  I do not think he was in any difficulty at all. By talking a lot the Deputy tried to create an imaginary web or tangle and suggested that there was some very great difficulty about the section.  To my mind, there is nothing difficult about it.  It clearly expresses what it is intended to do.  Instead of proceeding ruthlessly in the making of appointments we are proceeding by easy stages so that there will be no hardship inflicted on anybody.  We are treating the existing officers in a proper way.  The transition from the managerial system to a democratic system will be carried out without dislocating the business of the councils or imposing a hardship on anybody, or by placing further burdens on the rates.  Deputy Corry seemed to be worried about this latter point.</P>
    <P>There is no question of additional officers being appointed.  The reverse, in fact, will be the case.  We are leaving it to the elected representatives to say whether they will or will not give effect to the merging of two posts into one. There is no dictation in the Bill, but rather an honest, genuine effort to restore to the elected representatives a full measure of liberty in the running of the affairs of their councils.  I would say to Deputy Allen that, naturally, a good deal of work will be thrown on the councils.  In that connection, we are taking from the county manager the executive functions which he exercises at present.  I have already read for the House a list of the items that we are taking from him and transferring to the elected representatives.  What I have said in that regard cannot be challenged. The councils will have their scheduled and executive functions.  The executive functions, which were in the hands of the county manager, are being taken from him and given to the local authorities.  Two executive committees are being set up to carry out those executive functions.  In view of that, I have not the least fear but that the business of the councils will be carried out speedily and efficiently and in a <Col N="348" /> democratic manner that will be satisfactory to all persons concerned.  I can say that, having given the matter very serious consideration.  I have had fairly good experience myself of public administration, and I am perfectly satisfied that the councils will be well able to do the work which will fall to them under this Bill.  If any council feels that the work is growing too big for it, then it can appoint an assistant, but there will be only one chief officer and, that being so, there can be no rivalry.  There will be one chief, and the county council will be his employer.  There was a good deal of talk about democracy during this debate but there, in my opinion, so far as public administration is concerned, you are going to have democracy translated into action and efficiency.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is a very important one, and I think all the discussion that has taken place on it has been well worth while.  I have made it clear to the members of the Dáil what we are doing under it.  We are not inflicting burdens on anybody.  Rather, we are making it possible to have economies effected under this section.  The local representatives will have power vested in them to adjust their staffs and to effect economy by the merging of staff&mdash;of two into one, or, if they wish, they can appoint an assistant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the local authorities will have power to merge two into one.  The fact is that they have two, and you cannot merge two in one while two are there.  One must go first before you can do that.  If the Minister is correct in the opinion that he has given of this section that one man can do the work of two, I hold that the county councils should have the power at any time, after the passing of this Bill to remove the county manager and have one man, admits that, in his opinion, one man can do the work of the two.  Why then compel the ratepayers to pay two? Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 all set out the manner in which a county officer is to be appointed.  There is insistence in all these sections of the Bill that each county is to have a <Col N="349" /> county officer.  Then someone had another brainwave, and Section 15 was brought in to wipe out all those earlier sections.  The Bill is a complete contradiction in itself, and Section 15 is a complete contradiction of all the sections from 8 to 14.  These are things which I asked the Minister to clear up and he has not cleared them up.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister if the Cork County Council, for instance, decide, when this Bill becomes law, that the county secretary should do the work of the county officer and the county secretary, are they entitled then to remove the county officer at once or must they continue paying the county officer until one of the two goes, either the county secretary or the county officer?  Ten minutes ago we were talking about an age of 72½ for some person under the last Bill. If we have to pay the county secretary and the county manager until they are both 72½, as apparently the legal profession is prepared to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It will lead to such a condition of affairs as I alluded to here a moment ago, that a Minister did not know who was the housing authority for an area.  He thought the President of University College was the housing authority and held up the regional hospital for six months on that account.  That is a fact.  He even stated in the presence of the county manager that the county manager attended a conference with the President of University College and the county manager had to contradict him on the spot.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his last observation brought the whole of this section into the ambit, more or less, of political discussion about the whole purpose of the Bill and we will have to say something about it because a very big principle is involved.  The whole purpose of the Labour Party in more or less promoting this Bill was to give the impression to the country that the county managers were dictators <Col N="351" /> and were not in any way controlled by their councils and should be abolished. To my mind, that is a totally un-Irish conception.  There will always be leaders in this country and there always have been.  There is something nauseating about the idea of having a chief officer in genuine control of a local authority and trying to disparage that condition.  In the light of Irish history it is ludicrous.</P>
      <P>They have disparaged leadership in administration.  I do not mind if the county manager is called county manager or county officer.  All I know is that we have always believed that if county administration is to be carried on efficiently there must be at least two chief officers in each local authority, even the smallest of them if possible.  One should be a person who is called the county secretary and who is in charge of what I might describe as the slow-moving work. The other carries out the day-to-day work, gathers the whole dynamic part of the administration into his hands, and is responsible to the county council for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill one of two things might happen.  Either the county councillors will continue, as they should, doing their work as a part-time occupation, giving a certain amount of time throughout the year in assisting to carry out the work which they are delegated to do by Act of the Dáil; in other words, planning the Budget for the year, voting moneys, laying down general plans for local authorities to carry out, and so forth. If they do not become professional local politicians, in our view there will always be a necessity for a county secretary and for some kind of chief executive officer, not a person who is called an assistant officer, but two people with important functions, one the chief executive officer and the other the county secretary, who will do, as I said, the slow-moving part of the work.  If the worst happens, and in certain areas, perhaps encouraged by the Labour Party, we get county councillors meeting day after day to do the day-to-day work of administration, forming executive committees <Col N="352" /> and sub-committees, health committees, advisory sub-committees, going every day to the office and doing the work of civil servants instead of only doing the work of electors, then I still think it would be necessary to have a chief executive officer as well as a county secretary in order to bring to all those committees the documentation they will require and in order, so to speak, to do the work of the council twice over, once for the committees and once in the offices among the officials of the local authority.  Whichever course is taken, I think it will still be necessary to have one chief executive officer and under him a county secretary.  For that reason, I am opposed to the idea of belittling the position of either of these officials in Section 15 by advancing towards a state where there will be a county secretary and, if necessary, in the non-group counties an assistant county secretary.</P>
    <P>So far as the Labour Party is concerned, I feel that this entire discussion is associated with a considerable amount of hypocrisy.  Local authorities have nothing like the powers that members of this House have.  The statement made by the Minister that he was &ldquo;handing back&rdquo; local government to the county councils, it having been hitherto in the hands of the manager, is a gross misstatement of fact.  I know the Minister means it quite sincerely and I will take this opportunity of saying that I withdraw any suggestion I made that he ever demeaned county managers; certainly, other members of his Party did.  The actual fact is that 99.9 per cent.  of all the moneys spent by the county councils is controlled by the Minister for Local Government on behalf of this House.  Hardly a penny can be spent on anything in which there is not some central Government control either because the Government extends a grant towards the expenditure or because the whole of the panoply of appointments, staff conditions, wages and the hierarchic formation of officials and so forth is carried out by means of Acts of this House.  The cheap jack expressions used by the Labour Party as though these local authorities were little republics which under this Bill <Col N="353" /> will be given back suddenly those powers that it is alleged were taken from them by the Fianna Fáil Government are to my mind absolutely ludicrous.  I have always understood that, however much we might disagree with members of Fine Gael, for some reason or other they at least shared our opinion in regard to that matter. One can talk a lot of clap-trap about democracy in local government.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have very definite and very important duties.  They were very limited by Acts of Parliament and we were trying in our time to devise a system under which county councils would be able to do a really good job of work without having their time taken up unnecessarily in purely administrative matters, staff matters, employment matters and the tenancy of houses.  We said at that time that the appointment of county managers and county secretaries, such as are described in Section 15, was experimental and we left it open to local bodies to appoint committees of all kinds, if they so wished; we sent out an interpretation in 1945 of what we thought local authorities could do in this matter and we indicated to them that they had very wide powers of consultation and general planning in regard to their relations with the county managers.</P>
    <P>We stand for the principle that if county councils are to do their work well and if they are not to become merely professional politicians, there should be, we believe, a need for a chief executive officer with a county secretary under him.  Because of that, we are opposed absolutely and completely to Section 15 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the advent of the Managerial Act, we have been told from time to time that it would have the result of reducing the rates. Recently at the rates estimates meeting of the Cork County Council, the chairman mentioned that from 1943, and he took 1943 as the basic year, the rates have risen steadily year by year. I believe that when the County Management Act went through in 1942 Deputy MacEntee was not entirely responsible for it.  One of the points he raised was that the Act would be <Col N="354" /> conducive towards reducing the rates in the various counties.  It looks now as if the Act has been conducive to a steady rise in the rates year by year. In every county the rates have climbed alarmingly.  Deputy Corry says in his wisdom that the rates are increasing as a result of this Government's administration.  Oddly enough he blames the Minister for Health for an increase in the rates in County Cork. May I remind Deputy Corry of a statement made by the first Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, who stated that he would give a certain amount in subsistence and that over and above that we would have to collect from the home assistance authorities.  Of course, I understand Deputy Corry; he snuffs one day and he sneezes the next.  It is no trouble to him.  Snuff is good antidote and nobody will object to Deputy Corry using it.  So far as I understand the County Management Act, the county manager was placed in an executive position.  Those who have experience of county council administration must admit that I am right in that.  The county manager was put in charge: I remember on one occasion the county engineer's estimate was put before the county manager, and the county manager in his wisdom cut that estimate.  He then presented it to the county council and the county council in their wisdom cut it still further.  The result is that the roads have been deteriorating for the past ten years.</P>

I believe that this Bill is in an experimental stage at the moment.  Candidly, this Bill has not gone far enough at all so far as I am concerned.  When Deputy MacEntee implemented this Act I believe he was honest about it and as one of the men who always, without fear, favour or affection opposed it, I saw good points in the Act from time to time.  I wonder if Deputy MacEntee realised that owing to his public body Orders he nullified the good effect of the Act and put it into the odium it is in at the moment in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a few words, particularly because of a reference that Deputy Childers made to certain workings of the local authority and to the policy of Fine Gael. Deputy Childers, first of all, I feel sure, although he was for some time in the Custom House, never must have been in a county council office to see that office work, because of the view he gave of the way a manager and his secretary work and he has no conception whatever of the manner in which the duties of a secretary are carried out.  The position is entirely different to what Deputy Childers would have us believe.  The effect of this section will mean the eventual amalgamation of the positions of county officer and county secretary.  Indeed it is almost necessary, in dealing with that, owing to the challenge of Deputy Childers, to impinge slightly on the Second Reading point of view.  I believe that that almagamation is necessary and desirable, because I believe that there should be an officer under a council and not an officer over a council, such as Deputy MacEntee sent out in 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe quite frankly that if we had started in 1942 in respect of the County Management Acts on the same foot as that on which Deputy MacEntee stood in 1946, when, after a certain row in County Kildare, he issued his circular of 7th February, 1946, the legislation would have had infinitely more chance of success.  The fact, however, was that the managers were sent out by Deputy MacEntee as Minister with an entirely different outlook from that which he and Deputy Childers now try to put over to the House as the policy and outlook of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They were sent out then to be the overriding representatives of the Custom House in the several areas.  Later, I confess, that attitude was changed, but it was because of that initial outlook given to these people that they had very considerable <Col N="357" /> difficulty in operating at all at the beginning.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I was very surprised by that attitude when I read the expression of view given by Deputy Lemass on this question of management in local affairs.  Going back a long way, to 1930, when Deputy Lemass was on that side of the House and when we were discussing a particular City Management Bill, Deputy Lemass indicated that he thought the principle was a bad one, but, apparently in the intervening period, the transfer over from this side not merely made him think the principle a good one but one which should be extended infinitely and it is to that extension I object and it is a position which I think this Bill will reverse.  If the Deputy would like me to give the reference, he will find these expressions of view in Volume 33, column 1012 of the Official Debates. He said there:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another remarkable result of the operation of the Cork City Management Act had been that practically no public interest whatever exists in the actions of the council.  The reason for that is that the basis of representation is too small.  That is only one reason.  The absence of powers they should have is another.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can read the Bill, the position is going to be quite clear.  I do not want to have anything to do as a member of a county council with the ordinary day to day administration of the affairs of that council, but I want to be quite sure that, when the members of that council direct a policy with regard to a particular action, that policy will be carried out, and that we will not have a position in which, as at present, that policy can be defied and the manager can say that the Act of 1940, as amended by the Act of 1943, gives the council no power to discuss or to direct.  I want to see a local authority directing on general principles and I want an officer under that authority carrying out these principles.  I want to see the county secretary carrying out the detailed administration of these principles in regard to general <Col N="358" /> purposes.  I want to see the county medical officer carrying them out directly from the council in regard to health and the engineer carrying them out directly from the council in regard to engineering services because I believe the worst feature of all in the County Management Act was that, by centralising everything in one person, we got useless paper administration and the useless building up of files, worse than obtains in any Government Department.  I believe quite seriously that that was not intended by Deputy MacEntee, but it was definitely the result of the system he introduced in 1942.</P>

That is the experience of many county councils.  If there were efficient county councillors in Deputy Sweetman's county, if Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Harris, Senator Smyth and the other members of the county council in Kildare knew their jobs, as Deputy O'Leary and other people in Wexford know their jobs, the Management Act would have operated in Kildare.</P>

      <P>I object to this proposal to set up two types of officials.  Under this, the principal officers in different counties will have different names.  In one he will be the secretary and in the neighbouring county he will be county officer.  That is wrong, and even after two or three hours' discussion, the Minister has not adverted to it or explained why it is necessary.  Let us have a uniform name.  The Minister should reconsider the matter, and on the Report Stage or on the recommittal of this Bill he should alter it.  It will not alter the principle of the Bill in regard to committees, but he is completely wrong on this point.  The county officers of the future will have so many and such varied functions that they will be incapable of performing the functions of secretary.  I honestly believe that, and I worked on a county council before 1942 with the secretary, and also under the Management Act, and I saw no difference whatever, except that instead of having to spend hours and hours on some finicky proposal at a council or a board of health meeting, we were able to transact the business efficiently in a quarter of the time.</P>

      <P>I heard the estimates discussed in detail and the council succeeded in passing the estimate they thought fit in every detail, as they <Col N="361" /> understood it and spent time on it.  It was the duty of the secretary or the manager to submit the estimate, and it was the council's duty to examine it in detail, if they knew how to do it, and to give for the maintenance of each particular service the money they thought necessary to maintain it properly. Deputy O'Leary knows that quite well.</P>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash;in the Minister's absence at the moment&mdash;will tell the House whether he is satisfied that having different names for the principal officer in different administrative areas will not create difficulties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening to the Minister replying to statements on this particular section.  While he believed there could be economy under it, he thought at the same time that the local authority could appoint an assistant if they were of opinion that the secretary could not discharge the duties fully.  I know officials and have a fair idea of chief executive officers and county officers over many years.  With the volume of business which has been added to local authorities in the past 20 years, the administration of which must be carried out generally by the county manager and his staff, there have been applications by the manager on various occasions for increased clerical staff.  The change form county manager to county officer, as far as economy is concerned, will not enter into it.  It will not be possible to have any economy.  There will be the same duties to be performed.  The duties being transferred back to the council are very insignificant.  In a county like ours, the county officer will have to deal all the time with the Ballinasloe Mental Hospital, the Galway City Corporation and such institutions and he will be very glad to avail of this opportunity to ask the council to appoint an assistant.  When it comes <Col N="362" /> to the time&mdash;I hope it will be a very long time&mdash;when he retires and the term is changed to county secretary, there will be no economy whatever. The county secretary will take over the job the county officer was doing.  Who is going to replace the county secretary and do his work?  Will he not come before the local authority and ask, not for one but for two additional clerical assistants?  Will that not add further to the cost?</P>
      <P>The whole principle of management has been discussed on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage. The City of Cork and the City of Dublin Management Acts have been brought into the question.  One Deputy went back to 1930 to quote what a member of the Opposition then and a member of the Opposition now said then.  There is no analogy between city management and county management. If the managerial system is not suitable to the city, I believe it was quite suitable to the county.  In the city the elected representatives had far greater facilities to attend meetings, even many times a week if necessary. That facility was not available in the rural areas.  Were it not for the fact that the county managerial system was introduced into the rural areas I believe that things would have become most chaotic during the past eight or nine years.  We had boards of health and all the rest of it and as a member of one I know very well that we went to the meetings but were never able to transact the business in any one day and the same would be true of the county councils at the present time.  If they were to get back what people are led to believe they are getting now the county councils or the executive committees would have a whole-time job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I am not doing that but I am sorry if I am. The principal thing which enters into this is the change of term, first of all from &ldquo;county manager&rdquo; to &ldquo;county officer,&rdquo; and secondly from &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; to &ldquo;county secretary.&rdquo;  I think <Col N="363" /> it is altogether wrong that that has not been justified in any of the statements made either by the Minister or by those who have favoured the Bill. We have been told about the &ldquo;dictatorial powers&rdquo; of county managers.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned that what was wrong with the County Management Act was that the county managers were given such freedom in the first years that they acted in a dictatorial fashion.  I do not find that from my experience in County Galway.  We were always consulted and if such a thing happened in other counties it was in my opinion because the councillors did not get in their county solicitor, their legal adviser, and find out what their powers really were.  Save in very insignificant matters the county officer is having the same powers as the county manager had and that fact has not been very emphatically denied.  No one has pointed out specifically what powers are being taken from the county manager and vested in the elected representatives.  The only thing is that they are going to have the executive committee and the health committee which are supposed to take the place of the county manager in certain respects, but still, in so far at least as I can read the Bill, he has the overriding authority while of course the supreme authority still rests with the Minister for Local Government in the Custom House.  Instead of making for progress and speed in the carrying out of the various schemes for which local authorities are responsible I believe that this Bill will have the opposite effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly resent the fact that there has been a change of name.  Give the Irish term if you like, but it does not add in any way to the dignity of the councils or the local representatives if you change the title from &ldquo;county manager&rdquo; to &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; or from &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; to &ldquo;county secretary&rdquo;. I think that the Minister should consider this very seriously before the Report Stage; if he did I believe that the existing term would still apply because it is a more dignified term.  The term means nothing so far as the duties and responsibilities of the elected representatives <Col N="364" /> are concerned; their duties are defined in the previous Act and so are their powers if they only knew how to avail of them.  They will have the very same powers and very little more except that they will be of a glamorous nature and be far more expensive under the present Bill.</P>

      <P>Many Opposition speakers on this amendment, including Deputy Childers, who spoke at length, denounced from time to time the Labour Party's statements as so much hypocrisy and claptrap and said that this Bill was an attempt to hoodwink the people, especially their own supporters; into believing that it contained no real change, but merely meant changing the name &ldquo;county manager&rdquo; to &ldquo;county officer&rdquo;.  At the risk of wearying the House, I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to read out a list of functions which county councillors will have when the Bill becomes law and which county managers have at the present time.

If he likes, every county councillor in the Fianna Fáil Party can come here for the next two weeks to describe in detail the functions of the county manager in regard to a great many of the things of which the Parliamentary Secretary has spoken&mdash;in particular, the maintenance of roads, the estimation of the amounts required for the roads, and the planning, location and designing of the schemes.

      <P>The Deputy's argument is absolutely beside the point.  My submission is that the functions are now functions of the county manager.  It is true, as Deputy Allen says, that many of these schemes are initiated by the county council but they have no legal authority to undertake them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a present of that to the Opposition.  Housing schemes, sewerage schemes and road works have been undertaken on the initiative of the county councils in many cases, but they never had legal authority or power to see these schemes through.  They were always at the mercy of the county manager who, if he wanted to, could use the dictatorial powers given to him under the County Managerial Act.</P>

I should like to refute the allegation made by Deputy Allen.  As I said in my Second Reading speech, I have no complaint against any individual county manager.</P>

      <P>But you misinterpreted me.  I stand over every single word of my Second Reading speech.  I want to refute any allegation that I ever attempted to insult any county manager or county managers as a whole. Deputy Childers would have us put the managers on a far superior plane to that which they are on at present.  He suggests that the Irish people want leaders and that, as far as local government is concerned, the managers should be the leaders of the people.  I do not think that he would get many Irishmen to subscribe to that view. On the contrary, the people of this country, at local elections, select men who, they believe, should run local affairs.  I suggest that that is what is being done under this particular Bill. The manager has employment functions and tenancy functions.  He has individual functions and, after that, the councillors have the rest of the functions.</P>

It might be inappropriate to quote at this stage but I should like to say again that I subscribe to the view held by Deputy MacEntee&mdash;and, on this occasion, he seems to be in absolute conflict with Deputy Childers.  We do not know at present whether it is Deputy Childers or Deputy MacEntee who is speaking for the Fianna Fáil Party. The big compliment that Deputy MacEntee paid the Bill was in connection with the setting up of these committees. He said that at least there was <Col N="369" /> a statutory obligation to set up two, and he would have us believe that it would be a good idea if more were set up.</P>

      <P>The subject matter of the debate is Question No. 54 on yesterday's Order Paper, which asked the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="370" /> to explain why no appeal was made for an increase in the acreage of sugar beet and wheat and the matter therefore concerns only sugar beet and wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter to-night, not for the purpose of giving the Minister any additional information, but simply for the purpose of obtaining information and securing from him a clear and definite statement as to what is now his policy in regard to beet and wheat.  I will not mention peat.  I think the Government bitterly regret that they followed the Minister's advice in regard to this commodity.  I want to get the Minister's present policy in regard to sugar beet and wheat.  The Minister has a perfect right, as Minister for Agriculture, to seek to give leadership to the agricultural community in regard to what they ought to produce and to advise as to what is best in the national interest.  Recognising that the farmer has a perfect right to select what crops he will grow and what type of stock he will maintain on his farm, there is the obligation on the Minister to advise the farming community as to what is best in the national interest.</P>
      <P>The Minister went to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 21st January last.  If I had the insulting type of mind that the Minister has long developed I would refer to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> as the Minister's &ldquo;kept&rdquo; paper. I do not believe in being offensive though I sometimes feel that it would be more true to describe the <i>Sunday Independent</i> as the Minister's keeper. I do not congratulate the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on the type of pet they seek to keep.  I think they would be wiser to invest in some other type of pet, such as a skunk.</P>

      <P>Such as a skunk, I said. The Minister spent a great deal of time savagely attacking what he described as &ldquo;a broken-down general.&rdquo; The man who thrashed &ldquo;the Nazi beast&rdquo; here on the floor of the House has nothing but redicule and contempt for an <Col N="371" /> Irishman who merely fought &ldquo;the Nazi beast&rdquo; on the battlefield.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The direct relevance of this to wheat and beet is not immediately discernible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to interrupt, the Minister will be answered.  The Minister went to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on the 21st January and in the course of that interview he outlined what in his opinion were the crops the acreage of which needed to be increased.  In outlining these particular crops, he was within his rights as Minister in advising the farmers as to what they should grow.  He mentioned 200,000 additional acres of feeding barley, 200,000 additional acres of oats and 50,000 additional acres of potatoes, but he made no reference whatever to the acreage of sugar beet and that he desired.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a straight question.  If the Minister wanted an increase in the acreage of sugar beet, why did he not state that he wanted it? Surely the occasion of an interview to a widely circulated paper was a very desirable opportunity for stating Government policy in regard to the growing of sugar beet and for giving the farming community some idea as to what were the requirements, in the public interest.  The Minister made no reference to beet beyond a casual statement that farmers could grow what sugar beet and wheat they require.</P>
      <P>Having described that we required so much oats, so much potatoes, so much barely, the Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Preparation for these crops must be undertaken now, in addition to such other crops as farmers may intend to sow, such as wheat, industrial barely, beet, and other root crops.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, as far as the Minister was concerned, it did not matter a damn how many acres of beet, wheat or malting barley farmers decided to grow. That would be all right if it did not matter but, within a week of that statement being made, the Irish Sugar Company met the Beet Growers' Association <Col N="372" /> and, in agreement, decided that the price to be paid for sugar beet should be increased and decided to launch a campaign to induce the farmers to grow, not the same acreage as last year, but 10,000 additional acres. There we have a State Company, a Government-sponsored company, undertaking a function which the Minister, if he had any sense of responsibility, should have undertaken himself and that State company has launched out on an advertising campaign in the Press to induce farmers to grow the additional 10,000 acres of beet.  In addition, of course, they have offered the inducement of an increased price, thereby showing that the country does need an additional acreage of beet.</P>
    <P>We had the sad experience of last year when we had to import the sweepings of Formosan sugar in order to supply our sugar needs.  I think the Irish Sugar Company were quite right in offering the farmer an increased price and in joining with the Beet Growers' Association in calling on farmers to increase the acreage so as to supply our needs.  I want an explanation as to why the Minister, as the responsible Minister, or as the Minister in charge of agriculture, failed to give a lead in this matter. Why did he leave it to a State-sponsored company to undertake that work?</P>
    <P>With regard to wheat, no statement whatever has been forthcoming from the Minister as to whether an increased acreage of wheat is required or desired in the national interest. There is an obligation on the Minister to tell us whether farmers should get out of wheat-growing altogether or should maintain the acreage they had last year or should increase it.  We imported last year something like 1,500,000 barrels of wheat from the United States, at a much higher price&mdash;I have not the figures at the moment&mdash;but a considerably higher price than we are paying to our Irish growers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the price is steadily increasing.  I am sure the <Col N="373" /> Minister will say that is not true also. The price of imported wheat is steadily going up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Apart from the price of wheat, the Minister knows that the cost of transporting wheat to this country has increased sharply over the past few weeks and that, of course, must affect the price.  I do not know whether the Minister thinks it is desirable to keep on spending dollars for the purpose of importing the additional quantity of wheat needed.  If that is the Minister's policy, then it requires a logical explanation.</P>
      <P>There were 362,000 acres of wheat grown last year, and that is a fairly substantial acreage.  I think the yield was something in the nature of seven barrels per acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advocating that the Minister should state clearly what is the Government's policy in regard to wheat.  Do they feel that the farmer should grow more wheat, or that he should get out of growing it?  I am asking also are the Government prepared to meet the wheat growers in the same way as the Irish Sugar Company are meeting the beet growers by giving an additional price?  If the Minister says he does not care whether the farmers grow any wheat or not, then that is a statement of policy and we have to accept it; but if he says he wants an increased acreage, then it is only right and proper that he should meet the farmers fairly in regard to price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wheat price was fixed in October, 1947, at £3 2s. 6d.  That price still operates, although the cost of production has increased enormously over the past three years.  Since 1947 the wages paid to agricultural workers have increased by over 10/- a week; <Col N="374" /> rates have increased by over 10/- in the £, and practically every requirement that the farmer must utilise in the production of wheat has increased in price.  Within the last week we have seen a very substantial increase in the price of artificial fertilisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advocating that the Minister should state clearly his policy on this question.  Does he require an additional acreage of wheat, and is he prepared to pay a reasonable price for it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want an explanation from the Minister on this matter.  He has stated his policy clearly and definitely in regard to feeding stuffs for live stock.  It is difficult to understand why the Minister should seek to make us self-sufficient in regard to feeding stuffs for animals when he refuses absolutely to make us reasonably secure in regard to food for human beings.</P>
      <P>There is no question of compulsion in this matter.  I have no desire to advocate compulsion.  I believe a reasonable inducement is all that is necessary&mdash;reasonable leadership and direction on the part of the Minister. I admit I am one of those who put the Minister into the position he occupies. I had hopes when he assumed office that he would adopt a responsible attitude in relation to agriculture, something along the lines he demonstrated when he was in Opposition.  I had hopes that the burden of office would make him responsible.  I hope that he will show some sense of responsibility to-night by approaching this matter in a fair and reasonable way, by giving a fair and reasonable indication of his attitude in regard to the growing of essential foodstuffs.  There is no use in increasing the acreage under barley, oats, wheat or other crops until you are certain you are going to get a reasonable price for your produce. There is no use in converting root crops and barley into eggs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is most unjust.  I <Col N="376" /> deprecate the description of Deputy MacEntee as &ldquo;a Nazi beast&rdquo;.  He is a mildly excitable man.  The quotation Deputy Cogan has made did contain, I frankly confess, one of the most appalling threats that it was possible for a public man to issue in this country.  It did say if the policy of the inter-Party Government, of trusting the farmers to do what is right on their own holdings, should fail, then the policy, the loathsome policy, of the Fianna Fáil Party would be vindicated and the appalling catastrophe of that Party being returned to power must be envisaged at an imminent date.</P>

Why cannot the Deputy get it out of his mind that our people are similar to the natives of the Gold Coast and of Sierra Leone?  Is it his frequenting the company of Pucka Sahibs that leads him to yearn for leadership and direction?  If the Deputy, by his vote, contributed to my election as Minister for Agriculture, I sincerely hope he was not induced to do that by the illusion that I was a Pucka Sahib.  That variety of fossil is more at home in Wicklow than in Mayo and the barnacles that adhere to that kind of fossil have no place in my county.</P>

Lest the Deputy might fear that this performance of our people last year gave any grounds for apprehending that they would fall short of what was expected of them this year, will he allow me to refresh his memory?  He hopes, I gathered, to appear in this House after the next general election as a faithful supporter of Deputy Smith.

      <P>He is a very important man in this context.  The Deputy will have to look to his false prognostications as to what the acreage under wheat was to be, because his Leader put it on record in 1947, and his Leader advised the Government of the United States in the autumn of 1947, that he planned to have grown in 1950-51 247,000 acres of wheat in this country. That was to be the patriotic effort of the Deputy's Leader and that was what the Fianna Fáil Government intended to have.  It was endorsed by every individual member of that Government which the Deputy now so eagerly yearns to follow.  In fact, we produced, not 247,000 acres, but 366,000 acres of wheat and they were not Fianna Fáil acres of wheat either, because out of the 366,000 acres we produced as much wheat as Fianna Fáil had been able to produce out of 670,000 acres.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy be sure that he will not die of starvation so long as this Government is in office.  Might I say just this last word?  I do not mind the Deputy exercising the rights of a free member of this House, the indefeasible right of the least worthy member of the Dáil, to compel the Minister to remain here <Col N="379" /> from 10.30 to 11 p.m. to answer whatever question he wishes to raise.  But I did not expect to see Deputy Cogan wagging his head at me, to wonder if I had forgotten how the price of wheat has gone up, when wheat is the one cereal grown on this earth, the price of which has been stabilised by the International Control Board at 180 cents.  It is the only cereal in the world, the price of which is controlled. The Deputy knows that the price of maize, rye or any other cereal produced on this earth varies, but the price of wheat is fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My advice to the farmers of this country to-night is this, and I have given it to them for the last 30 years: Let every farmer produce from his land the maximum quantity of those crops that will pay him best, and <Col N="380" /> secure for himself, his wife and his family the best living that he is capable of producing, always provided that he leaves his land in autumn a little better than he found it in spring. So long as I am Minister for Agriculture, no bailiff or inspector will have the right to cross his threshold to dictate what he should do, unless there is a situation in this country which demands that similar dictation should be permitted for every doctor, lawyer, tradesman, trade unionist, and every other type of citizen.  If other people are to be free, the farmers should be free also, and if the farmers are compelled to adopt any particular policy, Deputy Cogan and his Fianna Fáil colleagues will be compelled at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until Wednesday, 21st February, at 3 p.m.</P>
