      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether it was with his knowledge and consent that the Minister for Agriculture recently contributed an article as &ldquo;Éire's Minister for Agriculture&rdquo; to a British newspaper which has been banned in this country by the Censorship of Publications Board as being a periodical publication which is usually or frequently indecent or obscene; and whether in view of this occurrence he will suggest to the Minister in question that it is not in keeping with his position as a member of the Government to lend his name or to permit his ministerial position to be used to increase or maintain the circulation of a periodical of this character.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for Agriculture was asked by the newspaper referred to for an interview on the question of food supplies. A prepared statement was furnished by the Minister on this topic of current interest.  Interviews granted to newspapers here or abroad in no way imply approval or disapproval of the morals, politics or literary qualities of the newspaper seeking the interview.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if a member of the Government has recently retired from the service of a local authority; and, if so, whether he will state the name of the member in question; further, if he will state whether such member has applied for or will in due course be given a pension or retiring allowance by the local authority concerned and the amount of such pension; finally, if he will indicate the grounds on which it has been or may be granted, and cite the relevant provisions of the statute governing the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. T.F. O'Higgins, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has recently retired from the post of chief medical officer under the Meath County Council.  I understand that he has applied for the grant of superannuation for which, in accordance with Section 23 (2) (a) (i) of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, he is eligible as an established officer who has attained the age of 60 years and has not less than 20 years of pensionable service.</P>
      <P>The grant of superannuation in such a case is a matter for the local authority concerned, subject to the relevant provisions of the Act to which I have referred.  The provisions governing the amount of superannuation are contained in Section 24 and 25 of the Act, dealing, respectively, with the determination of the lump sum and with the determination of the annual allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has seen the newspaper accounts of a recent speech made by the chairman of the Labour Court, Mr. R.J.P. Mortished, at University College, Cork, in the course of which Mr. Mortished is reported as having criticised national policy in regard to the unification of the country; if he will state whether there are any rules, conventions or regulations governing the making of such statements by persons holding such positions and whether he proposes to take any action in the matter.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the speech referred to by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>I do not question Mr. Mortished's right to express freely his convictions and opinions, but&mdash;while there are no specific rules or regulations in the matter&mdash;I feel obliged to say that a person holding a quasi-judicial office, as Mr. Mortished does, is rightly expected to maintain a reserve in political matters, to exercise great discretion in regard to public discussions of questions of national policy and to refrain from taking part, in a controversial way, in any such discussion. Looking at the matter from this point of view, the Government consider that, in their tone and general content, Mr. Mortished's remarks on the occasion referred to, as reported, were ill-advised and improper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that he disapproves of Mr. Mortished's entry, in the manner specified in the question, into the field of controversial politics and will the Taoiseach express an opinion as to whether it is in the national interest to have the occupant of a position such as that which Mr. Mortished occupies expressing a point of view on Partition contrary to that which is held on both sides of this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary <Col N="1676" /> question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The second part of his question asks me to express an opinion, and requests for expressions of opinion are not supposed to be dealt with in answers to queries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

There was an existing sluice at Reena-lagane and in 1926 the Land Commission repaired it after the benefiting land holders had signed an undertaking for future maintenance.  The work was fully carried out in 1926 and the Land Commission do not propose to repair the sluice again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the urgent necessity for carrying out afforestation schemes in any part of the country where suitable land can be procured.</P>
      <P>In the South Kerry area, there are already three forestry centres: Killarney, 2,155 acres; Kenmare, 523 acres; Kilgarvan, 504 acres, and, as the Deputy was recently informed, a new centre is to be opened at Lickeen as soon as title can be proved and other legal formalities cleared up.</P>
      <P>A lot of inspection and valuation work has been done lately in this district, and as a result agreement has been reached for the purchase of an additional area of 304 acres for attachment to Kenmare forest.  Possession is about to be taken of an area of 273 acres and a bargain has been made for the purchase of another area of 484 acres as additions to Kilgarvan forest.</P>
      <P>Other offers of approximately 11,000 acres in South Kerry have been received and are under consideration. Many have been inspected and some are awaiting inspection, but I am unable, at this stage, to say how many may ultimately be acquired.  In many cases the prices expected are in excess of the value of the land.</P>
      <P>Maritime pine will be planted in such areas as the technical experts of the forestry division consider most suitable for that species.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware of the long standing practice in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court whereby members of the Jewish faith are ordered by the State to &ldquo;stand by&rdquo; when about to be sworn on a jury and that this is hurtful to the persons concerned and to members of their faith; and, if so, if he will direct the Chief State Solicitor to discontinue the practice or, alternatively, if he will direct that Jews are not to be summoned for jury service if they are not to be permitted to serve on juries.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the existence of any such practice as is mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Members of the Jewish faith summoned as jurors are liable to be challenged and ordered to &ldquo;stand by&rdquo; when a jury is being sworn just as are any of the other jurors on the panel. There is no foundation, however, for any suggestion of discrimination against members of the Jewish faith merely because of their faith.  In fact, out of some 50 cases recently heard in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court members of the Jewish faith have actually served on the juries in approximately 14 cases.</P>

      <P>In the case referred to, the Circuit Court judge imposed a sentence of two months' imprisonment with hard labour on each of the convicted men.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice has always taken the view that it would be undesirable to state the grounds for the exercise of the prerogative in particular cases.

      <P>A Defence Force regulation was made on the 23rd February, 1951, altering the rates of special allowance payable to N.C.O.s filling vacancies for battalion administrative officers with units of An Forsa Cosanta Aitiuil in country districts to 3/3 a day for N.C.O.s provided with military accommodation or who are living with their families and to 6/- a day for others. Previously the allowances were 3/1 a day for personnel provided with military accommodation and 4/1 a day for all others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the two rates of special allowance (at present 2/9 a day and previously 1/- a day) represents an element in respect of the cost of <Col N="1691" /> lodgings for single men not provided with the accommodation which they would normally have in barracks if they were stationed at military posts.  Previously, in addition to personnel who were compelled to live in lodgings, the higher rate of special allowance was, owing to the wording of the regulation, issued to married personnel living with their families, although such personnel are not at any time or in any locality provided with free married accommodation. The anomaly which existed hitherto has been rectified as from the 23rd February, 1951, with the result that 61 battalion administrative officers who had, prior to that date, been in receipt of 4/1 a day are now in receipt of 3/3 a day, representing a decrease in their cases of 10d. a day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 32 to 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are fully aware, and have been for some time, of the potential dangers to the Irish economy inherent in the growing world scarcity of certain essential raw materials, and have taken steps to encourage and facilitate the accumulation in this country of reserve stocks of these materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long ago as last September, the Industrial Development Authority, at my request, commenced a survey of the <Col N="1693" /> position in essential industries, including those using the materials referred to by the Deputy.  They advised manufacturers of the growing difficulties which were likely to be encountered in securing raw materials and urged them in their own interests and in the national interest to lay in at least a six months' stock.  The great majority of manufacturers approached signified their willingness to co-operate &mdash;some, in fact, had already taken action themselves in anticipation of shortages&mdash;but it is too soon yet to say to what extent their stockpiling efforts have been successful.  Manufacturers have been asked to keep the authority informed periodically regarding the trend of their stocks.</P>
    <P>The authority, for their part, are at present examining in detail the position in regard to each commodity and are keeping a close watch on developments in world markets.  I understand that they have already accumulated a considerable amount of information but not quite enough for a complete picture.</P>
    <P>I might add that I have accepted recommendations of the authority for a relaxation of quota and tariff restrictions on certain commodities, principally piece goods, in order to assist stockpiling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let me put it this way.  It must be of very recent vintage, because up to comparatively recently certain industrialists requiring to stockpile were precluded from doing so because of the operation of quotas and I actually raised it in the House some six months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the <Col N="1698" /> first part of the question is in the affirmative.  Where exploration shows the existence of deposits of minerals which can be commercially exploited, capital and experience are required for the exploitation which may not be available to the extent required in this country.  In such circumstances, it would be the policy of the Government to provide facilities for external companies who can provide the technical skill needed and who are willing to invest funds in the working of minerals here.  As regards the exportation of unprocessed ores, it may be pointed out that there is no plant available in this country suitable for the smelting of lead and zinc ores.</P>

Is there any commercial advantage to this country in having that type of temporary exploitation facilitated?  Is it not far preferable to leave the minerals there in the ground, if necessary, until we are able to process them within the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as leaving holes in the ground is concerned, the Deputy left more than I will ever leave. With regard to the minerals underground, the important thing is to get their value and their amount surveyed, explored and, if possible, exploited for the benefit of this country, both geographically and nationally.  At any time when a source is explored and developed, we have permanent authority to control export.  Under the Deputy's own Act, a certain amount of export is allowed for experimental purposes.</P>

      <P>The best method of repair of a county road depends on such factors as the nature of the foundation, the weight and type of traffic, the type of materials available and so on.  The greater part of the county road mileage is still maintained by the spreading of broken stone and gravel, which is left for the traffic to bind in.  This method is neither useless nor uneconomic in the case of county roads, which still mainly take horse traffic, but where considerable motor traffic is involved, the best method to deal with the problem is to steamroll and tar the roads in question. The county road improvement grant is now making a steady annual contribution towards this work, but county councils are urged to supplement the grant out of their own resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts of the Department of Agriculture as disclosed in this Supplementary Estimate are certainly worthy of close scrutiny in my opinion by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Minister is switching a sum of about £1,500,000 from certain purposes to other purposes.  He is asking the Dáil to give him over £1,000,000 &mdash;£1,165,000&mdash;for flour and wheaten meal subsidies.  The Minister himself, in other debates, has admitted that Irish wheat, which he bought at £25 a ton, is being ground for cattle feeding. He is asking the Dáil to give him a sum of money which will enable him to sell the wheat he bought at £25 a ton for cattle feeding and to pay the difference between £32 a ton, which he is paying for American wheat, and the price at which the rationed flour is sold.  It is quite clear that the Minister is doing that in order to give an indirect subsidy to the export of cattle and eggs to Britain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but the wheat that should have been kept for human consumption and ground for rationed flour is being sold for cattle feeding, and it is costing the Exchequer very much more to buy American wheat and reduce it to the price at which rationed flour is sold, an extra £7 per ton.  The Minister himself admitted in another debate that he was, in fact, grinding the Irish wheat for cattle feeding. I say that this difference of £7 a ton is a matter which the Comptroller and Auditor-General should look into. I would not mind passing a subsidy for cattle feeding if the Minister came into <Col N="1707" /> the Dáil and proved that there was a case for it, but I certainly do object to passing a sum of money ostensibly to be used for subsidising food for human consumption and having that subsidy switched to subsidising cattle food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister claim that it is £29&mdash;I do not admit it, but if it is £29 there is a difference of £3. We are giving a £3 subsidy to cattle food out of the Vote for human food subsidies.  Now, apart from that aspect of the case, there is the further fact that we are spending millions of borrowed dollars in buying cereals from the United States of America in order to convert them into animal products and eggs for Britain.  Last year we imported about £6,000,000 worth of cereals over 1949; and our total excess of exports of animals and livestock products in 1950 over 1949 was just about £6,000,000.  We are therefore actually saving the British dollar purchases. We are borrowing dollars from America to buy cereals and converting those cereals into animal products and selling them to Britain for £s.  The Taoiseach at one time held the theory that we should hit the British in their pride, their prestige and their pockets. The Minister for Agriculture must be playing some very subtle game of hitting the British in their pride and in their prestige by borrowing American dollars and giving the British the results.  It is a fantastic economic policy to borrow dollars to buy something <Col N="1708" /> which we are converting into a sterling sale.  Perhaps the Minister thinks he can implement the Taoiseach's policy by hitting the British in their soft under-belly with cheap eggs.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is that there is a sum of £55,000 which the Minister is saving on food subsidies for school meals over a period of 12 months.  He has recently informed local authorities that he is not prepared to give them rationed flour for school meals and, by his refusal, he will thereby save £55,000 for the Exchequer.  Now school meals were largely provided in those schools where it is in the public interest that the children should be provided with cheap meals.</P>

      <P>Before I pass away from this wheat and flour subsidy, I want to say that as far as the country is concerned, the Minister stands in relation to wheat growing where he always stood.  He has spent a lot of the public money in a year which the Taoiseach <Col N="1712" /> has said is a very dangerous one, in which the Minister for Finance has announced that it is necessary to spend money to stock up, in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is urging everybody to stock up.  The Minister for Agriculture has not yet asked one single farmer to grow one grain of wheat, which is an essential commodity for human beings.  He did ask the farmers by advertisement to grow cattle food.  Will he ask them to grow food for human beings in the form of wheat?  I do not worship wheat but I think it is a very useful crop.  It is an essential crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the food subsidy. If the Minister would ask the farmers to grow wheat in this particular year, their food subsidy next year might be very much less.  We started off buying foreign wheat at the beginning of this year for many less pounds a ton than we paid at the end of it, and if the present trend goes on it is more than £32 a ton we may be paying for foreign wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister nominated in this particular case the pedigree seed merchants as the enemy of the farmers and he was pretty bitter about them.  He talked about them as &ldquo;these boys&rdquo;, &ldquo;these monopolists&rdquo;. He said&mdash;at column 1643, Volume 124, Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I simply abolished the monopoly and as soon as I abolished the monopoly the boys did not last much longer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He alluded to them several times as &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; and so on.  He also alluded tothem as &ldquo;a ring&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a small item, £5,000, in the Supplementary Estimate which is going to what the Minister calls &ldquo;a ring&rdquo;, to these monopolists.  He gave an explanation in regard to this matter which simply did not hold water because what he said disagreed fundamentally with what is written on <Col N="1715" /> the face of the Estimate.  The Minister said that he gave them this £5,000 because, as he said at column 1642:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Being reasonable men on both sides we eventually compromised on the issue and agreed that the payment of this sum would liquidate any claims that they had without prejudice on our part that any claims existed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is his history of the transaction. But on the face of the Estimate it was disclosed that this sum of money was given to what the Minister called a ring because they had at the end of the wheat season a certain amount of assembled wheat which, not having been taken by the Irish farmers, had to be given to the mills and this £5,000 went to make up the difference between their costs and the price they got from the mills.  The Minister said that he has effectively broken this ring, that he has put an end to the pedigree seed growing.  What the Minister has done effectively is to kill as far as he was able the production of pure line seed wheat for which the farmers over a number of years paid £4 10s. 0d. a barrel and this year pure line pedigree seed wheat is offered to us by the Swedes and the British at £6 10s. 0d., so that the Minister has endeavoured to kill the production of seed wheat in Ireland and to import more from Sweden and England at a very much higher price.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of that, and the most important aspect of it, is that the farmers do not know, when they are importing from Sweden and Britain, whether the wheat, oats or barley is pure line seed or not.  A Chinn Chomhairle, I can scarcely hear myself, with Deputy Cowan and Deputy Lehane speaking.  If they want to converse, they should go outside.</P>

      <P>In Glasnevin their pure line seed was bought out long ago. Where can you get pure line seed? What has the Minister done?  With his crazy approach to this problem, he has destroyed an effort, which was an honest effort, to improve the output of this land by the production within the country, and under our own surveillance, of pure line seeds&mdash;wheat, barely, oats and everything else.  I think it is a completely disastrous policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not rambling.  The Minister said he set up an organisation a fortnight ago.  He destroyed this thing a couple of years ago.  It could have been going ahead, building up. The effort started during the war to produce good seeds of all sorts should have been continued until we got to the point where every farmer sowing an acre with grass, oats, wheat, mangels or turnips, should be sowing it with good pure seed, produced under such conditions as would give a guarantee to those farmers and to the Department that it was good, sound seed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not rambling.  The Minister may know something about certain little trades, but he knows nothing about agriculture.  He did not <Col N="1718" /> get this year from the seed merchants their price lists, so he could not deny that allegedly pure line seed from Britain will cost £6 10s. and we used to get it for £4 10s.  I am talking now about wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am sure if the merchants are charging £6 10s. for English seed, the English merchants are getting a good whack out of it, very much more than our merchants got when they had to pay 65/- for wheat in the harvest and were selling it at £4 10s.</P>
      <P>Another little fable which the Minister told us, related to hides.  He expanded quite a lot on that and he talked again about a ring.  What do we gather from what the Minister said? We heard his denunciation of the &ldquo;ring&rdquo; and we heard him denouncing Fianna Fáil for setting it up.  From the Minister's figures we gather that the ring is getting £5 8s. 4d. of a subsidy per hide, instead of £3 2s. 6d. under Fianna Fáil.  He is giving them £5 8s. 4d. a hide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to drag the truth out of the Minister and it is a pretty difficult operation.  The Minister informed us that this operation was costing cattle graziers £1,000,000 to £1,500,000.  That is a pretty hefty sum. If the Minister gave it to the egg producers it would represent 10/- a great hundred, or 1/- a dozen on the exports. The Minister told the egg producers a couple of years ago that he was going to give them a sure, guaranteed, remunerative market for all the eggs they could produce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly support the Minister in telling the British that they <Col N="1720" /> will get no eggs from here at 2/- a dozen.  The Minister thought that 3/- a dozen was a rather poor price when maize was round about £1 per cwt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has almost £500,000 here for butter.  Here again it was very difficult to get the truth out of the Minister.  I have not yet got the truth out of him, in my opinion, in regard to how this £500,000 is to be used.  When the Minister made his opening speech he said that they calculated that production last year would be about 700,000 cwt.  Then he amended that in the course of my speech to say that that should have been 650,000 cwt.  I do not believe the Minister calculated on a reduction in the production of butter in 1950 as against 1949 but according to the figures which he gave the Dáil the other day the estimated production in 1949 was 687,000 cwt.  Surely the Minister did not in 1949 think the production in 1950 would be lower than that by some 37,000 cwt.?  We all know the Minister is an optimist, a foolish optimist in many respects, but I think the original statement in this regard is more likely to be true, that, in fact, they did estimate for a production of 700,000 cwt.  However, we are not likely to get at the truth of that matter, and I only want to mark this, that in 1949 there was a production of 687,000 cwt. and the Minister told us that he estimated that the production of butter would be down the following year instead of up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I want to warn the Minister.  I have seen these wrappers in which there was Danish or New Zealand butter.  It was an Irish creamery butter wrapper and the usual printing on it to the effect that it was Irish creamery butter.  Then there was a stamp which said that it was New Zealand or Danish butter.  I think it would have been much better to have used a plain piece of paper rather than a wrapper of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It has led to a lot of confusion. It is a pretty confusing business, not only for us here in the Dáil who are trying to extract some information from the Minister, but also for the ordinary people.  I think it was a mistake to have issued an Irish wrapper for Danish or New Zealand butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the reason the Minister is asking us for this £500,000 for butter this year is not because Irish production went up to such an extent as would warrant this Supplementary Estimate, but because he carried out this unfortunate transaction of selling Irish butter cheaply and buying New Zealand and Danish butter dearly.  That is the reason for a large portion of this subsidy we have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, and I am perfectly certain that the people who are close up to this business know it is true.  The Minister can deny it here because I have no access to the papers that would show it is true.  I do not know what the Comptroller and Auditor-General can do with that, but if the Minister is telling this Dáil that he is asking for a sum of money to subsidise the consumption of Irish butter, and if he is asking the Dáil to grant it for that reason alone, then I think the Comptroller and Auditor-General should look into the whole matter and see whether or not it is a fact, that the <Col N="1722" /> reason we have to give this £500,000 of money is to subsidise very dearly bought Danish and New Zealand butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>There was a certain gentleman who asked that question on one occasion but seeing that it is Deputy Cowan who asks it on this occasion, it does not matter.  The Minister tried to tell me on the last day that he was asking for £500,000 extra&mdash;more than one-fifth extra for a butter subsidy simply because his Estimate had been out by one twenty-eighth.  He changed the story later to say that instead of being out one twenty-eighth, it was out three twenty-eighths. That still leaves two twenty-eighths unaccounted for.  Unless the Minister wants this subsidy to utilise it for some other unknown reason, it is for a butter subsidy.  He is <Col N="1723" /> using this butter subsidy to bridge the very big gap between the Danish price and the New Zealand price and the price for which he would have got Irish butter.</P>

      <P>We will get somebody else to deal with that question.  I will get one of our Deputies to deal with that particular thing in detail for the Minister's benefit.  The Minister seems to have given up his attempt to drown the British in eggs, but he proposes to drown the world in Kerry cows' milk, and he is going to do it all for the £800 that is in this Estimate.  Now the Minister took us on a trip around the world.  He had Kerry cows eating cactus in the Middle East and some very dry grass in the Orient, and all that was going to happen because the Minister proposes to spend in this Estimate a sum of £800.  I would like to see the breed of Kerry cows promoted in the poor areas in the country, areas in which they would be more suitable than the cattle that are at present being kept there.  Indeed, if we could establish a foreign trade in Kerry cows for poor areas, I think it would be an excellent idea.  I have seen Kerry cows outside of Ireland, and I have seen them doing well; but, if the Minister is starting off on that type of campaign, he will have to spend very much more than £800.  The <Col N="1724" /> Minister made more chat about the £800 than he did about the rest of the £1,500,000.  I think it would be a good idea if the Minister would take some practical steps to promote the export of Kerry cows, but it should be done in a reasonable way.  If he is going to go into it in a big way, then he should have asked for a reasonable sum in connection with it.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about the Minister is that it is very hard for us to know which is his head and which is his tail.  He stands on his head when he starts talking about agriculture. One time he says to the farmer's wife that she is going to know, before the chicken puts its beak through the shell, what she is going to get for every egg which it lays during its economic lifetime, but the next day he turns around and says he is going to cut the price of eggs by 6d. a dozen, and in another six months, he cuts it by another 6d. a dozen.

We wanted the Minister to deal with the question of butter and to tell us what he really wanted this £500,000 for.  We wanted him to deal with the question of wheat, with what is likely to be the situation in connection with it, and what he wants the farmers to do.  Instead of that, he goes cowpunching Kerry cows all over the world.

      <P>I do not want to delay the House for more than a few minutes on this Supplementary Estimate.  Between Deputy Aiken and the Minister, there has been, whether wittingly or unwittingly, a certain amount of fog created about this whole question of the butter subsidy and, particularly, about the relationship of that subsidy to the importation of New Zealand and Danish butter, which, unfortunately, the people of this city have been obliged to take on their ration.  To my mind the explanation&mdash;I speak subject to correction by the Minister if he does not adopt my view of it&mdash;is a very simple one, and I suggest to Deputy Aiken that it is one in respect of which no blame can be attached to the Minister. As I understand the figures, the people of this country consumed during the past year a greater quantity of butter than they had ever consumed before, so far as we can gather from recorded statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister underestimated the capacity of our people to purchase butter; in other words, the Minister underestimated the general prosperity of our people.  That was a mistake on the Minister's part and I quarrel with his decision to export butter at the time he did so, but it was a pardonable mistake, and a mistake in respect of which I suggest we should rather not criticise the Minister but congratulate ourselves on the fact that our people were in a position to have, in reasonably generous quantities, this very necessary component of diet.  It is quite easy to impute to the Minister the worst possible motives, to say that he made a colossal mistake and that he wilfully wanted to subsidise the New Zealand and Danish producers of butter at the expense of our own people; but anyone looking at the facts objectively and examining them without rancour, without bias and <Col N="1727" /> without prejudice against the Minister is driven inescapably to the conclusion that the Minister's mistake was the one I have outlined, namely, an underestimation of the purchasing capacity of our people in respect of this article of diet.  That is the only comment I want to make on that.</P>
    <P>What brought me into the House for this Supplementary Estimate was a much less important and much smaller matter, because I did not think there could be any real controversy on the other question.  The point with which I want to deal arises on sub-head F (7) in respect of the additional grants to university colleges.</P>

      <P>The appearance of that figure on my Estimate is a pure convention. It is the Minister for Finance who answers to the House for it and its appearance on my Estimate is merely a survival of the pre-1924 practice when the Department was responsible for the agricultural college.  We transferred it to University College, Dublin, in 1924, but never transferred that part of the university grant which applies to it from my Vote.  But for that, it would not be there at all; it would be on the Vote for Universities and Colleges.</P>

Inasmuch as this figure in respect of additional provision to University College, Dublin, Faculty of General Agriculture, <Col N="1728" /> appears on this Supplementary Estimate, it must be on this Supplementary Estimate that I deal with it.  I understand&mdash;again I am open to correction&mdash;that it is proposed that the greater portion of this sum should be allotted for the purpose of raising the salaries of the six professors and four lecturers in the faculty of agriculture at Albert College and that a little over £1,000 is to be allocated in respect of increases to assistant lecturers, of whom there are nine.  I suggest to the Minister that where a sum of money of that amount is being allocated for salary increases, the first charge upon such a sum should be the claim of those less well remunerated, and that, before giving rather substantial increases to professors and lecturers already in receipt of sufficient, if not substantial, emoluments, consideration should be given to those less well remunerated.</P>

The House is being asked to vote a sum of £6,000 and I am entitled to suggest it to the Minister &mdash;I am not questioning in any way the autonomous position of University College, Dublin&mdash;that it would be much easier for the House to agree to vote this sum, were the House satisfied that it was being wisely and properly utilised.  In my submission, it would be wiser and more proper to utilise the major portion of this sum in increasing the salaries of those less well remunerated than to appropriate three-quarters of it for a small number of people already in receipt of substantial salaries, while ignoring the just claims of the assistant lecturers, who, in my submission, are not properly remunerated at the moment.</P>

Having made the point, I do not wish to labour it further.  I merely commend to the Minister the general principle that, before having regard to the claims of people in receipt of substantial emoluments, he should first of all give due weight and consideration to the claims of people such as assistant lecturers in the faculty of agriculture to reasonable increases in their salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endeavour to get from the Minister some intelligent explanation of his administration of the flour subsidy.  The additional amount he is asking for flour subsidy this year&mdash;£1,165,000&mdash;is by far the biggest item in the Supplementary Estimate and the explanation he gave the Dáil in regard to that item on Thursday night last was most unintelligible. If we are to believe the Minister, the administration of flour subsidy has been covered by trickery and deceit for the past three years. No figure given by him or by the Minister for Finance was accurate and no further reliance can be placed upon any figure given us now.  That is true, if we are to believe the Minister.</P>
      <P>The matter of flour subsidy involves a substantial amount of money and the Dáil should be particularly careful as to how that money is utilised and for what purposes.  It should insist on getting some reliable estimate of the expenditure and some detailed account of how it was effected.  On Thursday night last the Minister started off by telling us that his Department had estimated the cost of flour subsidy at £7,400,000.  For some reason, which he did not explain, the figure of £7,200,000 was put in the Book of Estimates. Later, in the course of his remarks, he gave another computation made at that time&mdash;an anonymous computation &mdash;which placed the cost of subsidy at £7,465,000.  He injudiciously told us how the amount of subsidy was calculated&mdash;50,600 sacks per week, on the average, subsidised to the extent of 57/6 and involving, if my calculation is correct, £7,565,000.</P>

      <P>From column 1644 of the Official Report of 8th March.  That number of sacks per week, subsidised to the extent of 57/6 per sack, requires £7,465,000.  However, the Minister told us, from the sale of white flour he got an excess profit of 17/6 a sack. The sales of white flour averaged 4,750 sacks per week, which reduced the amount required for subsidy by £216,000, leaving a net sum required of £7,349,000.</P>

      <P>First of all I want to know why the Estimate of the Department was not inserted in the Book of Estimates and why the book, if it was prepared on the basis suggested by the Minister, gave a wrong figure&mdash;but particularly, why that figure was £1,165,000 out. The Minister will not claim that he gave a coherent explanation of that point.  He said that the balance required to meet the original estimate, based on 12 months' delivery to approximately 19th January, 1951, is £265,000.  A little more explanation in regard to that figure is needed.</P>
      <P>Then, apparently, he contends that there was some sort of book-keeping change under which provision for subsidy was extended from 1st January to 28th February, which required £700,000. I do not believe that that is the correct explanation.  In addition, there was another £200,000 to make some back payment due to the millers for an earlier year.</P>

In 1948 the Book of Estimates contained a figure of approximately £9,500,000 for flour <Col N="1733" /> subsidy.  The Minister for Finance came to the Dáil and announced his device for averaging the cost of subsidy over a five-year period&mdash;involving a reduction in the cost of subsidy in that year of £2,500,000 and an increase in subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The Argentine wheat in 1948 brought the average price of imported wheat to £33 10s. 0d. per ton against £32 per ton which we are paying now.  Let us deal with the finances. The Minister for Finance got this brilliant idea of averaging the high cost of imported wheat in that year over five years.  He said he based his calculations on the assumption that the price of wheat would not rise above the two dollars per bushel contracted for under the International Wheat Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the ceiling price was two dollars.  The actual price in the first year was one dollar 80 cents. He assured us that over the five-year period&mdash;on the basis of his pessimistic assumptions&mdash;the average cost of flour subsidy would not exceed £7,134,000. The price of wheat did fall and freights fell also, but in no year has the cost of the flour subsidy fallen below the figure quoted by the Minister for Finance in his first Budget statement.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the facts as we know them.  The Minister for Finance did not do anything of the kind he had proposed to do.  The idea of having £2,500,000 in the form of subsidy in 1948 spread over a five-year period was dropped at some time in that year without the Dáil being informed of the fact.  According to information subsequently published, the amount paid in 1948-49 was £9,900,000&mdash;not the Minister for Finance's estimate of £7,134,000 in the Budget statement, but £9,900,000.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to <Col N="1734" /> your being conservative but I do object to being tricked and I object to the Dáil and the people of the country being tricked as well.  If the Minister for Finance puts forward certain proposals of which he asks the Dáil to approve and subsequently, behind the backs of the Dáil without giving any hint of his intention of changing his mind, abandons those proposals and allocates to purposes of which the Dáil is not aware, the substantial sum of £3,000,000, the Government of which he is a member is open to criticism. Having regard to the fact that the additional cost of wheat in 1948 was not spread over the ensuing five-year period, will the Minister for Finance explain why it is that the cost of the subsidy in each case of the subsequent years exceeded instead of falling below £7,100,000, the figure which the Minister for Finance told us it would not exceed when speaking here in 1948?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the explanation? Does it explain the 1949 figure? Remember that the figure £7,100,000 was based on three assumptions: that in each year part of the 1948 cost would be carried over; it was not carried over.  The second assumption was that the cost of wheat would not fall below the 1948 average; but it did fall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Minister was trying to mislead the House last week when he said that the price was £31.  Will he try to make up his mind what it does cost?  We have the position that the original plan of spreading the high cost of the wheat subsidy in 1948 over a five-year period was abandoned and the whole cost was met in that financial year without the Dáil being aware of it; we had a fall in the cost of imported wheat in 1949, a fall undoubtedly subsequently arrested by devaluation, but which brought the average price for 1949 down to £26; we had a drop in shipping freights, but no drop in the cost of the flour subsidy and there should have been a substantial drop in the cost of the flour subsidy.  The Minister set up a committee to report on the flour and bread subsidy with Mr. Lavery as its chairman and they, misled by the proposals of the Minister for Finance in 1948 and by some calculations made by the Minister for Agriculture, estimated that the cost of the subsidy should average between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000 a year.  Why then does it cost £8,000,000 this year and why did it cost £7,000,000 last year?  If there is an explanation I should like to hear it but nobody has offered any information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the arithmetic in that column is wrong.  I do not believe that there has been this change in accountancy practice by which the cost of the wheat subsidy was voted only up to the 19th January and that it is now intended to extend it to the 28th February.  The Minister has got to think of a more convincing explanation than that.  Let me remind him that the Estimate was all wrong last year also.  He asked the Dáil, 12 months ago, to vote an additional subsidy of £800,000 and on that occasion gave an entirely different explanation for the need of the additional amount to the one he is now giving.  I suppose he thought that the one story would not get over twice.  The explanation on that occasion was that the quantity of domestic wheat had been under-estimated. We have heard a lot of talk from the Minister about his ability to produce more wheat from a smaller acreage than Fianna Fáil could manage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the discussion on the main Estimate last year, on June 15th, he said that there was a substantial decline in the total acreage of wheat.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But, despite that fact, the delivery of wheat to the mills up to 29th April last amounted to 2,350,648 barrels as compared with 2,514,088 barrels last year off an acreage nearly 150,000 less this year than was laid down under wheat last year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was all baloney.  The Minister for Finance can, of course, control the issues of facts from his Department. He can doctor those facts to suit whatever case he wants to make to the Dáil, but he will have to do something about the Government Statistics Office if he wants to sound convincing. Unfortunately for him, the Government Statistics Office is pouring out a volume of statistics which completely contradicts everything he says.  I would prefer the Minister to interrupt me by speech rather than by facial contortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quantity of wheat delivered to the Irish mills, according to the <Col N="1738" /> Statistics Office was, in 1949-50, 305,000 cwt. less than in 1948-49; and in 1950-51&mdash;the year in which the Minister was boasting that he was able to get such a larger yield of wheat from a smaller acreage than was possible under Fianna Fáil&mdash;it fell by a further 1,110,000 cwt.

      <P>The point I am trying to establish is that every single estimate in all the Minister's speeches, of the yield of wheat or the cost of wheat subsidy, has been proven in the event to be wrong, and fantastically wrong. Not merely that, but we paid out in 1948, £9,998,000 in wheat subsidy when the Minister for Finance framed his Budget on the assumption that it would be only £7,100,000.  Not only was he wrong then but the Minister for Agriculture under-estimated it by £800,000 in the following year and during this year we find it under-estimated by £1,165,000.  I suggest that, having regard to the conflicting and erroneous figures given to us as to the cost of Irish wheat, the cost of imported wheat, the yield of wheat from the Irish harvest, the delivery of wheat to the Irish mills and the quantity of wheat imported, we are forced to the conclusion that we can place no reliance whatever on any statement made by the Minister in that connection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can concede that some quantity of wheat held by farmers for seed which will not be used for seed will be delivered to the mills between this and next June, but from my experience the quantity of wheat so delivered will not exceed 5,000 or at the outside 10,000 tons; and that does not invalidate my contention that the Minister's statement that he got delivered in 1950 from a smaller acreage more wheat than in previous years was fantastically inaccurate. There was a deficiency of 1,110,000 cwt.</P>
      <P>There is a matter to which I want to refer, which may be of some delicacy, and if the Minister thinks that, in referring to it, I am prejudicing any national interest, I want him to intervene and tell me so.  It was stated here by members of the Dáil last week that wheat is being crushed for animal feeding.  In my time, when I was responsible for supervising wheat purchases abroad and the rationing of flour and bread supplies at home, there was an international authority controlling wheat exports. That international authority was particular in supervising the use of wheat by importing countries.  When there was a suggestion that, even in spite of our regulations here and our efforts to enforce those regulations, some wheat was being used in this country for animal feeding, there was a threat that our supplies from abroad would be curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if that international wheat authority is still in existence. I do not know if there is any international body that cares a thrauneen <Col N="1741" /> what the Minister does with, wheat here; but I do know this, that the world wheat situation is tight at the moment and that it will be with difficulty that we will be able to get enough wheat to meet our requirements in this year.  If there is any such international body now in existence, or if such an international authority is likely to be created in the possibly difficult circumstances of this year, then the knowledge that we were utilising wheat for animal feeding with ministerial authority may prove seriously detrimental to our interests.</P>
    <P>We are facing this year the probability of another substantial drop in the Irish wheat acreage.  I do not think even the Minister will contend otherwise.  The fact that wheat is the crop which gives the poorest return to farmers at present prices and the sense of grievance because the Irish price is now well below the world price, will operate to discourage wheat growing and, as has been mentioned here, the Minister is taking no steps to sustain it.  All the departmental propoganda is concentrated in favour of the production of other crops.</P>
    <P>We are likely, therefore, to have from this year's harvest, apart altogether from weather conditions, a substantial diminution in yield and will be forced to rely more and more on imported wheat and to rely on getting that imported wheat in the restricted supply conditions now prevailing. Granted that these conditions may change if there is a bountiful harvest in the northern hemisphere this year, but if not, then we may have difficulty in meeting our full requirements; and these difficulties may be enhanced if there is any objection raised abroad by those supplying us with wheat or providing us with dollars to buy wheat, to the utilisation of that commodity for animal feeding in present circumstances. The Minister said here last year, when he made the change affecting pollard and decided to withdraw supplies of pollard from the compound feeding-stuff manufacturers and to utilise it for straight sale, that there was going to be a scarcity of pollard and that he was introducing a system of control which would ensure a fair distribution.  I presume he is well <Col N="1742" /> aware now that there is no scarcity of pollard, that in fact the position has arisen that there is such a glut of pollard in the mills that some millers may cease production unless arrangements are made to relieve the pressure on their storage space.  That is the position in a number of flour mills and I can state that on the best authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite pleased about that.  That is not what the Minister anticipated when he made the change and withdrew the pollard from the compound feeding-stuff manufacturers. He might now think it worth while to investigate why certain matters did not turn out as he seems <Col N="1743" /> to have anticipated.  That is all I have to say on that subject.</P>
      <P>There is one thing I want to say about this matter of the price of hides. The Minister is under the impression that this arrangement by which the export of hides is controlled and hides are sold to Irish tanneries at a fixed price is one designed to benefit the tanneries, the hide merchants and the boot and shoe manufacturers.  It does nothing of the kind.  The only basis for that situation is the prohibition on export which the Government is maintaining. If that prohibition was lifted, Irish hides would flow out of the country, and be sold at the prices now prevailing in scarcity conditions throughout the world.  It would not affect the tanneries.  The tanneries will be able to continue in production. It would not affect the boot and shoe manufacturers.  They would be able to continue in production.  It is true that the prices of leather and boots and shoes will go up.  Certainly, if the Minister withdraws the prohibition, it will not hurt the Eire Hides Improvement Association.  They would prefer to export their hides and cash-in on the scarcity prices prevailing rather than to be held by a departmental regulation to sell them to Irish tanneries at a fixed price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is trying to ride away upon his usual device of attacking some group of Irish citizens and blaming them for the consequences of an act of his Government.  There is no justification for it.  If the Minister can persuade the Government to repeal the Order prohibiting the export of hides, that problem will disappear, and they will be lighting bonfires outside the offices of the Eire Hides Improvement Association and, inside, passing resolutions congratulating the Minister.  Remember, that restriction was imposed as a protection for our citizens.  It was a justifiable protection during the war at a time when there was a scarcity of leather throughout the world and when in Great Britain, not merely was that scarcity most acute, but the British Government was heavily subsiding imported hides.  Is it suggested that we should have deprived ourselves of leather and <Col N="1744" /> footwear so that the hide exporters would be able to cash-in on these special conditions?  We decided against that.  We stopped the export of hides. We insisted that all the hides originating in this country would be sold to Irish tanneries to be tanned here and sold at a price which we regarded as reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can alter the price by a stroke of the pen tomorrow. Why does he not do it if he thinks it is unfair?  There has been an increase under his direction since the change of Government.  It can be increased again.  But, when it is increased, let him not try to avoid the consequences.  The consequence will be an increase in the cost of leather and, consequently, of footwear and other articles manufactured from leather.  The tanneries would, if they could get them, prefer to use a much higher proportion of imported hides, because there are certain forms of leather which can be manufactured more economically from sun-dried hides than from the native hides available here.  What the Minister is attempting to put over on the Dáil appears to be all nonsense.  There is a situation there which the Government has created and is maintaining and the Government is trying to put the blame for the consequences of that situation upon some group of citizens who have nothing to do with it and who would be glad to see it ended.  It is most unfair to attack the hide merchants in particular who protested strongly against the making of the Order controlling exports.</P>

      <P>I do not care at whose expense.  The British Government did it by direct subsidy.  If the Irish Government want to do it by direct subsidy, they can do it also.  If they choose to do it in another way, it is a matter of Government policy from day to day; it can be changed from day to day.  If the Minister wants to hit somebody for the consequences of a wrong policy, he will have to hit himself.  I cannot see the reason for all his rhetorical denunciation of people outside the House because he is annoyed at the consequences of what he decided upon.  There would be some sense in the Minister's remarks if he followed them up by announcing that the Government had changed its mind and had decided to reverse its decision. Apparently, the only sequel to the Minister's denunciation of this situation is to leave the situation unchanged, which seems to be next door to lunacy.</P>

      <P>I have a document in my possession which was presented to Deputy Lemass in April, 1932.  Deputy Lemass welcomed the individuals who came to see him in April, 1932, with proposals for the nationalisation of the flour milling industry.  Instead of putting into operation the nationalisation policy that he advocated and said he believed in prior to 1932, he poured tens of millions of pounds into the pockets of the Rank combine and other big flour millers in this country.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;An examination of the flour milling industry in the Saorstát based upon the numbers and conditions of the wage earners employed at present compared with the past and the important place of the industry in the national economy and its vital necessity as an essential food-producing service, results in the conclusion <Col N="1747" /> that the reorganisation and control of the whole flour-milling industry must be undertaken by a national non-profit making association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They then go on to give the details in support of their proposals.  I suggest that if Deputy Lemass had given any consideration&mdash;I do not think he did&mdash; to the proposals that were welcomed by him in April, 1932, this country would have been saved tens of millions of pounds during the intervening period.</P>

I dare say the Minister for Agriculture can request his colleague to hand him over the whole file dealing with this proposal. I would encourage the Minister to give careful consideration to these proposals rather than to continue to pour out these millions of pounds on behalf of the taxpayers so that we may make more flour millionaires in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to relate the figure of £1,165,000, that he is now asking for to the Estimate under the same sub-head for the year ending 31st March, 1952, and to ensure that the subsidy for the year ending 31st March, 1952, will not exceed the figure of £7,000,000.  In the original Estimate for the year ending 31st March, 1951, the Estimate shows that the sum estimated would not exceed £7,200,000.  That figure has now been increased to £8,365,000.  As the Minister knows, the Estimate under sub-head P for flour and wheaten meal shows a reduction for the current financial year of £200,000.  If the figure of £7,000,000 can be regarded as a reliable estimate, <Col N="1748" /> then we will have a saving of £1,365,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>That being so, I would appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration at an early date to the necessity for reorganising the flour-milling industry.  I would encourage him to do so.  If he has not all the data in the Department of Agriculture I wonder would he get hold of the file that is probably covered with dust in the Department of Industry and Commerce and look into the matter, not just for the purpose of putting into operation a policy of nationalisation but for the purpose of putting into operation a policy that will save the taxpayers from the huge sums that have been and are being doled out to the millers over a long period of years. There is no doubt but that Deputy Aiken, when he was Minister for Finance, must have found out something about the wealth of the flour millers, a small body of people who have become wealthy at the expense of the taxpayers.</P>

While a very substantial sum, amounting to £1,000,769, is required there are Appropriations-in-Aid <Col N="1749" /> of £300,000 and there are savings on other sub-heads of £1,400,000.  It would be interesting to know where those savings have occurred.  At whose expense have those savings been effected?  I have a sort of suspicion&mdash; the Minister did not mention the matter&mdash;that a considerable amount of money was saved through cutting the grants about which the Minister talks so fluently when he describes all he is doing for the farmer.  I hope that the Minister when he is replying will explain fully how he has saved this very large sum of £1,400,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every time the Minister comes in here to discuss agricultural policy he discovers some atrocious plot against the people.  Last week he discovered a potato plot in County Donegal.  I would be interested to know whether he intends prosecuting anybody for their activities in connection with that very objectionable business, but I have a shrewd suspicion that the Minister's denunciations will go no further than this House.  It is very easy to denounce people here. There is no penalty involved.  Having discovered the potato plot last week, the Minister will probably discover a cabbage plot somewhere in Dublin next week and the week after he will discover some other gang of thieves who are preying on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is always the &ldquo;Great White Chief&rdquo;, defending the people's interest.  Listening to him, one gets the impression that Dick Barton and Hopalong Cassidy are only trotting after him.  He discovers criminals, bandits, highwaymen and racketeers everywhere.  I do not think the people take the Minister very seriously now, but I do think that the Minister is abusing his function in attacking those <Col N="1750" /> who are not here to defend themselves. Possibly attack is the best defence.  It would be very hard for the Minister to defend his policy in regard to many items included in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Con Lehane giving such a very plausible explanation as to why this butter subsidy is required.  He said that the Minister underestimated our capacity for consuming butter.  I wonder is that the whole explanation?  The Minister knows, of course, that while our consumption of creamery butter has increased very substantially during the last few years our production and consumption of farmers' butter has decreased very substantially and continues to decrease.  The Minister quite ruthlessly killed that branch of our agricultural industry.  Having killed it, he is now able to show an expansion in the production of creamery butter.  It is only natural that with more and more areas being brought within the scope of the creamery industry the production of creamery butter must increase, coupled with the fact that the last few years were favourable towards expansion.  I can never accept the statistics presented to me in relation to the production and consumption of farmers' butter.  I do not believe that the Minister can accept them fully either.  Butter is produced and consumed in my house and no one has ever asked me how much butter is produced and consumed in my house.  The figures given are merely the result of guesswork.  I presume that it is the result of observation that the Department has estimated that the production of farmers' butter has gone down and is going down very rapidly.  Indeed, one would not need to be an official of the Department of Agriculture to see that.</P>
    <P>The fact that creamery butter is heavily subsidised and sold at less than the cost of production naturally tends to discourage the production of farmers' butter.  That is why farmers' butter production continues to go down.  I do not think the Minister, in making these wild estimates of the enormous increase in the consumption of creamery butter, has given full consideration to the decline in production, <Col N="1751" /> marketing and consumption of farmers' butter.  I think the Minister should try to give a true picture of the position in relation to every branch of his Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subsidy on wheat, there is one point to which I think the Minister should refer when he is replying. I refer to the enormous increase in the price charged for bran and pollard.  I would like to have the figures analysed.  They would show some profit being secured to the milling industry as a result of this increase. I know that whole wheat is being added to pollard.  If the matter is carefully investigated it will show that the producer of bran and pollard is paying more than double what he paid a couple of months ago.  Somebody must be getting an increased profit. That profit may be going into the pockets of Deputy Davin's friends or it may be shown as a saving on subsidy.  I think the Minister should let us know the true position and explain why such a substantial increase has taken place in this important feeding stuff.  This increase in the price of bran and pollard, together with the increase in the price of maize and other feeding stuffs, is literally crippling agricultural production.  I think every Deputy must agree that from the very outset the Minister has blundered badly in relation to the production of animal feeding stuffs.  He has brought the country to a deplorable position. He announced to the world, and to the Irish farmer in particular, that he would flood this country with cheap maize.  For two years he preached that doctrine and drove the farmers out of tillage.  For some unknown reason, he proclaimed that he would import unlimited quantities of maize at a reduced price.</P>

The Minister cannot escape blame in respect of that transaction. We are dealing in this Supplementary Estimate with only a few specific items, and I do not want to discuss the Minister's entire agricultural policy.</P>

Questions have been asked since that, and information has been extracted from him, and we have found that, while we are paying £25 a ton for native wheat, we are importing wheat at £31 16s. a ton.

That is an appalling position and it is one that it is very hard to remedy.

      <P>I am taking only a small part in this debate.  The Minister has a habit of interrupting, by which he hopes to divert attention from any criticism that may be directed against his policy.  Deputy Lemass complained of the Minister interrupting by facial contortions.  I have no complaint whatever about any interruptions on the Minister's part.  It does not help him in any way; it does not explain his failures; it does not explain why he is coming to this House to demand this substantial sum, a substantial sum which is not coming out of taxation but which is coming out of savings under other sub-heads, savings which, I venture to say, have been effected by drastically cutting down various grants that were provided for the farming community.  I would be inclined to suspect that probably some of the savings come out of the land rehabilitation project.  I would be interested to know if that is so because, so much has been said against farmers and so much has been said about all the money that we are drawing from the taxpayers, from the State, that the Minister should inform the public as to what money is taken back from the farming community.  The substantial subsidies here, in regard to both butter and wheat, are subsidies, pure and simple, to the consumer.  I do not think the Minister will deny that.  They do not go to the farmer.  But, in order to find the money for these consumer subsidies, the Minister is taking money that was originally voted for the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to take part in this very intellectual debate between gentlemen who are financial wizards in their own particular sphere.  I listened with interest to Deputy Lemass.  Whatever points he made, undoubtedly, he presented them in a very proper manner, although, to my mind, some of them were not correct. Perhaps my mind may be wrong. <Col N="1755" /> In any case, it was a pleasure to listen to Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Davin followed and gave very interesting facts and figures.  Deputy Cogan started off with wheat and then went along to potatoes.  I do not know if he mentioned exports.  He did mention Dick Barton and Hopalong Cassidy.  I was wondering if he would mention Superman, because he is not a bad replica of Superman himself.  He blew in a window some time ago and he saved a Baltinglass lady.  Superman did that a couple of weeks ago in the <i>Sunday Press.</i></P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister, again, to what extent profits have been made by the miller bakers.  It is a fact that the miller bakers of Dublin can sell bread in Athy cheaper than they can sell it in the City of Dublin.  That is a most amazing revelation. They can carry bread in their very nicely set out vans and sell it in Athy at ½d. a loaf cheaper than they can sell it in Dublin.  I am subject to correction as to the price but I do know that they can sell it cheaper in Athy than in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There must be something wrong as far as the subsidies going to these particular elements are concerned.  Irrespective of what commissions we set up, I have an idea that the sooner we set up a Gestapo of some kind or another here to investigate these particular boys, as Deputy Corry is so anxious to call some people at times&mdash; I think he puts an &ldquo;o&rdquo; to it and makes them boyos&mdash;the better will it be for everybody.  It would be a good job for the finances of the State and for the taxpayers generally.</P>
      <P>We have a certain commission going all through the country at the moment with regard to wheat.  If my opinion were asked, irrespective of what my colleagues would think of me&mdash;and I am a farmer, too&mdash;I would say that wheat is not a bad proposition at the moment.  I think if the people who are advocating a particular line and creating this agitation would give their honest opinion, they would say the very same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparisons have been drawn between <Col N="1756" /> imported wheat and our own wheat.  I do not want to draw any unfavourable comparison, but facts are facts.  Nobody can gainsay that before imported wheat goes to the rollers it must be sprinkled, whereas our own wheat must be kiln dried.  There is a difference in that way, there is a reduction, and perhaps that reduction may more than equate the difference in price between the foreign and the Irish wheat.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subsidies for feeding stuffs, I fail to see why there should be any such thing as a subsidy for feeding stuffs.  We have the land and the machinery and we still have the horses.  There were some people who laughed and jeered at the Minister for advocating machinery at one time.  They have it themselves now and they speak very highly of it.  We have the ground and the seed and why not grow our own feeding stuffs?  Why be dependent on the Argentine, or wherever we get the maize from, when we can grow barley and oats in this country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we grew it we could not get a price for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why did you not feed it to your own stock?  Apparently your national outlook is this, that if you can get foreign foodstuffs at a cheap price you will forgo the growing of your own native stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Cogan is not too susceptible to taking advice from any Minister.  To my mind, he forms very strong opinions of his own, and rightly or wrongly, he stands by them&mdash;I must say that for him.  I fail to see why any subsidy should be paid for imported feeding stuffs inasmuch as we have here a certain amount of arable land, and there is a particular variety of barely which I have known to be grown on land where, before this, barley would not stand up at all.  I cannot give you the average yield to the acre, but I believe it is very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> Surely Deputy Cogan will agree that a barely and oats mixture, with potatoes, is very good food for pigs, and for cattle also.  The sooner this House and the particular community who are exploited here night after night realise that the cutting of the loaf is in their own hands, the better it will be for themselves and for the taxpayers.  As regards maize&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I remember a famous guerilla leader in Cork who said that the war started with hurleys, but he thought it would finish with fountain pens.

The Minister has quoted those figures repeatedly in the House.  It has been specifically stated as regards those costings, the figures given by Professor Murphy, that no account was taken, in giving those figures, of interest on capital or management charges or expenses.  Further, those were the costings in 1946, which is a pretty long time ago, nearly as long ago as the days of Brian Boru&mdash;a favourite saying of the Minister.  Since then the Minister has boasted in this House that he has increased the cost to farmers.</P>

It would pay the State to have the Danish Minister for Agriculture, if we have butter to sell abroad, to sell that butter for us and to give him a decent commission out of the 98/- per cwt.  I am sorry the Minister has departed but when the Minister spoke here of Brian Boru so often lately I began to wonder if all this talk of Brian Boru had any connection with the Danish butter which he is importing now.

      <P>I am answering something he said in the House last Thursday when he told us that there was never so much butter consumed in this country since the days of Brian Boru. He has told us that on a number of occasions.  Bearing in mind all the questions that were asked in connection with this Danish butter and the complaints made by these people with the nice taste in Dublin, about whom Deputy Byrne and other Deputies were so troubled, the explanation occurs to me that, like a good general, Brian Boru kept his quartermasters' stores in his own tent at the battle of Clontarf, and when he was killed by Broder, Broder collared this parcel of butter and took it off to Denmark with him and it has been in cold storage there ever since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, with the customary readiness of this Government to pay every robber willing to hand back to <Col N="1760" /> us something stolen from us in former years, the Minister went off and paid the Danes for butter that was stolen from Brian Boru in Clontarf and brought it back here to tickle the tasteful palates of the people of Dublin. That is the only way to explain the purchase of this Danish butter, because mind you, the Danes sold, for the first six months of 1950, 281,000 cwt. of butter on the continental market.  The price ranged from 489/- per cwt. paid by the American forces, in occupation of Germany, down to 414/- per cwt. paid by the German people.  He got 463/- per cwt. in France and he sold altogether 281,000 cwt. at an average price of 438/- per cwt.  Our Minister went over, I might suggest dishonestly, carrying out the bluff that he had endeavoured to work on the farmers of this country, when he sold butter to Britain at £13 8s. 2d. per cwt. He sold 810 cwt. in 1950 and then came along to the Irish farmer and said: &ldquo;I have increased your cost of production by something between 25 per cent. and 33 per cent. and now I ask you to take 2d. per gallon less for your milk, because I may have a surplus of butter and I must sell that surplus on the British market where the price offered is 271/- per cwt.&rdquo;  He tried on that bluff and circularised every co-operative creamery in the country asking them to say were they prepared to do it on a five-year plan.  Three creameries, according to replies which he gave in this House, said they would, on conditions. The Minister refused to tell us the conditions but he failed in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He still wanted to persuade the Irish farmers that there was a surplus of butter there.  Deputy Lehane asked two questions here on the 29th March last.  He asked the Taoiseach if he would state the total amount of creamery butter produced in this country and he was told 687,512 cwt. He then asked the then Minister for Industry and Commerce what was the total quantity of butter required to give an 8 oz. ration in this country and he was told 700,000 cwt. so that there was not sufficient produced to give even a ration to all the people. Yet the Minister in order to carry out his bluff, sold our butter abroad for a <Col N="1761" /> price of £17 odd per cwt.  Then he went off and bought the butter about which I told you and which the Danes robbed us of at Clontarf.  He bought that back from the Danes and paid them £18 16s. 0d. for it.  He is a good salesman.</P>
    <P>We are paying now for that transaction in this butter subsidy.  I warned the Minister here 12 months ago and two years ago that he had killed grain growing in this country, that he had done his damnedest to kill beet growing in this country and that all that was left was the old cow, and that if he carried on the game he was playing the old cow was going the way of the wheat, the peat, and the beet&mdash;&ldquo;God speed the day,&rdquo; as he told us then.</P>
    <P>That was his attitude.  Deputies in all Parties in this House with the exception of my beloved friend Deputy Dunne, have made appeals to the Minister to bring the price of milk up to the cost of production for people sending their milk to the creameries. If we were to pay 10 per cent.  commission to the Danish Minister for Agriculture, hand over our butter to him and tell him to sell it for us at the price which he got for it on the Continent, we could pay from 1/5 to 1/6 per gallon for every gallon of milk that we send to the creameries in this country.  The Minister for External Affairs is madly anxious looking for export markets.  There is an idea for him.  I am sure our ambassadors in those continental countries could sell our produce, as well as the Danish Minister for Agriculture, and could get that price for it.  My point is that the subsidy is not half enough.  If we are going to subsidise the consumers of this country to eat farmers' butter, why will they not pay the cost of production for it, and where is the idea of keeping three-quarters of our population as abject slaves?  Deputy Dunne complains, in one way, about their wages, and I am complaining generally about their condition&mdash;of both the employer and the farm labourer.  They have been brought to that condition by that bull-headed Minister over there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now going outside the Supplementary <Col N="1762" /> Estimate.  The condition of the farm labourer does not arise under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, and I do not intend to go into it.  I am speaking of this additional subsidy of £500,000. That sum of money cannot be found on the side of the road.  If I knew where it was, and could find it, I would be very glad of it.  But there is a half a million of money involved in this matter alone.  I can see no justification whatever for the Minister's attitude on this.  He has not one leg to stand on on any side of the fence, except dishonesty and falsehood.</P>
      <P>There is a sub-head dealing with agricultural schools and farms.  We have a whole list of them here.  Figures are given with regard to the general expenses of management of these farms.  The general expense of managing our farm at Athenry is £6,200; for the farm at Ballyhaise, it is £2,800; for the farm at Clonakilty the figure is £2,850; the general expenses of managing Johnstown Castle are £2,000, and the figure for the Munster Institute is £4,800.  Might I suggest to the Minister that he should add these figures to his price of 8½d. for milk and see where he will come out.  I suppose the old farmer does not want anything to eat, that he can live in the nude, that he does not want anything for managing his farm, and he is clothed by the Minister, I suppose.  I suggest that three of these farms be picked out by the Minister. Let him then put in a stock of those famous cows that he has, and give us the cost of the production of a gallon of milk on any one of these farms over a 12 months' period.  I ask him to do that himself.  Let him try out that game at our expense, or at the expense of the general taxpayer.  When he has done that, he need not look for the figures which the County Cork farmers got from Professor Murphy in University College, Cork.  I guarantee to him that the figures he will get will be an eye-opener for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows well that, from May to October, the cost of the production of a gallon of milk at University College, Cork, was 1/3½ per gallon. Despite that, he got up here, with his tongue in his cheek, and talked about 8½d. per gallon.  The Minister has <Col N="1763" /> before him definite knowledge that the price our butter could be sold for on the Continent is 438/- per cwt., and that that price allows 1/5 to 1/6 per gallon for milk.  He is aware, from the costs of production before him, that the cost of the production of that milk in one of his great subsidised concerns is 1/3½ per gallon.  I have not before me the famous figures which were quoted here of the cost of production in Grangegorman, but I am sure the Minister will have a more intimate association with that place later on.</P>

      <P>It would be enlightening if we could be told if they made that profit, based on the price and on the costs of the production of a gallon of milk as given in this House.  There is also, in this Supplementary Estimate, a grant of £4,000 for the faculty of dairy science in University College, Cork.  I am demanding that, in return for this sum of £4,000 which we are paying to the faculty of dairy science, they give us the cost of production per gallon of milk on the university farm in Cork.  I think that is fair enough&mdash;and that it be placed on the Table of the House for the information of Deputies.</P>

I am not prepared to agree to give the Minister something like £6,200 for managing a farm in Athenry, County Galway.  If that was put on to the cost of production of farm produce, what would farm produce rise to?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Deputy Cowan, with his wide knowledge of agriculture, will enlighten us on the accuracy of these statements.  I should love to hear him.  I admit that this gentleman is provided with a motorcar and I suppose he gets travelling expenses whenever he goes down to buy Deputy Halliden's bull or to Kerry to buy some of the Minister's Kerry cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-head I (1), which contains a provision in respect of the purchase of heifers, the Minister said, in respect of the farm at Grange last year, he did what I am sure Deputy Dunne fully and absolutely approves of, that is, he turned it into a ranch for bullocks.  He reared bullocks, he said, last year on the Grange farm, and he is now embarking on a programme <Col N="1765" />&ldquo;for the elimination from the dairy herds of the country of uneconomic cows.&rdquo;  He tells us also that he is going to have 800 heifers on the Grange farm.  I think there are 632,000 milch cows in the country, and, according to his own figures, given in the course of attacks on Deputy O'Reilly and other farmer Deputies who spoke about the low yield of milk, the cow under 500 or 600 gallons is an uneconomic cow, so that all the cows of under 500 gallons are to be cleared out and all the farmers with cows under 500 gallons are to make for the Grange, Abbotstown and Clonakilty farms. They are all going to be inseminated and are all going to be in-calf and, when a farmer wants to get rid of one cow, all he has to do is to go down to Grange or Clonakilty and bring back by the horns one of the Minister's inseminated in-calf heifers that will milk 900 gallons at the first lactation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; he will get it for nothing.  I wonder at what period in our future history this scheme will be put into operation.  Are these 800 heifers calved yet?  Are they already in &ldquo;suckies&rdquo; anywhere in this land of ours, waiting to be picked up by the Minister?  He surely will not inseminate them this year&mdash;he will have to wait a little&mdash;so that the earliest period at which this proposal of the Minister's can come into operation is about 1955 or 1956.  There will be somebody else taking care of the Minister then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wandered widely over all this range of subjects, but I should like to get from him some statement with regard to these enormous sums set down here as food subsidies on flour and wheaten meal.  Statements were made here that, after drying Irish wheat, the price of it was £28 17s. delivered at the mill.  We cannot find out at present what the price of imported wheat is, it is covered over so cutely with subsidies of all description, but roughly it is £33.  That means that we are paying the foreigner an extra 100/- for every ton of wheat he sends to this country.  We are paying the foreigner £5 more than we are <Col N="1766" /> prepared to pay our own farmer to produce wheat in this country.</P>
    <P>Last week a very illuminating position was brought out as regards the sugar crop.  There is no justification whatsoever for coming to the taxpayers of this country and asking them to pay more to the farmers of any other country for our essentials than we are prepared to pay our own farmers&mdash;and I respectfully suggest that wheat is definitely one of our essentials.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Defence is present in the House at the moment because what I have to say now has a very direct bearing on his particular Department.  When the Minister for Defence spends public money on the Army he sees to it that that money is well spent and that the Army is suitably equipped to make it a decent mobile fighting force.  I am sure the Minister for Defence would not agree that that Army should find itself in the position that it would have to be sold by this Government to act for some foreign country in order that Deputy Cowan might be fed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Wheat has largely been an insurance policy with the people of this country&mdash;a policy under which we were always able to say: &ldquo;Well, at any rate, we shall be able to feed the people.&rdquo;  On that principle, we paid a higher price between 1932 and 1939 for wheat produced in this country than we would have had to pay for imported wheat.  At the moment wheat is the cheapest grain produced in this country.  To-day, the price of oats is somewhere around 40/- per cwt.: the price of barley is somewhere around 36/- &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the price of wheat is 25/-.  We must keep these prices in mind now because the Minister for Agriculture is asking this House for a further £1,165,000 which will be paid not to our own farmers for growing wheat for us but to the foreigners.  I remember the very happy <Col N="1767" /> statements we heard from these benches in 1939 and 1940: &ldquo;Ah, all the wheat you require will be brought in in American bottoms.&rdquo;</P>

Is there any justification for a Minister for Agriculture to come to this House and look for that sum of money while, at the same time and in so far as he can do so, he is preventing the growing of wheat in this country by our own farmers?  If an extra sum of £1,000,000 is to be taken from the taxpayers of this country, why should it not be given to our own farmers?  What is the objection to doing so?  Why should we hand over the whole of that sum of money to the foreigner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not ex ceeding £252,623 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1951, for the Defence Forces (including certain grants-in-aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts and for certain <Col N="1768" /> administrative expenses in connection therewith; for certain expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for expenses in connection with the issue of medals, etc.; for expenses of the Bureau of Military History, and for a grant-in-aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    <P>The main reasons necessitating the introduction of this Suppementary Estimate for the Defence Vote are the purchase of reserve stores and the expansion of the regular administrative and training personnel attached to the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>The stores which we are purchasing for the purpose of creating reserve stocks in case of an emergency consist of drugs, dressings, spare parts for mechanical transport, petrol and oils, clothing, fuel and maintenance stores for the Naval Service.  The total cost of these reserve stores is approximately £337,500.</P>
    <P>The second reason for the Estimate is the expansion of the training and administrative cadres of regular personel attached to the F.C.A.  This cadre has practically been trebled and now consists of about 138 officers and 444 other ranks, and the extra cost in allowances for the present financial year will be approximately £5,000. There has also been introduced during the past year a system of gratuities or bounties for members of the F.C.A. attending for 14 days' annual training. These gratuities are £6 for privates, £8 for N.C.O.s, £10 for officers and £15 for officers commanding units.  This has cost to date about £38,000, but as the expenditure has been met by savings on the relevant sub-head, it is not reflected in the present Estimate.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the usual rules governing Supplementary Estimates of this kind, advantage has been taken of the occasion of its introduction to provide for excesses of any relative magnitude on other sub-heads of the Vote.  Thus, there is an excess of <Col N="1769" /> £5,000 under sub-head A (1) owing to delay in the presentation of accounts, an excess of £1,000 under sub-head X in respect of advertisements, and of £3,500 under sub-head X (2) owing to increased charges for hospital treatment in respect of soldiers' dependents. Moreover under sub-head J is included a sum of £9,800 for vehicles which were not delivered during the year 1949-50 and for which provision was made in that year.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary can, therefore, be briefly summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>This excess is, however, offset by savings on other sub-heads of the Vote to the extent of £109,177.  These savings are due almost exclusively to warlike stores ordered but, despite every effort, not delivered during the financial year and, therefore, the net amount asked for is thus reduced to £252,623.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that this sum of upwards of £250,000 is due in the main to the rising cost of the various articles mentioned in the sub-heads. It is a pity that of this very large sum practically nothing is earmarked for the purpose of making the Defence Forces more effective from the points of view expressed from time to time on these benches.</P>
      <P>I presume that sub-head F dealing with medicines and instruments is a purely Army item and that it has no relation to civil defence requirements. On this side of the House we have spoken of the necessity of providing these requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head G is caused to a very great extent by the upward trend in the cost of living.  The additional sum in this sub-head is required for subsistence allowances of extra officers and other ranks appointed for duty with the <Col N="1770" /> F.C.A.  I would like the Minister to tell us in his reply if that branch of the Defence Forces has expanded to such a degree that extra officers and men are required.  It is of some importance that we should know that.</P>
    <P>The other sub-heads, J, L, M, and P (2) appear to me to deal mainly with what might be described as stockpiling and in that I think the Minister is correct.  I would even suggest that he would deal more vigorously still with that question.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to deal with sub-head X which covers the additional sum required for advertisements for recruiting.  I think that the Minister's predecessor stated in the House that he regretted that that particular campaign was a failure.  He had to admit that the result did not justify the means but this sum of £1,000 would appear to me to be a miserly amount with which to endeavour to secure recruits.  These recruits I understand were required to augment the Reserve, not for the Regular Forces. That is something which could have been made very attractive but £1,000 would not go very far to meet the high cost of advertising.  I would ask the Minister now that he is starting off as Minister for Defence to re-examine that particular situation and see if sub-head X could not be added to, perhaps from some other sub-heads.</P>
    <P>I regret to have heard the Minister state&mdash;I can understand the difficulties &mdash;that most of these savings come from the Vote for Warlike Stores.  It is regrettable that that is so.  I can understand the difficulties that confront the Minister in attempting to secure these stores.  I hope, nevertheless, he will continue his activities in trying to add to what we have at the present time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would be glad if the Minister would let us know the actual position in regard to the recent campaign to secure recruits&mdash;has it been brought to a conclusion and is no further effort being made to secure them, either for the Reserve or for the Regular Army?</P>

Naturally, the debate on this particular Estimate is limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as we have the opportunity on the main Estimate of dealing with it, there is very little purpose to be served by endeavouring to speak on this particular and very limited Estimate.  Deputy Traynor has said that perhaps the main expenses covered by this are due to a rise in the cost of living and in the cost of materials, and to that extent the additional Estimate&mdash;although it is a substantial sum&mdash;does not provide for that improvement in the Defence Forces that we should wish to see.</P>
      <P>Deputy Traynor mentioned this sum for advertisements.  Of course, there is only one advertisement that is of any effective purpose as far as an army is concerned, and that is the advertisement that brings the young men into the Army.  What brings them in is attractive conditions and good pay.  The best way the Minister could spend any sum available for advertisements is by increasing the pay of the soldiers, the N.C.O.s and the young officers.  No amount of money spent on newspaper publicity or on propaganda in the cinemas, or even by ceremonial parades or band tours, will attract the young boy, but one thing will attract him&mdash;good pay and good conditions of service.</P>

      <P>I know £1,000 would not go far, but if it were saved on that particular sub-head and if the idea I have&mdash;which I am sure is the Minister's own idea&mdash;were put into practice, then there would be no necessity to have any provision for expenditure on advertisements.</P>
      <P>This term &ldquo;stockpiling&rdquo; always causes me some concern.  It is an American term, and whether it is a good one or not we have seen it used for quite a while.  What can we really stockpile?  Perhaps we could stockpile ammunition.  I do not know if we could.  Stockpiling suggests the provision of enormous quantities of a particular material in a place where you can protect it.  That presents obvious difficulties, and I do not want to see any stockpiling of that kind. What I would like to see is the provision of ammunition, the things with which soldiers fight; and I think that the right place to have a considerable quantity of these stocks is not in dumps but actually in the homes of the people.  I should like to see the F.C.A. develop in such a way that every young man in the country would be in it, that he would be fully armed and equipped, that he would have his own reserve supply of ammunition, and that the area would be so organised that mobile units could be brought into operation locally almost by the sound of a whistle.  That is the form of development that should take place and it is the form in which this stockpiling that is referred to can be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he will bring in his main Estimate very soon, that it will be one of the first Estimates <Col N="1773" /> to be brought before the House.  That will give the House a good opportunity to discuss this whole problem of defence in the world conditions of to-day.  We can then discuss whether we want a bigger or a smaller Regular Army, the type of Regular Army that we want, and whether our planning should be for peace or for war or for neutrality.  I take it that these vital and serious problems are not relevant to the discussion on this Estimate and, having the promise from the Minister that we shall have that opportunity very soon, all I can say in regard to this Supplementary Estimate is that, for the reasons advanced by the Minister, it must have the approval of the House.</P>

Now, as to sub-head F&mdash;additional sum required for the purchase of reserve stocks of drugs, dressings, etc.&mdash;I wonder would the Minister be able to tell us whether these are actually reserve stocks or whether it is a question of building up to our normal requirements the existing stocks?  I can make that clearer in this way.  Is it a question that the ordinary stocks were below the ordinary reserve we carry, that we had to add to them and that the cost is up?  As to sub-head G additional sum required for subsistance allowance&mdash;that is understandable, and I shall have an opportunity later to-night of dealing with that matter in another way.  I take it that the sum is merely the additional sum involved because of the revised rates.  As to sub-head J&mdash;Mechanical Transport&mdash;I should like to ask the Minister to give us frankly the information we ask for. The form of this is &ldquo;mainly for payment for vehicles ordered but not delivered during 1949-50, and partly for the purchase of reserve stocks.&rdquo;  Can the Minister give us any rough indication as to what proportion is for the purchase of vehicles and what proportion is for the purchase of reserve stocks.  As to the additional sum required for the purchase of reserve stocks of petrol and oils, the same question <Col N="1774" /> as I asked under sub-head F would be appropriate there.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head M&mdash;Clothing and Equipment&mdash;I would be glad to hear from the Minister if it is true, as this seems to indicate, that actually he is providing against the difficulties in the woollen market at the moment and securing additional stocks of cloth for uniforms.  If that is so, I should like him to be explicit about it.  Again, this word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; appears in sub-head P (2)&mdash;Naval Service&mdash;&ldquo;mainly for the purchase of reserve stocks of stores and equipment.&rdquo;  What is the other purpose for which it is required? Perhaps the Minister will be in a position to tell us that.  Now, again, under sub-head R&mdash;fuel, light and water in kind and fuel oils&mdash;a similar question arises.  How far is that money to be apportioned to a genuine reserve of stocks and how far is it to be apportioned to cover the increased costs of normal purchases?  These are questions the answers to which would help us very much, especially when we come to the main Estimate, of which Deputy Cowan spoke.  The question of the recruiting campaign can turn up later.</P>
      <P>There is one final question which I should like to ask the Minister.  I do not want to pin the Minister accurately to the word he used, but he said that the saving on other sub-heads was mainly on stores ordered.  I should like him to say, if he has the information available, whether stores to that amount were actually ordered or is it that a certain sum was provided in the original Estimate and his predecessor could not go even as far as ordering? These are the only matters which arise on this Estimate, but I think the Minister would help us if he could separate the matters in the way I have asked him.  In brief, it boils down to this: how much is the Supplementary Estimate conditioned by what my colleague, Deputy Traynor, called the increase in the cost of living; how much is it conditioned by increased costs; and how much does it represent the real laying in of reserve stocks over and above the normal stocks carried in regard to the articles specified on the back of the Estimate?</P>

      <P>It is quite clear <Col N="1775" /> that most of the increase in regard to stores is for reserve stock so far as we can get it and have been able to get it. Most of it is in that direction, as I said in my opening speech.  Then the subsistence allowance is costing a greater sum for the F.C.A. and so on. I think that the amount that would be due to the increased cost of living is not as much as you might expect.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I am not able to say that.  I shall have to deal with that on some other occasion. The F.C.A. is expanding.  It is a force which should be developed to the greatest possible extent.  Anything that I can do as Minister to expand that force I will certainly do.  That has been the object of my predecessors in this Government and in the last Government. There is no doubt that they tried to build up that force.  As everybody knows, it is not easy to keep a rural force in being for a very long time, but there are various methods by which that can be achieved.  The recruiting has not been as successful as we would like it to be, but the effort will be continued.  The additional £1,000 required for advertisements for recruiting is to make good the shortage of the sum already voted.  It is not a question of spending only £1,000 upon advertising for recruits.  I do not know that there is anything I can usefully add, except to say that, as far as I can possibly do it, a revision will take place of the recruiting and I shall try to make the force as strong as possible. In regard to the stockpiling of ammunition, it should be possible to do something throughout the country. At the same time it is very hard to expect the N.C.O.s and men in the F.C.A. to carry a lot of it.  But, seeing what was done in other countries during the recent war in regard to stockpiling, I think greater use can be made of the local stores and the homes of the men for reserves.  I am grateful to Deputies for the manner in which they have received this first effort of mine in this Department and, as I <Col N="1776" /> stated, I will ask the Government to give me an opportunity of bringing the main Estimate forward as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £53,125 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The gross total of the Supplementary Estimate is £205,000.  The savings on other sub-heads amount to £151,945. The sum required is £53,125.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> The savings are made up as follows: Sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £7,000; sub-head E&mdash; Advertising and Publicity, £1,500; sub-head HH&mdash;Chicago International Trade Fair, 1950, £1,445; Food Subsidies, £140,000; sub-head S (1)&mdash;Grant for Remuneration and Expenses, Members of the Industrial Development Authority, £200,000, making a total of £151,945.</P>
    <P>Savings set out above are explained as follows:&mdash;sub-head A&mdash;unfilled staff vacancies; sub-head E&mdash;the amount of £2,500 was provided for expenditure on a &ldquo;buy Irish campaign&rdquo; but was not proceeded with; sub-head HH&mdash; the number of Irish firms which participated in the Chicago Fair was less than anticipated; J. (1)&mdash;sales of unrationed tea were greater than was anticipated with consequent relief to the subsidy to the amount indicated; sub-head S (1)&mdash;one post for members of the Industrial Development Authority for which provision was made has not-been filled; sub-head K &mdash;the original Estimate was £5 and the revised Estimate £500, as money was required in connection with the supply of 300 tons of turf to the Aran Islands in November of last year in consequence of a shortage of turf there. I can give the details of that to the Deputies if they require them, but I will not take up their time by reading the whole particulars.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L&mdash;Turf Production Schemes, the original Estimate there was for £5.  The revised estimate is £1,785, leaving a sum of £1,780 additional sum required.  Supplies of turf, produced by local authorities, were disposed of to Fuel Importers Limited, Government departments and local institutions, and were sold at the full cost of production, and no losses were incurred by the producing authorities on such sales.  Supplies of turf disposed of to merchants for distribution in the area had, however, to be sold at a price which would enable the merchants to retail the turf at the controlled price, losses on such sales being the difference between the cost of production and the actual sale price as certified by the Department of Local Government.  These will be recouped <Col N="1778" /> to the local authorities from the provision under this sub-head.  It was expected at the time of the Estimate that all losses incurred by local authorities would have been recouped before the close of the financial year 1949-50.  The Department of Local Government did not however, find it possible to complete the audit of all local authority accounts in time to enable the recoupment to be made in the year 1949-50.  Losses amounting to £1,782 1s. 2d. have now been certified by the Department of Local Government for recoupment to the local authorities mentioned hereunder: Tipperary South County Council, £33 15s. 3d.; Limerick County Council, £1,748 5s. 11d., making a total of £1,782 1s. 2d.</P>
    <P>Sub-head LL&mdash;Recoupment to county councils of losses on turf produced. Provision was made in the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote under Miscellaneous Schemes sub-head for the recoupment of losses incurred by local authorities in the sale of turf otherwise than by Fuel Importers, Limited, Government Departments and local in situtions, that is to fuel merchants, for distribution in the turf areas.  It was not possible to recover the full cost of production of the turf by fuel merchants to meet the requirements of residents in the turf area.  Such sales were made at the prices decided by the local authorities in consultation with the Bord na Móna representative in the district.  The general aim was that, having due regard to the prevailing local prices, the prices fixed should cover the production cost, but in many counties prices below production cost had to be fixed in order to avoid any incentive to seek higher prices for their turf.  The revised estimate in this case is £5,960.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (2)&mdash;Payment to Mianrai Teoranta for prospecting.  The original Estimate was for £70,000.  The extra amount required was £10,000.  Deputies will recall that it was pointed out under the Minerals Act, 1947, Mianrai Teoranta had no authority to expend money on the purchase of land and mineral rights.  It was necessary to amend sub-section (2) of Section 5 to permit the payment of money to the <Col N="1779" /> company for this purpose.  It was decided that the company should have secure title to the minerals in Avoca in order that any benefits resulting from their prospecting operations might accrue to the company and not to private interests.  The company were, accordingly, authorised under Section 3 of the Minerals Company (Amendment) Act, 1950, to purchase mineral rights in East Avoca.  The purchase was made for the sum of £10,000 although provision was made for this expenditure in the original amount of £70,000 under the sub-head.  It is unlikely that any balance will be available out of the amount to cover this expenditure by the 31st March, 1951.  Therefore, I am moving a Supplementary Estimate for this £70,000.</P>
    <P>We come now to sub-head O (2), the cost of turf production schemes hitherto undertaken by county councils.  The original Estimate was for £5.  The revised Estimate is for £140,000.  This scheme was formerly operated by county councils; it was designed to meet the fuel shortage in the eastern counties during the emergency.  From the 1st January, 1948, the operation of this scheme was taken over by Bord na Móna.  It is quite distinct from the permanent operations of the board under the Turf Development Act, 1946-1950.  The programme approved for the 1950 season provided for the production of 40,000 tons of machine turf at an estimated cost of £94,000. The actual production during the season amounted to 29,000 tons.  Expenditure on the 1950 operations is estimated at £70,000.  At 1st April, 1950, Bord na Móna had on hands approximately 38,000 tons of turf produced during the previous year.  Receipts during 1950-51 in respect of the sale of turf are expected to amount to £120,000.  In view of the serious deterioration in the coal supply position it is proposed to expand the scheme in the 1951 season to provide for the production of 110,000 tons of machine turf; expenditure on operations in respect of that season covering development works, production, equipment, spare parts for machines, etc., is estimated at £341,000.  Of this sum it is <Col N="1780" /> estimated that £70,000 will be required in the present financial year to meet expenditure on preparatory work which will be necessary in connection with the 1951 operations.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is O (3).  In the original Estimate no provision was made under this sub-head which deals with publicity in connection with turf marketing.  The revised Estimate now is for £5,000 for expenditure on publicity in connection with the turf production drive.  The next item is sub-head S (2), salaries and wages of the Industrial Development Authority. When the Estimate for 1950-51 was being prepared it was clear that the Industrial Development Authority would need additional staff to deal with the greater volume of work arising out of its activities and a sum of £5,500 was provided for that purpose.  Additional staff was made available in 1950 in connection with the administration of cotton quota Orders and to deal with an expansion of the work on the industries side.  This staff was provided by retrenchment of posts in other branches of the Department. The cost of the staff up to the end of a current financial year will amount to £7,000; that is an increase of £1,500 on the original provision for additional staff.</P>
    <P>The authority has been expanding its activities for the development of industries, etc., in accordance with its functions.  This has necessitated further increases in staff.  The cost of this further additional staff during the current financial year is £4,675.  There will, therefore, be a total excess of £6,175, that is £1,500 plus £4,675, on the Vote for the current financial year.</P>
    <P>In addition to all that, we have the Prices Advisory Body, sub-head U (1), salaries, wages and allowances.  This body was set up and commenced to function in January, 1951.  In order to discharge its functions under the Prices and Wages (Standstill) Order, 1951, the body requires an indoor and an outdoor staff.  The services of the former staff of the Prices Branch of the Department, together with some additions thereto, have been put at the disposal of that body.  In addition, provision has been made for the employment <Col N="1781" /> of not less than 50 officers on out-door duties; 25 of these officers have already been recruited and the remainder will take up duty shortly. In the meantime, assistance in enforcement is also being given by the staff of the general inspectorate, of whom there are 21 employed at present. Furthermore, any officer of customs and excise or any member of the Gardaí is an authorised officer for the purpose of the enforcement of the Order.  The cost of the personnel of the body and of the new staff for the current financial year is estimated at £6,365.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been some slight mistake in the Minister taking this Estimate now.  My information is that it was not down for discussion.  However, as it is a Supplementary Estimate and the Minister has opened it, I take it we can proceed with it.</P>
      <P>There are a number of items in the Estimate which call for some comment. The first is that the £53,125, which is the net amount of the Estimate, is quite a substantial sum and, coupled with the Minister's next Estimate, represents a very real increase on the original Estimate for 1950-51.  The Minister has dealt with a number of sub-heads.  The first that I would like to comment on is that of mineral development. If this money is to be spent on actual mineral development there can be no quarrel with it.  Perhaps the Minister would expand when he is replying on the question of compensation. Are we to understand that that sum of money represents the acquisition of titles in the Avoca area only or did I misunderstand the Minister in that regard?  Are the lands so acquired to be operated by Mianraí Teoranta or will they be reserved for any other purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operations of Bord na Móna are to be anticipated.  I note under sub-head O (2) this money is stated to be grants to Bord na Móna for the general administration of the scheme, the purchase of machines and equipment and other expenses incidental to the production, transport and storage of turf.  I wonder would the Minister take this opportunity to tell us what <Col N="1782" /> additional machinery can be acquired or is being acquired.  It is perfectly obvious now that turf production must loom large in our economy from this time out.  In fact, it is a regrettable thing that the production of turf was so little encouraged during the past three years.  I shall not take this opportunity to go back on the story, but certainly I am not exaggerating it when I say that during the past three years neither were our producers encouraged to produce turf nor were our consumers encouraged to burn it. In fact, the Party to which the Minister belongs have been noted in the past for their efforts to decry the use and the potentialities of the native fuel.  Nevertheless, necessity now compels us and, even at this hour, a change that will mean the encouragement of our people both to produce and to consume our own fuel and generally to develop this particular resource which we have will be welcome.</P>
    <P>The grant under O (3), to Bord na Móna, for publicity in connection with private production of turf and for the marketing of turf seems to me to require a little elucidation by the Minister.  By ordinary advertising standards, the sum of £5,000, unfortunately, is not a large one.  It could not buy a very large amount of publicity.  I note that under this head also is included provision for the marketing of such privately produced turf.  It is difficult to see how much can be achieved with that sum and, at this stage, I would simply content myself with asking the Minister could he give us some information as to what is envisaged under this particular head.</P>
    <P>We have to face this unfortunate fact&mdash;who is to blame or who is not to blame is a relatively secondary thing&mdash;that three years ago and before it, the Fine Gael Party, in particular, spent their time largely on a dual campaign.  That campaign was, on the one hand, aimed at disrupting and discouraging the production of turf and, on the other hand, was aimed at discouraging the consumer from burning turf.</P>
    <P>In spite of all that was tried during the emergency and the success attained <Col N="1783" /> in producing native fuel and having it burned&mdash;there were defects and there were the inevitable troubles that arose from emergency production and all the problems of an emergency&mdash;no opportunity was lost by the Minister and his Party to shout &ldquo;wet turf&rdquo;, to decry turf in the towns and the cities and to demoralise the consumer as they demoralised, or tried to demoralise, the producer.  The result is that, in face of the fact of the almost complete failure of the supplies of coal on which they pinned all their faith, and getting such supplies of coal as they do get at a very dear price, the Minister has the unhappy task of trying to undo the damage which was so irresponsibly done, with such little forethought, some years ago.  That will not be an easy task.  It will be necessary&mdash;and we must all co-operate in this task&mdash; to try to encourage in every possible way both the private producers and the public concern to develop our bogs, to produce the turf we need, not only to meet short-term shortages, that is, the shortages, say, of this year, but also to leave us relatively independent, as independent as we can possibly be, of foreign supplies of fuel, for domestic purposes at any time.  That is a task which, as I say, will require considerable energy and the co-operation of the whole community.</P>
    <P>It would be expanding this debate too far to go into the details of that matter.  It is to be hoped that Bord na Móna and the small producers will get all the intelligent support and encouragement, both from the Government and from all other public persons, that they require for the prosecution of this important national task.  In addition to that, the damage which was done to the morale of the consumer must be repaired.  The problems, for instance, of the burner of domestic fuel in our towns and cities must be considered.  We knew from the last emergency that there were problems that, when things were easier, would have to be reconsidered and readjusted. In the city, for instance, there is the problem of storage in flats; there is the problem of the delivery of turf in good condition; there is the problem of inducing the consumer to <Col N="1784" /> use the fuel to the best advantage, and so forth.  All that will require attention.</P>
    <P>Then there will be the question of relieving the load on the central bodies by encouraging the private production of turf.  I take it that is what is involved in this heading O (3).  During the emergency, not only were the local authorities, Bord na Móna itself and all these other bodies, encouraged to develop the bogs and supply the turf, but the private producer, wherever he could produce turf, was encouraged.  It even went to the lengths of encouraging people in the City of Dublin to take turf banks and to cut them, and so forth, all these things contributing to relieving the strain on the distribution machine.  All these things will have to be examined again.  All these things will have to be co-ordinated in the light of the latest information, with realistic relation to the facts as they are and with a view to a real economy in our resources.</P>
    <P>That all means governmental drive, governmental lead, and governmental co-ordination.  I must say, frankly, that the balance in this Estimate does not indicate, so far, a comprehensive approach to that matter.  On the other hand, I freely concede to the Minister that, as I take it, this is merely to carry us to the end of this financial year and that provisions will be made in the next financial year.  Perhaps I have overstrained the inference to be drawn from the sum, as I see it here.  Now, so much for the production of turf.  It is urgent, with the price of coal as it is, apart from its scarcity. From the point of view of building up coal stocks from such coal as we can get in, it is urgent.  These are all matters that, I am sure, the Department will be quite capable of handling with credit, as the Minister's Department handled it in the past, given an effective lead and with a drive behind it.</P>
    <P>Passing on to the Industrial Development Authority, I see there is an additional sum required for salaries, wages and allowances.  Perhaps I was a bit slow on the uptake when I was listening to the Minister, but I was not clear whether that represents additional <Col N="1785" /> staff or an increase in allowances.</P>

      <P>Later perhaps the Minister might tell me how much of this is new staff.  The point is that this authority is expanding, but we have very meagre information as to what it is actually achieving.  I do not want to go outside the debate, but there is one rather important matter which I have tried to press on the Minister's predecessor.  It is the importance of filling before it is too late to make the effort, a very important gap in our industrial structure, our national supply structure.  I have in mind the making of certain basically chemical substances here, substances for which we are completely dependent on outsiders.  If the supplies of such chemicals were cut off, it would mean a serious embarrassment and dislocation in time of isolation or partial isolation.</P>
      <P>I have been told for at least a year that that is a matter that the Industrial Development Authority was considering. The Minister's predecessor, more than a year ago, assured me they were considering it, and doing so sympathetically. I know that certain reports, certain technical reports, were furnished before that authority was set up, and much of the technical aspect of this problem was examined. I renewed the question last Christmas, and was told that they were still considering it.  I regret to say the Parliamentary Secretary interjected a remark, at the end of the supplementary questions, which was rather disquieting. He said he did not expect such a project could be continued during a time of emergency, but I take it his remark had no deeper significance than merely his own opinion.  I renewed the question recently, and the matter apparently is still under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> The point is that if this authority is in any way to justify itself&mdash;many of us believed it was not the type of body suitable for the purpose for which it was designed&mdash;it is important that it should be in a position quickly to decide on various matters.  Speedy decision is paramount in the present circumstances, when there is a growing shortage of plant and material for every purpose.  It will be very little use to have a relatively perfect system and find that you cannot get the steel, the structural materials, the particular type of plant you require when you are ready to go ahead.  There is that emergency element in our problem even at the moment, and this body should be alive to it.  It would be better to do something and get a partial result rather than risk a total failure in performance at a later date.</P>
    <P>We have had our lesson from the past.  A somewhat similar project was considered before the 1939 war.  In fact, the Minister's Department and the Department of Agriculture were involved&mdash;I am not quite sure about the Department of Agriculture&mdash;and they had got to the stage of placing a contract on the Continent when there was still time to get the plant purchased and erected here.  The crisis of 1938, followed by events in 1939, completely nullified this project and we had to weather through the emergency with that very serious gap.  The Minister must know how fortunate we were in the matter of supplies during the last emergency.  He must be aware of the respite we got and how it would be really tempting Providence to hope for the same performance again if those circumstances were to repeat themselves even in the face of a threatened shortage and apart from the situation degenerating into hostilities. That is the lesson we should take to heart.</P>
    <P>The Minister can also consult the Bureau of Standards and Research; he can communicate with the officers and other personnel associated with it and he will learn the story of the desperate efforts made to meet shortages along the line of country I am following.</P>

I can say without bias, prejudice or malice, and in perfect fairness, that we have not had from any Minister information which will constitute an incontrovertible justification of this authority to-day. There is this particular field, apart from others, in which there are possibilities.  In voting this sum for this authority, I must ask the Minister to use all his power and energy to spur it on and to make the urgency of the matter clear.  The Government should be alert to see that practical results are achieved as speedily as possible. Passing a Bill here, setting up bodies, carrying on inquiries, arranging organisations and doing a lot of paper work, even the doing of preliminary experimental work, is relatively of no account unless there is some physical project there that will deliver the goods when they are required.</P>
      <P>I will pass now to salaries, wages and allowances for the Prices Advisory Body.  The office is going to cost us £6,365.  This covers salaries, wages and allowances and it does not cover any other expenses which are provided for under sub-head U (2), where we have travelling and incidental expenses. This figure, I should imagine, will not cover completely all the expense that this body will be to the State.  As I understand it, this body will have to carry out inquiries and will make certain demands on the Minister's and other Departments which, when translated into the language of the Minister for Finance, do not appear in this Estimate and, therefore, it is quite obvious that on the face of this Estimate this new Prices Body is going to cost practically £9,000.  I think it would be a very conservative estimate, when you take these other matters which are hidden or concealed, if I say that this Prices Body will take £10,000.  Lest the Minister will dispute that figure, let me say that the one in the Estimate is £8,665, or practically £9,000, up to the end of this financial year&mdash;that is, up to the 31st March.  It is very impertinent to inquire what we are going to do with this body.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Collins for the correction.  I know Deputies who would say that it is indeed impertinent of the Government, in all the circumstances, to impose this body on the public, because here is its history.  Let us be quite clear as to what we are going to pay before the end of the financial year.  We are going to pay £8,600 odd for this body with the promise of further costs in the year to come.  That is a fairly big sum for a Supplementary Estimate and it is relevant to inquire what we are paying that sum for.  We are paying it for a body with this history.  For the moment I am dealing with it completely impersonally, without the slightest reflection on its personnel. A Supplies and Services Bill was introduced into this Dáil.  It was a continuation Act and there was nothing said about it.  Quite quickly, just before the Bill was due to come before the House, the first Bill was withdrawn and a new Bill was introduced with this clause setting up the body. It was pointed out at the time that it would not be effective.  It was obviously one of those sops to the Labour Party, one of those concessions by Fine Gael to the Labour Party, which have become so commonplace now as to pass without remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on that Bill the Government panicked on the question of prices and declared a price freeze, as from an unspecified date at that time.  Later, a price freeze was declared as from the 2nd December.  We were given to understand that all prices would be frozen as from 2nd December and that this body would deal with the matter.  What has this body functioned as so far?  So far as we can see, this body can be characterised as the prices defreezing body, because we have had a succession of exemptions from the price freeze.  We have had, during the last week, a list of a considerable number of commodities which were exempted from the <Col N="1789" /> price freeze.  We had another list some days ago.  I think it included woollen goods, footwear, and so forth. There was then an increase in prices. Now I take it these various increases, which run completely counter to the Tánaiste's statement, were done under and by the authority of this body.  At least I hope that no Government would come in and appoint a body which is doing nothing.  Since this defreezing of prices appears to be their proper function, I take it that I am doing them no injustice in attributing to them the exemption of various commodities from the original standstill that was declared for 2nd December last.  That is what we are voting this money for.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living index has been recently issued for February.  One would have expected, in the normal course of events, that February would have been one of the good months. Look at the series in the <i>Trade Journal</i> and you will find that February should be a relatively good month.  One would not have been surprised, therefore, if the figure for February had been the same as the figure for November, notwithstanding the increase in prices since.  However, we do find that the February figure is up.  It is 103, I understand, now, and the clothing index is very much up. This being all related to the appointment of this Prices Body, leads one very much to ask whether this body is worth nearly £9,000.  As I said, I would be willing to hazard the guess that it is really costing more than £10,000.  Why are we paying this money for this body when the Department itself, during the emergency years, could exercise more effective control without the help of any such extraneous body?  Why is it necessary to vote this sum of money for this advisory body, as it is called, when, during the period of the emergency, from November, 1943, until February, 1946, the Department itself, with its efficient officers and its efficient staff, were capable of keeping prices relatively steady?  I do not want to enlarge this debate into one on the question of the cost of living but, as we know, there is a very serious and difficult problem involved in this whole <Col N="1790" /> matter.  It is not a problem that any Government can solve by the toss of a coin.  It is a problem which, as many Deputies on the opposite side are beginning to realise, nowadays is conditioned to a great extent by matters outside the control of the Government of this country.  I am warranted in saying that this body does not seem likely to do anything effective to counteract that trend and that it is very questionable, indeed, whether the spending of this sum of money is justified in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Vivion de Valera, I do not think that the sum provided in these Supplementary Estimates for the financing of the Industrial Development Authority and the Prices Advisory Body are justified. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce came before this House with a proposal to set up this Industrial Development Authority I, with <Col N="1792" /> many others, pointed out that it was just another attempt to try and persuade the people that something spectacular was being done to promote the establishment of industries here. I think that since that Industrial Development Authority was set up we have not got any indication from the Minister concerned as to what activities they have been engaged in.  I, like the speaker who has preceded me, believe that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would get better advice from the experienced officials of his Department.  That has already been touched upon by Deputy Vivion de Valera, and I do not want to traverse the same ground.</P>
      <P>Now, as regards the Prices Advisory Body, unfortunately that, too, has been a disappointment so far.  If we are to take what has happened within the past few weeks as an indication of the usefulness of that body, I am afraid it will serve no useful purpose whatever, because we have seen that over 60 articles have been removed from price control within the past couple of weeks.  Now, where is the Prices Advisory Body?  In other words, it appears to me that the force of economic circumstances will drive up prices here and that the Minister, or his Prices Advisory Body, can do nothing about it.  I, too, cannot understand why a judge of the Supreme Court was appointed chairman.</P>

      <P>I was about to point out that the £6,365 does not represent the total expenditure involved in the setting up of this Prices Advisory Body, and at that I will leave it.  I have to come back to turf.  I am glad to see that the members of the present Government are becoming turf-minded at last, but again it is the force of circumstances which has driven them to take up that attitude.  We on this side of the House&mdash;just as we did when we were on the other side of the House&mdash;have always advocated the production of as much of our own turf as possible, and if our advice and our deeds had been accepted by the people opposite, the position would not be as bad as it is to-day.</P>
      <P>I wonder did I hear the Minister correctly when he said that 38,000 tons of turf were sold for £20,000.  I should like to know if that figure is correct. That would seem to have been an extraordinary deal.  In other words, turf was sold for something like 11/- per ton, while the price that turf is fetching to-day is something approaching £4 a ton.  I do not think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a very good move when he ordered that turf to be sold at 11/- per ton.  Perhaps I did not get the figure properly from the Minister.  I have always been trying to advocate the use of turf in our public institutions. From time to time, I have put down questions inquiring of the appropriate Minister how many institutions in the country were using native fuel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an item in the Supplementary Estimate of £5,000 for publicity.  I do not know exactly what <Col N="1794" /> kind of publicity the Minister and his Department intend to carry on.  Are they going to put up posters all over the country telling people to produce turf for their own requirements and more?  I think the best way to push the production of hand-won turf is to get the parish councils working to as great an extent as possible, and, where parish councils have not been functioning up to the present, it should be possible to establish such councils for the specific purpose of getting them to contact the farmers who have turbary and of making sure that the maximum amount of turf is produced in every parish.  That would be much better and much more effective than ordinary publicity.  It is a matter which the Minister and his Department should consider very carefully.  I should like to know from the Minister to what extent machines will be used on the bogs this year.  I know that several machines were working on the bogs of Kerry and that they were taken away&mdash;where, I do not know. It is wrong, in places where turf abounds, to take away the machinery and to expect the workers engaged in turf production in these areas to go to places like Kildare to do the same work.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of a guaranteed price for turf.  The Government have been asked to fix a guaranteed price for turf and I understand that they have said that they do not propose to do so.  I think they would be well advised to reconsider the matter, because there are many people who would not be prepared to face the uncertainty of the turf market, having regard to the disappointment which some of them suffered over the past few years.  A good many people who had lorries had to sell them because there was not a remunerative price, after the change of Government, for their turf, and I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the question of fixing a guaranteed price now.</P>

This is really the first time we have had any opportunity of discussing it, with any degree of experience <Col N="1795" /> of its working.  I refer to the Prices Advisory Body.  The setting up of that body is the logical outcome of outpourings by all the members of all the different groups who have welded themselves into the Coalition Government. These had to be translated into something, but it at least has proved to the community, to every section of the community, that all these outpourings were purely political outpourings in the shape of attacks on industrialists without any foundation whatever.</P>

It has proved to the public conclusively that these people used the situation, without any regard to the facts, purely for the purpose of getting themselves into office and have now translated their combined lack of wisdom on the matter into the setting up of this body.</P>
      <P>One would have imagined when the Tánaiste made the announcement in this House that this body was to be set up in order to protect the public and check racketeers, that he at least would have had some evidence to go on and that the Government would have considered it in a proper way, instead of which the public are now satisfied that it was an attempt again to confuse them.  Unfortunately for the Government, the bomb exploded before it reached the target and the splinters are affecting the members of all the Coalition groups.</P>

      <P>The date was set as December 2nd&mdash;a great date that would be remembered in the history of this country and quoted some 1,000 years from now by some Minister for Agriculture who probably had forgotten about Brian Boru&mdash;for the coming into effect of the price freeze Order and the saving of the community from the racketeers of the business world.  What happened? Practically every commodity was put on the price freeze list and <Col N="1796" /> to-day practically every commodity which is not in fact controlled by a maximum price Order has been unfrozen and in respect of the few commodities which came before this body for consideration, price increases were permitted.</P>
      <P>We have a figure here in this Supplementary Estimate which is not a true figure, and I want to say to the Minister that, while the figure shown here covers salaries, wages and, certain incidental expenses, it does not cover the cost, which I estimate to be at least £6,000, of the setting up and furnishing of the offices into which this body has been put.  It will probably appear in the Board of Works Estimate, but people who have been up there know that a whole section of Griffith Barracks was placed at the disposal of this body, that alterations were made and furniture brought in, and that the names of the various members of the court were painted on the doors, and, so far as I can judge, a figure of some £6,000 will have to be added to this amount to get the exact picture.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can say whether it is or not.  It will be a figure decided on by the Board of Works and not an outside body or firm which might be making a few shillings on the work.  The life of this body has been very short up to the present.  If the remaining few items that are still frozen are dealt with in the course of the next few months, or are unfrozen within the next few months, are we to take it that this body will continue or are we to take it that it will cease to exist?  Some people who expected relief in prices and other people who were interfered with in their ordinary business activities now say that this is so much political smoke and window-dressing and that bears no relation to the facts.  But the damage has been done.  We are not now worrying about the prices of articles: we are worrying about the materials and essential goods which are needed by the people of this country.  By the creation of this Prices Advisory Body, business concerns, who had the responsibility of having a continuous <Col N="1797" /> supply of essential raw materials coming into this country, had to stop buying.  Why?  They had to stop buying because the world situation was such that raw material prices were continually on the increase and because they would have to pay more for raw materials than they would be allowed to charge for these materials on the basis of the price list of 2nd December last.  In all my experience in commercial and in political life, I have never seen such an exhibition and proof of irresponsibility and such complete disregard for the welfare of the community.</P>
      <P>At Question Time to-day we heard the Minister for Health, in reply to a question, say that he is seeking certain essential supplies for all public institutions.  How many of these materials can be obtained at any price? Like Deputy Major de Valera, I am not casting any reflection on the personnel of this body which is called the Prices Advisory Body.  That body has been established to do a job and the personnel of that body are not responsible for all the pronouncements and announcements that have been made. When Deputy A. Byrne asked the Tánaiste how many articles were going to be frozen the Tánaiste replied that he could sit up all night to count them. It appears to me that the personnel of the Prices Advisory Body sat up all night to count the items that were unfrozen. I do not know what to make of all this.  I do not know that very many individuals who occupy the Government Benches know the first thing about trade, industry, manufacturing industries or their requirements.  I see in this House now a number of professional men, a number of farmers and some labour representatives.  Where are the commercial men?  Where are the industrialists who can give some advice on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, in the Department of Industry and Commerce, an important section composed of very experienced officers who exert a control on prices of all goods manufactured or sold in this country.  Most of the people who have been affected by this price control which is based on a margin of <Col N="1798" /> profit find, because of the very effective control, that whereas a certain working capital was previously sufficient to keep the wheels of their business turning, their capital in relation to their business is becoming quite inadequate because the cost of materials has increased, in many cases, by three and four times their pre-emergency prices.  An item which previously cost 1/6 a pound or an ounce, or whatever it might be, now costs four times that price.  Anybody who has the slightest conception of what business people have to contend with will recognise, particularly in these days of advance buying and of commitments, that either their turnover must be four times as quick as it was previously or else that four times as much capital as was previously required is necessary. Side by side with that full and effective control by the Department we have this new Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>Any business man who wants to continue producing a particular article, the raw material for which he is dependent upon an outside source of supply, must use his own judgment, when there is an availability of merchandise, as to whether the price is likely to fall or to rise.  Notwithstanding that, in addition to price control we had this control of actual purchase.</P>
    <P>Every time a business man bought a new supply of raw material which had increased in price he had to go to the Prices Section and submit for inspection his costings and his invoices of the new prices and get permission to raise his prices accordingly. Further, every time he was faced with a demand for higher wages he had to go to the Prices Section and give particulars of the increase in wages which he had given to his workers&mdash; and which, in turn, had increased his costs of production&mdash;and ask for permission to increase his prices.  On top of all that, we had in this House a hounding of industrialists who were trying to serve the community and to manufacture goods which were sold not at prices fixed by themselves or at prices which secretly showed an exorbitant profit but at prices which <Col N="1799" /> were rigidly controlled by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>These business people were referred to in this House as &ldquo;racketeers&rdquo;.  In one case I think it was Deputy MacEntee who asked in this House regarding a statement made by the Tánaiste about some balance sheet he had seen of certain industrialists whether it had been shown to him in breach of what was called the secrecy preserved by the Revenue Commissioners; it was used by him in an effort to prove to the public that they were being robbed and eaten alive by the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>To-day our industry has stood many shocks in the shape of these attacks, but the greatest shock it has withstood and the greatest damage that has been done to industry generally in this country has been the setting up of the Prices Advisory Body because the ordinary individual cannot conceive or believe that a sensible body of men forming the Cabinet of the Government charged with running the affairs of the country could have gone to the expense of setting up this body if they had not had adequate and sufficient evidence that such a body was necessary over and above the existing controls.  Now we have the spectacle of this body, having had a Prices Freeze Order, allowed now to let out of their control practically every item, at least two-thirds of them.  I said before, and do not want to repeat, that the balance which are frozen are already controlled by a Maximum Prices Order of a different nature.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the members of this House appreciate that they have a certain responsibility not only for the welfare of certain sections of the community but of every section, and a Government, in particular, must act in an even-handed manner.  To have such a part, a certain section of the community, as a fair target for destruction, for annihilation, for atomic bombing, may satisfy Deputy Hickey, but I can tell Deputy Hickey: until you have a Government in this country of such a totalitarian nature that it can employ all our people in exchange for the unemployment that will follow the destruction of private <Col N="1800" /> enterprise, do not take the line that has been taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the right of people to a just reward for their labour.  The Prices Advisory Body was set up to deal with a certain section of our community, business people, and has excluded all else.  I was going to say if I were an insurance broker would it be right to bring me before that body and tell me that my commission was obviously unfair, that it was robbery if I had insured somebody by getting him to take a life policy and if forever after I got a commission on his premiums?  I do not think it is fair to single out the business and commercial people and industrialists and attack them in this House to the extent of saying that they are fit to be let loose on the community only under the control of a Prices Advisory Body.  They set up this body and then found that it had to remove from control two-thirds of the articles that the Government, at the behest of the Tánaiste, froze as from December 2nd.  I want to know whether this body is to continue or not.  Is it to be the position that business people will have three courts &mdash;outside the courts of law, of course <Col N="1803" />&mdash;to which they have to go with all their papers, all their books and all their affairs, and from day to day spend their time visiting the Prices Advisory Body, the Prices Control Section of Industry and Commerce and the new Industrial Development Authority, before they can turn in to do their day's work?  That is what is happening.</P>
      <P>If this Government and that happily wedded group of people over there want to see goods in circulation, essential goods available for our people, they must either take over themselves the purchase of all raw materials and let them out to the manufacturers at prices which they can demand in relation to their actual cost or at a subsidised rate, or they must allow the business community to carry on its own business under the existing control, which I say is sufficient.</P>
      <P>What is wrong is this.  Some individual gets an idea&mdash;like I had recently, to start a little business called Industrial Chemicals.  I will admit that I am starting with a friend in a very small way and I admit that I am putting in limited capital, as I am not a millionaire.  If this business is fortunate enough, in the course of five or ten years, to assume big proportions and have a reasonably big turnover of articles which on merit have succeeded and I as a result make a bit of money, am I to take it that I am now one of these outstanding racketeers of which this country should beware?</P>

      <P>Well, I am giving an example of myself, because I do not want to talk of other industries.  I say that the setting up of new industries is being stopped by the present attitude.  On the one hand, the Government sets up&mdash;and it is in this Estimate&mdash;a new industrial body which Deputy Hickey applauded when it was brought into being.  It was to get new industries started so rapidly, and such big ones, that all the industrial development of the 16 years' administration of Fianna Fáil would sink into insignificance and nothingness.  Side <Col N="1804" /> by side with that, you set up the Advisory Body to stop industrialists getting into business at all, as you say they must not make any money.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir.  The Minister has taken over this Department in these last few days, and I want him to approach this matter with reason and with open mind&mdash;if he can&mdash;and to recognise that this political agitation, this talk of racketeering in industry, is only a logical outcome of outpourings on the hustings on the eve of the last general election and the promises still unfulfilled of all those gentlemen&mdash;&ldquo;We will reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this Prices Advisory Body was set up for.  When everything else had failed, this was going to do it&mdash;and this body has thrown in its hand.  Now that the <Col N="1805" /> Government has come to the conclusion that the prices control section of Industry and Commerce has failed, and now that we know the Prices Advisory Body has failed, as it has thrown out all the commodities from control, I want a promise from the Minister to this House that the Government will not come in again to create another body to deal with a problem which cannot be dealt with in this way.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether this will be a growing office or not, but I see that a great number of persons are attached to it.  Amongst the personnel we have 53 clerical officers.  I see that 50 of them are given an increased allowance of £60, temporary and non-pensionable, so I take it that they are not new clerical officers but have been taken over from other Departments.</P>
      <P>To my mind, all this is more than stupid.  The public are not fools.  They realise this thing has had a very short life.  I ask the Minister to let us know whether he has had even an interim report from this body as to the advisability of their continuing in their activity. Has the Minister had any opportunity of seeing how this has affected industry generally, to what extent it has slowed up the procuring of raw materials for ordinary industry?  I agree there should be price control and the fact is that there was a system of price control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of matters I wish to deal with.  They come under sub-head S (2)&mdash;Industrial Development Authority.  In November, 1947, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce went down to Haulbowline and was there shown blue prints for the conversion of the furnaces to oil burning ones.  He was also shown the preparations that were made for putting up a sheet mill for the production of corrugated iron which is at present being imported into this country.  He then guaranteed that, as soon as machinery became available, the money would be placed at their disposal to carry out these works.  I remained silent on that matter for 12 months.  Then I raised it and I was told that it was being considered by the Government; that it was a very grave and important matter and that a decision on it could not be come to lightly.  A short time afterwards this Industrial Development Authority was set up and, when I put down a question six months afterwards to know whether this grave matter was still being considered, I was told it had been handed over to the Industrial Development Authority.  I then waited for six months more, as a matter of fact until last month, three years after this Government took office.  I put down a question and I was told that the Industrial Development Authority had recommended that an expert should be brought in to deal with this matter and that the expert had advanced <Col N="1807" /> very far in his investigations. I asked the Parliamentary Secretary who answered my question whether that expert had yet arrived in Haulbowline and I was told he had not.</P>
      <P>Now that we have a new Minister for Industry and Commerce, a large number of whose constituents are finding decent employment in that industry, I hope that he will speed up that authority, find out from them if the expert has yet been employed, when he is going to visit Haulbowline and when we are going to get some decision. We hear of people looking for new industries all over the country and yet we are waiting for the machinery to start the second portion of that industry which was started in 1939 and we have an Industrial Development Authority, costing £51,000, thinking over it for over 12 months.  The second matter I should like to deal with is the question of an oil tank in Haulbowline and the bunkering of ships there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for bringing it up on this Vote is that a deputation which I had the misfortune to have charge of were referred last week to the Industrial Development Authority. We went over there and interviewed one of these gentlemen for half an hour after an appointment had been made for us by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  After interviewing us for half an hour, he said: &ldquo;I am afraid I know nothing about this; it has not got anything to do with me.&rdquo;  I want to know from the Minister to what particular branch of his Department I am to take this deputation from my constituency in order to have this matter investigated, so that if a war does come there will be a couple of gallons of oil at our base in Cobh to supply the Irish Navy before they go out to protect our shores.  The Minister should have sufficient knowledge of that situation previously to have it dealt with by now.  I have a very definite suspicion that for this Government, as for other Governments, Eire means starting at Inchicore and finishing at the other end of Dublin, and that a deliberate attempt is being made to bring business and trade to Dublin to the detriment of the principal port in this island, namely, the Port of Cork.  Now that the Minister for Industry and Commerce represents the constituency of Cork, I hope that he will see that this tendency is stopped.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to know whether the Department have plans to supply non-turf counties with turf.  In my constituency of Waterford we had considerable trouble previously because we had to get turf from very great distances.  I should like to know whether the Department are planning <Col N="1809" /> this time and, if so, whether they will plan in such a way that the turf will be brought from as near a locality as possible into the County Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there are a few aspects of this Estimate which would require a little more exposure to the public than, I under stand, was vouchsafed to them by the Minister when introducing the Vote. In fact, I have heard that the Minister's justification for this Estimate was almost inaudible in the House. Although I do not assume that I have missed very much by not hearing the Minister giving an explanation of this relatively enormous increase in the Estimate for an already inflated Department, I would, nevertheless, out of my native inspiration, like to explain to the public some of the things the cost of which it is intended to defray under this Estimate.  Most of us remember that, in the early stages of this Government, inspectors, particularly industrial inspectors, were referred to by the predecessor of the present Minister in the Coalition Government as &ldquo;pip-squeaks&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Pip-squeaks&rdquo; is, of course, a term of contempt.  I assume it is not intended by those who use it to enhance the public prestige of those to whom that term is applied. We should have thought that a Minister in a Government, which had proclaimed as its object the abolition of the pip-squeaks from our public life, would have long hesitated before it attempted to increase them very considerably, but one of the purposes of this Supplementary Estimate, which we have before us, is to pay for no less than 50 additional pip-squeaks&mdash;a pip-squeak ministry which is almost as prolific of pip-squeaks as rabbits are of progeny.  Fifty additional pip-squeaks appointed at an additional cost to the Exchequer, every one of them at £60 per year.  I do not wish to be taken as reflecting on the unfortunate civil servant who is called upon to hold himself out as one of the Minister's people in order to discharge the obligations which the Minister has imposed upon him.  Far from it.  I have a great deal of experience, naturally, in the work of the <Col N="1810" /> Civil Service.  I know that they do many things which are unpleasant to themselves personally.  I know that they are zealous in giving effect to whatever should happen to be the policy of the Government of the day. I have no doubt that these 50 pip-squeaks will be as zealous under the present Minister for Industry and Commerce as they would have been under his immediate predecessor and as they would have been, indeed, under any Government that chose to employ them.  Pip-squeaks in order to harass. That was really the implication which was embodied in the use of the term&mdash; pip-squeaks to harass suffering shopkeepers, industrialists and suffering manufacturers.  But the 50 additional pip-squeaks are comparatively unimportant elements in the set-up for which we are asked to provide £6,365 in respect of two months' operation only.</P>
      <P>Much more important is the tribunal, the Prices Advisory Body, as it is called in the Estimate, and that, I presume, is its correct official title. You will note, first of all, in passing, that we no longer have the august tribunal of which the Tánaiste spoke on the 6th December.  We are no longer to have the omniscient, all-powerful and universally venerated tribunal which the Tánaiste visualised when he came in to save the Parliamentary Secretary from the consequences of the indiscreet speech which he delivered here on the 4th December of last year.  However, whether they call it a tribunal or a body, it is not of any very great importance. What is important is the personnel and the constitution of that body.  In order that we may realise how important the personnel and the constitution of that body is, I would like to refer Deputies to the Official Reports and to some of the statements which were made by the Tánaiste on that notable occasion, the 6th December last.  At column 1818, Volume 123 of the Official Dáil Debates, dated the 6th December, 1950, the Tánaiste said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We propose in this Bill to set up not an inconsequential advisory committee...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that the body for <Col N="1811" /> which we are asked to vote £6,000 odd is called a Prices Advisory Body,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;which can ponder over a problem sent to it for a period of months, but a Price Tribunal...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But a Price Tribunal now.  Whatever may have been the Tánaiste's ambitious intention, when he made that announcement on the 6th December, 1950, his grandiose scheme seems to have been somewhat diminished when it came to actual realisation; and whether, as a result of a difference of opinion between the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and other members of the Cabinet, this Prices Advisory Body has speedily been diminished until it has become an advisory committee, or an advisory body, of which the Tánaiste spoke so contemptuously on December 6th last.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to refer to the patent divergence of view in relation to important public questions which exists amongst members of the present Government.  I think nothing will more adequately illustrate that divergence than the difference in tone and phraseology in the speech which the Tánaiste delivered when the present Minister for Justice, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, was unfortunately&mdash;and I say that quite sincerely&mdash;unable to discharge his functions as Minister for Industry and Commerce because of illness.  I think there is one thing that would not have happened if the then Minister for Industry and Commerce had been in control of the Department of Industry and Commerce instead of having Mr. Norton butting in, as I said on another occasion, like a cuckoo into the Minister for Industry and Commerce's nest.  It was quite clear, from the first public speech which Mr. Morrissey made&mdash;I am referring to him by name in order that the personality may be quite clear in the minds of members&mdash;from the first public speech which the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Morrissey, made that he differed quite radically from the views which had been expressed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare in relation <Col N="1812" /> to this question of price control and profit-fixing.  Having heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the occasion which I have in mind, I should say that he regarded the statements which had been made by the Tánaiste, and the admissions which the Government had made, to avoid publicly disowning the Tánaiste and his utterances, were nothing short of disastrous from the point of view of their effect upon the economic progress and even upon the economic and social future of the people.</P>
    <P>Let me get back now to the devil in the drum or, shall I say, the nigger in the woodpile: let me get back to the Tánaiste and his famous speech.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We propose in this Bill to set up not an inconsequential advisory committee which can ponder over a problem sent to it for a period of months but a price tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, just listen to the terms in which the Tánaiste described his contemplated prices tribunal:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But a price tribunal, a virile, vibrant, representative body of three or five citizens selected on the basis of their competence and on the basis that they are citizens of standing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quoting from Volume 123, column 1818.  A virile, vibrant, representative body of three or five citizens.  Vibrant is a word largely used by fraudulent persons who deal in spiritualism, hypnotism, auto-suggestion, Couéism, black magic and the like.  Therefore, it does not come at all strangely from the Tánaiste.  It comes as a matter of fact, if one might say so, trippingly on the tongue so far as the Tánaiste is concerned. He is full of vibrations.  When we see him here &ldquo;tearing a passion to tatters&rdquo; the air is vibrant with his gaseous emanations.  Then we have the word &ldquo;virile.&rdquo;  That is a word largely used in advertisements designed to appeal to those suffering from inferiority complexes, the physically unfit and the mentally subnormal.  Virility is often illustrated by he-man pictures showing hairy torsos, muscular overdevelopment and strong stern visages, from out the mouth of which stern words erupt as they erupt from the Tánaiste on occasions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> Let us consider the virile and vibrant personalities of the vibrant and virile personnel of this tribunal.  First of all, we have the chairman.  The chairman, according to a note which I have here, is a judge of the Supreme Court whose salary is borne on the Central Fund. For that gentleman's competence as a lawyer, for his skill as an advocate no one has more admiration than I; no one, indeed, in the latter capacity has perhaps more reason to be grateful to him than I have.  But I would scarcely describe him in this context&mdash;I might elsewhere, if he were in the prize-ring or running a prize race&mdash;as virile.</P>
    <P>In his capacity as a judge of the Supreme Court and as chairman of the Prices Advisory Body, I think the use of the adjectives &ldquo;virile&rdquo; and &ldquo;vibrant&rdquo; would be completey out of place.  In his capacity as chairman presiding over the proceedings of this body before which, according to the Tánaiste, the shopkeepers, the manufacturers, and those engaged in commerce might be hailed at will, surely it was rather an air of judicial impartiality we would like to see characterising his conduct.  We would prefer to think that he would sit back and listen instead of sending out vibrations and manifesting virility, as the Tánaiste told us he and each and every one of the members of this Prices Advisory Body would do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for proclaiming to the public that the Prices Advisory Body would be composed of virile and vibrant citizens.  It was the Tánaiste who applied those adjectives.  I am merely saying that he misapplied them.  I am merely saying that they are the last qualities the public would wish to see manifested by the members of this Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, according to another note in the Estimate, the vice-chairman is a Special Commissioner for Income-tax, whose salary is borne on Vote 7.  In passing, I may say here that notwithstanding the fact that we are asked to vote £6,365 for this body we have not got from the Minister a comprehensive statement as to what in fact the body is <Col N="1814" /> costing the taxpayers.  Because, it has been noted that while the vice-chairman is being paid a temporary non-pensionable allowance of £500 a year, his main salary as Special Commissioner for Income-tax is borne on Vote 7.</P>
    <P>I do not happen to have a volume of the Estimates handy.  If I had, I would like to turn to Vote 7, to see whether the amount of the salary of this Special Commissioner of Income-tax is disclosed in the volume of Estimates for the coming year.  I do not think it is, because one of the matters which I have complained of in regard to that volume of Estimates is that this vital information, this information which is essential if we are going to consider these Estimates intelligently, has been withheld from us, so that here we are discussing an Estimate for the Prices Advisory Body and none of us&mdash;at least I am not&mdash;is in a position to say what exactly <i>in toto</i> do the salary and allowances of the vice-chairman of this body amount to.  I am sure, of course, that, judged perhaps by ordinary commercial standards, they would not be exorbitant but that is not the point.  The point is that, as I have said, vital information is being concealed from the House, which makes it difficult for us really to criticise this allowance adequately.</P>
    <P>However, let me get back again to consider the person, the highly competent public officer, who has been appointed as vice-chairman of this Prices Advisory Body.  I have known that officer over a great many years.  I knew him when he was a member of the Special Investigation Branch of the Revenue Commissioners.  I know him to be very zealous, very competent and highly efficient but I should not describe him as being virile or vibrant. Far from it, and I should think that persons who were compelled to have resort to the Special Commissioners of Income-tax in order that they might secure some redress against the exorbitant demands of the income-tax inspectors and the income-tax assessors would not want to see a person who was very virile or vibrant in front of them when they were asking for justice at his hands.  On the contrary, they <Col N="1815" /> would like to see a person who might perhaps have the characteristics of a good ordinary general practitioner, say, the family doctor, who would listen patiently, who would calmly assess the facts and come to a conclusion instead of, with all his virility and all his vibrancy, try to impress his point of view upon the unfortunate individual who was coming before him to seek justice, and it is justice that those who come before this Prices Advisory Body come to seek.</P>
    <P>Of course, that does not happen to be the Tánaiste's conception of the functions of the Prices Advisory Body. On the contrary, judging by some passages which I will quote in due course from his speech, he would appear to have visualised this Prices Advisory Body as a replica, a reproduction, of the fabulous Spanish Inquisition, one which would sit in forbidding surroundings, the principal feature of which was a gridiron upon which the unfortunate industrialists would be turned and turned, if they were not put on a spit and turned, for the delectation of some members of the Prices Advisory Body and, of course, of gentlemen like the Tánaiste, Deputy Davin, Deputy Seán Dunne and the rest of them, who think that the only thing that should be done, the only fate that should be meted out, to manufacturers, industrialists and successful businessmen is that of drawing and quartering or perhaps flaying, even before they are dead.</P>
    <P>We can pass from this question of virility and vibrancy.  We know what the Tánaiste thought the Prices Tribunal ought to be.  Then he goes on to tell us what it ought not to be. I am quoting this time from column 1819:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to make it clear here and now on behalf of the Government that that Price Tribunal will not be an automatic machine for registering price increases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us see how that was fulfilled.  I think that the Prices Advisory Body had not been two days or three days in existence before an Order was made automatically increasing the price of coal to the citizens of Dublin by&mdash;I am <Col N="1816" /> speaking entirely from recollection and I am by no means a housekeeper&mdash;at least 30 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well then, I will make a guess at it.  My recollection is that it rose from somewhere in the neighbourhood of £6 10s. 0d. a ton, I think it was, to nearly £9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>£8 5s. 0d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, £6 10s. 0d. to £8 5s. 0d.&mdash;a jump overnight, sanctioned without, apparently, any application from anybody.  We did not have any public display on that particular occasion of the coal merchants being hailed before this tribunal and asked to justify an increase in price. <Col N="1817" /> We did not hear anything about profiteering because, of course, the big profiteer in this matter was the Government.  It was the Government that was responsible for the jump in price from £6 10s. 0d. to £8 5s. 0d., as Deputy Davin has been good enough to disclose to the House.  But what became, then, of the Tánaiste's solemn undertaking to the public when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would like to make it clear here and now on behalf of the Government that that Price Tribunal will not be an automatic machine for registering price increases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What was it in that case except an automatic machine?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, perhaps, for all I know, even the Tánaiste himself, pressed the button and at once the machine needle jumped up and registered an automatic price increase.  Of course, there were many more price increases of the same sort which I have not time to expose to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave this question of the Prices Advisory Body, I think there is a feature of it which should be commented upon.  I do not wish to be taken as implying anything or reflecting in any way upon the integrity or the competence of the gentlemen who compose this body, but I think it is unfortunate that the Government should have chosen as the chairman of the body a judge of the Supreme Court.  I say that for this reason, that I understand there is considerable doubt among lawyers as to the validity of this body, as to the validity of the Prices Freeze Order itself, and it may not be, perhaps, unconnected with that, that some of the developments that have been criticised in relation to the enforcement of this Prices Freeze Order may have some relationship to the fact that the Government are so very doubtful as to whether the Prices Freeze Order is legal or not, that they anticipate, perhaps, it might be challenged in court, and that they are now, as delicately and as tactfully as they can, so as not to embarrass the Tánaiste or Deputy Davin or other <Col N="1818" /> members of the Labour Party, endeavouring to thaw out this prices freeze before something worse befalls them.</P>
    <P>If there is any doubt whatever, and I think there is and I am assured there is, about the legality of this Order&mdash; and I think before the Order was made that this very point, this very issue of its legality, must have been put before the Government&mdash;surely it was an improper thing, from the point of view of future possible developments, to have put as chairman of this body a judge of the Supreme Court, who might ultimately, if he would sit&mdash;I do not think he would, but if he would&mdash; have to decide a point of the greatest constitutional importance in relation to a body of which he had been chairman and in which he had functioned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall now finish with the chairman of this Prices Advisory Committee.  I think it was very unfortunate and very ill-advised, and it creates a bad precedent, that the Government should have chosen as chairman of this body a judge of the Supreme Court.  I have no doubt they could have got another person who would act as chairman, I am not going to say with greater distinction or with greater ability, but I want to emphasise, and I think a great many others believe with me, that it was a wrong thing to have done.</P>
      <P>What I have said with regard to the chairman of this body applies with almost as great force to the vice-chairman. The vice-chairman, as the note in the Estimate informs us, is a special commissioner for income-tax.  I do not think he has ceased to function as a special commissioner for income-tax. Income-tax payers have to go before him.  They have to establish a case there.  They have to show their books and accounts and these accounts are subject to scrutiny by him and the other commissioner who sits with him generally, and the person concerned has to explain all the implications of every figure in his accounts and to justify the appeal which he makes to the special commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is exceedingly difficult for a person functioning in that particular capacity, with all the knowledge he must acquire about people's businesses, to drop his rôle as special commissioner <Col N="1820" /> and sit as vice-chairman of this Prices Advisory Body.  I do not think it is possible for him, or any other man, no matter how determined he may be to do justice, no matter how determined he may be to be impersonal, to blot out of his mind knowledge which he may have gained in his capacity as special commissioner for income-tax and to approach the person who comes before him, any body which comes before him, appealing to be permitted to make a reasonable increase in the prices of the things which he or they make or sell. I do not think it is possible for him to approach a person in that capacity in the same impersonal way as he would be able, I hope, to do if he did not hold the post of special commissioner for income-tax.</P>
    <P>I know a great many people are very disturbed about this development because hitherto the proceedings of the Revenue Commissioners, particularly in relation to income-tax, where there are special and general commissioners, have always been regarded as highly confidential.  Not even in my time, and I am perfectly certain not even in the time of my predecessor, Mr. Blythe and not even in the time of my immediate successors, the President, or Deputy Aiken when he was Minister for Finance, and not even a Minister for Finance during the whole period 1922 to 1948, could one secure from the Revenue Commissioners any information relating to the business of any individual or any concern in this country.</P>
    <P>Now the people feel because of this appointment that that position no longer obtains, and they are fortified in that belief by a speech which was made by the Tánaiste himself in January, 1949, when he suggested that he had seen the balance sheets of some of these companies.  You remember that famous speech: &ldquo;If you saw,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the balance sheets of some of these companies, these boys have certainly got away with murder since 1939.&rdquo;  Then he went on to say that there was a small group of unscrupulous people who lined their pockets thicker and thicker with the money raked out of the pockets of the consuming public.  &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in a well-governed country gentlemen <Col N="1821" /> of that kind should be the guests of the Government in power in the thickest-walled jails we have.&rdquo;  That was in January, 1949, and he followed that up with this statement on the 6th December last&mdash;I am quoting from column 1809&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A lot of people remember it, and I think the Tánaiste would like a lot of people to forget it, as I hope to show before I have finished, when I have dealt with his speech dealing with the Prices Advisory Body.  The Tánaiste, in the course of his speech on the 6th December last said, as reported in column 1809:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is it not as plain as a pikestaff that during that period&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>he was referring to the period between 1939 and 1946&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;so far as the workers were concerned, they endured economic crucifixion at the hands of the Fianna Fáil Government because their wages were kept low while, on the other hand, we had created a new hierarchy of wealthy people, arrogant in their wealth, arrogant in their opulence, challenging anybody who dared to question their right to make extortionate profits.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;arrogant&rdquo; comes well from the mouth of the Tanáiste.  Is there anybody whose public conduct in relation to the citizens, in relation to the taxpayers who groan under him, who adopts a more arrogant attitude than the Tanáiste, whether he is addressing this House or addressing a public meeting outside?</P>

On the 6th December, 1950, he declared that &ldquo;they were arrogant in their wealth, arrogant in their opulence, challenging anybody who dared to question their right to make extortionate profits.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We shall talk about cheque books when I have finished. There is one matter about this mysterious office that calls for some explanation&mdash;one mysterious omission. We shall talk about cheque books later on.  I have not forgotten it and I shall come to it when it appears to me to be relevant to do so.  I was referring to the Tánaiste's statement about arrogance but I shall leave the question of the Tánaiste's arrogance for a moment because I want to come back again to the Prices Tribunal.  I was saying that the Tánaiste had stated as reported in column 1819, that the Prices Tribunal would not be an automatic machine for registering <Col N="1823" /> price increases.  &ldquo;We want this examination,&rdquo; he went on to say later, &ldquo;carried out in the full light of day and we want to make sure that the public Press will be available to report the applications for increases and to read the examination of the witnesses before that Tribunal.&rdquo;  How many members of the public Press were invited to attend at the tribunal when it was hearing the Government's request to be permitted to increase the price of coal from £6 10s. 0d. a ton to £8 5s. 0d?  Why should the Government be selected and singled out for special treatment and the ordinary citizen, the taxpayer who supports this Government and supports this House, be subjected to the full rigour of the price freeze Order? Why was the Minister for Industry and Commerce not asked to come before the Prices Advisory Body and to undergo public examination in order to explain why it was necessary to import this coal from overseas or across the Atlantic, why it was we had not available turf supplies to make good any deficiency there might be in the British supplies; why it was that the British, whom we had allowed to put a strangle-hold on our cattle export trade, were not fulfilling the great bargain of 1948?  Why was the Government allowed to get away with that?  Why was the Minister for Agriculture who was responsible, very largely, for that agreement, whose deficiencies have been responsible for the fact that we had to import, and have had to continue to import, coal at an exorbitant price, a price which has made this mineral merit the name of black diamonds, because it will be soon as rare in the houses of the ordinary people of this country&mdash;the middle class and the workers&mdash;as diamonds are, not called before the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was not the Tánaiste's principle applied in relation to this increase which was permitted in the price of coal?  Why was not the examination in that case carried out in the full light of day, and why were not the Press representatives invited to be present?  It seems to me that the Dáil is being led <Col N="1824" /> up the garden path in relation to this. The public were told that we were going to get an omnipotent, an omniscient, a merciless and pitiless tribunal and yet in the first case which goes before them, the cause is heard in secret, and the public are mulcted by the members of the Advisory Tribunal permitting the Government to increase the price of coal.</P>
    <P>What else was this Prices Tribunal to do?  I have, Sir, to ask the House to be patient while I read from a somewhat lengthy statement made by the Tánaiste in regard to this further activity of the Prices Tribunal, and what it was to lead to eventually.  I am quoting from column 1821:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must ask ourselves frankly&rdquo;&mdash;said the Tánaiste&mdash;&ldquo;how many people will we keep on the basis of paying them profits between the time the article is manufactured and the point at which it ultimately reaches the hands of the consumer.  We could, if we liked, put in half a dozen more classes and let them all get a little and let the consumer pay in the long run.  But prudent people may think that we have now reached the stage and the consumer has reached the stage where he no longer thinks he ought to be asked to carry so many at such an expensive price as he is paying to-day.  However, that is a matter which will be subject to examination by this tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, mark what was to be a subject for examination by this tribunal&mdash;one may describe it as the rationalisation of distribution.  I know that that will appeal to the former leaders and members of <i>The Vanguard</i>, because, under their programme, the small shopkeeper, the middleman, was to be crushed out: in fact, his business was to be expropriated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, the vanguard which I see has now become a rearguard position.  The Tánaiste is in the vanguard in trying to put over the policy of <i>The Vanguard.</i>  Let me remind the House of what the Tánaiste <Col N="1825" /> was talking about.  &ldquo;We could, if we liked,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;put in half a dozen more classes ... but prudent people may think that we have now reached the stage and the consumer has reached the stage where he no longer thinks he ought to be asked to carry so many at such an expensive price as he is paying to-day.  However,&rdquo; the Tánaiste went on&mdash;and this is what makes what I am going to say relevant &mdash;&ldquo;that is a matter which will be subject to examination by this tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he is replying to tell the House whether this tribunal has yet addressed itself to this problem, the problem as to how many people we will &ldquo;keep on the basis of paying them profits between the time the article is manufactured and the point at which it ultimately reaches the hands of the consumer.&rdquo;  That seems an innocuous statement until you begin to think what it means.  If it means anything, it means that the Tánaiste wants the tribunal to examine how many people, shopkeepers and others, can be put out of employment in order to bring down the price of goods to the consumer.  Now, there may be too many people engaged in the distribution trade, but, if they are engaged in the distribution trade, they are engaged in it because they have to earn a livelihood, and there is no other means of earning a livelihood open to them.  You can crush out the small shopkeeper.  It has been done in Poland and in Czechoslovakia: it has been done in every country behind the Iron Curtain.  It was the first thing Lenin tried to do in Russia&mdash;to rationalise the system of distribution, to which this tribunal under the direction of the Tánaiste is to address itself as an urgent problem.  You can do all this. It has been done elsewhere, and Deputy Cowan who is sneering and sniggering wants to have it done here; but, if you do that, what are you going to do with the people whom you put out of business, and with the men and women, the boys and the girls, whom they employ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste set up a commission to consider the problem of emigration. If you put these people out of employment, <Col N="1826" /> if you reduce the number of stages between the manufacturer and the consumer, somebody is going to lose, somebody is going to be put out of a job and somebody is probably going to be driven out of the country. Yet, this question of the rationalisation of distribution is one of the tasks which the Tánaiste indicated, on behalf of the Government, the tribunal would be asked to examine.</P>
    <P>I do not think that proposal figured among the pledges which the Fine Gael Party gave to the electorate when they went before them in the year 1948.  But, if you rationalise the system of distribution, a problem which the Tánaiste would like to see the tribunal examine, what is to prevent the rationalisation of agriculture as well?  It is true, and perhaps to this extent I may be irrelevant, that agriculture is one activity which is excluded altogether from the Price Freeze Order, but once let this question of rationalisation, in regard to production and distribution, creep in on the industrial side of our economy and what is to stop it being applied to the agricultural industry as well?  We ought to watch where we are going.</P>

What is to be the ultimate result of the tribunal's activities and of the Order <Col N="1827" /> under which it was to be set up? &ldquo;There may be a case,&rdquo; said the Tánaiste, at column 1821, &ldquo;for a price freeze, though there are difficulties in the administration of any such freeze, but at least there will be a price freeze, the most extensive and practical price freeze we can devise.&rdquo; Deputy Alfred Byrne, Senior, asked: &ldquo;Will it be a general one?&rdquo; and the Tánaiste replied: &ldquo;It will be a general one and the Deputy will be tired counting the commodities that will be affected by it.&rdquo;  I think Deputy Byrne would have been very fatigued indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying that prices are rising and the Government does not deny that prices are rising.  What the Government does is to try to excuse itself by passing the blame on to others&mdash;the war in Korea, the fact that people are stockpiling and a dozen other things, all outside the Government's control; but the point about it is that every one of these factors was operating in the year 1947 and the beginning of 1948, and there was not a single speaker on the then Opposition platform who was prepared to have the moral courage to admit that prices might rise, because, so far as the Government was concerned, they were uncontrollable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I object to in relation to this whole set up is that it was an attempt to deceive the people, an attempt to mislead the people, an attempt to undo the harm that had been done by the injudiciously phrased speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not say that that speech of his was deliberately designed to try to deny the facts of the situation, because they were undeniable.  Everybody outside this House, everybody who has had to engage in any commercial transaction, knows that prices are rising, that the cost of living is going up and is bound to go up even much more; but what people did complain about was that <Col N="1828" /> the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government for whom he spoke should have had so little regard for their intelligence as to attempt to persuade them that, because the cost-of-living index did not show any change, there were no changes in the facts of the situation.</P>

      <P>Let me get back.  I was saying that the Tánaiste said that the price freeze would be a general one and that Deputy Byrne would be tired counting the commodities that would be affected by it.  Of course, the price freeze was a general one.  Irrespective of what the facts of the situation were and irrespective of the fact that wool had gone up in price, not by 100 per cent. overnight, as Deputy Byrne has told us blankets rose, but by 300 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Inside a very short period, and, for all practical manufacturing purposes, overnight.  Disregarding the fact that copper was soaring, that aluminium was soaring, that rubber was still soaring and that, as a matter of fact, most of these things were almost unprocurable, the Government, disregarding all the facts of the situation, imposed this price freeze Order.  What was the immediate effect of it&mdash;that everybody who was engaged in industry, everybody who had to buy ahead, expecting that, in due time, he would be compensated for any increase in the cost of his raw materials and any increase in the other charges to which his industry might be subject, immediately stopped buying. They could not afford to buy wool, if they were not to be allowed to increase the price of the blankets; they could not afford to buy cotton, if they were not to be allowed to increase the price of the garments to be made from that cotton; they could not afford to buy rubber, if they were not to be allowed to increase the price of the <Col N="1829" /> commodities in the manufacture of which rubber is a substantial factor; they could not afford to buy steel or any other of these things which they had to get from outside, and, therefore, they stopped buying.</P>
      <P>In this period, when all the world is buying in order to safeguard itself against an ultimate shortage we in this country, who are more vulnerable to blockade than any other country in Europe, whose people had a very tight time during the last war, allowed these priceless days and weeks and months to slip by because the Government had done a foolish thing which prevented every wise man, every farseeing business man from taking the normal precautions he would have taken to maintain his stocks of raw materials.  Without these stocks of imported raw materials, we cannot keep industry in this country going; we cannot meet the needs of our people, and we cannot keep our workers in employment.  It is a longstanding tale that you cannot make bricks, without straw, but that is what the Government demanded that the Irish manufacturer should do&mdash;make bricks without straw, produce commodities and give employment without being able to procure for himself the raw materials essential to the maintenance of industry.  That is where the criminality of this Price Freeze Order came in.  I am not against price control.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, in times of shortage and scarcity, there will be some people &mdash;not all&mdash;who will be prepared to exploit that situation, but this was not price control.  This was rank, staring madness.  This was a deliberate paralysis of industry by the Government in order to secure a petty political end, in order to get the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government for whom he spoke out of the mess in which his ill-judged speech had precipitated them.</P>

      <P>I am raising this matter on the Adjournment because, in <Col N="1830" /> its essence, it is a question of the right of Deputies in this House to frank answers to questions which are asked. In certain circumstances a Minister is occasionally entitled to decline to give the information sought and to give his reasons&mdash;and that is frequently accepted.  However, in such circumstances, it has been customary to say frankly that the information is not being given and to give a reason for taking that course.  In other cases, the custom and the proper course has been to give the information frankly, and heretofore we accepted in this House&mdash; and, indeed, it is very frequently done &mdash;that, although the information would not be politically helpful to the Minister who is giving it, nevertheless it was frankly given.  My reason for raising this matter is because there has been a lamentable departure in this particular case from that correct practice.  The Minister who is answering to-night is in no way responsible, and when I speak of the Minister in this matter I am speaking of the corporate body, and I must, of necessity, refer to his predecessor in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which I should like to make is that the Deputies of this House have the privilege of asking for information. They should not be put to the task of a careful legal formulation of the question in order to get the information which they require.  It should be sufficient for a Deputy to make his sense clear when asking for the information and, on such a clear request, it should be sufficient to have an answer frank in the spirit as well as in the letter of the question.  What happened in this case?  On the 28th February last the Minister was asked whether any reductions had been made in subsistence allowances payable to battalion administrative officers attached to the F.C.A.  The reference is column 773 of the Official Report of the 28th February last.  The Minister's predecessor in office replied that the rates of special allowance payable to N.C.O.s filling vacancies for battalion administrative officers with units of the F.C.A. in country districts have heretofore been 3/1 a day for personnel provided with military accommodation and 4/1 a day <Col N="1831" /> for others.  He said, further, that it was recently decided to alter these allowances to 3/3 a day for administrative officers for whom accommodation is provided or who are living with their families and 6/- a day for others.  In a supplementary question, Deputy Boland asked about a reduction of 10d. a day for N.C.O.s and the net result was that the Minister's reply left everyone under the impression that rather was there not a reduction but that there was an increase and he professed not to understand the rest of the question. This was an example of a half-truth which was misleading.  In view of the form of the question, I fear I must draw the inference that the reply was deliberately misleading.  Reading the answer in the light of facts that, fortunately, we subsequently had available to us, it is easy to see, on parsing the answer, that it can be read as not an untrue statement but as a partial statement which was misleading.</P>
    <P>What, in fact, apparently was the position?  It would appear, and I gather this now from the Minister's reply to-day, that there was, in fact, a reduction in the amount of subsistence allowance payable to N.C.O.s, some 61 in number, of 10d. a day.  The Minister's answer on the occasion referred to was to show an increase to N.C.O.s in the same category but with a slight difference of circumstances.  What were the circumstances?  Incidentally, in the question to-day I asked whether a finance branch or other directive or regulation providing for &ldquo;arrears of allowances to B.A.O.s under Amendment to D.F.R. S/3, paragraph 70, whereunder allowances at the rate of 3/3 per day are provided for married N.C.O.s living with their families (except where military accommodation is provided) with effect from 28/12/'50 was recently promulgated....&rdquo;  I am not quite clear from the answer whether that is a correct reference. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  It would appear that the new regulations provide especially for N.C.O.s living in the Dublin area&mdash; which do not concern us here; then for married N.C.O.s living with their families <Col N="1832" /> at 3/3 per day, and then for single or married N.C.O.s living away from their families who are to get 6/- a day. It appears that the net result of this was to increase the subsistence allowances to N.C.O.s in the Limerick and Dublin area, and also to single or married N.C.O.s living away from their families due to the exigencies of the service.  But married N.C.O.s living with their families, except where military accommodation was provided, were to get 3/3 a day whereas heretofore the sum was 4/1 a day.  Therefore, if I understand the matter correctly, there was a reduction of 10d. a day in the allowances paid to these men who were living with their families but for whom military accommodation was not provided.  Surely a responsible Minister, in face of the question asked &mdash;whether any reduction had recently been made in subsistence allowances payable to B.A.O.s&mdash;would have given that fact as well as others.  That is the first point.  In its essence, it is a question of the privilege and right of Deputies of this House.  I am perfectly certain that no Minister would be misled to such an extent by the officers of his Department in a matter of that nature &mdash;and I must therefore lay the blame on the present Minister's predecessor.</P>
    <P>At the risk of repetition, I should like Deputies to appreciate what is involved for every Deputy in the House if any such lack of frankness or misleading answers to questions from the ministerial benches should be tolerated, no matter who or what group or what Party or what Government should be responsible for the furnishing of these answers.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of these B.A.O.s themselves.</P>
    <P>It appears therefore that there are 61 N.C.O.s who are to suffer a decrease of 10d. per day in their subsistence allowance.  The subsistence allowance is an allowance that goes to meet the cost of living and enables them to be efficient.  Surely this time when prices are rising, when the supply situation is difficult, is not a time to cut the allowance of these officers.  Surely a time when we want to encourage the F.C.A. which is the <Col N="1833" /> major part of the Reserve of our Defence Forces is not the time to do a thing like that.  Any of us who have had experience of voluntary forces&mdash; and a number have been tried in the State heretofore&mdash;realise and must know that the efficiency of such a force depends firstly on the furnishing of an adequate whole-time personnel to cater for them and secondly on the enthusiasm and efficiency of that personnel. Very much indeed depends on these factors.  What will be the effect of this action on the efficiency of the F.C.A. which we all profess to regard as important and encourage and which the Minister and his predecessor sought to encourage?  What effect can it have but an adverse one?  The amount of money involved cannot be very great.  I have not done the sum. I should have, I suppose.</P>

      <P>It is not going to break the Exchequer.  Remember that the Minister has had a saving under the stores heading; he has not been able to purchase the stores he would like to purchase, or at least so we have been frequently told here.  Surely a part of that saving, less than £1,000, could be usefully diverted to this purpose.  There was no need to cut the allowances of these men, and therefore I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to reconsider his decision. It savours of the many regulations from which the-Army suffered in the past under different Governments; they did not do any good and the net result was not any real economy.  Here is a point where I think it would be important to reconsider just this one matter, even if it were decided that those N.C.O.s who received the allowance heretofore should continue to receive it while the other cases might be considered.  I would definitely go so far as to say that these officers perform such an important duty and so much depends upon them that it <Col N="1834" /> would be money well spent to leave them this established allowance rather than demoralise them.</P>
      <P>Another matter arose out of the Minister's reply to a supplementary question.  Perhaps I might be permitted to read it.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The difference between the two rates of special allowance (at present 2/9 a day and previously a 1/- a day) represents an element in respect of the cost of lodgings for single men not provided with the accommodation which they would normally have in barracks if they were stationed at military posts.  Previously, in addition to personnel who were compelled to live in lodgings, the higher rate of special allowance was, owing to the wording of the regulation, issued to married personnel living with their families, although such personnel are not at any time or in any locality provided with free married accommodation. The anomaly which existed hitherto has been rectified as from the 23rd February, 1951, with the result that 61 battalion administrative officers who had, prior to that date, been in receipt of 4/1 a day are now in receipt of 3/3 a day, representing a decrease in their cases of 10d. a day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister certain supplementaries and the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a reduction of 10d. a day to people who are not entitled to it at all.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I said that these were allowed before and the Minister agreed they were.  I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I take it that they were drawing it legally.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said no, and I asked if the Department had made illegal payments.  I am not trying to take up the Minister on that word, nor do I say that the present Minister tried to mislead me on this matter.  I do not think he did, but is it quite correct to say that they were illegal payments?  If there was a fault in the wording of the regulation it may have been against the intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody understands that It was against the intention, but, frankly I cannot see the Minister's very efficient Department slipping up on an illegal payment and I am sure the Minister cannot either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to get them to make legal payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They are so cautious that that is very frequently so.  That payment was legal and proper as far as the regulations were concerned, whatever about the regulation not corresponding with the intention and, therefore, these men were, in law anyway, entitled to this payment. If a mistake was made, as mistakes sometimes are made, they were not at fault, nor did they draw something to which they were not entitled.  That is all the more reason why it should not be taken from them now.  To give anything and then take it away always causes greater hardship than not to give it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give the Minister time to reply, but I would ask him first of all to give the Deputies of this House an assurance on behalf of his Department that in future questions will be answered frankly even if it means not answering at all, as happened recently when the Minister said frankly to me that he did not think it would be in the public interest to give me the information I wanted.  At least I knew I was not getting any information and the reasons why, and we knew where we were.  Questions should be answered by the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth and not by a part-truth, as was done by the Minister's predecessor with all the appearance of attempting deliberately to mislead the people who asked the question.  For the sake of the 61 men involved, for <Col N="1836" /> the sake of the Army, for the sake of that very important element of our Defence Forces, the F.C.A., will the Minister not now adjust his regulation to see that this sum is paid to these men?</P>
    <P>Also, from the point of good faith, it is a very important thing&mdash;and the Minister himself knows it as an officer who served in the Army&mdash;for the morale of our Defence Forces, to know that faith can be kept with trust on both sides, on the Government side and on their side; and in a sense this now resolves itself to a matter of keeping faith with them.  A regulation was made, inadvertently giving them a benefit, leading them to believe they were entitled to it.  Keep faith with them now, adjust that regulation and pay them.  There are only 61 involved.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy was rather unfair to my predecessor when he said that he was misleading.  The answer is very clear in view of the answer he gave on the 23rd.  It appears to me, on reading it, that the facts are clearly stated.  I do not believe that there was any intention to mislead, nor do I believe that the Minister did mislead, either intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, at the earliest possible moment, I want to say that, as far as I can see, the information was that asked for by the Deputy. However, the question was asked in a more deliberate way to-day and, to be quite candid, I find it difficult myself to understand the answer&mdash;though I have had it in front of me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question was: was there a reduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The second, however, is more difficult.  Married soldiers living with families, whether inside or outside barracks, pay for their accommodation, their married quarters, out of their pay, marriage allowances, etc. There are two types of such allowance payable to an N.C.O. attached to the F.C.A., one to cover disturbance expenses and the other to cover both disturbance and accommodation.  Due to a flaw in the regulations, married men living with their families were <Col N="1837" /> hitherto getting the higher allowances as well as men in lodgings to whom it was properly payable.  Advantage was taken of the recent amendment of the regulations to rectify this position. Had it continued, men living in lodgings as well as married men living with families but not attached to the F.C.A. would have a grievance.  In other words, there were other people who would come in.  I am quite willing to admit that when a person has some advantage that the regulation gives him, it is the devil to lose it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an older practice than that, that is, where a mistake occurred there are two people to suffer&mdash;the person responsible for the payment can be surcharged and the poor fellow who got it can be compelled to repay it.  That is a regulation which both Deputies know as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply here.  The regulation was legal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> If there is a flaw, it is in the regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the fact that something was given to them which apparently it was not the intention to give to that class of N.C.O.  I have not been able to examine the whole circumstances or the effects and the best and the most I can say is that I will examine them.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as far as I can go and I should not be pressed to do anything more than that at the moment.  Any time there is a grievance in any section of the Army, I know that it affects the morale of the forces.  A contented Army personnel is one of the greatest assets any country can have.  Quite the contrary is the reverse of that.  Therefore, my policy and the policy of the Government of which I am a member is to make things as satisfactory as can humanly be done for every member serving in the forces of our country.</P>
