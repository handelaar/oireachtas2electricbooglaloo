    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is confusing the validity of the index and of the indications which it purports to give of the rise in the cost of a number of commodities.  This index purports to deal only with the commodities listed by it.  The survey at present being carried out will cover a number of commodities not at present included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to an article purporting to have been written by a Reuter's correspondent in Dublin which appeared in a Tasmanian newspaper stating, <i>inter alia:</i> (a) that the question of Partition is rarely mentioned to-day except by members of the Irish Government; (b) that even in the Six Counties the Nationalists do not really want a united Ireland; (c) that a member of the Irish Electricity Board stated that the Irishman keeps his pig in his parlour just to prove that he has a parlour; (d) that Southern Ireland's butter lies in the refrigerator stores of Dublin instead of in the warehouses of England, and (e) that Southern Ireland cattle and sheep eat down the grasslands long after they have reached maturity because there is no market to which they can be sent; and, if so, whether the Minister proposes to take any steps to combat such distorted and misleading reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to this report, and I agree with the Deputy that it is distorted and misleading.  As regards the steps which I am taking to combat such reports, I have, in this particular <Col N="557" /> instance, asked the Ambassador in Canberra to issue a correction.  Correction of misleading reports is not, however, adequate in itself, for many more people will read the original report than will see the correction. The most effective step to combat such distortion is by making available objective and brightly-written reports on Ireland.  This is the function which the Irish News Agency is intended to discharge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot conceive that any responsible Irish journalist would write material of this kind.  I should like to add that I know at least the leading correspondent of Reuter's News Agency in Dublin is an extremely responsible and competent journalist and I am quite certain that he would not take part in such misrepresentation.</P>

I have already made it clear to the House that the Land Commission's intentions in such cases will not under any circumstances be made known beforehand.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a strike at this forest last month.  At the Deputy's request, I met some of the men involved and on my advice work was resumed.  I then had an investigation carried out on the spot by two senior officers of the Department and, as I am fully satisfied that there is no justification for the present strike, I can <Col N="562" /> only repeat my advice to the men to go back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that men in charge of workers in the forestry section of the Department of Lands are entitled to address themselves to the workers when carrying out their duties in such a manner as to cast doubts upon the legitimacy of the workers, and to use foul and filthy language to the workers?  Does he consider that, when men stop work as a protest against that kind of attitude on the part of those in charge of the workers, they are unreasonable, and does he think that that kind of conduct should be allowed by any responsible Minister on the part of his officials?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy Dunne that I do not stand over, nor should I like that anyone in the Department would be guilty of, the conduct which he alleges.  The history of the case is that these men went on strike.  First of all, none of the men, except one, ever had any experience of, and never worked under the particular head labourer that they objected to, or raised complaints about. They went back to work on my advice. Since then, the men have assured the two senior officials of the Department whom I sent down to investigate the charges which they made, that there has been no bad language, such as the men complained about in the first instance. That is the situation.  I believe that there is no justifiable cause for the men to be on strike this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious matter.  I would like to ask the Minister if he thinks it is reasonable to <Col N="563" /> assume that over 30 men will stop work in County Wicklow, and especially in West Wicklow where it is particularly hard to find work, just for amusement?  Is he not aware of the fact that this particular overseer was removed by the Department on a previous occasion because of the fact that he had been using language of the type which I have described to these men? Will he not, in these circumstances, reexamine the position with a view to having this man removed from the company of the men over whom he has been put in charge, because I think the situation is a scandalous one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that if I had any reasonable proof at all that the situation was as he has just outlined it, I would not stand over the man's conduct for one moment.  On the other hand, I do not think it would be fair to remove the man, seeing that the men themselves have admitted that since then there has not been a single complaint.  The men themselves admitted that to the two officials whom I sent down.  Unless there was some reasonable grounds for doing so, I would not like to be guilty of removing a man and of reducing him in his status or pay without some just cause.  That is the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in a recent Press announcement, the guaranteed minimum price for Ymer barley offered by farmers after next harvest has been increased from 16/- to 20/- per cwt.  It must be remembered, however, that this is a minimum price which farmers may receive for such quantity as they may produce surplus to their individual requirements.  As I have previously stated on many occasions, farmers will get the most profitable returns by using the feeding stuffs produced by them for feeding to their own live stock.</P>

The company now considers that the needs of the farmers in the Doon and Coolard areas who had previously to travel unduly long distances to the company's premises at Kilcoleman, Lisselton, Listowel and Ballylongford are being adequately met by the travelling creamery service in question, and in the circumstances it is not proposed to establish a separating station at either Coolard or Doon.</P>

As a result of a survey of these areas made last year it was considered that the quantity of milk in the areas which was not being sent to existing creamery premises would not justify the provision of a travelling creamery.  I would suggest that the farmers concerned should cooperate to arrange for the conveyance of their combined milk supplies to the nearest creameries.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, milk may be conveyed to creameries for reward by owners of motor vehicles who are not the holders of merchandise licences.</P>

      <P>The number of special allowances granted under the Army Pensions Act, 1946, is 1,712.  Of this number, 1,539 were members of the I.R.A. and 173 were members of Cumann na mBan.  In 233 of these cases, the recipients have died, and the number of allowances at present on payment is 1,408.  The average annual rate of allowance is £64.  The total cost is £90,112.  The approximate annual cost of increasing the present allowance by 25 per cent. would be £22,528.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that these men and women have to be <Col N="576" /> proved to be destitute and incapable of supporting themselves before they qualify for this allowance, would the Minister not now consider it a reasonable request to increase the allowance for the sake of £22,000, since other persons in receipt of pensions have received increases within the past three years?  Many of these people have died in the past few months because they could not provide themselves with proper nourishment, fuel or anything else.</P>

      <P>I would be sorry to think that the previous Administration made such a blunder in the introduction of this Act that anybody was left to die for want of means.  I regarded this Act, and I said so at the time it was introduced, as a very, very generous measure.  It brought the income of a single individual up to a minimum of £80 per year and of a married individual to some pounds over £100 a year, irrespective of the cost of living.  That does not mean that anyone should die for want of nourishment. The scheme is still there.  It has been extended since the change of Government.  The date for application has been altered and there has been a considerable influx of new applicants. I do not think it is reasonable to press for any further concessions in this matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the drastic cut in supplies of tinplate in the second quota period will result in the closing of canning factories engaged in home trade production, causing extensive unemployment and shortages of important canned foods and whether he will make strong representations, on ministerial level, to the British authorities, and open negotiations with the American authorities, for an increased quota.</P>

      <P>Until late in 1950, when the coal supply position in European producing countries began to deteriorate, the shortage which has since developed was not foreseen by anybody.  Sufficient supplies for current consumption in this country were available.  In view of this fact, and in view of the firm and binding nature of the Trade Agreement made with Britain in 1948, under which the British Government undertook to supply to Ireland not less than 1,570,000 tons a year of coal and other fuels, the Government did not consider it necessary to make any addition to the already substantial stocks held by Fuel Importers (Éire), Limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will consider introducing proposals for legislation to ensure that messenger boys will be (a) paid a decent wage; (b) supplied by their employers with protective clothing; (c) provided with carrier bicycles kept in good repair by the employers, and (d) safeguarded from having their carrier bicycles overloaded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it necessary to introduce special legislation to achieve what the Deputy proposes. Machinery exists under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, for the establishment of joint labour committees which may make regulations governing the wages and other conditions of employment of the workers concerned.  Joint labour committees for messengers in the Cork City area and in Dublin City and Dún Laoghaire have been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>These joint committees deal principally with conditions of employment and wages.  I do not think they take into account the way messenger boys are dressed, the type of carrier bicycles with which they are supplied and the amount of load they are expected to carry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that traders with whom customers have lodged pages from special ration books entitling them to increased rations of flour are seriously inconvenienced by his failure to issue instructions to flour millers on the procedure to be adopted to recoup traders for flour issued against these coupons, and if he will have this position rectified without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the inconvenience caused to traders cannot be serious.  The ration is sufficiently generous to leave every trader in possession of a leave surplus flour, and out of this surplus he should be able to meet the wants of the occasional person who lodges with him pages from the special ration book.  I regret that I cannot see my way to alter the existing arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will have inquiries made into the delay in giving Artane, Coolock, Portmarnock and adjoining areas in County Dublin a water supply sufficient to enable building societies to continue the building of houses in these districts, and, further, whether he is aware that a scheme of house building is held up because of the failure to supply water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas referred to will be served by the North Dublin regional water supply scheme which is being undertaken by the Dublin County Council.  Tenders for two sections of the scheme have been approved.  Contract drawings have been approved for a third section, comprising the reservoir at Ballycoolan, and the specification, bill of quantities and details of steel reinforcement are awaited.</P>
      <P>Although the provision of a water supply in the areas may permit of some further local housing development, the completion of the first section of the Howth outfall sewerage scheme will be a material factor in determining the county council's policy on proposals for major building developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister use his great influence to get these various authorities to come together to speed it up, as there is a scheme of housing already held up in Artane and the men may lose employment and go away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the North Dublin regional water supply scheme is likely to take a good deal of time before it comes to maturity? Is he aware that in the meantime housing schemes are held up by virtue of water shortage, in the Artane district particularly, and would he consider making representations to Dublin Corporation to make a temporary supply available to those schemes pending the completion of the North Dublin scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>A preliminary report and drawings in connection with the proposed water supply at Annascaul were received in my Department on the 19th May, 1950.  No records of the gauging of the proposed source accompanied the proposals but in July, 1950, records of gaugings covering the period from 1st April, 1950, to 30th June, 1950, were submitted.  These were not sufficient to establish the adequacy of the proposed source beyond doubt and the sanitary authority were advised to continue gaugings up to the end of the autumn. At the request of the sanitary authority, an inspection of the proposed scheme was carried out and certain observations and recommendations of the Department's technical advisers on the proposals have since <Col N="603" /> been furnished to the sanitary authority for their consideration.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there has been no avoidable delay in this matter.  I am not in a position to state when work will commence on the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Any plan designed to provide comprehensive relief of traffic congestion in Dublin would necessitate the carrying out of large-scale demolition of property and schemes involving heavy capital expenditure on new roads and bridges.  No such plan has yet been agreed to as between the corporation and the Port and Docks Board.  The control of traffic congestion, in so far as this can be achieved within the existing road system, is primarily a matter for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is not aware that the traffic position in the City of Dublin is fast becoming impossible?  In the light of that fact is the position now that no steps are being taken to make any plan to relieve that situation?  Is that the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the question of traffic congestion and parking was a matter in the first place for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, who makes the parking regulations in agreement with the corporation and with the approval of the Minister. Another question to which I referred was the difficulty of the lay-out of Dublin.  If congestion were to be relieved in the principal parts, notably College Green, Westmoreland Street and places in the centre of Dublin, it would involve heavy expense by way of capital expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary cannot hold that nothing can be done to relieve the traffic situation in Dublin without large-scale demolition of property?  If the Gardaí examined the matter from the point of view of having more one-way streets they might arrive at a position where the traffic would flow instead of sticking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the Deputy's suggestion conveyed to the corporation for their consideration and I am informed that the adoption has been found impracticable owing to the difficulty of supervising the laying of mastic asphalt in artificial light and also on account of the extra expenditure <Col N="608" /> likely to be involved in night working.  I am, however, satisfied that arrangements have been made to ensure that the works in the central city area will cause the minimum disturbance to traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that quite recently&mdash; as a matter of fact at the present time &mdash;very small minor works have been carried out and that considerable dislocation has been caused owing to their being done in the daytime?  Is he further aware that under the scheme which the corporation has in mind the entire area from Nassau Street to O'Connell Street will be up and that this will cause complete dislocation in this part of the city?  Does he not consider it essential in the light of that that the corporation should make known some definite plans to the public and also that they should consider having the work done as far as possible at night time when the traffic is lighter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that a considerable amount of inconvenience will be caused to traffic but I do not think that the Deputy's solution would alleviate the difficulty to any extent at all.  The Deputy's suggestion is that the work be done at night and that certain of these works could be completed during the night-time but, as a matter of fact, the Deputy knows full well and the House knows that even if a road were opened up at night the barriers, implements, tools and the other things the contractor would need would still be there in the morning on the site and that it would be impossible to remove them.  In any case the corporation have made arrangements with the Gardaí to divert traffic.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state whether he has received correspondence from the Cork Fever Hospital Committee regarding the provision of finance for the North Fever Hospital, Cork; whether he has replied to this, and if he will now indicate the position of the committee regarding the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) Noel C. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received correspondence from the Cork Fever Hospital Committee regarding the finance of the fever hospital at Richmond Hill, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of finance for this hospital is governed by the Cork Fever Hospital Act, 1935, as amended.  Under that Act, the authorities of the hospital handed over to the Cork Corporation funds which it had accumulated in earlier years and the Act provided that the Cork Corporation should finance the running of the hospital, while it remained <Col N="611" /> in being, and also the building of the new fever hospital in Cork, visualised in the Act, out of the accumulated funds referred to, out of grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund and, in so far as funds from these two sources proved insufficient, out of corporation funds.</P>
    <P>The decision, in which Cork Corporation concurred, taken last year to utilise as an orthopædic hospital the premises of the new fever hospital then and now in course of erection involves a material change in the financial arrangements set out in the Cork Fever Hospital Acts and the changes to be proposed to the Oireachtas in an amending Bill are under consideration.</P>
    <P>I understand that the present financial difficulty of the Richmond Hill Hospital is due mainly to the decision of Cork Corporation to terminate, as from 30th September last, a monthly payment of £500 to the hospital on account of its expenses.  In July last, in view of the altered circumstances arising out of the alternative use decided on for the new fever hospital premises, I made certain suggestions to the Cork Corporation in regard to the financing of the Richmond Hill Hospital.  These were considered by the authorities of the last mentioned hospital, and in a letter addressed to the Cork City Manager on 22nd November, they expressed the view that my proposals were impracticable.  On the same date they invited me to make a determination in accordance with Section 9 of the Cork Fever Hospital Act, 1935, in respect of the financial year 1950/51, in default of agreement between the hospital authorities and Cork Corporation.  I did not hear further from Cork Corporation in regard to the matter until 17th inst.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, on the 16th inst., I had written to Cork Corporation agreeing to a final payment from the Hospitals Trust Fund to Cork Corporation in recoupment of sums paid by the corporation to the hospital in respect of the period up to 31st March, 1948.  I received no application from Cork Corporation for recoupment from the Hospitals Trust Fund of any moneys paid <Col N="612" /> by the corporation in respect of periods subsequent to that date, and I asked the corporation, in the letter referred to, the position regarding payments made by it since to the hospital, and invited any claim the corporation may have for recoupment.</P>
    <P>I have, in the light of the Cork Corporation's letter received on 17th inst., made the determination requested by the fever hospital authorities, and have notified these authorities and the Cork Corporation accordingly.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on Section 12, as amended.</P>
    <Col N="614" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night I was dealing with the provisions of Section 12 (2) of this Bill.  Under this sub-section, the new board to be appointed to the Meath Hospital will have power to dispense with the services of any appointee to the hospital who received his or her appointment on or after the 6th December, 1950.  Without attempting to restate what I have already stated, I had established that the board who made the appointments which are sought to be brought within the purview of this section was a properly constituted board and was found to be properly and legally constituted by a decision of the High Court of Justice in this country.  It was also clear that there was need for extra appointments to the staff of this hospital.  The posts having been properly advertised, certain applicants sat for interview before a board on which the medical profession was represented.  The qualifications required were very high&mdash;the applicants were required to possess two senior degrees in medicine or surgery.  Out of the 20 applicants, four men were appointed.  It must be presumed that the four men who were appointed held the highest possible qualifications.  I might mention that these posts are honorary and that the appointment of the men who have obtained them would have no effect on the positions of the existing medical or surgical staff in that hospital. There is no attempt, by these appointments, to displace any of the existing staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next main objection to this sub-section is that it is retrospective legislation.  I have an objection in principle to retrospective legislation. Nevertheless, I realise that in some instances retrospective legislation is necessary and even desirable.  It is generally employed when a certain situation exists which, on examination, has proved to be not quite legal and provision is often made by this House to legalise a desirable state of affairs. In this sub-section there is an attempt to nullify what was otherwise a legal act.  As far as I remember, it is the first time this device was employed to render null and void an act which was otherwise legal and which had no taint <Col N="615" /> whatever of illegality.  There is the further point that these appointments have created between the hospital and the new appointees a contractual situation. The position is that when these men accepted a post they entered into a contract of employment.  I have not found in any branch of the law any provision which would enable an employer to dismiss an employee without giving cause or excuse.  If any member of this house or any employer outside it acted towards his employee in the manner envisaged in and permitted by this sub-section, he would be faced with an action for damages by his employee for dismissal.  Nevertheless, we are going to condone such a position by allowing a sub-section into a Bill which would permit the new board appointed under the Act to dismiss these men, who were properly appointed, without giving any reason whatever for doing so.  I think that this is a position that might not stand if legal action were taken.  I have not examined the position in that light but I have very grave doubts as to the effect of the sub-section with regard to the present position of the law.  For the benefit of the new board, should this section be carried, I should like to observe that it is entirely permissive&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the first instance, I have not made two cases.  I challenge anybody to deny the accuracy of what I have stated.  This sub-section tries to condone an action which, if taken by the new board, would not be considered legal in the case of any other contractual situation as between employer and employee.  I may say that <Col N="616" /> I have no interest whatever in any of the appointees, personal or otherwise, or in any of the organisations alleged to have any interest in the matter.  As the sub-section is permissive, I hope the new board will not take any hasty action and will not be motivated by the same spirit that prompted the threat that one or all of these men would be kicked out on their ears as soon as the Bill became law.  I would ask them to consider the position of these men who acted in good faith in responding to an advertisement and presenting themselves for interview, to consider the position of eminent surgeons who, if they lose these appointments, cannot completely efface from their record the fact that at one time they were dismissed from appointments within a few weeks, or even months, of getting them.  If the sub-section is carried, I sincerely hope that these men, having been appointed, will be judged on their merits and that no precipitate action will be taken against them merely because they accepted appointments under a board with whom the new board could not see eye to eye.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Deputies who are opposed to Section 12 seem to be so, not merely from a lack of full information as to the background to this section, but from a misconception of its purpose.  I am sorry that when Deputy McCann, chairman of the Select Committee, was speaking last night, he did not take more time to explain, particularly to fellow Deputies of his own Party, the background to this section and the approach which brought the Bill in its present form before the House.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here, not with the problems of members of the medical profession or of members of the joint committee.  When this Bill came before the House on Second Reading, the House, as part of the law-making machinery of this country, saw fit to adopt the principle embodied in the long title to the Bill, namely, that it was necessary and desirable to provide suitable machinery for the constitution of the governing committee of this hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The manner in which the House received the Bill on Second Reading was a compliment to the House and to the Deputies.  The Bill was approached solely on the basis that we were dealing here with an institution which exists primarily, not for the benefit of the medical profession, or the members of any joint committee, or administrators of a hospital, but for the purpose of the treatment and care of sick people and that, therefore, the sole concern of the House was to ensure that that hospital, that centre of medical treatment for sick people, would be provided not with the personnel of a joint committee, but with the machinery whereby a committee could be provided which would be suitable to the high purpose of the institution.  No member of the House, on Second Reading, had any regard to the background of this whole matter; but solely concerned himself with the question that we are dealing here, not merely with a hospital, but with a public hospital whose area of responsibility extends over the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, whose existence and future is dependent on public moneys and whose sole purpose is the treatment and care of the sick.</P>
    <P>The House referred the Bill to a Select Committee representative not merely of all Parties in the House but of all non-Party groups as well.  Those of us who served on that Select Committee found that the atmosphere was a happy one and an unusual one in the sense that all of the matters that came before the Select Committee were decided, almost without exception, by a unanimous decision.  From the first meeting of that committee, it was unanimously decided that the responsibility handed to us by this House was to confine ourselves exclusively to the problem of providing by way of the Bill the most suitable and the most acceptable type of machinery for the carrying on of the government of the hospital.</P>
    <P>When, on the completion of the Second Reading of the Bill by this House, that became publicly known, especially to all parties interested in and concerned with the Meath Hospital, and the progress of the Bill through the House, it must have become <Col N="618" /> equally apparent to those parties that this House, as part of the law-making machinery of the community and also as one of the highest representative public bodies in the community, had passed judgment, not on the personnel of the existing joint committee or on its legality, but on the desirability of providing a more suitable and more acceptable type of machinery for the provision of the governing committee of the hospital.</P>
    <P>The members who submitted the amendment which is now embodied in Section 12&mdash;and again it is well to stress that the supporters of that amendment were drawn from all Parties and all shades of opinion&mdash;had in mind that, the Dáil having indicated its opinion upon the principle, if, as had been indicated by the decision on Second Reading, there was going to be provided machinery which, in the mind of the members of the corporate body of the Oireachtas, was a suitable and a preferable type of machinery for the provision of the governing body of the hospital, it was not merely a question of public interest, but a matter of courtesy to this House, that nothing should be done which would create a new and drastically changed situation from the time when that decision upon principle was taken until such time as the new governing body would be elected in accordance with the machinery finally decided upon by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In that they were actuated by their concern, not merely to avoid becoming embroiled in the general atmosphere that had surrounded the hospital for some time, but to confine themselves to the terms of reference given to them by the House and to discharge the responsibility that had been placed upon them.  It was, therefore, from that point of view that the amendment was submitted.  Not merely was the amendment submitted by a group of members of the Select Committee which was representative of all shades of opinion in the House, but the amendment was adopted by a unanimous decision of the Select Committee. Therefore, when the amendment is examined, it should be examined not in the light of special pleading for any <Col N="619" /> group or any individual who may be affected in any way by its operation, but it should be examined in relation to the principle underlying it and the purpose for which it was put forward and adopted by the Select Committee.</P>
    <P>That is the background in so far as the section is concerned.  When we examine the amendment itself, we will recollect that it has already been pointed out that what in effect is proposed by the section is that a joint committee will be elected by the machinery finally decided upon by the Oireachtas and embodied in legislation. More important still is the fact that the machinery now set out represents a fundamental, a basic change from the machinery already provided in the Bill on the occasion of its First Reading.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised that this is not merely a hospital, that it is a public hospital dependent on public funds and able to continue only to the extent that it is provided for by public funds.  The viewpoint of members who are interested in the Bill and the viewpoint now before the House in the form of the report of the Select Committee is that the decisive authority should repose in the representatives of public authorities who, by their representative character, have been charged with speaking&mdash;and they are entitled to speak on behalf of the public&mdash;not merely as individual representatives, but as the representatives of large and most important corporate bodies.  These are the representative type&mdash;whoever the individuals may be is another matter&mdash;who, when the Bill becomes law, will be charged with the major authority under the new joint committee.</P>
    <P>To suggest that men and women of such a representative character will concern themselves with anything but the primary purpose of the hospital&mdash; that is, the welfare of the patients&mdash;is unfair and is contrary to the whole experience of the manner in which members of public authorities discharge their particular functions.</P>
    <P>In so far as the powers proposed to be given to them under Section 12 are concerned, it has been indicated that <Col N="620" /> they are permissive.  Does any Deputy suggest that in respect of appointments&mdash;and I have in mind the particular appointments that have already been made&mdash;the power given under Section 12 is to be used by representative public men and women, sitting on the joint committee, not merely in their individual capacity, but as representing corporate bodies from whom they have been selected, is going to be used in an arbitrary fashion, in an unfair fashion or in a manner that will be harmful to the main purpose of the hospital, which is the welfare of the patients?</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that appointments do not consist merely of the appointment of individuals to particular posts.  A hospital is a machine; it may be an efficient or an inefficient machine&mdash;that is a matter to be determined by those charged with the government of the hospital.  The government of the hospital, in so far as this Bill is concerned, is intended to be vested primarily in the hands of those public representatives who will sit on the committee, duly advised and guided by experts who are members of the medical profession.  But the final authority will lie with the members of the joint committee, and from that point of view they must have regard, not merely to existing or future appointments, but to the administrative side and the medical system which is represented by those appointed.  Changes in appointments, or additions to appointments, may not merely raise the question of the professional qualifications of the appointees, but may, in fact, raise the question of drastic and fundamental changes in the administration and in the medical practice.</P>
    <P>It is sufficient for those who support the section that the Dáil has decided on the principle that it is desirable to provide better and more acceptable machinery in respect of the government of this hospital, and it is only fair that those who will be charged as public representatives, under the machinery devised by the Oireachtas, with the responsibility of carrying on the hospital, should not be hampered or interfered with, but should be given <Col N="621" /> a completely unqualified opportunity of making their decisions in regard to maintenance or the changes they desire in the existing administration or the medical practice of the hospital; in other words, that it is desirable that the Dáil, having given attention to this matter, should see to it that the <i>status quo</i> is maintained until a new joint committee arising out of the machinery provided in this measure has taken up office.  Whether that is a reasonable point of view or not is a matter that can be discussed.  It is not an unfair point of view; it has no ulterior purpose and it is in keeping with, and fully justified by, the decision of the Dáil on the Second Reading.  It is represented by the section as it now stands.</P>
    <P>It has been indicated that the section is permissive.  I have no doubt that, in so far as the gentlemen who have been appointed are concerned, no question, so far as I can see as a layman, can arise in regard to their medical qualifications.  Why there should be this special pleading, I fail to understand. The only question that could conceivably arise, and it is a matter for the new joint committee, is the final overriding question as to what extent the changes that have taken place, the appointments, are for the ultimate benefit of the sick people who will have to be treated in the hospital.</P>
    <P>On that aspect, I feel that if we, as the Dáil, are of the opinion that the changes are desirable&mdash;the machinery to constitute the joint committee&mdash;we should equally have faith in this, that the machinery we are providing is going to produce a joint committee of men and women who will accept their fundamental responsibility to the patients and place that above all other considerations.  If they do that, there can be no doubt and no nervousness on the part of any individual, whether he be a lay administrator or a member of the medical profession, that if he has the qualifications and competency to discharge his responsibility to the patients, he will not be in any jeopardy.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is the most important aspect of this section.  Listening to the viewpoints expressed in opposition to the section, I was somewhat concerned <Col N="622" /> with the high level on which the House dealt with the Bill on Second Reading, and the high level at which the Select Committee considered it and were able to arrive at a unanimous expression of opinion.  They brought back to the House a Bill which clearly sets out the purpose and the principle which this House approved and had in mind on the Second Reading, and it would be regrettable if we were to step down a little from that high level.  I think it is important to note that the Deputies from all sides of the House who so far have spoken in opposition to the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in opposition to Section 12, have not, quite frankly, had the advantage of membership of the Select Committee.  I am one of those who believe that committee machinery can assist the progress of business in this House.  It is clear in this instance that those who have been most closely associated with the work of the Select Committee have had a certain advantage but I do think that other members who have not been members of the Select Committee, should read very carefully the report of the committee and pay particular attention to the manner in which the decisions were arrived at and the atmosphere in which the report has been produced.  I personally feel that Section 12 is not merely necessary but is almost a corollary to Section 4, which deals with the proposed constitution of the joint committee. It is to me quite clear, if we take the view that the main body of authority and responsibility in the future joint committee should devolve on those members who have a public representative character, that then we should take the stand that they should have a free and unfettered opportunity, from the first of their meetings, to deal with the problem which will be handed on to them by the passing of this Bill. So far as medical appointments are concerned, reference has been made to certain sections of the Act of 1815, to which everybody rightfully takes exception. These limiting sections, so far as appointments are concerned, no longer exist but more important still, <Col N="623" /> not merely will the joint committee as proposed in the Bill be constituted with a majority of public representatives, but clearly and unmistakably for the first time, the joint committee will have the final and the sole power of making appointments.  Therefore, any fears that conceivably might lie in the minds of members of this House or persons outside as to the manner in which the Meath Hospital will be conducted in future, can quite readily be set at rest.  On the basis of the machinery set out in the Bill, the proposed constitution of the committee and the new powers of the committee, I feel that in so far as we are asking a body of men and women to take upon their shoulders a somewhat difficult and onerous task, we should express our confidence in them to the extent of allowing Section 12 to stand, being assured that it will not be abused and that it will be operated in the interests of the patients who will be the future inmates of this hospital. These are the important aspects we should have in mind in dealing with the section.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to other matters with which I am not competent to deal in regard to the practical application of the Bill, but these are purely matters for other spheres of activity.  As to the question of retrospective legislation, that does not arise.  Section 12 is not retrospective. Section 12 comes into force only on the appointed day after the Act is passed.  The only effect of Section 12 is to free the hands of the joint committee which will take up office by virtue of the decision of the Oireachtas, and to put them into the position of dealing with this problem, a problem which this House has already decided existed and required attention, a problem which should be decided on the lines set out in the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Larkin has approached the problem of the Bill in a spirit that is highly worthy of the House.  I oppose the section in the very same spirit.  My friend, Deputy Cowan, interjected to describe this section as permissive.  I fundamentally doubt the necessity for this section at all because I am perfectly satisfied, and I think the House on my reasoning will be perfectly satisfied, that in this joint hospital committee, this ultimate authority, will repose authority to deal with its own staff whether or not the section is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In public institutions, public hospitals, of the boards of which many Deputies are members, either as trustees or by way of being members of the joint committee, Deputies are perfectly well aware that the complete control of staff is vested in the governing authority.  The sinister application I see in this section has, I think unwittingly, crept into it not with any bad intention, but I would say from a misconceived good intention, because it is odious to me in the normal way, looking at the section, to feel that certain individuals or people appointed after a certain day should be the only people subject to a particular application. It is true that the case will be made that these people did make application for and received confirmation in a post in the teeth of a principle that had been established by the Bill. Taking Deputy Larkin's own argument, a principle has been established <Col N="625" /> and has been unanimously accepted, as to the manner of selecting the people to control the hospital, but the fact that a medical appointment or any type of appointment, has already been made does not in the least detract from the authority of any body appointed to control the hospital under this Bill.  I say to the House, in all earnestness, as one who has no personal interest in these appointments, even though it will be suggested facetiously I know, by my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, that the Cork Deputies are all interested because the appointees are Corkmen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Why is it necessary to bring into this Bill a positive section repeating the power that already exists? <Col N="626" /> Why is it necessary to bring into the Bill particular appointees who, by virtue of this section, may be harbouring unnatural grievances that they may not have at all?  If the section is not there no one can be affected by it, and so the power and authority is going to rest exclusively in the hands of the people who will ultimately be selected, under the machinery which this Bill sets out, to control the hospital.

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether there is any necessity for this particular section.  I perfectly well appreciate what was actuating the minds of the members of the Select Committee.  I think they felt that there might have been a certain affront offered to Dáil Éireann by what they suggest was the haste in advertising certain posts.  I think that, with or without this section, which is permissive, the body which will ultimately be the authority in the Meath Hospital will be able to deal with its own internal problems and not leave any odium that there was any particular type of appointment, or any particular day fixed, on which they could, without any reason, arbitrarily dismiss anybody.  I do not believe there is any such intention in the minds of those who may be the ultimate authority of the Meath Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think any reasonable people, charged with the responsibility, as Deputy Larkin has so ably suggested, of the care and welfare of the sick, are not going to act in any arbitrary fashion.  I would hate to think so little of the members selected by the corporate bodies who are going to send representatives to be the majority on the new committee in control were of so little consequence as to leave themselves open to the charge of exercising arbitrary authority.  I do not believe that is so.  My objection to this section is based purely and sincerely on the belief that, I think, the central authority will have the power, irrespective of this section, to deal with their own problems of <Col N="627" /> staffing.  I feel that if the section were not in the Bill their powers would not be impaired.  There is nobody, then, in a position to try and suggest that any section of an Act of the Oireachtas was, either by way of retrospective legislation or by way of inference, capable of being interpreted as victimising anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Larkin say that this was a hospital catering for the Twenty-Six Counties and not merely a Dublin hospital, as some people in this House seem to think.  We have been told that patients come from all over the country to it.  Therefore, Deputies from all parts of the country are entitled to be as much interested in it as Dublin Deputies.  The position, as I see it, is that for a couple of hundred years there were appointments made in this hospital without even an advertisement being issued.  We have no evidence as to whether those appointments were made on merit or not. They certainly were not open to all our medical men to apply for them. A new board was appointed, and it decided that certain appointments were necessary.  That board, as it stands at present, is a legally constituted board.  That was proved in our High Court recently.  For the first time in the history of this hospital advertisements for these appointments appeared in the <i>Medical Journal.</i> The board received applications from 20 people, some of whom were Irishmen practising in England, while some were unaware of any of the things that we are talking about now.  I think Deputy Lynch made it very clear last night, and there should be no doubt about it, that the people who are opposing this section are not opposed to the Bill in general.  We think it is a good Bill and, perhaps, a necessary Bill, but we think there should be no legislation introduced in this House to deprive an official of any position which he holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned here that this board took advantage of the breathing space there was between the introduction and the passing of this Bill to fill those appointments.  When the Harbours <Col N="628" /> Act was passing through this House, every harbour board in the country made appointments before the Bill became law, and all those appointments were sanctioned afterwards by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He did so, I expect, because he recognised that these bodies had a legal existence at the time, and had a perfect right to make the appointments.  I think the same position exists here. This body, which was proved to be a legal body in the High Court, decided to make appointments, and, when they advertised these appointments, it was decided by Deputies to put in this amendment.  What surprises me is this: if the Deputies were so anxious that we should have the most efficient doctors in charge of this hospital, why did they not bring in a section which would allow them to deal with all the doctors in this institution?  Apparently, they are quite satisfied that the people who are elected without any competition, without any advertisement or without any examination, are quite competent. We have here medical men who come not alone from poor stock in this country but men who are highly qualified, who went across to England to gain experience and applied for these posts. In order to qualify for these posts they had to have two major degrees.  I think that was a sufficient precaution which was taken by the existing board to see that they got properly qualified men. I cannot see why, if those people are so anxious to see that the most efficient doctors are provided, they did not put something into this Bill to allow the committee to get rid of the people who, as I said before, got their positions without any competition whatever.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Corkmen. I do not think it is because they are Corkmen that some people are objecting, but I think they have as good a right to be appointed to a hospital which caters for the Twenty-Six Counties as to any other hospital.  If the board are going to take action over these appointments their first step should be to take action against the people who wrote and spoke and threatened these men that once the Bill was passed they would be kicked out.  That is the first thing this board should be interested <Col N="629" /> in inquiring into and not into highly qualified men who got their jobs by competition.  If that board would examine into the efficiency of the men who got in without competition they would be doing something far more in keeping with what is being said.</P>

      <P>I have a definite objection to the wording of Section 12.  I notice that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is in it&mdash; that the joint committee may, without assigning any reason therefor, dismiss or remove a doctor from office.  I am a long distance away from the situation in Dublin and I do not know what is wrong, why there should be all this confusion about the running of a hospital in Dublin when the main object should be to treat the patients properly and to get the best men possible to do it.</P>

I want it to be clear to all concerned that there was a general agreement that there should be a better system of election in the future.  I do not think it was in the mind of any of us who did not speak on that occasion that the election was to take place within a certain period, but that it was to take place at the normal time.

      <P>I have it here. The Deputy can get up and contradict me if he wants to.  The only point I want to make on the section is that the committee has legally done something and that this House is giving authority, if it is not already there, to this committee when it comes in to dismiss without assigning any reason. I know that is a rather serious step to take.  It has been argued that that authority is already there; if it is there, then we are merely copper fastening it by giving that express authority to dismiss without assigning any reason.</P>

      <P>I ask the House to be very careful before it passes this section.  I suggest this is not in accord with natural justice.  Where a body has legally and lawfully carried out some administrative act, this House should not step in and say: &ldquo;No, you cannot do that,&rdquo; or authorise them to upset some decision because, if that is done, we are striking at the very root of lawful administration.

      <P>As chairman of the Select Committee I ask the House to view this matter objectively and impersonally. The Bill was introduced here carrying on it the signatures of Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, Deputy Peadar Doyle, Deputy Michael O'Higgins and myself.  Three former Lords Mayor of Dublin signed that Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Three former Lords Mayor sponsored the Bill.  The facts are that representations had been made to us as responsible Deputies representing the citizens of Dublin that all was not well at the Meath Hospital and that there was maladministration there.  We were concerned primarily and principally, and the Select Committee at all times concerned itself solely, with the welfare of the patients in that hospital irrespective of whether they came from Dublin, Cork, Leitrim, Belfast or anywhere else throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>We must approach this matter frankly.  The Bill was introduced and received a unanimous Second Reading.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and I indicated, when speaking briefly on that Second Reading, perhaps too briefly now, that our minds were not in accord with everything that was in the Bill as it stood and that we intended to amend it in certain respects; we indicated that we did not hold with the ten-guinea subscription and we did not hold with the section which gave the medical board the right to elect when a vacancy occurred.  We believed that the hospital should be administered democratically and we believed that the public representatives should have control.  We approached the Bill in Select Committee in that spirit.</P>
      <P>As chairman of that committee I was at all times impartial.  I did not concern myself with any amendments other than drafting amendments.  But I must be frank and open and above board on this particular matter, as I hope I am open and above board in every other matter.  A change was needed in the Meath Hospital.  The Bill provided for that.  The Bill provided that a new joint committee should be set up.  While that Bill was in Select Committee, having received a unanimous Second Reading from the House, the administration in the Meath Hospital proceeded to short circuit the legislation pending before the House and, in fact, to hold this House in contempt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it charitable to the committee that the Deputy should say they did that?  Does he allege <Col N="634" /> that this committee does not consist of law-abiding citizens with a sense of justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that plenty of things happen that are within the law. At all stages I preferred to approach this matter dispassionately.  My first approach was that we should not turn the committee into a court of law and that no reference should be made there to any public proceedings; that we would not listen to persons representing any particular point of view but that we would be prepared at all times to consider as exhaustively as possible all representations made if they were made in writing.  I think we approached the matter in as fair a manner as it could be approached.</P>
      <P>The difficulty then arose that while legislation was actually pending and while it was in Select Committee certain things were happening. Appointments were being advertised which we had been informed were not necessary.  I was born within a stone's throw of the Meath Hospital and I have lived all my life within a stone's throw of that hospital.  I have an intimate association with it.  I and members of my family have been treated at that hospital.  I know the work that the physicians and surgeons have done there.  So far as I and my constituents are concerned, they have done very good work and done it most efficiently for the very poor who were not in a position to pay them as much as a halfpenny.</P>

      <P>There are Corkmen on the staff.  I think Mr. Lane is a Corkman and I am certain that Dr. O'Leary is.  However, I prefer not to be sidetracked. When this legislation was going through the House this action was taken by the joint committee, a joint committee which was to be dismissed under this Bill.  What action were they taking?  They were advertising certain posts which they filled last Thursday.  We have heard quite a lot about that because a most unsavoury canvass was conducted within the precincts of the House over the last few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>And misrepresenting the other.  No mention was made here by any Deputy of the doctors who were dismissed from the Meath Hospital on 31st January of this year. Is there to be one law for one section and another for another section?  I hold the same law should apply to all sections.  I have always held that.  I believe that is what the declaration of the Irish Republic from the steps of the General Post Office meant in 1916; all sections were the same.  That is the attitude I have adopted in my approach to this matter, as I have adopted it in my approach to every other matter.  Four men, Doctors Montgomery, O'Hanlon, Stevens and Henry were dismissed.  We heard nothing about them.  I do not know who will constitute the new board.  I do not know what attitude the new board will take.  That section is there and if the new board feels that these appointments are superfluous they may remove them.  Remember this&mdash; and it is important&mdash;the present joint committee of the Meath Hospital are not happy about these appointments. It was a hairline decision when they decided to make these appointments. Since that, Senator Colgan and two others have resigned from the board of the Meath Hospital, and four members have stated in the public Press that, while not resigning, they are in full agreement with Senator Colgan and the two others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an important point.  Why did they resign?  Senator Colgan stated in the Press that he resigned because, in his opinion, the appointments are superfluous and that the question should have been deferred for three months until the new board <Col N="636" /> was appointed.  These are the facts of the case.  It has been represented here that the gentlemen in question&mdash; I do not doubt their qualifications; I believe they are very well qualified&mdash; did not know of the retrospective clause in this legislation.  Between last night and to-day I have ascertained that on the day they were interviewed &mdash;a fortnight ago to-day all applicants were interviewed&mdash;each applicant was shown a copy of a newspaper which carried the story that the Select Committee had, in fact, passed this retrospective legislation.  I make that point because it has been repeated here and elsewhere that these men had no knowledge of the retrospective clause.</P>
      <P>So far as the interviewing board was concerned, again, under the new Bill the medical board will merely have the power of examining the credentials and recommending to the joint committee.  The joint committee will have the power to appoint.  Under the old 1815 Act, as it stands, the medical board has the power of making the appointments.  We have repealed any portion of the 1815 or the 1898 Acts that was unsavoury.  We recommended to the Select Committee that they be repealed and I think, taking everything into consideration, that we did our job in a strictly impartial manner having regard to the fact that all the time we were charged with the responsibility of bringing back into this House a Bill which could be said to be a good democratic measure.  Those of us who spoke on the Second Reading had done what we had indicated we would do on the Second Reading. I make a frank and open avowal.  I believe that this section should be in the Bill.  I believe that the Dáil should pass this section so that if the joint committee to be elected under this Bill agree with those members who have resigned from the present joint committee that the appointments are superfluous they can deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that this section should have been discussed in any atmosphere of controversy at all.  I do not think it is wise that it should.  A number of Deputies from the south have spoken in opposition to the section.  I think some of them <Col N="637" /> made a case against the adoption of sub-section (2) of Section 12 which might appear to be reasonable.  I have endeavoured, even though I am one of those who sponsored this particular sub-section, to approach this with an open mind and to listen to the arguments put up by the Deputies in opposition and to the arguments and marshalling of arguments by Deputies Larkin and McCann.  I have come to the conclusion that, on balance, the arguments are definitely in favour of retention of this section in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to say this.  Deputy McCann mentioned a canvass of Deputies carried out within the last couple of days.  I was not canvassed at all, but I would not resent it if I were canvassed.  I think that any person who wants to approach a Deputy in this House is perfectly entitled to do so.  If a person wants to make a case against any legislation going through the House I think it is that person's right to make his representations to his Deputy.  Perhaps, unfortunately, but nevertheless it is the duty of the Deputy to listen to such representations. While saying that in disagreement with Deputy McCann's remarks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us do a lot of canvassing before we get in here. Deputy McCann was chairman of this Select Committee.  As a person in the opposite benches, I would like to pay him a tribute which is his due.  I was not able to attend all the meetings of the Select Committee, but when I did attend I have no hesitation in saying that Deputy McCann certainly was a very impartial chairman.  He approached the problem of the Meath Hospital and the Meath Hospital Bill in a spirit of trying to bring back to the Dáil from the Select Committee a Bill which would meet the problem which arose in connection with the hospital and which would give the hospital a proper charter and a proper method of selecting a joint committee. <Col N="638" /> I think it is due to Deputy McCann to say that.  As one who may have played a less part than others on the Select Committee, I am free to pay the same compliment to a number of other Deputies of all Parties who worked in complete harmony on that committee to produce the Bill which is now before us.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the argument put forward by Deputies Flanagan and Lynch that the inclusion of this section in the Bill will inflict a grave hardship on the people who are appointed to these recently advertised posts.  It is true, as Deputy McCann said, that the people who applied for these positions must have been aware of the legislation pending in the Dáil.  The joint committee of the Meath Hospital undoubtedly were aware of the legislation which was pending.  On the 6th of December last the Second Reading of this Bill was passed unanimously by the Dáil.  Despite the fact that the present joint committee in charge of the hospital had at least a very significant hint from the Dáil that this legislation would be passed, they took certain decisions which they were perfectly entitled by law to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Justice was somewhat naïve in making the point that any Deputies supporting this section are doing so on the ground that the committee did anything which was not strictly in accordance with law.  Undoubtedly the committee had a legal right to advertise these posts and to make these appointments.  No one is questioning their legal authority to do so, and, since this matter has already been disposed of by the courts, no one can, or should, now question the legal status of the present board or committee. They are entitled to be there, entitled to act as a committee and entitled to take any decisions in accordance with law which they may choose to take.  They took this decision, as they had a legal right to do, but what exercises my mind is consideration of the question as to whether it was fair to do it or not.  I do not question the legality of it, but was it fair to make these appointments?  Was it fair or courteous not only to Dáil Éireann but to the people who made application <Col N="639" /> and subsequently succeeded in getting these appointments, that, with the knowledge the committee had that this legislation was pending and the fact that the Second Reading had been unanimously accepted, this action should have been taken?  That is a matter which the committee and the individual members of the committee must make up their own minds on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly did.  It got quite an amount of publicity in the papers.  In any event, as Deputy McCann has indicated, the committee were obviously not unanimous as to whether their action was the correct action or not.  Some members of the committee after this action was taken, resigned, and I think they used the expression that the appointments were injudicious in making known publicly their resignations.  As Deputy McCann has also pointed out, subsequent to that, the public representatives on the committee made known their attitude.  I refer now to the public representatives and not to those who were elected or appointed to the committee under the old procedure which this House unanimously wants to do away with&mdash;the public representatives who are on that committee by virtue of being public representatives. They made known their views and their attitude with regard to this decision of the committee and their attitude was that the appointments should not have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rather resent&mdash;I do not want to do it in any heated way&mdash;the suggestion made by some speakers against this sub-section that those of us who support the section are in any way questioning the qualifications, the characters or the capabilities of the gentlemen who were appointed to these posts. I certainly am not doing that and I do not think any Deputy who supports this section is doing it.  Reading the names of these gentlemen in the newspapers, I think I know one of them quite well personally and I am the last person in this House who would wish to do the person I have in mind an <Col N="640" /> injury.  I would much prefer to be able to assist him.  I believe his qualifications and the qualifications of the others appointed are not only excellent qualifications but probably qualifications of the highest order.  That is not what is in question in this section, and it is unfair to suggest that any slur is being cast on either the characters of the people appointed or on their high academic qualifications.  That is not being done.</P>
    <P>I do not think the question of grave hardship mentioned by Deputy Lynch and Deputy Flanagan arises at all. Deputy Flanagan seemed to think that something underhand, something of a bullying nature, something sinister, had been done because one applicant, and possibly all the applicants, for all I know, received a letter from a certain gentleman&mdash;I think the name mentioned was Robinson, though I do not know anything about him&mdash;enclosing a copy of this Bill with Section 12 marked. There are two points of view about that.  I do not for a moment accept that that was done in any sinister or bullying fashion.  It seems to me that it was probably done out of prudence and courtesy, so that people applying for these posts would be made aware without further delay of this provision in sub-section (2).  I cannot see anything wrong with that; I cannot see anything sinister in it; and I do not think it was intended in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice commented on the fact that the committee were legally entitled to act as they have acted.  I agree with that, but the Minister went on to make the suggestion that the enactment of Section 12 would make the acts of the committee illegal.  That is simply not so.  The enactment of Section 12, as Deputy Lynch and other Deputies pointed out, is permissive.  It enables the new committee to act in a certain manner and emphasises that, by doing that, they also will be acting in a legal manner.  Deputy Collins&mdash;and I think he had the tacit approval of the Minister for Justice in this argument, at least it was mentioned as an aside by the Minister&mdash;argued that this section was not necessary because the power to act as the committee would be authorised to act by this section <Col N="641" /> would, in any event, be vested in the new joint committee.  If we accept that as being correct&mdash;and I am prepared to accept it&mdash;why is there any opposition to this section?  If this section merely re-states the law, even though it may be doing so in more emphatic language, why are Deputies opposed to the section?  What would it benefit Deputies or the holders of these posts if that section were dropped?  Assuming that Deputy Collins' argument is correct, assuming that the section was not in the Bill and never appeared in the Bill, that the authority to act in this manner would be inherent in the new joint committee, why is there any opposition to the section?  I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice also gave it as his opinion that this section was not in accord with justice.  I cannot see where the injustice comes in.  Surely the committee are entitled to have this power, to be able to come to decisions and act in this way regarding any members of the staff?  Either they are entitled to do that or not.  If they are not, who then is to have the authority?  I wonder if any Deputy opposed to this section would answer that one.  Deputy Corry seems to think that in common with other Corkmen he would be taking up the cudgels against this section.  Probably he will answer that one when he does.</P>

      <P>A suggestion has been made&mdash;I think it was by Deputy McGrath of Cork&mdash;that there was something wrong in enacting this sub-section to deal with appointments between 6th December and the appointed day and not to refer to earlier appointments.  It may be that there is something in their argument, but I think Deputy McGrath will appreciate the reason why the date 6th December, 1950, was inserted in the Bill.  That was the date on which this House formally signified its assent, in principle at any rate, to this Bill.  Deputy Hickey of Cork was also opposed to this section, his objections being on much the same lines as those of Deputy McGrath.  Deputy Lynch of Cork opposed it on the grounds which I mentioned already, that there <Col N="642" /> was a grave hardship to the people who were appointed and that there was something sinister in the threat to determine the services of these people. I have dealt with those points already. Deputy Ted O'Sullivan of Cork also opposed this section.  Possibly when he opposed it he was in a different position from the others who have since opposed it, in that he was a Corkman with no special connection with the City of Dublin or with the hospital situated in the middle of the city and he saw in this Bill a section which appeared to him to require explanation. That explanation has been given very fully by Deputy Larkin and Deputy McCann and probably Deputy O'Sullivan will accept it.  I have already dealt with the objections made by Deputy Collins of Cork.  If he is right in his argument, it at least has the effect of completely scuttling opposition to this section.</P>

      <P>First of all, I am deeply grateful to the three Corkmen who called my attention to this section.  I can quite understand the mentality of the four Dublin Deputies, O'Higgins, Larkin, O'Sullivan and McCann. When they find a terrible injury happening and three Corkmen getting jobs in Dublin, they bring in a special section to knock them out.  I can understand the mentality of that, but I am deeply grateful to those who called my attention to the section. The section embodies a principle which could very well be put into effect in other spheres.  It has a smack of Tammany Hall about it.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person was, after the 6th day of December, 1950, and before the appointed day, appointed to any office, then, notwithstanding the terms and conditions on which he was appointed, the joint committee may, without assigning any reason therefor, dismiss or remove him from that office.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the reason for putting it in. Deputy O'Higgins is anxious to know who is going to have the power of dismissal. The joint committee may dismiss a person for some reason and if they dismiss without reason the man <Col N="643" /> has a legal remedy; but if this section is passed he apparently has no legal remedy.</P>

      <P>There is a principle underlying this section which I view with horror and dread being brought into this House at all.  Political Parties when in office have power to make certain appointments.  Are we to have it now that when that political Party goes out, those who come after them may fire out without any reason every judge and district justice who was appointed by their predecessors? The principle being brought in here is the predecessor to that.  When Fine Gael rewards some long-suffering penniless barrister by putting him in charge of the imposing of a £5 fine on a fellow because he had no shoes on his donkey&mdash;those things are done&mdash; those who come after him are to sack that man again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Even to-day, those who have obtained a legal appointment, who are legally there and put there by a body legally entitled to appoint them, are to have their appointments nullified by this Bill.  This is done because some Corkmen happened to succeed in getting three jobs in Dublin.  Their qualifications are not disputed.  There were 20 applicants for the job.  They were interviewed by the interview board&mdash;I do not know that there was any Corkman on it&mdash;but just because that board decided those four men were the best qualified and should get the positions, a special section of a Bill is brought in here, which was not in the previous Bill, to nullify the appointment. This is a section to throw out the young man who gave up his position in England and came over here to fill a publicly advertised position after he <Col N="644" /> had applied for it and gone before an interview board.  Then we are told that we have the highest opinion of their qualifications, that nothing is going to happen and that those men will be happy without any job.  What will happen to those men if this special section is brought in to fire them out? What will happen when they are applying for the next job?  They will be told: &ldquo;You are the fellow that a special Act of Parliament was brought through the Dáil to throw you out of your job.&rdquo;  That is what I object to. This is a nullification of justice and is doing a most unjust action to four individuals, citizens of this State, who surely are entitled to fair protection.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to say that the joint committee was not entitled to advertise those positions or make those appointments. That is not the question; the question is that after the committee had advertised the appointments those men came from any part of the world, applied for them and got them because they were the best qualified, and then this special section is brought into this House and the members of this House are supposed to be fools enough to pass it.  If I rightly understand it, they are the first four members of the staff of that hospital who ever got their positions by public advertisement and interview board.</P>
      <P>If that principle and that section is accepted by this House you will create a precedent which might very well uproot the very foundations of this State. You will have it down the country with every change of local authority after a county council or urban election. They will move on the same lines following the good example of the Dáil. When a new Government comes in they will have a look at the list of appointments made by the old team and say: &ldquo;There is a fine fat job that might suit my Michael and we will remove this judge, this district justice, this State solicitor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think I have ever listened to more nonsense than I have heard in the last few minutes from the previous Deputy on this particular section.  There have been, however, some very fine contributions to this debate, if I may say so. Deputies Larkin and McCann raised this whole question into the realm where it really belongs and as a member of the Select Committee which dealt with this Bill I would also like to pay a tribute to the chairmanship of Deputy McCann and the way in which he, and indeed the other members of the committee, approached this very difficult problem.  There is a background to this Bill, a thing I do not propose to go into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the section cannot just be considered <i>in vacuo.</i>  There is a joint committee of the hospital and they were at loggerheads with the medical board.  That is the position and the Select Committee dealing with this Bill and, in fact, the whole House, as was shown on the Second Reading, wanted to give the hospital the government which would enable it to carry on peacefully and harmoniously in the interests of the citizens of Dublin.  That is the fundamental matter in this Bill and in this section, and practically everything else is extraneous to it.  The advertisements appeared calling for four doctors and, as Deputy McCann pointed out, there were dismissals which took place before the appointments were made.  A lot of sympathy has been given to the four young men who were given these posts but I would like to point out to the House, as other speakers have done, that those candidates, in fact all the candidates as they came up for interview, were informed of the retrospective clause which had been passed by the committee.  The insistence that they should be told of that came from one of the elected public representatives; a councillor of the Dublin Corporation sitting on the Meath Hospital Board insisted that every candidate would have that information in front of him so that it could not be said that an injustice had been done to any individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In company with the other Deputies on the Select Committee, I did not like the idea of the insertion of a section which, if passed by the House, would have the effect of retrospective legislation. It is not a thing that gave any of us any pleasure whatsoever.  However, if the whole effect of this Bill were not to be nullified by the action of the joint committee, we had to bring in that retrospective section.  It was brought in so that harmony might come about in the future in the Meath Hospital. That is why I say that you cannot consider this matter <i>in vacuo.</i> It must be considered in relation to the general position in that hospital. We could not, by sections, bring about harmony at present.  If we could have done so we should have done everything possible in that connection. <Col N="647" /> would remind the Minister for Justice that the long title of the Bill is: &ldquo;An Act to reconstitute the joint committee of the institution, called the Meath Hospital and County of Dublin Infirmary...&rdquo; That is the preamble. It deals with other matters but it was in that light that this section was brought in.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointments and the advertising of them, I should say that no complaints were received either of bad treatment of patients or of an insufficiency of doctors.  No complaint that any surgical work was left undone has ever been received.  I understand that the bed occupancy figures for the Meath Hospital&mdash;the latest figure is for the year 1949&mdash;is 96 per cent., which shows that the turnover of operations and patients in the hospital is unusually high.  That figure, I understand, is the highest in Dublin.  Therefore, the case cannot be made that the hospital was either understaffed or inefficiently staffed.  We know that amongst the very many fine doctors and surgeons in that hospital there is at least one who has a world-wide reputation. I mention that because Deputy McGrath seems to cast&mdash;I think probably unwittingly&mdash;a slight on the members of the medical board of that hospital.  I do not think you could pick any hospital in Dublin, not to mention the whole of Ireland, which has a finer reputation for first-class medical and surgical work, nor any hospital which has produced on its staff down through the years more medical men of genius and of international repute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>And all the patients in lodging-houses throughout the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has mentioned that.  It happens that there is a doctor in that hospital who, as I have said, is a genius of world-wide reputation.  In order that the peculiar and unique skill of that doctor should be made available to as many as possible and that, therefore, as many lives as possible might be saved as a result of his skill&mdash;because he is unique and because he is able to save lives where even other skilled medical men might not be able to do <Col N="648" /> so&mdash;a temporary system was instituted by which patients could be placed under the best supervision in approved apartments close by the hospital, both before and after surgical care had been given to them&mdash;in other words, both before and after they went under the knife of this particular surgeon.  It was in order to give the maximum number of members of the public the benefit of this man's skill that that temporary system was adopted.</P>
      <P>There are many other points in connection with the section, but other speakers have covered them exceptionally well.  I ask the House to support this section of the Bill.  It was put there in order that that great institution should be able to carry on in a harmonious fashion.  Unfortunately, the joint committee, in opposition to the medical board, said that four new appointments were necessary.  The only way this House can deal with that matter and see that the hospital is free to carry on is to give the new committee power to reorganise the hospital on the best lines.  It would be very unfortunate if this House allowed that joint committee, which it is bringing in a Bill to get rid of, to leave its sting behind it like a dying bee and ruin the good and harmonious relations of the hospital in the future.  For these reasons, I ask the House to support this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this section has been approached under a misapprehension.  That misapprehension arose in the minds of the particular doctors who have been appointed. I do not know who told them that they would be dismissed; I do not know who sent them along to this House yesterday, but they misunderstood the position and, unfortunately, the Deputies to whom they spoke also misunderstood it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were dealing with this matter in Select Committee, we went very fully into it.  Deputy McCann has explained to the House the ideas which actuated the committee in taking the decision which they took.  I want to make it clear that when we agreed on the new constitution of the joint committee, we agreed on a committee the majority of whom would be people subject <Col N="649" /> to the elected representatives of the people in Dublin City and Dublin County and, as far as the rest of the country is concerned, to the General Council of County Councils.  That was the committee that was proposed to be set up and that this House has agreed on this stage should be set up.</P>
    <P>We knew that these appointments were being made, or about to be made.  The appointments may or not be necessary.  Members of the present joint committee, for whom I have respect, say that they were unnecessary and, at least, that the matter ought to be left over until this new committee was properly constituted.  Without waiting for that, the present joint committee, for whom I have no respect as a committee, decided that they would go ahead with these appointments. They invited applications.  They had an interview board.  They appointed certain people who, I understand from their discussions, are men of the very highest qualifications.  That is as it should be.  It is understood and recognised all over the world that the products of our medical schools are excellent. We felt that when this new joint committee would examine the running of the hospital they might come to the conclusion that it was necessary to have some or maybe all of these persons but that, if they came to the conclusion that it was not necessary for the efficient administration of the hospital to have, say, one of them or two of them, they would have the right to dismiss them without assigning any cause, simply because they were redundant and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I believe that a committee formed in the way that this committee is now being formed will not do anything unjust, will not do anything hastily.  It may be that the doctors who have been appointed will serve for long years in that hospital and will render very valuable services to the community. I sincerely hope that that will be so.  That is why I think those gentlemen did an ill-service to themselves and that the Deputies who were misled by them did an ill-service to them by some of the remarks that have been made in this House.  I would ask those Deputies who misunderstood <Col N="650" /> the position and who were misled in the course of a very short canvass on the stairs in this House to accept it from the people who were on the Select Committee, who gave long thought to this whole problem, that there is no question of any injustice likely to be done and that the barrier against injustice is set out in Section 4, which gives you a joint committee of very responsible people.  I would ask that it would be accepted in that spirit.  I would ask that it would be accepted in that spirit in the interest of the doctors concerned.  If it is accepted in that spirit and if those doctors remain in that hospital, rendering valuable service, they will themselves feel that, possibly, their action in regard to this Bill was not advisable.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the doctors concerned, in approaching members of this House, were doing it in their own personal interest and were not doing it in the interests of a section of a committee that is now administering the affairs of the hospital.  That would be a mistaken thing for them to do. They do not know the figures that have been given in this House.  They do not know many of the things that have been stated in this House, but certain members of the present joint committee do know those facts and those figures.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there is a democratic committee, mainly controlled by public representatives, and that there is very little likelihood of any injustice arising, I would submit to the House that Section 12 should be agreed to.  In its operation no injustice will be done to any individual. Let the new committee have a chance to operate.</P>
    <P>The Meath Hospital is a very old institution.  It was established in 1777 by Act of the Irish Parliament.  There was an Act in the British Parliament of 1815 which referred to the type of people who could be employed as physicians and surgeons, which referred to the colleges from which they came.  When that Act was passed, we had no National University; we had no medical school except the medical school set out in that Act, and it is <Col N="651" /> not the fault of the hospital and it is not the fault of the doctors that there has been no legislation in this country since to put an end to that unsatisfactory state of affairs.  The members of the Select Committee examined these old Acts and we eliminated anything that might be objectionable.  Everyone will agree that the work of the Select Committee was valuable and that all, these matters to which exceptional objection could be taken have been eliminated from the statutes governing the hospital.</P>
    <P>From my own personal experience in Dublin, I would say that the very high tribute paid to the hospital by Deputy Dockrell is well deserved.  The surgeons and the physicians in that hospital are men of the very highest calibre.  I, like other solicitors in this city, have very often to call on the services of these doctors in important cases in the courts in which very poor plaintiffs are vitally concerned.  I have never yet known one of them to refuse to come to court and do all he could to see that justice was done to an unfortunate plaintiff.  I am glad to be able to pay that tribute to them and I sincerely hope that the same spirit will actuate the physicians and surgeons on the medical staff of the hospital in future.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will not delay longer over this but will enable this Bill to be passed into law so that this new machinery of democratic government of the Meath Hospital may be put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a good many speeches on this Bill, and particularly to the entire speech made by Deputy McCann, to which I want to pay tribute as an objective summary of the situation.  I want to add that I subscribe entirely to everything he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was common knowledge that, as he put it, all was not well in the Meath Hospital.  It was also common knowledge that the only way in which harmonious working in that hospital, which is so necessary for the welfare of the patients, could be ensured for the future, was by this House taking positive steps to make certain that <Col N="652" /> there could not be a recurrence, from either the one side or the other, of the difficulties that had arisen.  I think it would be very unfortunate if, in the consideration of this measure, we intended to go into the question as to whether it was one side or the other that was in any way at fault; but, whatever the position was in that regard, it was quite clear that there were differences, that there were bound to be recurring differences in the future, and that in those differences existing at the time and bound to continue, one thing was absolutely certain, and that was that the patients would be the people who ultimately would suffer.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced, the sponsors of it very correctly, as Deputy McCann has already pointed out, indicated that they were not satisfied with the detail of it at all, but that they brought it in as a solution which could be altered, remodelled; they felt it would end the unhappy differences that were existing, and would enable the hospital to start out on a new scheme of administration.  I was not one of the sponsors, but I think I would be correctly interpreting their view when I say that they were not anxious to go into what had been the cause of the differences or the existence of the differences, that they were merely taking them as a fact and wanted to ensure that for the future the administration of the hospital would be harmonious.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee have brought us a scheme which will mean that the administration of the hospital will in the future be governed on a democratic basis, on a new basis that does not attribute to either one side or the other any of the difficulties that existed. That was the whole ambition of the Select Committee, to ensure that there would be a new administration in the future, that it would start off afresh and give a chance of harmonious working which is so necessary in that hospital. That was the view of this House, through its Select Committee, and it was quite well known throughout the City of Dublin, well known to every member of the committee at present operating; yet that committee chose to <Col N="653" /> try and jump over the wishes of this House, over the wishes of the Select Committee set up by this House.</P>
    <P>It is because I believe that the actions of the committee were deliberately designed to nullify and to obstruct and to prevent the chance of the new administration that this House was going to give to the Meath Hospital, it is because I believe the existing committee tried to obstruct that in the appointments they have made, that I strongly support the plea put forward by Deputy McCann as chairman of the committee&mdash;a plea that was earlier put forward by Deputy Larkin.</P>
    <P>I am looking at this matter in an entirely objective way.  We must make sure that there is a completely new approach to the administration and you can only get that new approach if you take the position as it was on the day or on the night that this House decided and made its will known that it was going to ensure that there would be a new type of administration.</P>
    <P>I do not wish in any way to comment on the merits of the people who were appointed as doctors&mdash;far be it from me to do so.  They are, I am sure, highly qualified, thoroughly qualified. My regret in that regard is that I think they have been used, unwittingly used, by certain people for other ends.  I think it was unfortunate that these doctors did not realise, on the day they were being interviewed, and when they were told&mdash;and they were told, as I have ascertained independently of the sources from which Deputy McCann ascertained it&mdash;that the Select Committee of the Dáil had decided that this section was going to go in.  It is unfortunate that they were so used, that they were unwittingly used, and I want it perfectly crystal clear that I am not, nor is anybody else to whom I have spoken about this matter, casting the slightest reflection or aspersion on their qualifications as doctors or on their anxieties in regard to the position.</P>
    <P>This House determined, I believe rightly and correctly determined, that it was undesirable that there should be any difference of opinion or any unharmonious relations in the hospital administration.  The House determined <Col N="654" /> on 6th December that it was not going to go into the question of who was right or wrong, but that it was absolutely certain that there had been some difficulty in the past year and, if it did not take action, that there would be difficulty in the coming year, that there would be another election on the old basis and there would be a tug-of-war between the different factions. The House came to the conclusion that the way to deal with the hospital, in the interest of the patients, was to set up a new administration that would give the whole thing a fresh start and it is because I believe an attempt was made to prevent that fresh start being given that I am subscribing wholeheartedly to and supporting wholeheartedly the section that has been brought in by the Select Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Front Bench on the opposite side of the House has expressed his views, perhaps I should express my views also.  I think that through our desire to avoid getting into the past and judging the merits or demerits of a certain situation, we are in difficulty in arriving at a proper sense of what is involved in this particular section. I think it would be quite wrong for the House not to accept in this case the unanimous recommendation of the Select Committee which considered this whole matter in detail&mdash;a Select Committee that consisted of representatives of all Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter came to the House it came to us in the exercise of our duty as the highest authority charged with the public interest; it came to us as a public interest question.  We knew that in a certain hospital the control was of an archaic type which lent itself to a coup.  The papers made it clear to us that a coup had been effected and, as a result of the whole business, the medical service to our people was being interfered with.  Now, as guardians of the public interest, we interfered, and the moment we interfered in this matter, it was only right that everybody should take warning and recognise that we, as the sovereign power, having interfered, were going to do our utmost to provide for the future and to see that there would be harmonious working <Col N="655" /> in this hospital.  I forget whether the Second Reading of the Bill was passed unanimously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>It was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We then set up a Select Committee, and they arrived at unanimous decisions.  At one stage, the present hospital committee, which we could only regard from the moment we took action as a caretaking committee, took an action which they must have known was going to prejudice the situation and prevent this House from dealing with the situation in what I might term a stable or frozen form.  It was only natural that the Select Committee, which wanted to provide properly for the future, should have issued a warning that they were going to freeze the position so that they would have a stable situation to consider and that steps could be taken to provide properly for the future on that basis.  They gave public notice, and I think everybody should have taken heed of that public notice.  The Select Committee of this House consisted of representatives of all parties and I do not know that any more solemn notice could have been given than the notice given, once the committee decided unanimously to make a recommendation of that kind to the Dáil.  The need for it was obvious, because if the committee, which was going to be displaced, wanted to create a chaotic situation they could clearly do so, and it was essential to safeguard against such a possibility.  Deputy McCann has been good enough from time to time to inform me of the proceedings of the committee and, so far as I know, it was in that spirit that that section was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that this is something altogether unusual in legislation.  It is not unusual.  Whenever any particular group or section of the community are about to be affected by a Bill, and it is essential that the existing situation should continue until the Bill becomes law, notice of that kind is given, and very properly given, because otherwise interested parties of all sorts would try to circumvent the purpose of the Legislature and create <Col N="656" /> a situation very different from that with which the Dáil was dealing at the start.  It was necessary in many cases to stabilise the position so as to prevent interested parties stepping in and creating a new situation.  I take it that is what is being done in this instance, and it is being done with the object of ensuring that the Dáil, when dealing with this matter, will see a certain situation continuing until the machinery they have provided can come into full action.  They want that machinery to be as free as possible to deal with the situation with which it is designed to deal.  If we were to allow the other course to develop, the new hospital committee possibly would be confronted with a situation which it would be impossible for them to remedy.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which I do not think has been referred to up to the present.  We have given notice and that notice, I am sure, has been accepted by a very large number of doctors who might in other circumstances have been candidates for these positions.  It is possible at least that a number of them would have been candidates but they accepted that notice. Therefore, having given this notice, if you now stop half-way and ignore it, you may be doing an injustice to others who might possibly have been candidates.  The only logical and proper course, therefore, for the Dáil to follow is to accept the unanimous recommendation of our committee and to accept this section, with the other sections, as it is given to us.</P>

      <P>There are few things &mdash;I suppose they are very few&mdash;that have not been said on this section.  I should like to associate myself with the main tenor of the remarks of the chairman of the Select Committee, Deputy McCann, and the observations of Deputy Larkin.  Having said that, I should like to refer to the things which have not been said.  Reference was made by Deputy McCann and Deputy Sweetman to maladministration. In Deputy McCann's phrase &ldquo;all was not well&rdquo;.  I think we must accept it that they correctly stated the position but I think it is only fair that we should go further and say this&mdash;that <Col N="657" /> those terms did not become applicable to the position in the Meath Hospital only from the time that the new committee took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure it was intended that that should be said.  I think, if we look at this matter realistically, we must realise that things have not been right and could not have been right in the Meath Hospital.  Due to what Deputy de Valera said, to its archaic situation and to many other factors, things have not been well and have not been well for very many years. I think I am entitled to say that, whatever the motives of the group of people who carried out what Deputy de Valera referred to as &ldquo;a coup&rdquo;, they did succeed&mdash;I do not wish to impute any motives to them other than the highest&mdash;in performing a useful public service by bringing about the situation which caused the present Bill to come before the Dáil in its present form.  The term &ldquo;voluntary hospital&rdquo;&mdash;I have said this already&mdash;is a misnomer, these hospitals being in the position in which they are to-day.  To my mind it is a complete anachronism that a hospital maintained mainly out of public moneys should be free from any form of popular or democratic control. One of the reasons why I welcome the Bill is that it does enshrine that principle of popular and democratic control.</P>
      <P>Let me make this personal explanation to the House.  Reference was made on a number of occasions to the fact that the Second Reading of the Bill was unanimous.  I certainly would have gone on record as opposing the Bill in the terms in which it was introduced, were it not for the fact that Deputy McCann and Deputy Martin O'Sullivan very properly indicated that they themselves envisaged radical amendment of the Bill in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the Select Committee, let me say that the Bill was radically amended in Committee.  I would find considerable difficulty in supporting the Bill as introduced.  I do not know that I could.  I would have to oppose the Bill if it came before the House for final consideration in the <Col N="658" /> form in which it was first introduced. But the Select Committee, working in complete harmony, did ensure that popular and democratic control would be paramount.  Let us be frank. Deputy McCann referred to the necessity for frankness, so let us be frank and say that the position that existed in the Meath Hospital, which barred graduates of the National University, was one upon which none of us, as Deputies in this House, could look on with approval or with equanimity. That was a bad position, that was a disgraceful position, and, to the extent that the existing committee are responsible for having ended that position, I think that the public are in their debt.  Many rather hard things were said about these gentlemen here to-day.  I can say truthfully that, personally, I think only one of them is known to me, or perhaps two.  I know nothing about their motives, but I think it is only fair that, in appraising the situation, we should realise the condition of affairs which existed in the Meath Hospital prior to the carrying out of what has been described as a <i>coup d'état.</i>  A condition of affairs existed which was not one that we should readily tolerate.</P>
    <P>One thing that rather disquieted me here was a reference made by Deputy Flanagan, a reference that a threat had been issued to one of the successful applicants recently appointed by the existing committee.  I hope and believe that the machinery which we are now setting up will be such that these gentlemen will in no way be barred from consideration for these posts.  The section is a purely permissive one.  If any person issued a threat of the nature described by Deputy Flanagan, then to my mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan told the House, with what authority other than his own statement I do not know, that a threat was issued to one of these candidates.  I think it should go out from this House that conduct of that nature would meet with our strongest possible disapprobation.  I do not believe for one second that the machinery which we are now setting up will produce the type of joint committee which will make it possible for threats of that nature to be implemented. To my mind we have wasted probably&mdash;I do not propose to transgress myself&mdash;a considerable amount of time in airing personal prejudices in this House this evening.  The correct approach was the approach taken particularly by Deputy Larkin and by Deputy McCann.  Our concern here is not with the question of doctors' appointments.  That is a very minor matter.  Our concern here should be to ensure that the machinery that is being made available by this House, whereby this hospital can be properly run in the interests of the ordinary people of Dublin, should be the paramount consideration, and not the question of the appointment of doctors.  My experience of doctors is that, as a general rule, they are very well able to look after themselves.  The paramount consideration in our minds should be the interests of the patients in the hospital.</P>
      <P>I believe, quite sincerely, that the fears which have been expressed by Deputy Ted O'Sullivan, by Deputy Lynch and those opposing the section, are groundless fears.  I support the section, and I support the Bill in its present form, but let me repeat again that I did feel it necessary to underscore a little bit the fact that were it not for the action of the group of people who did come in there&mdash;that is the existing committee&mdash;we might, perhaps, be still continuing in blissful ignorance of the conditions and the archaic regulations under which the Meath Hospital was working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened <Col N="660" /> in this debate but for the fact that a number of amendments were tabled in my name.  I should like to say that these amendments were tabled inadvertently, and I apologise to the House for their appearance.  I was not a member of the Select Committee, and, therefore, I have not that intimate knowledge of this whole problem which other Deputies have. Since I was approached on this matter I have given the whole question very careful consideration, and I have come to the conclusion that the Select Committee of this House justified itself, and, to a great extent, justified the principle of appointing a Select Committee to go into matters of this kind in detail.</P>
      <P>Now, a lot of sympathy has been expressed with the doctors who are dealt with under this section.  I share the sympathy that is felt for them.  I think they deserve our consideration, and that they will deserve the consideration of the new committee.  We have constituted the committee on more or less democratic lines, and while it may not be perfect, I think it is possibly the best that could be devised in present circumstances.  I think we ought to have a reasonable amount of confidence in the members of that committee, and hope that they will take their duties seriously.  Their first and most important duty will be to preserve the continuity of harmony and efficiency in the hospital.</P>
      <P>Many interests have been mentioned in connection with this matter.  The most vital and important interest of all is the interest of the patients&mdash;the men, women and children, who are lying on their beds of pain or on the table in the operating theatre who depend entirely upon the skill and efficiency of the hospital staff.  We would be stultifying ourselves if we were to do anything to mar the work of this important hospital.  While the constitution of the governing body and other factors may have been unsatisfactory owing to the many years which have passed since this institution was established, there can be no doubt that this hospital was outstanding in its success in the treatment of patients, and that, of course, is the most important consideration of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> Some people have said that this hospital existed for the people of Dublin, and others for the patients of Dublin.  As a rural Deputy, I think I can bear witness that this hospital has served the interests of people from all parts of the country, and the tributes which have been paid to the staff of the hospital by the people from every county are clear evidence that, while all may not have been well in the constitution of the hospital, there was very little wrong with the service that was given to the community and to the patients.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely condemn the members of the present joint committee who took drastic action in this matter. People with zeal and enthusiasm often can be a great nuisance, but no progress has ever been made in any country without such types of people, and if, as I am sure will happen, a better constitution is given to this hospital, I think a very considerable amount of credit must be given to these people who intervened.  Therefore, I hope Deputies who have opposed this section will, on reconsideration, see that they are not serving a useful purpose.  The Select Committee was representative of all Parties and it has taken into consideration all aspects of the question. It has given due and long-term consideration all aspects of the question. It has given due and long-term consideration to the whole future of this hospital and hospitalisation generally, and I think the sense of responsibility which it has shown should be endorsed by this House.  Therefore, I ask those Deputies who are opposing this section to withdraw their opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who approaches the consideration of this section in an objective fashion must be driven to the conclusion that it is necessary having regard to the background in connection with the recent history of the Meath Hospital before the introduction of the Bill.  I would agree with Deputy C. Lehane that the present committee, in the <i>coup d'état,</i> as it has been referred to, which they effected, did do a good job for the hospital in drawing attention to the conditions that existed there and enabling a Bill like this to be introduced.  Every member of the Select Committee tried to <Col N="662" /> look at the various questions that came before them objectively and tried to forget all they had heard about both sides of the question.  I think we succeeded very well in doing that and that we are all a bit proud of the fact that, despite the various differences between us, we produced such a good Bill which some of us hope will serve as a model for the future government of hospitals.</P>
      <P>When this amendment&mdash;I think it was the very first amendment&mdash;was put into the Bill it was immediately published.  The Select Committee, when they agreed to it, took steps to see that publication would be made immediately, because they felt that possibly some people might be put to expense and inconvenience or that some people might even give up situations to take up positions which had been advertised and might lose them if this section passes.  I think this section should pass.  When this House unanimously agreed to the Second Reading, the present joint committee, who knew of that immediately, should have been satisfied that they had done a good job and should not, unfortunately, have set out at that time to dismiss certain people and appoint other people, knowing that the view of the Dáil was against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know who will be the members of the new joint committee to be set up under this Bill.  All we know is that they will be democratically elected and public representatives will be in a majority on the committee. Is it fair to ask people to take over the job of running that hospital, knowing the immediate background, if we delete this section and set them an immediate problem in which these various differences with regard to the dismissals and the new appointments are deeply involved?  It is unfair to them that this House should do that.  We should try to give them as clean a slate as we can.  The date in this section is the date on which this House adopted the Second Reading and it should have been clear to the members of the present committee that from that time onwards they were only a caretaker government, as Deputy de Valera said &mdash;that they were only carrying on until <Col N="663" /> the Dáil would have completed its job in connection with this Bill.  Nobody can say that there has been any delay about the putting through of this Bill. It only got a Second Reading on the 6th December.  The Select Committee got through their business during the Christmas recess and had it ready on the first day of the sitting and there has been no delay since.  Therefore, nobody can complain that there was any delay in this respect.  Consequently, this House should certainly adopt this section.</P>
    <P>When the Select Committee were considering it, I was, perhaps, the most antagonistic of the members to it at the start.  But, when one examines the question, one has to see that it is necessary.  I put it to the House that they should accept the section in that spirit.  I am sorry if any doctors have been misled into a false position, but I do not think that is the fault of this House, nor do I think that such a consideration as that should make us withdraw the provision here which would perhaps have the effect of producing more and prolonged friction in the new committee.  I suggest to those who are in favour of the deletion of this section that there are much bigger considerations than the question of the appointment of these doctors last week and that, in the interest of the hospital, of the patients in it, and of the good working of the joint committee, it is necessary that this section should be retained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this section in the Bill will be accepted unanimously. I have the advantage of being a member of the joint committee, not a governor elected by governors, but a representative nominated by the Dublin County Council.  I am familiar with the running of the board there and with the conditions existing in the hospital.  It would appear that the House is in general agreement that proper legislation in accordance with modern requirements should be implemented in relation to this particular hospital within the shortest possible time.  This is an old institution.  It is operating under old laws.  It is desirable now that it should be brought up <Col N="664" /> to date.  This Bill proposes to regularise the management of the hospital.  It is sponsored by both sides in a generous effort to try to meet present needs and to ensure that those who avail of the services of that hospital will receive the best possible treatment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan last night, and other Deputies too, seemed to start off on the wrong foot.  That may possibly have happened because they heard only one side of the story.  If they understood the position as it exists I have no doubt they would not have been misled. I have no doubt they would realise the necessity for having the management of this hospital established on a broad basis, especially with reference to Section 12.</P>
      <P>The argument put forward here has been based mainly on the fact that the 6th December was mentioned specifically. It was shown quite clearly here that 6th December was the date on which it was made known to the public that this Bill intended to provide for the management of the hospital in the future.  The argument that appointments were made since that date and that hardship may be inflicted on those who were appointed as a result of the implementation of this measure cannot therefore stand.  There has been a constant conflict with the existing medical staff in the hospital.  It is not to the advantage of the patients that such conditions should be allowed to exist. Doctors were deprived of positions which they had held there for many years.  Not only that, but they were deprived of positions in respect of which they received no pay.  They were actually sacked out of honorary posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of new medical personnel did not appear to me to be necessary especially when one considers that the sudden decision to appoint extra personnel was only taken since 6th December.  The existing joint committee had carried on for nearly two years.  Only since the 6th December comes the sudden decision to appoint extra staff.  The number of patients in the hospital has not increased. A certain number of patients is allocated to each member of the medical staff.  The doctors are well able to look after the numbers allocated <Col N="665" /> to them.  I am at at loss to know where the work is in the hospital for this newly appointed staff.  It may be said that there will be work for them in the future.  Extensions to the hospital are in course of construction at the moment but they will not be completed for at least another two years.  In the meantime these newly appointed doctors must wait until the patients come into the extension before they can engage in any work.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the month of December four doctors were dismissed. These doctors had given loyal service to the hospital.  The dismissals resulted from a certain amount of friction which has existed between the governors of the joint board and the medical board.  The conflict has been in existence for a long time.  Possibly it was that conflict which resulted in these dismissals.  The services of these men, who have given loyal and efficient service to both the hospital and the patients, will be a great loss to the hospital and to the patients.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that much of the misguided discussion which has taken place was the result of canvassing here yesterday evening.  I was one of the Deputies asked to discuss this matter with one of the appointed persons.  I refused to do so.  I am sure there were other Deputies who also refused.  But the fact remains that a high-powered canvass was carried on here yesterday evening in an effort to have this section of the Bill deleted and those Deputies who were not familiar with conditions in the hospital fell for that canvass.  They were led to believe that efforts to have this section removed were justified.</P>
    <P>Last week we saw the resignations of Senator Colgan and others from the joint committee.  These people were elected governors of the board.  They were not nominated by either the Dublin Corporation or the Dublin County Council.  They resigned because they felt that the board was acting contrary to the general purpose of this Bill.  They took the view, and it appears to be the view taken generally here, that 6th December was the <Col N="666" /> zero hour for any new appointments, and the joint committee should have taken note of that.  If we had a joint committee bad enough to do it, we could find ourselves in the ridiculous position of having two or three times as many staff as is required appointed between 6th December and the date on which this Bill will come into operation.  We could have two or three extra porters; we could have two or three secretaries and extra clerical staff.  There would be general confusion in the hospital when the new management took over.  This section, therefore, making 6th December the zero date is well justified.</P>
    <P>The ground has been very well covered by previous speakers, particularly by Deputy McCann and Deputy Larkin.  They made the position very clear, especially for the benefit of those who are not familiar with the hospital.  These doctors who have been appointed were told what the position was, and therefore no question of hardship arises.  They knew they were accepting the position in the face of this clause.  They knew they would have to take the consequences if, as a result of this measure becoming law, the new management found it necessary to put this section into effect.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give the hospital, the staff and the patients adequate protection against any kind of trickery, treachery or conspiracy.  In achieving that it will ensure that those who find it necessary to seek treatment in this very fine old hospital can do so unhesitatingly. This hospital deserves a Bill of this nature, and I hope that there will be no delay in passing it into law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate on this sub-section and I have been disappointed because so few Deputies have addressed themselves to the sub-section. Generally speaking, they discussed the entire Bill and the whole position relating to the Meath Hospital. I do not think there is any reflection on the Select Committee in our action in opposing this sub-section.  We have been informed that the Bill is necessary and that every section of it is in <Col N="667" /> order except this sub-section, which is quite definitely objectionable:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person was, after the 6th day of December, 1950, and before the appointed day, appointed to any office, then, notwithstanding the terms and conditions on which he was appointed, the joint committee may, without assigning any reason therefor, dismiss or remove him from that office.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the sub-section to which we object.  We have no objection to the Bill in general and we cast no reflection on the Select Committee that prepared this Bill.  We are grateful to them for the work they have done.  I have heard nothing to convince me that this sub-section should not be deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to enter into this discussion but I am impelled to do so because of a point made by Deputy Rooney.  I think the position needs clarification.  Deputy Rooney mentioned the canvass that took place.  In case it might be said that some of us will go into the lobby because of that canvass, I think it is only fair to state unequivocally that the words complained of by Deputy O'Sullivan are words to which we take very definite exception.  I am a member of the committee of a hospital in Cork.  At no time was there ever any question of a contract being signed when an appointment was being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual selected was appointed and was there at the goodwill of the committee so long as he carried out his duties satisfactorily.  If at any time he failed in his duties the committee had power to act in a manner they thought fit.  It seems to me that the wording of this section is unreasonable even if we take into consideration the permissive &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Why is it necessary to have the clause &ldquo;without assigning any reason therefor, dismiss or remove him from that office&rdquo;?  If there is a written contract between the employers and the employee surely they have a right at any time to take such action as they think fit.  There is no question of our being &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; on this particular section any more than on any other <Col N="668" /> section.  We take no exception to the Meath Hospital as an institution.  It is what is written before us that we object to and we believe that we are acting in a proper manner in making that objection.</P>

Those of us who served on this committee, in full agreement and working in full co-operation with each other for the benefit of the patients who will be served by that hospital, have reached conclusions and have made changes in the Bill which have greatly improved it.  We felt it might be better not to have any great discussion in the House.  It appears now that we have to take the gloves off. I was a member of that committee and, on the eve of its first meeting, I was canvassed outside the very doors of the room in which we were meeting by the chairman of the present joint committee.  As a matter of fact, I mentioned to the members of the committee that these people were there and we discussed procedure about meeting anybody who wanted to make representations.</P>

    <P>I had been informed that the committee had decided, once the Bill had passed the Second Reading, that no matter what we did in the Select Committee we were going to be faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> in the matter of dismissals and appointments.  I appealed to the chairman of the committee not to make changes in haste, and suggested that when the Bill became an Act would surely be the best time to change, carefully and quietly, without <Col N="669" /> any reference to what had gone on before with regard to the best way to manage the hospital in relation to its staff.</P>
    <P>As a result of the knowledge which came to us as to what was happening, we thought we would have to protect what we thought was the position of this House.  If we were going to be treated with the contempt that was to be poured out on us, we would have to bring about some provision in the Bill to enable a position such as has now arisen to be dealt with in a proper way.</P>
    <P>I do not know if anybody in this House, up to the appointments that were made last Thursday, had any special interest in or objection to the Bill other than to see brought back something which would be a guide to other hospitals and an improvement on a position which existed.  We all know the history of the case.  We all know the good points and the bad points.  We have a full realisation that the main upkeep of that hospital, as stated by Deputy Larkin earlier to-day, falls on the backs of the ratepayers, the taxpayers and also the hospitals fund and that the subscriber element are to-day in a very nominal position with regard to its upkeep.  Nevertheless, every interest has been safeguarded. We discussed in great detail the advisability of having subscriber members with representation on the board having their own form of election&mdash;you will see it in the Bill&mdash;in order that public spirited citizens will still be able to give their help and assistance, whether physical or financial, and do good work for these hospitals.</P>
    <P>We have brought into being for the first time out of an old and antiquated system what we believe is a control which will be an example to other institutions and other parts of the country.  The present committee must have known after the Second Reading of this Bill had been passed that they were in fact a temporary committee and that we wanted the <i>status quo</i> maintained.  We were not interested in examining the personalities of individuals attached to the hospital. Those of us who are resident in the City of Dublin know that a great deal of good work has been done by that hospital and that great credit is due to <Col N="670" /> the medical staff for the good work they have done, but nevertheless our interest was not in connection with groups, individuals or personalities. Our interest was purely in laying the foundations of a better control and a better management in the interest of the patients.  Now we are faced with a situation in which, in face of the meeting of the Dáil to dispose of the final stages of the Bill, appointments have been made.  A great deal of sympathy has been expressed for the individuals who have been appointed, and the suggestion is that the new board, with this optional power, if you like, wish to make a change, these men are going to be interfered with in their prestige and professional standing; but nobody said anything about the four men who have been dismissed, four men who have served the hospital well.</P>

      <P>The Deputy first sought to suggest that he spoke to nobody, but new he has watered that down.  I was canvassed here yesterday by a certain individual who told me that if I stood the ground I was standing, I would hear about it at a public meeting in O'Connell Street.  That is the kind of canvass we are up against.  The gentleman who canvassed me is in the House to-day doing more canvassing of that nature.  I want to appeal to my colleagues on all sides to understand that we examined this matter thoroughly as representatives of this House on the Select Committee.  Nobody can say that Deputy Cowan and I go arm in arm politically down the streets.  We disagree on very many things, but fortunately at this committee all political opinions were put aside and we concerned ourselves solely with what we thought would bring about such control of this hospital as we could stand over and of which we could be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All kinds of documents have been sent round.  I have read some of them. There is not one of us about whom a document could not be circulated and something said about him if all the good things are left out.  Some of these documents I have only half read, because I was satisfied, after reading the first few lines, what the purpose of the document was.  I do not know if the Deputies who are concerned about the appointments which have been made, and who propose to challenge a division on this section for that reason, really appreciate that, if the present committee had been sufficiently reasonable to remain the guardians of this hospital until they had seen the recommendations of this Select Committee and had seen the control which is now suggested, and which I hope will be passed, with representatives of the local authorities who are contributing bodies and who will have the maximum control, before making changes, it would have been better.  It will be public representatives or their nominees who will have the maximum <Col N="672" /> control and if it is suggested that these unknown people&mdash;we do not know who they will be&mdash;together with the representatives of the subscriber members who will also have a certain number on the board are going to start by chopping off heads, the whole idea of introducing democratic control of these institutions will be futile.  I am quite prepared to stand over the decision of this Select Committee.  I subscribe to it with the rest of my colleagues 100 per cent. and I think it a tragedy that, at a late hour, a few days before or on the very day on which this Bill was to be taken here, these appointments were made.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that these professional gentlemen were not aware of this section until they had been appointed. I am informed, and I accept the information as being reliable and truthful, that each of the candidates was shown a copy of the Bill and was made aware of this section before his appointment.  I do not know whether that will be challenged or not, but I am so informed and I accept the information as being true.  I do not know who answered the advertisements.  I am not interested in that.  All I am concerned about is that we will hand over the hospital to the control of people who, we believe, will be reasonable people, representing the interests now responsible for the upkeep of the hospital and who are closer to responsibility in relation to the individual patients who benefit by treatment in that hospital.  I believe we have done a good job, and I appeal to those who are being led to believe that this section was designed by us in advance to hurt individuals whom we never heard of and who were not appointed until long after we had finished our work to realise that that is not so, that we designed the section in order to try to avoid a situation such as this.</P>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;and I do not say this in any spirit of levity&mdash;whether, if these men happened to be Donegal doctors, the Cork Deputies would be as interested as they are.  They seem to be united in this objection to the section.  Deputy Corry, earlier on, did not realise that two of the existing <Col N="673" /> doctors on the staff are Corkmen. Surely they should be left alone?  We are not concerned about their origins.</P>

      <P>Permit me to raise one point, a Leas-Chinn Chomhairle.  I understand that in the course of the debate a Deputy made a statement to the effect that there was no question whatever of any of the appointed doctors ever receiving a threat or anything in the nature of a threat.  One other Deputy said that if there was a threat, he would view it with very great alarm.  I rise now, with your permission, to have it recorded on the records of the House that a threat, which I consider is a real threat, was made over the name of a Cecil W.C. Robinson&mdash;who has no standing whatever except self-appointment as honorary secretary of what is known as the medical board.  I understand that he appointed himself and that he sent out to the doctors, and to one doctor in particular, a copy of this Meath Hospital Bill on the day following his appointment, with a covering note:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am instructed by the medical board to forward the enclosed copy of the Meath Hospital Bill, 1950, as amended in Select Committee, for your information, please.</P>

Therefore, since I have no direct personal interest in the Meath Hospital, I judge right between&mdash;and I believe I am giving an honest and fair expression, as Deputy Ted O'Sullivan did, and I am confident in saying that if Deputy Ted O'Sullivan were asked to find the Meath Hospital to-night he could not, just like myself or some other Cork Deputies interested in this.  I hope and trust that, when there is a division on this, we will vote solidly for the deletion of this dangerous section, which I consider a bad one.  I welcome any Bill which will improve conditions for any section of our people, but I think that this was a very strange time to introduce a Bill of this type, when feeling was so high concerning the management of this hospital. However, the promoters of the Bill knew best and they are the men who now shoulder the responsibility. Again, I assure the House that a grave injustice will be done if this is passed.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great care to the arguments put forward in favour of the Bill and I have listened to the Leader of the Opposition on the question of the need for the Bill. I do not dispute that very probably there was a need for the Bill, but the case made by Deputy McCann and others was that what was wrong with the Meath Hospital was maladministration. The inference was that that <Col N="680" /> started since this committee was established.  Let me be quite clear and specific on this point.  I do not know a single member of the existing committee and certainly I do not know any member of the staff that has been appointed.  Therefore, I have no interest whatever, good, bad or indifferent, except just for three points. At any time that a Minister for Local Government suppressed a body, county council, hospital committee or other committee, protects were made from every side of this House that his action was an interference with a properly elected body under the law. I want to point out that the existing committee is a properly elected body and has been found to be so by the courts of this State.</P>

      <P>Everybody knew that the court proceedings were about to be taken.  This Bill was brought in &mdash;and you were gracious enough not to move the Bill while the matter was <i>sub judice.</i>  You waited until the court came to its decision.  Maybe you should have moved it while the court was in progress.  Maybe you should have prejudged it.  The fact of the matter is that, the courts having decided the issue, the Bill was then introduced.  I must give the special committee this much credit&mdash;that the Bill we are now passing is not the same as it was when it was introduced.  Not only were they going to disestablish this body but they were going to disqualify the members of the committee who formed it.  You would need a Courts of Justice Act to remove the disqualifications in that case.  Anyhow, that was dropped.  I agree that a method of election was necessary.  I think the method of election of the new committee in the Bill is a good one.  I think you have done well.  I submit, however, that the committee should be allowed to continue its normal life and that the machine you have set up is the one that is to operate when the next election is to take place.  I submit that you should not <Col N="682" /> abolish the committee during their term of office.  I think that if we abolish them during their term of office, we are doing something that we should not do.  It is true that this is the sovereign Parliament and that we can do so, but we often make mistakes and I am not at all satisfied that this matter has been fully examined. Before this Bill becomes law, I should like an inquiry of some sort into the whole matter.  In that way, I think we would have enough factual informtion to enable us to come to a decision as to what steps ought to be taken.  No matter what we may do now, I do not think we are going to meet the demands or the requirements. We are not going to please the existing committee and I doubt very much if you will please the people who will supplant it.  It is not essential for its effectiveness that that should happen.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the House not to pass this Bill without further examination, without giving an opportunity to interested parties to make further representations. It may be argued that that can be done while the Bill is in the Seanad.  I do want to stress that it is rather a dangerous precedent to suppress an elected body on evidence of Deputies in this House, who can say in this House what they will not say outside the House.  There were statements made here to-day about inefficiency and maladministration which, if they were said about the committee outside this House, might have certain results.  I have no interest, good, bad or indifferent, but I think it is a dangerous precedent to establish, and the House should be slow to adopt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support wholeheartedly the appeal made by the Minister for Justice that this Bill should not be given a final reading.  I have no personal interest whatever in the Meath Hospital or any of the staff. There has been domestic trouble within the walls of the Meath Hospital for a considerable time past.  I think it was wrong for the Deputies who sponsored this Bill to introduce it when feeling was rather high concerning the Meath Hospital.  If such a Bill had been introduced some years ago or if such a Bill were to be introduced <Col N="683" /> in years to come, it would probably be regarded as more helpful legislation than this Bill can be regarded to-day.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I endeavoured to submit a motion to the House, which was not accepted because of the progress that was being made with the Bill.  Deputy Dr. Brennan who, unfortunately, is unable to be present to-night, has tabled a motion with me asking the Minister for Health to hold an inquiry into the whole administration of the Meath Hospital for the past five or ten years.  Let that inquiry be held and, when a report is made either to the Minister for Health or to both Houses of the Oireachtas, let us see, calmly and coolly, what type of legislation will be in the best interests of the institution and in the best interests of the citizens of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I do say that every Deputy who has a sound sense of responsibility knows within his heart, whether he desires to admit it or otherwise, that there is something in the management of the Meath Hospital that has the hell of a dirty smell.  That fact has not been referred to in any of the speeches made and it is not dealt with in any section of this Bill.  Is it not the duty of the Minister for Health, who is responsible for the health of the citizens, who is the chief health officer in the State, if there are facts placed before him that the patients in a particular hospital, such as the Meath Hospital, are not getting the service that they should get, and are not likely to get it, to inquire into that matter and to have it dealt with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

Knowing and realising that the hospital cannot be managed properly in future until the cause of the disturbance and the hullabaloo that has gone on in the institution in the <Col N="684" /> past has been properly investigated, is it unreasonable for us to ask the House to shelve this Bill until such time as there is a little peace and ease concerning the management of the Meath Hospital?</P>

Deputies Martin O'Sullivan, McCann and O'Higgins may see something in this Bill and, with the very helpful and farseeing eyes of Deputy Peadar Cowan, they may see something deep in the Bill which may have useful results in the management of the institution.  My eyesight has not failed me and my limited intelligence, so far, has not deceived me.  I cannot see where there will be any great improvement in the management of this institution as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that period, from 1763 to 1815, that legislation continued and under the 1815 Act, which is the important Act, the Meath Hospital was a private hospital, supported and maintained by private subscriptions. It originated largely because of the activities of charitable individuals and of physicians and surgeons anxious to make provision for people who needed medical treatment.  That situation continued right down to the present.  In the meantime, under the Act of 1898 and subsequent Acts of this Oireachtas, provision was made for the payment of large sums to this private hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with this aspect and I shall do so very briefly; it is an aspect that we have been inclined, perhaps, to overlook&mdash; the private control of the Meath Hospital. Right up to the present the committee that is now being displaced by this measure was largely a committee representing the governors or governesses, who were those types of people that I have mentioned.  Under this Bill all that is changed, after almost 200 years, and now we shall have this Meath Hospital, or County Dublin Infirmary, controlled by a committee consisting of representatives of the Dublin County Council, representatives of the Dublin Corporation, representatives of the General Council of County Councils, representatives of the medical board and representatives of the governors and governesses of the hospital.  In order that that committee may avail of the services of competent people, they have the power under the constitution to co-opt two members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This hospital will be administered and controlled completely by that democratic committee.  If there are any inquiries to be made into the running of the hospital, those inquiries will be made by that democratic committee. One of the amendments which we have passed provides that this committee may make rules governing the admission of patients and for the <Col N="690" /> better government of the hospital or any matter relating thereto.  Any safeguard that Deputy Flanagan wants in regard to the proper running of the hospital in the future is contained in the Bill and when Deputy Flanagan was speaking on Section 12 he admitted that this was a good Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

In other words, Deputy Flanagan wants the present situation to continue.  He does not want this democratic body elected.  He does not want to see representatives of the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin County Council or representatives of the General Council of County Councils running the hospital.</P>

It is all right for a Deputy to do that, but Dublin people know that patients who go into the Meath Hospital are well looked after and that they get there first-class medical treatment.  Nobody that I know has ever had any suggestion to make that the surgeons or physicians of the hospital were not doing their duty to the patients.  I think it is absolutely unfair for a person who knows nothing about the hospital, who does not live within 50 miles of the hospital, to come into this House with a biased brief of that kind and to use the privileges of the House to slander an institution such as that.</P>

      <P>This Bill has had a very wide discussion.  All I want to say now is that the principle of the Bill was unanimously adopted by the House on the Second Reading.  It was sent to a Select Committee, who worked very hard to produce a Bill that would be acceptable to the House.  With the exception of one sub-section, which was contested very keenly by Deputies from Cork, the Bill has received general support.  Even Deputies who voted against that particular sub-section have indicated that they approved of the Bill as a whole. In these circumstances, having made provision for what one might term a revolution in the government and the administration of the Meath Hospital, I would request the House to reject the suggestion made by the Minister for Justice and by Deputy Flanagan that we should not pass this Bill; in other words, that we should throw overboard all the hard work of this committee in making this Bill what we believe it will be, a very effective instrument to ensure excellent administration <Col N="693" /> of the Meath Hospital in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) Noel C. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been particularly well piloted through all its stages by persons who are competent to do so. I should like to clear up a misapprehension under which Deputy Flanagan appeared to be labouring.  So far as these voluntary hospitals are concerned, the Department of Health has in the ordinary sense no responsibility whatever.  Beyond the fact that I administer expenditure under the Hospitals' Sweepstakes Fund, the payment of deficits and certain capital outlay, I have no right of entry or no power of entry, in the normal state of affairs, into any of these institutions.  They are particularly conscious of their rights in these matters and I would be the first to do anything that I could to protect those rights where a good job is being carried out by any of these institutions.  My responsibility extends far enough inasmuch as it covers all the local authority and district institutions, sanatoria, county hospitals, mentals hospitals, etc.  These voluntary hospitals are autonomous bodies and I have no control over them.  The necessity for the introduction of this Bill has been accepted by this House.  The Bill as originally introduced would have been completely unacceptable to me but inasmuch as it had been agreed that certain radical changes were required in it, in order to correct the condition of affairs which it was said, existed in the institution, it was sent to a committee of the House.  After considerable thought, we have the Bill which is before us.  It is the outcome of that committee's deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say that, while I accept the Bill as being the will of all Parties in the House, with its provision to ensure a majority of local authority representatives on the joint committee, I would have preferred if the total representation on the board of this hospital had been drawn from the local authorities.  We are elected to this House on a popular franchise ourselves, and so I believe that, so far as our opinion was asked we would have given substance to our belief in the idea concerning the expenditure of <Col N="694" /> public moneys or semi-State funds such as the Hospital Sweep Funds in a hospital such as this.  Though the position is limited at the moment, I have no doubt that the expenditure of public funds in relation to all these institutions can only increase as time goes on. I feel, therefore, that the most desirable kind of a Bill would have been one with complete local authority representation for the administration of the affairs of this institution.  There is nothing unusual about that principle.  It would be a logical principle for members of this House to accept, either in their capacity as Deputies or as members of corporations, county councils or local authorities.  Many Deputies are members of boards of local authority institutions.  I do not see, therefore, why the principle could not, or should not, have been accepted in relation to this institution.  It has been accepted in relation to St. Kevin's Institution, Crooksling, Rialto Hospital and the various local authority institutions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If a voluntary organisation, or a voluntary group, happens to get its affairs into a mess, and then comes to the Oireachtas, comes to what is so often described as the State bureaucratic machine in order to get its affairs put right, then I think we are at liberty to state our terms.  The Bill, as I say, is a considerable improvement on the Bill which was introduced and which provided for the election of members under the old system.  It is a considerable improvement in so far as it makes provision for a majority of local authority representation on the joint committee, and to that extent it is acceptable to me.</P>
    <P>There is one other point of criticism in connection with the Bill to which I should like to refer.  It is, in fact, the underlying principle over which the discussion roamed the whole of this afternoon and evening.  That is the question of appointment.  I believe that a most desirable proposition to be put forward by the House and to be included in the Bill would have been the principle which, as Ministers and Deputies, we accept in relation to the majority of appointments made throughout the local authority services <Col N="695" /> and the Civil Service: that is to say, that we should accept the principle that an indisputable case has been made for the establishment of an autonomous body of independent members&mdash;independent of the particular institution, preferable&mdash;to decide on the merits of candidates presenting themselves for appointment to any particular institution.  That principle has been enshrined in legislation and accepted by this House, by the country and by all parties over the years in the Local Appointments Commission. If that had been accepted, I think we could have improved the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Local Appointments Commission, which I think we all accept as being completely above suspicion in these matters, is the most desirable machinery, I think, for the making of appointments.  If that principle had been included, a lot of the trouble referred to here to-night&mdash;the question of appointments and the justification for appointments in which I am not remotely concerned &mdash; need not have arisen.  In fact, if that principle had been accepted the Meath Hospital Bill might never have been needed.  However, I feel that if the principle of the Local Appointments Commission were accepted it could have improved the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important, when considering this question of appointing persons to hospitals particularly, not to concern ourselves with the particular club, university, medical school, association or society to which the individual belongs. That is his personal concern and has nothing to do with our main concern, or the correct concern of the people who administer the institution, which is the welfare of the patients. That, I suggest, can only be ensured by getting the best qualified men.  I am not suggesting that this aim has not been achieved in this particular hospital, or in such hospitals throughout the country.  I do believe, however, that if there is an anxiety to achieve, as near as we can, the certainty that the best persons will be appointed to such posts, our best chance of ensuring that is through such a body as the Local Appointments Commission which, <Col N="696" /> as I have said is autonomous.  It sits on a particular day, the members of it do not know who will be on the board at the time, and the candidates are not in a position to canvass and make life most unpleasant for the persons who happen to be sitting on the board.</P>

      <P>As to Deputy Flanagan's suggestion that there was something which needed righting in the institution, I feel that the Bill as introduced did not and could not improve it. Though not as desirable as I would have liked in regard to making a radical alteration in the controlling body of the Meath Hospital, I believe that there is a reasonable chance, in spite of the defects to which I have referred, that the Bill, as amended, can bring about the radical improvement which Deputy Flanagan and all in this House feel should take place in the Meath Hospital.  I feel that if I were to pursue Deputy Flanagan's suggestion and Deputy Dr. Brennan's suggestion that we should hold an investigation into the affairs of this institution going back over the last five or ten years we would not achieve as soon as possible <Col N="697" /> the results desired by Deputy Flanagan. Consequently, I approve of this Bill and I feel that it should, given goodwill on the part of the new committee, and I am sure they will give that goodwill, achieve the results desired by the House and by Deputy Flanagan.</P>

      <P>Having made our protest on Section 12, I rise at this stage of the Bill to wish God speed to the effort for improvement the Bill may make in the Meath Hospital.  We have made the protest we felt justified in making on Section 12.  The section itself is rather nauseating in its very writing but, having been defeated on that section, which was the only section to which we directed any opposition, we feel that there has been a very solid case made by the unanimous Select Committee of the House for this Bill.  We feel that it must be an urgently required measure and, in the circumstances, we hope that all that Deputy McCann, Deputy Cowan, and other members of the Select Committee have wished for in the way of improvement in the internal affairs and the harmonious management of the hospital will be the speedy and happy consequence of this legislation.</P>

      <P>After listening for a long time this evening to the debate on this Bill I have been convinced by the disquisition of Deputy McCann, although a promise made is a debt unpaid.  I can assure the House that if I had heard Deputy McCann before I made this promise I certainly would not have voted in the way I voted to-night. I am making no apology so far as a promise made is a debt unpaid.  I always believe in the principle that if a man gives his word he should keep it.  I only rise to pay tribute to the six or seven just men appointed by this House who sat down, probably at great inconvenience to themselves, and arrived at certain decisions.  I am sure that the section of the Bill at which we took umbrage will not be implemented to the disadvantage or, if I might say so, the victimisation of any of the four men, all four of them Corkmen, who were appointed.  I was delighted to hear to-night the appreciation <Col N="698" /> of Corkmen.  It is very seldom in this House that we have such unanimity with regard either to criticism or appreciation as we had to-night. It was very edifying to note that the four men who were appointed, irrespective of what way they were appointed&mdash;I believe that they were not appointed on a wrong basis&mdash;were four Corkmen.  We claim to have the brains of this country and it was proved here absolutely this evening that it is true by both the appreciation and the criticism of Corkmen.</P>

      <P>In this very pleasant atmosphere, I should like to say a few words.  I am glad to see that the Bill is closing on a note of harmony because, speaking as a member of the committee, that is what we tried to achieve.  I think the way in which the House has handled this Bill from its introduction is a tribute to their sense of fair play and their sense of honour and justice.  As a Dubliner and as a Deputy in whose constituency the Meath Hospital is situated, I want to make it clear that I have for the hospital and the doctors connected with it only the very, very highest praise, and I <Col N="699" /> have heard nothing but the highest praise of it.  The hospital stands high in the opinion of the people, notwithstanding what one or two country Deputies have said about it.  I think they were not, perhaps, as <i>au fait</i> with the facts as the Dublin people were, and that is why they made the statements they did.</P>
      <P>I am glad this Bill is being passed in the spirit in which it is being passed. I feel sure that the Meath Hospital under the guidance of the new joint committee, which will be based on persons elected as public representative or those chosen by public representatives as their nominees for the most part, will go forward to new successes in greater harmony.  I thank the House for the way in which they have dealt with this matter.  I thank Deputy McCann for the way in which he conducted the business of the Select Committee. He was both skilful and fair in his chairmanship.</P>

      <P>May I say in conclusion that we have put into this Bill what we intended should be put into it on the Second Reading.  We have established democratic control.  We have repealed objectionable statutes.  We have taken from the medical board the power of appointment and given it back to the democratic joint committee. We have reduced the subscription from ten guineas, as it originally appeared in the Bill, to two guineas.  Those were the four points with which we indicated we would deal on the Second Reading.  We have done that. I believe we have brought in a very good Bill and one that should be passed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a short reference to what Deputy Flanagan said last night in relation to lodging houses in which patients from the country are accommodated. There was insufficient accommodation in the hospital and a house near the hospital had to be acquired for treatment of urological cases.  Everyone who knows that terrible disease that afflicts elderly people knows that where a stoppage of urine occurs the patient must be rushed immediately to a Dublin hospital for the purpose of <Col N="700" /> operation, first an incision in the side to drain the kidneys and then a major operation some days later.  It was a question in these cases of either leaving the patient in the country to die or bringing the patient to Dublin and accommodating him in a well-run boarding house, or lodging house, close to the hospital.  I inspect that house myself.  It is under the supervision of the hospital.  Deputy Flanagan said it was badly run.  That is not so; it is well run under the supervision of the hospital and it was imperative to acquire this house in order to save lives.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 10, to delete &ldquo;executive&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;of all the&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no necessity to explain this particular amendment which has for its object the formation of executive committees consisting of all the members of the council instead of a number of members of the council as is proposed in the section.  Every argument that can be adduced in favour of this amendment has already been adduced.  The Minister has indicated that if it is the desire of the House that the executive committee should consist of all the members of the council he will accept that decision.  I think the Minister must know now as a result of the discussion here yesterday that it is the desire of the House that these executive committees should consist of all the members of the council. I do not want to sit down without mentioning what I might term the <Col N="701" /> stronger points in favour of the amendment. If those executive committees are to perform very important functions and are limited to a small number, say, one-third of the council, it certainly will mean that two-thirds of the council will be deprived of the right of participating in the discussions and decision on matters for which they were elected by the electorate in the local elections. To that extent the Bill, as now drafted, cuts across in a fundamental way the principle of democracy.  The Minister has said that not only now&mdash;not only since he became Minister but for many years&mdash;it was his desire and the desire of the Party to which he belongs that democracy should be restored to the local authorities.  Democracy cannot be exercised if individuals elected to local councils are deprived by an Act of the Oireachtas from participating in and deciding serious issues that affect the people whom they represent.</P>
    <P>There are many other arguments in favour of this proposal.  Those arguments have been advanced already in the course of the discussion which is to some extent becoming disentangled now.  Consequently I move the amendment, which I know has substantial support and which will revolutionise the Bill and guarantee to local authorities complete control over the administration of their own affairs.  We are now amending in the Bill&mdash;sub-stantially amending&mdash;the Management Acts as originally introduced.  By the adoption by this House of the amendment that I propose the most objectionable features of management, whether given to a manager or a small committee, will be eliminated and full powers will be given to the elected representatives of the people.</P>

      <P>Drainage committees. I further submit that the working of the old boards of health and the sub-committees <Col N="702" /> under them, where their powers were not restricted, was a success.  If you constitute the whole council into a committee the work will not be done as expeditiously as it would be done by having smaller committees. Democracy is safeguarded in the Bill by the proportional representation system of election.  I therefore find myself&mdash;speaking for myself&mdash;in opposition to this amendment, and certainly if there is a vote in the House I will vote against it.</P>

      <P>While I think there is a good deal in this amendment which can be commended, I do not think the mover can justifiably claim that its acceptance by the Minister would revolutionise the Bill.  It seems to me that the proposal in the Bill is to constitute executive committees.  As it stands, it would have very little difference in effect in its working out from the proposal made by Deputy Cowan except in this regard, that unattached members of county councils, corporations or local authorities of any kind who could not command voting support on a county council might find themselves without representation on these executive committees.  Everybody who is a member of a local authority is aware that committees of this kind are filled largely on the basis of certain political party affiliations.  If the Bill is left in its present form, there is the danger that those who would not have any party affiliations, members of local authorities, might find themselves, while desiring to be members of executive committees, unable to gain election to these committees.  It is certainly undemocratic from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a good deal to be said for the point of view put forward by Deputy Kennedy that small committees get more done.  That is quite true.  If we are to safeguard the principle of democracy&mdash;and it is upon that principle that this Bill has been introduced&mdash;democracy must permit the distribution of authority amongst all the members of the council.  There is undoubtedly very much to be said for the amendment.  I understand from the mover's remarks that this is a matter upon which the Minister is prepared to accept the view of the <Col N="703" /> House that it is not a fundamental issue, but one in respect of which care should be taken to see that every element of the local authority will get representation.  The only way in which that can be done is to constitute the committees of the entire members of the county council.  In my view, the amendment has that much in its favour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the arguments advanced from this side of the House yesterday would favour the principle of Deputy Cowan's amendment.  Our attitude was that we were opposed to the principle of these executive committees in the first instance.  If you have committees with executive authority we feel that the whole council would be the best body to have. Take the case of the boards of health long ago.  They were usually composed of ten members who were responsible for the administration of home assistance, but the ten members of the board of health never administered home assistance.  When the board of health met, the ten members, in order to get through the work, had to divide themselfves up into three sub-committees.  There was a housing sub-committee, home assistance sub-committee and a general hospital sub-committee.  These were the three sub-committees.  The average attendance at a board of health meeting would be about eight out of the ten. Occasionally, you would have the ten members.  There would be two sub-committees with three members each and one with two members.  You had two members of a council consisting of 27 members in my area administering home assistance for the county, while the local knowledge of the other 25 men who were drawn from different parts of a large rural area&mdash;probably 60 miles by 40 miles&mdash;was never called on, with the result that many difficulties arose and there was friction amongst members of the board of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You had also this dangerous situation, that two members of a council of 27 were determining how £20,000 a year would be spent and the feeling was growing that it was an undesirable procedure which should not be <Col N="704" /> allowed to continue.  That was probably one of the reasons why boards of health came to an end.  In respect of housing, a committee of two or probably three determined very serious and far-reaching matters&mdash;the repair of all houses, the money to be spent on them and probably much bigger questions. All members of a council in a rural area are equally interested in the problems that come up and all should get an opportunity of expressing their opinions on them.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances you will get better and sounder work done.  There will be less danger of cliques and less danger&mdash;I do not like to use the word &mdash;of corruption.  Human beings are human beings, and we had very little of it in the public life of this country. The suggestion was made in the past, but with the whole council administering public funds, there will be no danger of that.  Very strong arguments could be put forward against the idea of small committees administering public funds, and I feel fairly strongly on this point from experience and knowledge.  It is unsound in the long run, and if there is anything which may lead to abuse by local authorities in the administration of public funds, it is the small group.  The work can be done by a sub-executive committee as provided in this Bill.  Such a committee can have three members, and it is even provided here that one member of a county council can constitute himself an executive committee.</P>
    <P>The counter argument can be put up that the present county manager is doing that in the secrecy of his office, if you like, with his officers and advisers, but there is a safeguard in regard to the county manager which would not exist in the case of members of local authorities.  He is a highly paid officer in a highly responsible position, and it will be found, by and large, that the administration of public funds by the manager has given general satisfaction to all sections. There was no suggestion of abuse or unfair play and no suggestion that if any group got on the council, they would use their influence there to further the interests of a particular political party.  With the whole <Col N="705" /> council working together, there is a safeguard.  There is then the other objection that, even on a system of proportional representation, desirable members of a council, who were elected as independent members and who would be first-class administrators, have little or no chance of getting on these committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They might not deliberately be kept out, but it will be the concern of all the political groups to get as many of their own members on as possible.  That is a very natural interest and it cannot be avoided, but it may result in very desirable administrators, elected as independents, having no part whatever in the administration of the affairs of their county.  I believe these executive committees should consist of the whole council.  I agree that, with a small group of three or four, you get through business much faster and possibly more efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The more heads you have, even though they be sheeps' heads, the better.  We are all concerned with getting a machine which will be as near perfect as we can make it, a machine which will run smoothly and give rise to the least possible abuse in its working.  At present, areas are selected and designated local electoral areas, and, under this, even on the proportional representation system, you could have large parts of a rural area with no representation on any of these executive committees. That is quite a possibility. It might be that the members there would not have the time to attend many meetings in a month and it might be, on the other hand, that they might not be selected by their particular <Col N="706" /> Party groups.  A man in a particular area might not be selected by his Party group for membership of one of these committees.  I can see nothing wrong with these executive committees consisting of the whole council.  The whole council system has operated for the past six years and all the business has been done, whether the council consisted of 21 or 26 members, the usual number on a council, though there may be larger numbers in the Cork County Council.  The whole council carried out all the business and got through it reasonably expeditiously.  Everyone had an opportunity of expressing his views, and, even though the numbers may look somewhat large, it is sounder administration in the long run, and it gives more satisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows what is going on.  It is a peculiar thing that, in the past, where you had ten members out of a county council of 27 on the board of health the remaining 17 had always to inquire from their colleagues what they were doing in the matter of housing, sanitation and so on.  They had no power to make any representations, other than the fact that they were their colleagues and they could tell them about things that needed to be done; but they did not know what was going on at the meetings of the other body.  The majority of the county council had no knowledge other than what they read in the newspapers or could glean from their colleagues of the work being done by the board of health, and that was a bad system in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the principle of these executive committees, but that principle has been accepted and we must try to make the best of it and try to get to run smoothly and give more satisfaction.  If over half a council is to have no knowledge of what is going on, they will be Pooh-Bahs in future&mdash; the men who are not members of these executive committees.  I cannot see that the council will have anything really serious to do except strike a <Col N="707" /> rate.  They dare not put on the agenda anything to do with housing because they know that the chairman will rule housing out of order at the meeting of the county council.  Any health matter could not be raised at a general meeting of the county council, under this Bill&mdash;and that would be undesirable. I do not believe those who have worked on local authorities will be satisfied unless the full membership of the council are members of these executive committees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is quite clear up to a point how Deputy Allen has approached this.  Naturally, our views are the same.  If it is worked on proportional representation with a council of 21, seven would be on one particular committee.  That would mean that those seven men plus the council officers, might spend a day discussing particular matters; but in turn, under the democratic principles of any Bill, their decisions would have to be referred back to the general meeting. After seven members spending perhaps the best part of a day discussing this matter, the other 14 would be entitled to go over it again when it came back. That would be duplicating the work. Also, there is no guarantee that any decision arrived at by the seven wise men on the executive committee would be agreed to by the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, assuming that there are 21 on the council, even with two executive committees of seven each, that would make 14 members; and there are still seven on the council who would not get any representation.  It is only natural to assume that they would claim the right at the ordinary meeting to go over the whole proceedings and ask for another day.  We would have a retrogressive manner of dealing with local affairs if we have these separate discussions.  In Cork at the present time, there are 21 members on the South Cork Board of Health, in which I am interested.  At a board <Col N="708" /> of health meeting those 21 are automatically members of the board of health and decide on any representations to be made to the manager.  All the decisions we make become final at the meeting and we do not have to refer them to anyone else, as all 21 are automatically on it.  That means more efficiency and gives more satisfaction.</P>
    <P>If under this Bill there were an executive committee in North Cork for health matters, their decisions or recommendations would have to be referred to the county council.  Why should we, from a different part of the county, be made waste time dealing with a parish pump 80 miles away?  I would ask the Minister to realise that, if this Bill is to be really successful, we must be satisfied that every member will have the full right to discuss matters on these executive committees.</P>
    <P>It is only right to leave all heat out of this discussion, as one can get nowhere by that.  I will be frank on this point.  If there are four or five Parties and a couple of Independents on a council, this Bill could mean that some Parties may be denied representation on an executive committee.  In fairness to those elected by the people to represent them, and also if we are to take the most important aspect, that is, to make a success of local government, we must see that while matters of national importance may have to be dealt with here in the Dáil we can settle our own affairs in our own counties.  The principle behind amendment No. 44 is the same as in the other one.  I would ask the Minister to realise that it is absolutely necessary to see that every member of a council has a right to sit on an executive committee dealing with council matters, so as not to duplicate the work by having recommendations from a committee of one-third of the council referred back to the general council, which would mean added work and unsatisfactory results in the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the point put forward by Deputies Desmond and Allen, I bring to mind the working of the old board of health in Westmeath. There were two sub-committees acting for the board of health, and they met respectively in Athlone and Mullingar. One in the south of the county consisted of all the councillors for the southern divisions and the other consisted of the members from the northern divisions.  They dealt with housing, sanitary provisions, water and repairs to houses.  The board of health never questioned their work but automatically sanctioned whatever they did. I make the suggestion to the Minister and the House that we might find a <i>via media</i> out of this by making certain divisions of a county, to deal with particular matters appertaining to that end of the county.  To particularise, if the whole southern end of Westmeath had to spend half a day discussing Athlone health affairs, well, they would not be there after a while; whereas if the meeting were held in Athlone and consisted of the members from Athlone, Moate and that district, they would get through the business more quickly. In the following week, the northern members could meet and discuss matters for that portion and they would achieve something.  I put that forward as a suggestion to the Minister and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of executive committees of any kind is to help to speed up the business being conducted at the meeting.  I dare say that in the drafting of this Bill the Minister was full of good intentions. As he explained in the White Paper, the terribly overloaded agendas that carry on from one council meeting to another, with matters which could never be reached, create a problem not alone for the councillors and officials but also for the Minister and his Department.  There were many occasions in connection with my county when the Department of Local Government here would like to see certain matters decided, but we could not <Col N="710" /> reach them sometimes for a period of six months, because of the system of debate carried on in the county council. I suppose it was from that problem that the Minister got the idea of executive committees.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am a believer in such committees, as I have been long enough on a county council to realise that at least one-third of those who have been elected by the votes of the people do not take the interest in council affairs that the other two-thirds may take.  It may be because of their inability to take part in the debate or to understand as well as their fellows what is being debated, but my experience is that a third or at least a fourth of every council would be just as well off if they were not there at all.  However, these people are elected and being elected have the right to talk and discuss what is on the agenda as much as the others.  I believe that if a proper executive committee could be selected you would have a better and a more efficient type of administration, while if every county council could elect a chairman who was able to keep order you would have no need for executive committees at all.  If, for instance, the chairman of a county council could rule with an iron hand and keep in the mind and mouth of every councillor only the exact items on the agenda the work would be done more quickly, but we all know what happens at county council meetings.</P>

      <P>We can win on the field.  My objection to executive committees as they are constituted here &mdash;and I find myself in agreement with Deputy Desmond&mdash;is that there is very little use in having an executive committee of one-third of the members of the council if their findings can be rehashed at a meeting of the whole county council.  If that is true&mdash;and I think it is as I have studied this as well as I am capable&mdash;it is foolish. <Col N="711" /> The committee must have the same power as the old board of health or as the committee of agriculture at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the two executive committees which the Minister intends to form under Section 16, I would like to point out that when a representative is elected on the county council in Cork he is supposed by his constituents to look after their interests <Col N="713" /> in every phase of county council work, let it be housing, water supplies, public assistance or hospitals.  I have a very definite objection to any disfranchisement of any number of those members.  We might be said to have the most unwieldy county council in Ireland, seeing that we have 46 members, but those 46 members can get through their work in any one day very successfully.  There are separate days for home assistance work and boards of health.  The second of these two executive committees is supposed to deal with health matters, but we have in Cork three separate areas with three separate area charges.  You have a separate area charge in North Cork for housing, water and sewage purposes on one-third of Cork County.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have a separate area of charge in the South Cork area in the same manner, with the exception of home assistance for which we are, to our sorrow and woe, coupled with Cork City, and you have a separate area of charge for West Cork.  You have these naturally formed three separate executive committees there concerned with water, sewerage and housing.  There would be a very definite objection to a South Cork man interfering with the North Cork people.  They would have the very definite objection that somebody was stepping into vote on something for which he was paying nothing. That is the position there.  As regards roads and general administration, each councillor, as I stated at the start, is elected by the people to do his part. He is entitled to have his voice heard and to vote on how the money subscribed by his constituents is used.  For that reason I have a very definite objection to any reduction by any means of the whole of a county council&mdash;the dividing up of it into executive committees of any description.  I have pointed out that in regard to the housing, water supply, sewerage and so forth you have a natural division which can be made by the county council itself without the assistance of the section in this Bill which says that the executive committee can transfer its powers to any portion of it.  The executive committee of all the members of the council&mdash;which meets on roads <Col N="714" /> and other administration&mdash; can transfer its powers on housing, sewerage and water to the South Cork area, to the North Cork area, to the West Cork area who have to pay the piper themselves for anything they do in a separate area of charge.</P>
    <P>I maintain that to have an executive committee of one-third to do the other work is going to ruin the whole business. I am very grateful to the Minister for leaving this more or less an open question.  I appeal to the Minister, as one who wants to see this Bill workable and a success&mdash;if we can make a success out of it&mdash;to give serious consideration to what I am saying.  After all, we have been on local bodies and we have had experience of them.  I have been a member of the Cork County Council since 1924.  I have had pretty long experience of local government all down the years from 1924 until 1951.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of what happens in those bodies there.  I know the amount of soreness that exists even where we have a decent broad-minded chairman and a decent broad-minded attitude, when we cut out the proportion of members on each committee according as they were elected by the electorate.  For instance, if Fianna Fáil had so many, they got so many. If Labour had so many, they got so many members.  Similarly with Fine Gael, the Farmers and the Independents. It is worked that way in a broad-minded system.  I know the soreness that occurs even amongst Parties.  Take, for instance, two members of a Party are picked out to serve on a board of assistance as against five or six others that should have an equal right to serve on it and who represent as many ratepayers and people who have to pay as the others. I know well the soreness that occurs. I appeal to the Minister, if he wants to make a success of this Bill, to accept the amendment.  I appeal to him not from any political viewpoint whatever, but solely for the good and for the working of this Bill in the future.  Let us try it out.  I think he would have a far greater hope of the success of this measure by doing that than by splitting up and disfranchising <Col N="715" /> two-thirds of the electorate as he is doing as the Bill stands at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  I do so for the very same reasons which were given by various other speakers. If there should be a very big number of Independents on a council, due to the very fact that they are elected as Independents, they cannot combine to elect or select a member to represent them.  In the case of political Parties who return, say, two members, the Independents and the small political Parties can be deprived of any representation even under this particular system.  It is essential that all the people elected by the public should have an opportunity at least of putting forward their views.  I am quite well aware&mdash;and it is another reason why the Minister should agree to this amendment&mdash;of the fact that under Section 38 any number of people not elected on these executive bodies can use the county council as a means to endeavour to see that the council will compel these executive bodies to carry out a particular function.  As I have said on another occasion, this Bill will lead to a rehash of everything discussed at these executive committees, with consequent delay and loss of time.</P>

      <P>I am speaking, I think, at variance with most of the views expressed by Deputies on this side of the House in relation to Section 17.  A remark made <i>sotto voce</i> by my colleague, Deputy Corry, recalls a statement which he made when he was speaking to this amendment to the effect that a West Corkman would not be allowed to interfere with the affairs of an East Corkman.  I wish that that applied to the interference of Cork members with Dublin hospitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I bore with Deputy Corry when he was talking and I trust he will try to be forbearing towards me.  The principle as to whether we should or should not divide the executive functions between several groups of the council rather than to have every member of the council participating equally in the executive functions of all committees is governed, I think, by the fact that there will be a change in the present administration.  If we had the present system of county management, where all the executive functions were to be vested in the county manager and were to be discharged by him, then perhaps the necessity for having the personnel of the county council divided, as is proposed under Section 17 of the Bill, might not be so great. If in fact these committees are to be truly executive bodies, which I doubt &mdash;I have already expressed that doubt on Second Reading&mdash;I fear that experience will show that it will not be possible for them properly to discharge those executive functions and that ultimately those who are in favour of the idea of an executive committee will perhaps have to fall back on some such solution as is proposed in the Bill.  That is merely looking at the problem from the point of view that the committees in fact will be executive committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another consideration which I think members have lost sight of, that, as executive committees, they will be serving two Ministers.  The county council has now become the executive body very largely for the Minister for Local Government on the one hand and the Minister for Health on the other, <Col N="717" /> and, indeed, to a large extent, for the Minister for Social Welfare, as Deputy Allen has reminded me, in relation to the provision of home assistance.  That will make it somewhat difficult for members to keep in mind their responsibilities to the respective Ministers in relation to two parts of their functions. Psychologically speaking, I think they would be more conscious of the fact that they had responsibility, say, to the Minister for Health if they were serving on the health executive committee only and that they would be more conscious, perhaps, of their responsibilities to the Minister for Local Government if they were serving on the general executive committee of the council.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say which of the systems, in fact, will work the better.  There is no principle involved.  It is merely a question of expediency as to which we think is likely to work out the better in the end.</P>
    <P>There is, too, some merit in the provision which the Minister has included in the Bill whereby one-third of the membership will not be on any committee.  I am talking here, perhaps, not very accurately, because, in fact, I have proceeded so far on the assumption that a member of the council could be a member of only one committee.  Much of what I have said would be completely nullified if certain members were to be members of every committee or if a member was to be a member of two committees.  On the assumption that there would be a fair division of the work and responsibilities of the council over the elected body as a whole, there is something to be said for having one-third&mdash;at least, it need not be one-third, it might be one-fourth&mdash;but for having, at any rate, one section of the council not completely enmeshed in the interests, concerns and functions of one or other of these committees because they will be able to stand back and look at the problem as a whole from the point of view of the people who are very often forgotten about when we are dealing with local administration, that is to say, the ratepayers.  They would be, if you like, in the position of a composite Minister for Finance.  They would be <Col N="718" /> able to look at the financial implications of the proposals which, say, the general executive committee was pressing forward and at the proposals that the health committee was pressing forward.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to say that everything I am saying may not prove by experience to be correct, but one can visualise a situation where it would be useful to have one-third of the members, as I say, more or less taking a detached view of the operations of the other committees and, if you like, exercising a certain amount of financial supervision over them.  When the time came to strike the rate, naturally, they would all meet as one in the general body of the council but there would be in the general body of the council a section of members who could act as detached and impartial critics of what the other two committees were doing.</P>
    <P>May I put it this way?  It has been argued here that every member of the general body is entitled to sit on every committee of a local authority.  I do not think that that is realised in practice. There are, I think, committees on which only part of the membership of the council sits.  There are other committees that are composed partly of a selected number of members of the council and of persons who have been co-opted for special purposes.  I do not think it has been alleged, so far at any rate, that so far as these composite committees are concerned, or so far as these committees which consist only of a fraction of the elected personnel are concerned, there is any discrimination against one area in favour of another.</P>
    <P>I said that I had perhaps more extensive experience of local government than many people are aware.  If I may just mention a personal aspect of the matter: My father was one of the first Nationalist members elected to the Belfast Corporation in the year 1897, on the passage of the old Local Government Act, and he remained there and served on that body for over 20 years. In Belfast at that time there was this idea of executive committees.  There was a police committee, which looked after street lighting and that sort of thing&mdash;not after the police&mdash;an <Col N="719" /> electricity supply committee, which managed the affairs of the electricity supply undertaking; a libraries committee, which looked after the libraries; a gas committee which looked after the municipal gas works; a tramways committee, which looked after the tramways; and a number of other committees, including a general purposes committee, which dealt with matters outside these things, and a finance committee. A member, if he was an ordinary member of the council, could be a member of, at most, two of these committees.  If he happened to be chairman of one of these committees, he was a member of the finance committee. There was an organisation based upon this principle of having executive committees of the general body and it was not necessary that every member of the corporation should be a member of every one of these committees.  In fact, it would not have been practicable.</P>
    <P>I will concede at once that you cannot argue from urban experience, and particularly from experience in the local administration of a very large city like Belfast or Dublin to, say, the position which exists in Deputy Corry's satellite areas of County Cork because, as we all know, Cork extends practically across the whole of Ireland, just as we saw Cork extending along both sides of the House in a division here this evening.</P>

      <P>I was saying that one is not, perhaps, justified in arguing from an experience limited to urban areas and large municipalities; one is not, perhaps, justified in piling up such experience and saying that things would work out the same way in regard to county administration.  Perhaps they would not.  I think that, after all, there may be something in allowing the proposal of the Minister&mdash;at least <Col N="720" /> to consider it with a more open mind than it has been approached so far.</P>
      <P>I am not going to say that I am prepared to be a thick and thin supporter of this section.  Since we are all concerned with county administration.  I suppose I would have to bow to the weight of numbers and apparently, so far as members of the House on both sides who represent rural constituencies are concerned, they would rather have every member of the elected body a member of these executive committees. All I can say is, in so far as I have any wisdom or experience of them, that time will show that is not a very wise thing.</P>

      <P>This particular discussion has served a very useful purpose because it has shown to some of us who are new members in the House, members for the past three years at least, a new side of Deputy MacEntee and, if I may say so, a more persuasive side than he usually displays.  I think he is pretty well surrounded at the moment by Deputies who do not just accept the point of view that he would like to put before us, and it is good to see him accepting that position in the gracious way in which it was done.</P>
      <P>I will say to the Minister that this proposal will, to a large extent, decide the form in which the Bill will be finally passed.  The general viewpoint is that we are at what one might term an experimental stage.  Now, local government is all the time a living, growing thing.  Since 1898 it has, right up to date, gone through many phases.  We had the county management phase which, looking at it from a logical point of view, seemed to be a very sound way of doing things.  I think the more one considers it, the more, one can see in that particular proposal.  However, the general viewpoint has been away from that and now we want to try something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy MacEntee that what happens in a large city can hardly be applied to conditions in the country, but in the Dublin Corporation, which has had a long existence, before I went into it, which was only a few months back, they had decided that all the committee work, the principal committee work, should be done <Col N="721" /> by a committee of the whole house. They tried out the small committees and they found that was not successful and they are now operating&mdash;they have been for some time&mdash;a committee of the whole house.  That is, in relation to finance, housing, public health, town planning and, in fact, all the vital committees are committees of the whole house.  They went through the phase that Deputy MacEntee mentioned in regard to Belfast and while at the moment there are in the Dublin council some members who think it might be better to get back to the idea of the small committee, there are on the other hand members who think it would be better to have the big committee.</P>
    <P>We are at a completely experimental stage.  This is not the last Local Government Act that will be passed. The general desire seems to be that we should give a trial to the executive committee consisting of the whole council.  I would press the Minister to accept that without placing on record what I might refer to as the official objections to it.  It may be in three, four, or ten years' time the Dáil will be discussing some new Local Government (Amendment) Act and by that time experience will have shown that this idea of an executive committee of the whole house does not work out so well.  In view of the fact that on all sides of the House there is a desire for it, at least let the Minister say: &ldquo;I will give it a trial.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in comparing the experience of a member of a corporation&mdash;God help us&mdash;with that of a member of a county council because it is a different body altogether. Down the country we have an old saying. When we meet a particularly narrow-minded creature we say: &ldquo;You have a mind like a member of the Dublin Corporation.&rdquo;  God knows it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the statement made by my friend, Deputy MacEntee, I would like to point out that I have had experience as chairman of a board of assistance.  I think I did my work there fairly well, on a board where you have the conglomeration that Deputy MacEntee has alluded to.  We have the Minister for Social Welfare, the <Col N="722" /> Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Health, but they did not stop us from doing our duty and doing our work well.  Even when Deputy MacEntee was a Minister and tried to pull a pretty quick one in the line of the extra half-crown on the old age pensioners and the State's liability for that, I think Deputy Hickey will bear me out when I say that it did not take us too long to put our finger on the sore spot and make the Minister pay up.</P>
    <P>It might have been a rather sore matter with him at the time, but he had to put his hand in his pocket and fork out what the law allowed us.  The putting of a member of the board of health on one side, a member of a board of assistance on the other and a member of the county council as well, did not prevent me placing my finger on that little manoeuvre of the Minister's and bringing it out in the light of day.  We succeeded in getting a couple of thousand pounds that the unfortunate ratepayers would be hooked for otherwise.</P>
    <P>We also have had experience of this matter of the small committees.  I do not think there is any member here&mdash; I do not think there is any Cork County member, anyway&mdash;who can take his mind back to the time when we had county boards of health, composed of eight members, running the health matters of the county, something the same as is intended in this Bill.  I hold that there was not a more unpopular body in Cork County nor any body that did more injustice to the ratepayers of particular areas than that particular county board of health whilst they were in power until, thank God, we got means of removing them.</P>
    <P>I am speaking here with 27 years' experience as a member of a local authority.  That is a fairly long spell. I have seen them come and go and I can speak here honestly from my personal experience.  I am anxious now to have this matter finished if we can. I made an appeal to the Minister here to-night and I repeat that appeal honestly.  I say further that I saw his predecessor, God rest his soul, cut out from bodies on particular committees on <Col N="723" /> which he with his voice and experience, would have been of great assistance to us.  I say that here fairly and above board.  He was cut out from these bodies just because the Labour representation was not big enough to enable his to get in.  That is the situation that is going to be created by this fraud of a one-third game.  Drop it and drop it quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been emphasised by various speakers this is a very important point in the Bill.  The discussion, certainly, has been of a very helpful character, conducted, as it has been, in an atmosphere in which there has been a perfectly free and frank exchange of views, irrespective of Deputies' political affiliations, as to what would be the most successful method of appointing committees from the county council.  I am very glad that the discussion proceeded along these lines.  I indicated already that I had no bias whatever in the framing of this measure and that my only object was the restoration and preservation of the principle of democracy, to which reference has been made by Deputy Cowan and other Deputies, and to secure the efficient working of that democratic instrument.  In carrying out the transition from one system to another, one is obliged to have regard to many points.  At the outset, as has been mentioned by Deputy Cowan and Deputy MacEntee I should say that my experience of the working of committees on local authorities was gained in a corporation and I do not think that such experience would be much help when discussing the constitution of committees for a county council.  I have, therefore, to eschew any knowledge I have gained from the working of committees under the corporation, as being quite distinct from what one would have to deal with in the case of a county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points which it was urged should be borne in mind, if we are to aim at efficiency, was that the councillors will be drawn from a widespread area in counties such as Cork and Limerick and that much essential work will fall to be done from day to day&mdash;that is, work which was done <Col N="724" /> formerly by the manager, these executive functions.  These functions must be carried on from day to day.  Apart from that, the council, as a whole, must meet periodically to carry out the scheduled functions which cannot be delegated to anybody else.  There are also the executive functions.  I am still of opinion that the scheme envisaged by this Bill could not possibly function without at least two committees.  They may have a third committee if they wish, but they want at least two committees to deal with general matters and health matters.  As was mentioned by Deputy MacEntee, these councils will be functioning under three different departments&mdash;Social Welfare, Health and Local Government&mdash;and it is therefore necessary to segregate the work, where possible, so as to secure the expeditious discharge of its functions by the council.  The question is what is the most effective way to do that without sacrificing the principle of democracy.</P>
    <P>It has been stressed by a number of Deputies that people who were elected by the votes of the people and who are members of the council would be disfranchised because they did not happen to be on one of these committees.  I do not share that view, and it is an aspect of the matter that has been over-stressed. There is protection afforded by the proposals in the Bill, inasmuch as a third of the members will be dealing with health and a third with general matters.  Some Deputies went so far as to say that one man could run the show and reach a decision himself on these committees.  That, of course, is not so.  The only instance where one man could make a decision on his own would be on a question concerning home assistance.  It might be that he was the only member present at the committee when the question arose of granting home assistance urgently to some poor person and he would decide that home assistance should be given.  In no other instance can one man make a decision.</P>
    <P>The smallest committee that can be set up will consist of seven members out of a council of 21 and the biggest will consist of 16 members, where you have 45 or 46 members as in Cork.  With <Col N="725" /> the operation of proportional representation, one would naturally be inclined to believe that there was sufficient safeguard in this democratic country for the protection of elected representatives but there is the further safeguard that they are going to be elected for 12 months only and at the end of that period their work can be reviewed.  Another fact which should be borne in mind is that some members might have no desire to be on those committees.  Then a man who would not be lucky enough to get on either of the two committees which I have already mentioned would have several other committees on which he might expend his energies and they are by no means sinecure committees.  They are committees such as the rates committee, the agricultural committee and the library committee, all of which deal with important questions that come within the purview of the council.</P>

      <P>I think some Deputies fell into error in interpreting certain provisions in the Bill.  Some Deputies said that when the business was done by a small committee, there would be a complete rehash of that business when it came back to the county council. That is not quite correct.  What would happen is that the committee would report back to the council in the same way as a committee of this House reports back to the Dáil.  The committees would carry out the functions entrusted to them by the council, and the only occasion on which there would be any likelihood of a serious discussion at the council meeting of any of the matters already decided by the committee, would arise if the council thought that the executive committee was discharging their function in a manner that did not meet with their approval.  They are entitled as a supreme body under this measure to say if they are not satisfied: &ldquo;We are going to withdraw your powers in regard to that&rdquo; but the particular function that had been discharged, would be discharged beyond recall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only method of carrying out the work, but I suggest that there <Col N="726" /> is not very much likelihood of having a rehash of the business already discharged by the committee at the county council meeting, thus cluttering up the machinery of the county council with work already assigned to the executive committees.  That is the reason I was so strongly opposed to the suggestion of Deputy Childers that we should have advisory committees instead of these executive committees, who will have authority to conclude any work entrusted to them.  If, however, Deputies feel that there is any danger of overriding the authority of the council as a whole, I can assure them that we shall maintain the council's supremacy.  These will be merely committees of the council, and they will refer back to the council, just as a committee of this House refers back to the Dáil any Bill submitted to them.  Whether the committee will be a whole house committee or a small committee, they will still refer back to the parent body, the county council.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on the same note as that on which I started.  I do not want to interfere with any democratic principle good, bad or indifferent.  I have an open mind on this matter, and I am delighted with the discussions and the interchange of views that have taken place between Deputies, many of whom have experience of county councils.  If the House is of opinion from their knowledge that the work of the county councils would be better transacted by having the whole council as executive committees, I am prepared to accept that as a perfectly free decision of the House.  I shall be glad to accept the decision of the House and put it into operation, whether it directs a small committee or a whole house committee.  I want to get the instructions of the House on this matter.  Whatever the House says, will be put into effect, and whatever consequential amendments are necessary will be made on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne has given notice to raise on the motion for the Adjournment the subject-matter of Question 21 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Question 21, which I addressed to the Minister for Lands to-day, had to do with the strike of forestry workers which has continued at Blessington, Co. Wicklow, for almost five weeks, with one break of about ten days.  I think it is essential that the facts concerning this strike should be brought out into the open because, in my view, they reflect very great discredit on the Department of Lands and on the Minister.  This strike took place originally on the 8th January.  On that occasion, a number of men working at the forestry at Blessington were informed that a certain charge-hand would be placed in charge of them.  This charge-hand had had a previous history of employment with the Department.  On the occasion of his previous employment, some time prior to this, the men concerned from the Blessington area, because of the foul and filthy language which was used by the charge-hand to them, made representations to the forester, as a result of which the charge-hand was removed from his position of being in charge of the men.  The charge-hand for a period was then out sick and was engaged in other employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was indicated to the men prior to the 8th January that he was resuming in charge of this particular gang, and that he would have the authority which he had before.  I have concrete evidence, and there is, I submit, on the files of the Department of Lands evidence which cannot be challenged, <Col N="728" /> which shows very clearly that the person in question&mdash;I shall name him if the Minister or any Deputy so desires &mdash;is unfit and unqualified, by reason of his disposition, by reason of his attitude to the workers, by reason of the filthy language which he uses to the workers, and by reason of his insulting behaviour to the workers, to be in charge of any body of men, not alone in this country but in any country.</P>
    <P>As I say, these men took strike action on learning that this man, this charge-hand, was being put in charge of them.  I took an early opportunity of having the matter brought to the Minister's attention.  I may say that I did so with the greatest difficulty. I came up against certain difficulties in regard to officials in the forestry section of the Department of Lands, difficulties which I have become so used to now.  On a previous occasion, I had to refer here to the fact that I was refused details, although a member of this House, by that section in regard to the conditions under which men are employed by the Department of Lands on forestry work.  I had occasion to refer to that in the House. That attitude of mind which characterises the officials in the forestry section of the Department, as far as my experience goes, was carried over into this dispute.  However, eventually, after some difficulty I did reach the Minister, the result being that the Minister interviewed some of the men who were on strike.</P>
    <P>I want to say this, that an undertaking was given to me, and the men were definitely put under the impression by the Minister, that if they resumed work the charge-hand in question would be removed.  The men, being ordinary, simple countrymen, assumed that that undertaking would be honoured and resumed work.  They found, however, that the man was not removed.  Instead of removing him, the Minister sent out two inspectors who, on a couple of days, met the men concerned, and asked had this particular charge-hand been abusive and had he used the language previously complained of.  Of course, it was quite obvious what had been going on. This man was careful for the period during the resumption of work and did <Col N="729" /> not, in fact, commit himself as far as could be discovered during that particular period.  But I have evidence of an unquestionable nature to the effect that this man, while a charge-hand employed by the forestry section, used language which cannot be used here, but which I am sure Deputies can very well visualise, casting as I said earlier to-day, doubts upon the legitimacy of the workers, each and all of them, and accepting money from one worker so that, as was the phrase used, &ldquo;he might let him alone&rdquo;&mdash;accepting a sum of 2/6 from a badly paid worker in order to induce him from bullying and threatening him and treating this issue of taking the money in question as a great joke.</P>
    <P>That is the type of individual against whom the Minister says no case can be made.  I say that that is the case. We have 30 men, most of them married men, out on strike in Blessington, where it is very hard to get a job. We all know that it is very hard to get a job in West Wicklow.  The Minister suggests that these men are out just to pass their time or for amusement, as was suggested to-day. Then, I think, he cast doubts upon the sanity of the men concerned.  These are ordinary, simple, decent countrymen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not cast any doubts on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>You suggested, in your reply to-day, that there was no reason for these men to be out on strike.  If the Minister suggests that, he is suggesting that they are doing something which is irresponsible, which has no sense in it, and is insane.  If there was no reason for these men to put on themselves the hardship of a strike, they would be insane; but there is a hard, concrete solid reason for it.  As far as I am concerned as a member of the House&mdash;this is not my constituency, and these men are not my constituents and there are other Deputies who represent them&mdash; I feel it my duty, in ordinary common justice, to raise the matter here so that the facts will be made known. But here, in the year 1951, a Department of State is standing over the employment of an unfit individual, so <Col N="730" /> that men have to go out and stop work and undergo the hardship and privation which are inevitable when strikes occur, as well as the loss of income.  Their families are suffering, too, simply because the Department insists upon upholding this individual who, as I have said, is unfit and totally unqualified by reason of his attitude to be in charge of men.</P>
      <P>I want to say that it is a disgusting thing that I should have to bring this up here at all.  If this occurred in any employment outside of the forestry section of the Department of Lands, I am quite satisfied that it would not be necessary to mention a second time that this conduct was going on.  I would say that, if it happened in any other employment, the employer, if he was any way reasonable, would immediately, in his own interests if not from the point of view of ordinary common decency, remove an individual of this type.  Here we have the Minister saying he can discover nothing wrong with the man, although it can be seen from the files of the Department that when previous complaints were made in the Blessington area to the forester in charge by the men concerned and other men who are not under his control at present this individual had to be removed.  He is not a local of the area, and he is not even married.  He does not qualify to be a charge-hand because I have documents in my possession from the Department of Lands which indicate that a man to be appointed a charge-hand in the forestry section must have three years' continuous service.  This man has not had three years' continuous service, yet he is appointed a charge-hand.  He abuses the men foully, and we have the position that 30 men and their families are being sacrificed to suit this individual. There is something wrong with that. This man must have very influential friends either in the forestry section or outside, but at least in the employment of the forestry section, who are keeping him where he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister now in the interests of common humanity, decency and justice to get rid of this individual from the Blessington forest and to allow these men to go back without having <Col N="731" /> the fear of being bullied hanging over their heads and so that they will not have to listen to language which should not be heard by any workmen.  That kind of conduct went on years ago before we had trade unions and when workers were not organised.  It may go on still in some parts of the country, but it will not be accepted in County Dublin from the State or from any employer.  It will not be accepted on the borders of the county or in County Wicklow.  No decent man in this part of the country will work under such a charge-hand.  I ask the Minister even now to get rid of this man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne would appear to picture me as having taken little or no interest, or not having been inclined to take a fair line of action or conduct, in this particular matter. Let us take this matter from the beginning. The particular charge-hand who is objected to commenced work for the first time in Ballyward centre on January 8th as a charge-hand.  He was a labourer up to that for a considerable time.  On the morning that he was to take up duty as charge-hand the men refused to work for him.  In other words, as soon as they knew he was appointed they said they would not work under him.  They never had an opportunity of knowing what he was like as a charge-hand, except one man who worked under him as a charge-hand in a forest centre about four miles away.  It is not correct to say that he was removed by the forestry section from the post of charge-hand in the forest centre at Deerpark three or four miles away.  He went off work there in the previous June on account of his health.  There was no need for a second charge-hand in the Ballyward centre until January last when it was necessary to split up the gang of men working there and appoint a second charge-hand and the forester in charge appointed this particular man.  He was appointed on Saturday evening and the following Monday when he went to work the men refused to work for him. With the exception of one man, they never had an opportunity of knowing what he was like as a charge-hand. Deputy Dunne took an interest in the <Col N="732" /> matter and asked me to meet the men. The Deputy stated that it was with difficulty that he contacted me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that when efforts were made from my office to make an appointment with the Minister one of the Minister's officials told one of my officials that if the matter related to Blessington I need not bother because the Minister would not see me.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always made it a point to meet any Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone do I make it a point to meet Deputies but I also make it a point to meet deputations. I think it is only right that a Minister should see Deputies and deputations just as Deputies receive deputations in their own constituencies and elsewhere. That is time well spent.  To come back to the matter under discussion, do not forget that it was not on the Director of Forestry the men were striking; they were striking against me.  A Minister is responsible for his Department.  I took the unusual step then of meeting a number of these men and discussing the matter with them. I have every sympathy with them.  I know that men do not strike just for fun and that is why I took offence at Deputy Corry's attitude at Question Time to-day.  But when men go on strike I like to be assured that they have a good and just cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular instance I say that if the men reflect on the matter they will find they have not a just cause. I say that without in any way detracting from them.  Neither do I hold that they have embarked on this strike <Col N="733" /> lightly.  In the first instance they went back to work on my advice.  Deputy Dunne says that I gave them an undertaking. I did not give them an undertaking. I will quote their own words for Deputy Dunne in that regard.  The only undertaking I gave them was that I would have the verbal complaints they made to me investigated.  I thought the complaints serious enough to merit the sending down of two of the senior officials of my Department with strict instructions that they were to query everybody, the men themselves, the forester in charge and the particular head labourer concerned, in order to get for me a fully impartial report of what was happening.  The men were questioned and Mr. &ldquo;X&rdquo;, as we will call him, stated quite definitely several times that they were treated properly by the head labourer during the week.  The men stated that the Minister gave them no promise of any kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>He definitely said that in the presence of his companions.  The particular head labourer was not present so that he could not have had any evil influence, as was suggested; neither could he have intimidated the men into saying something that was not correct.  The men went back to work and during that week they said the head labourer did not use bad language. I cannot say whether or not he has a foul tongue, but he certainly has not used it while acting as head labourer over these men.  That is why I say they have not a just cause for striking.  I can assure Deputy Dunne that the moment I get positive proof that any man in charge of men is using foul language&mdash;I will not be squeamish <Col N="734" /> about it&mdash;I will take action.  I am sure this man can give his orders in whatever language he uses&mdash;English or Irish or whatever it is&mdash;plainly and simply without the abuse that Deputy Dunne alleges.  I do not believe any man would be so foul-mouthed as Deputy Dunne alleges this head labourer to be.</P>

In the name of that justice and humanity of which Deputy Dunne speaks, why should I remove him unless I have just cause for doing so?  Why should I deny that head labourer the increase in pay to which his promotion entitles him?  Why should I refuse him a higher status without just cause?  If I find just cause to take disciplinary action I will take it, not for the sake of inflicting a wound but for the sake of the men and for the good of the Department. I have no just cause to take action against this man, and if I deprive him of his pay I would feel compelled to make restitution to him.  I am sure the officials I sent down to investigate did not deceive me, and I am bound in conscience and justice not to deprive this man of something he has earned until such time as I get cause to do so.  If I find at any time that the men are being unfairly or harshly treated I will take prompt and swift action.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a reply to a question from Deputy Maguire on the 7th March last in connection with statistics of progress under the land project.  I undertook that comprehensive returns would be furnished periodically to Dáil Éireann, and the Deputy will recollect that two such returns have been supplied, the latest in November last.  A further return is in preparation and will be available to Deputies within the next few weeks.  It will include information relating to the recent extension of the project, i.e., the fertilisers scheme.  I trust that this return will give the Deputy the information he requires.  If it does not, I will have the Deputy supplied with whatever supplementary information he asks for.</P>
