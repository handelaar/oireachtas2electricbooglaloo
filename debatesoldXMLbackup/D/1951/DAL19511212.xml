      <P>Statistics of imports into this country are brought to account in accordance with the headings in the Official Import List which does not provide separate headings for the commodities specified by the Deputy.  As regards (a), a statement, showing the quantity (in hundredweights as the numbers are not available) and value of imports in each of the first ten months of this year of &ldquo;Other earthenware, chinaware and other clay products&mdash;pipes and connections, unglazed, not elsewhere specified&rdquo; under which clay land drainage pipes are brought to account, will, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, be circulated in the Official Report.  As regards (b), the imports of concrete land drainage pipes into this country during the period in question are believed to be negligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of a proposal for a cement project referred to by him in Dáil Éireann on 28th November, 1951, (Official Report Volume 127, No. 10, column 1822) (1) if the summary of the said proposal as set out in column 1822 was made by his Department or the Industrial Development Authority; and, if so, the date upon which such summary was made; and whether any report upon the said proposal was received by him at any time from his Department or the Industrial Development Authority; (2) if either his Department or the Industrial Development Authority reported that the said proposal involved: (a) that the promoter in question was to be given a monopoly of the sale of all cement in this country, (b) that Irish Cement, Limited, were to sell all their cement through the said promoter, (c) that the said promoter was, in the course of a couple of years, to make £2,000,000 profit; and, if so, if he will quote the relevant extracts from either or both of the reports on the three matters or any of them; (3) in particular, if the figure of £2,000,000 profit was at any time mentioned or suggested in connection with the said proposal; and (4) the basis of the allegation that £2,000,000 profit was to be made in the course of a couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The summary of the proposal relating to cement manufacture on which I based my remarks on November 28th was prepared in the Department of Industry and Commerce at my request prior to the debate.  Regarding the proposal referred to in the question, the promoter in this case proposed the establishment of a central organisation&mdash;called by him a &ldquo;sales central&rdquo;&mdash;which could buy or take over all cement whether home manufactured or imported.  Commission on the imports of cement was to be granted to a company with which the promoter was connected.  For this concession a cement factory which was originally estimated by the promoter to cost £1,000,000 was to be erected in two years.  In using the figure of £2,000,000, I had regard to other and more reliable estimates of the probable cost of a new factory of adequate size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the last part of the question, I have seen a report of a meeting held in the Department of Industry and Commerce on 1st March, 1950 (a copy of which the Deputy obviously used in putting down his question). The Chairman of Cement, Limited, is reported as saying that he could not agree that the dividends paid by Cement, Limited, had been high or even that the figure of 10 per cent. was high; he said that companies operating in Britain under a Labour Government had been paying out 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. by way of dividend; and that he could understand an objection to 10 per cent. if the industry were not efficient or if it were not working to capacity.  He is reported as having claimed that they were efficient and they were undoubtedly producing over 100 per cent. of their rated capacity; and he, therefore, felt that it was wrong that they should be criticised for looking for 10 per cent. merely <Col N="759" /> because certain people had &ldquo;bees in their bonnets&rdquo; about monopolies.  So far as public opinion was concerned, he thought that it was up to democratic government to educate public opinion in this and other respects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister quote the relevant part of the summary which he suggests substantiates his statement the other day that the gentleman in question was to be given a monopoly of the sale of cement in the country, that he was to be given the right to import and sell supplementary cement and that he was to make a profit of £2,000,000?  Will the Minister quote the relevant parts of the summary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated very categorically in the summary that he gave in column 1822 that he was quoting the proposal as summarised and as well as that he mentioned his proposal as a proposal which Mr. McGilligan was pressing and he mentioned specifically that this promoter was to get £2,000,000 profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal was that the commission on the sales of imported cement was to be paid to the promoter or the company with which the promoter was associated and <Col N="760" /> that in return for that concession a cement factory was to be built.  The original estimate for the cost was £1,000,000 but it was obviously very substantially underestimated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister summarised what he has mentioned now in quite different terms in his statement here and he stated explicitly that it was part of the proposal that the promoter should receive a profit of £2,000,000.  Will the Minister substantiate that in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He estimated himself that £1,000,000 would be enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>(a) £1 0s. 0d. per week for life, or</P>

      <P>I understand that in many cases the option at (c) above is selected, as the reduction at the age of 70 qualifies pensioners for the maximum amount of old age pension.</P>

      <P>The survey of departmental organisation is a continuous process to which, however, special attention has been given in recent years. Certain special survey measures were decided on in 1947 and added to in 1949. Most of these are still in operation and are likely to continue for several years. So far these measures have resulted in savings which are estimated to exceed £70,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that a considerable number of persons affected with tuberculosis in County Kildare are without institutional care; and, if so, whether he proposes to give any guidance or assistance to the Kildare County Council in dealing with this urgent problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is aware that not every person affected with tuberculosis requires institutional care and that he is referring only to persons who, in the opinion of the competent medical officer, require such care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities submit to me each month particulars of the number of persons on the county medical officers' tuberculosis register who are receiving institutional treatment and the number of persons who are on the tuberculosis register who are awaiting such treatment. The total of these two figures should represent the number of persons requiring such treatment.  According to the returns submitted to me by the <Col N="773" /> Kildare County Council, the number of adult pulmonary cases in that category for County Kildare rose from 74 at the end of January last to 126 at the end of November.  The main rise occurred in June, in which month the numbers rose from 92 to 123.  I am still awaiting a reply to an inquiry addressed to the local authority as to the reason for this increase.  The 70 per cent. increase from January to November in Kildare is not paralleled in any other area. The number of adults suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis awaiting admission or readmission to institutions rose over that period from eight to 43.</P>
    <P>As a solution of the problem, the health authority have proposed that the county fever hospital at Naas be adapted for use as a tuberculosis institution to accommodate about 40 patients.</P>
    <P>Before approving of this proposal, I must, of course, be satisfied that alternative accommodation can readily be made available for local cases of infectious desease, other than tuberculosis. I am awaiting further information from the health authority in regard to this matter and as soon as it is received, I shall give an early decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that, though obviously for the purpose of his Department he must ascertain the cause of the rise, yet the operative factor is that there are such cases awaiting treatment?  There are about 50 cases behindhand, waiting for treatment, some of them for the best part of five months, according to the information in my possession. Would the Minister give the dates upon which the local authority was asked to give this information to him which he suggests has not been furnished?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister go into the matter personally?  I am not treating this as a political matter but my information is that the boot is on the other foot, that we are awaiting replies from his Department and that it is because his Department wish to <Col N="774" /> utilise the Naas Fever Hospital for that purpose that we are not allowed to use it for tuberculosis patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's reluctance to give the information but the public is already aware of the position.  There is a post office over 11 miles away from this particular house and there is not another house to be connected because there are only a few small cottages in between. This particular party has got this phone while doctors are waiting, some of them for a transfer.  We all understand the reason why this particular person has become a subscriber.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 to 60 together.</P>
      <P>I consider that the expenditure of the considerable amount of official time which the compilation of the special statistics requested in the Deputy's questions would necessitate, would not be justified. It is possible, however, to give the Deputy some general information.</P>
      <P>A standard specification for concrete drainage pipes was evolved by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and was published in February, 1951 (Irish Standard 31/51). My Department is satisfied that pipes manufactured to this standard are suitable for use in connection with the land project where soil analysis indicates that deleterious elements are not present. An Irish standard specification for clay ware drainage pipes is in course of preparation.  Meantime, all clay pipes conforming to the British Standard Specification are acceptable.</P>
      <P>In the early stages of the land project the supply of drainage pipes of native manufacture was insufficient to meet demand.  Arrangements had to be made to import drainage pipes and while such arrangements were being completed, some delays occurred in the execution of drainage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No contracts were at any time made for the importation of concrete pipes, but my Department arranged to purchase from factories in Northern Ireland all surplus supplies of clay drainage pipes.  Arrangements were also made to purchase clay drainage pipes from the Continent.  Up to date, <Col N="794" /> approximately 7,000,000 pipes have been imported.  Deliveries, which commenced in June, 1950, vary according to the time of year.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 20,000,000 pipes will be used on the land project in 1952 and that of this number 75 per cent. will be of the baked clay variety.</P>
    <P>The total number of pipes used since the inception of the land project is approximately 9,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, at this stage, in view of the fact that a number of concrete pipe manufacturers held back production until a standard was fixed by the Bureau of Standards and are now coming into production, that it is immensely important that they should at least get a trickle of orders while the existing stocks are being used up?  Would he consider asking the Land Project Director to dilute the existing stocks of imported pipes with a fair share of the home manufactured concrete pipes upon which we will ultimately depend, and see that the encouragement of the Department will be given so that they have enough business to keep them going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the difficulty is this that some fellows held back until a standard was fixed.  It takes a long time to fix a standard. There is a large accumulation of pipes which the Minister has said is about 75 per cent. sufficient for 1952.</P>

If concrete pipes come up to standard and it is found that we can use them in non-acid soils, then we will use them as far as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a financial resolution in connection with the Committee Stage of the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce this specific question: Under this legislation it is proposed to appropriate money for the purpose of helping undeveloped areas, and the Minister was careful to emphasise that it was for the development of these areas.  He wanted no misunderstanding about that.  It is in that connection that I want to question him. Industrial development depends, I think, on four factors&mdash;the availability of capital, the availability of labour, the availability of a market for the finished product and the availability of raw material.  I want to suggest to the Minister that this is too narrow.  The purpose of this legislation is to exclude from the functions to be exercised under this Bill the task of providing raw materials.  There is no use in erecting a factory, providing capital and assembling labour in the West of Ireland if there is a want of raw materials. We have had that bitter experience repeatedly in Castlebar, in Claremorris, in Limerick and in Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is satisfied, should substantial additional employment be provided say in Castlebar or Claremorris, that there would be a supply of raw materials for the factory established there and that such supplies would be abundant. Would he consider, in collaboration with the Minister for Agriculture, devoting part of his energies to getting from these hinterland factories a growing supply of raw materials on <Col N="803" /> which to operate them.  I mention Castlebar, Claremorris, Limerick and Tralee particularly because there is present in my mind the fact that we have already factories established in these places.  We have the men and the capital at these centres as well as an unlimited market.  The one thing we lack in sufficient quantity is raw material.  In so far as some of these factories are concerned that lack has been filled by turning them over to the preparation of dressed meat for export.  If, under this Bill, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in collaboration with the Minister for Agriculture, would intensively promote the production of pigs in the area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know if my explanation of the purpose of this Bill was defective or that Deputies chose to misunderstand it.  The sole purpose is to enable us to give to persons undertaking industrial development in undeveloped areas aid to the extent deemed necessary to offset the disadvantages of the locations.</P>
      <P>All other forms of help to industries in those areas will be given by the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Agriculture in the same degree as to industries located elsewhere.  This Bill has a limited function which is to off-set the competitive disadvantages attached to industrial activity in certain areas but those who get help under the Bill will have available to them the services ordinarily given which will continue to be given by every other Government Department. If, therefore, there is a project for the establishment of a factory for the processing of any agricultural material in those areas the help required, if help is required, to secure the extended production of that agricultural product there, will be made available by the Department of Agriculture in the normal course of that Department's work.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister explain this to me?  An industry located in the West of Ireland may suffer from either of two handicaps, one, an inconvenient remoteness from its market or, alternatively, an inconvenient remoteness from its raw material.  The Minister is quite prepared and sees his way clearly to off-set the handicap of remoteness from the consumer market.  All I am asking him is this, if he can off-set the factory's remoteness from abundant supply of raw material by promoting the production of that raw material in the immediate vicinity of the factory, will he think that a proper charge?</P>

Once he has got that help he is on his own.  There is no further assistance under this Bill.  If any further help is required, he has to seek it in the same manner as any other industry, from the proper Government Department.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 2, between lines 11 and 12, to insert a new definition as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;industrial undertaking&rdquo; includes an undertaking in existence at the passing of this Act;</P>
      <P>I have some slight hesitation in proposing this amendment.  I considered carefully whether the help to be given under this Bill should be confined to new enterprises or whether it should, under any circumstances, be made available for the purpose of extending an existing enterprise.  I initially decided against giving help for the expansion of existing enterprises because I felt that an existing enterprise was one that having been located in an undeveloped area already, presumably did not regard itself as being at any great disadvantage because the decision to go there was voluntary; and, secondly, because it might lead to difficulties in deciding what constituted an extension of an existing enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pressed, however, by a number of speakers in the course of the debate on the Second Reading to agree to make it clear that help could be given for the expansion of existing enterprises and I must admit that it would be illogical not to do so, because we can foresee circumstances in which the expansion of existing enterprises might be just as beneficial to the area concerned <Col N="807" /> or just as productive of increased employment there as the establishment of new enterprises.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, am agreeing to make this amendment to make it clear that Foras Tionscal can consider applications from existing concerns seeking to extend their operations.  But I think I should also make it clear that such help will only be given where a new form of activity is being undertaken by some existing concern; in other words, I would not like Foras Tionscal to be dealing with applications for the renovation of obsolete plant or of repairing defects in existing equipment which should have been remedied by good management.  They should be asked to deal only with propositions such as the erection of a new wing to a factory, the extension of a new line of production that might conceivably have been done by a new undertaking as a separate enterprise.</P>
    <P>My anxiety in this matter is perhaps excessive but I want to make it quite clear that the purpose of the Bill is to encourage new enterprises and activities in the undeveloped areas rather than provide any sustenance or support for existing enterprises which, because of bad management or defective planning, are getting into difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, I think the case urged by Deputies for making it clear that the expansion of existing enterprises could be considered is sound and that is why I am making this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's decision in this regard is sound subject to one qualification.  I think it must inevitably give grave scandal if Oireachtas Éireann gives grants of money to industrial plants at present operating in the province of Connacht because you will be confronted with the situation that people who have the reputation locally of being relatively wealthy people are receiving grants from the Government whereas they are living surrounded by people in relatively humble circumstances, whose minds never even conceived the possibility of asking the Government <Col N="808" /> for a sum of money similar to what their wealthy neighbour appears to have received.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that to make this decision on the basis of grants not only puts him but I think puts us all in an impossible position.  There is, however, a way out.  I put it to the Minister that it is a perfectly legitimate thing to give a loan free of interest if there is an industry which is functioning in this part of the country which has not adapted itself to the changing times sufficiently rapidly and is now threatened with possible destruction because it has not equipped itself to meet the situation, and it cannot raise the capital because the interest on the capital necessary to bring its equipment up to date would cripple it, within our existing tax structure.  I think that the Minister knows that if an old business tries to raise capital to re-equip itself now, by the time taxation has finished with its profits, it is put to the pin of its collar to pay the interest, not to speak of repayment of the loan.  If the Minister would say: &ldquo;I will in this case lend £3,000 or £4,000 if they satisfy me they are going to put the money into this project of modernisation and development so that if a person puts £1 into the creation of a new industry or into the rehabilitation of a rundown industry, to create more employment and diversity of employment in the province of Connacht or these other areas, I shall make that £1 in effect do the work of £4 or £5 by advancing by way of loan to be repaid in 20 equal annual instalments of 5 per cent. of the capital&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Say we are advancing A B £20,000 for the next 20 years.  He must pay back £1,000 a year to the Government.  He is getting no grant and he will not be free from his obligation to pay back £1,000 a year until the loan is completely extinct. I think that is the practical thing to do.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was addressing myself to the Bill on Second Reading, I pointed out that this was a power I did not like. When a Minister takes power to add something by Order, and it requires a deputation or representations from some body to be made to him, there is something of the procedure of the mendicant about it and I do not like that that is necessary.  I would much prefer if the areas to be served by this particular Act were set out in the Act.  It would be declared that these were the areas which had this right by statute and we would not then be dependent <Col N="810" /> on the whims of a Minister as to whether a place should come in or should go out.  While perhaps it is an advantage to have the provision there, I do not like the way in which it is to be operated or the possibilities which it opens up.  I am not actuated by any objection to the Minister personally but I say it is a power that should not be vested in any Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be convenient if, on this amendment, I commented on the general form of the section because I take it the amendment is in some way linked up with other amendments in which Deputies seek to add other counties and areas to those named in sub-section (2).  This section of the Bill caused me more difficulty in the framing of it than perhaps any other because I realised that, whatever I did, some legitimate criticism could be expressed of it.  We can either apply the Bill to the whole country, which would make it meaningless because the purpose of the Bill is to induce industrial development from the eastern half to the western half of the country if possible, or else we can leave out the congested areas as defined in previous statutes and leave the whole operation of the Bill dependent on ministerial Order to apply to particular districts.  The objection to that course, which I had originally in mind to follow, is that it obscures the main purpose of the Bill.  If we frame the Bill merely with a provision that an undeveloped area is what the Minister declares to be an undeveloped area, then it will be less obvious that its purpose is to give this attraction to industry to move west rather than east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, therefore, decided to take, mainly for the purpose of emphasising in a special way the purpose of the Bill, the congested areas as defined in previous statutes.  The advantage of following that course is that it removed any suggestion that the counties or areas which are set out in paragraph (2) were determined by any process of selection at the present time.  These congested areas have been defined in statute for a long number of years and defined in statute for purposes somewhat analogous to that which inspired the Bill.  At the same time it was quite <Col N="811" /> obvious to us that it would be argued that there are areas in the country which are as undeveloped as any of these congested areas, where the economic circumstances are practically the same and where a new industry would be at the same or somewhat the same disadvantage as it would be in the congested areas as defined here. Therefore, we adopted this device of saying that the Bill must apply to the congested districts as defined in the previous legislation and may apply to other areas.</P>
    <P>I would be the last to deny that West Cavan, North Longford and part of West Limerick, or any of those areas which are more or less similar in economic conditions to adjoining areas set out in the Bill, are as much in need of the type of help which this Bill offers, if there is to be any industrial development there at all, as the congested areas defined.</P>
    <P>If it would be of any help to Deputies for me to put it on the record now, I would have no hesitation in saying that on getting an industrial proposition from any such district, I would let it go to this board to be established, An Foras Tionscail, to decide whether there was in fact competitive disadvantage in the location which it would be possible in the manner proposed in the Bill to remove and, if the board thought there was, to make an Order bringing in that area.  I urge Deputies, however, not to seek to amend the definition of congested areas as set out, not because it is intended to confine the Bill to these areas or to exclude from its benefits areas like West Cavan, North Longford and West Limerick or other areas adjacent to the congested districts where conditions are similar, but because if we do attempt to amend the definition of the congested areas, we will get ourselves into considerable trouble.  The definition of the congested areas was decided on a calculation which related population to valuation. We could easily, if we wanted to do it, amend that formula or get some other formula, and then find out what results it would give us when applied to individual counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> I think Deputy MacEoin, as any other Longford Deputy, would have difficulty in defending a proposal to extend this Bill to some areas in North Longford and not to other parts of Longford.  I think he would be compelled by local considerations to urge that the whole of Longford should be included.  Deputies from Cavan and Deputies from Limerick would find themselves in the same position.  In my view, it is not merely wiser but simpler to leave the Bill as it stands, to take the definition of the congested areas as laid down in a number of existing Acts, and to give power to somebody to extend the Bill to other areas where economic conditions are similar and where a new industry would have equivalent competitive disadvantages.</P>
    <P>I considered whether that power of extending the areas should be given to An Foras Tionscal or kept by the Minister, but my conclusion was that it was wiser to keep it in the hands of the Minister, because An Foras Tionscal will be primarily concerned with the administration of the fund entrusted to it.  It will be composed of people with special qualifications for that purpose, but they will not necessarily be familiar with the economic conditions in these areas and it would be unreasonable to ask them to carry out an investigation of these conditions to make themselves familiar with them before coming to a decision.  It is far more convenient for the Minister to get any information which he would require to enable him to make a decision from the Central Statistics Office or any other source.  In fact, there will not be much difficulty in making a decision because in the areas which everybody knows are similar in character to the congested areas and which are not likely to secure industrial development except helped in this way a new industrial enterprise would have competitive disadvantages because of the location, and the Minister will have no difficulty in deciding what those areas are.  I think, however, that if we try either to alter the definition of congested areas in the Bill or, as Deputy MacEoin's amendment would achieve, confine the Bill solely to the congested areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that in most of what the Minister says he has more or less the same ideas as Deputy MacEoin.  I also rather imagine that if the Bill were to have been applied to the congested areas, it would have been much more satisfactory. I smile, and I am sure many eastern Deputies smile, when we see these various amendments down to include Leitrim, part of Longford, portion of this and that and this townland and the other.  I rather imagine that Deputy Allen and I could argue a case for the parish of Kilrush in Wexford or for some State assistance for the promotion of industry in New Ross.  We could very well argue a case for assistance to industries in the four major towns in Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, but I am taking up what the Minister said.  If we did that, I imagine the Bill would be a huge joke.  I do not think the Minister should have power to apply the Act to any other areas that he considers suitable for assistance.  As a matter of fact, I rather imagine that this Bill will go some distance towards decentralisation, but I rather think in the wrong way.  I may be the only Deputy to approach this Bill from this <Col N="814" /> particular point of view.  What struck me rather forcibly was that the congested areas listed here comprise in the main the counties of Connacht.  I remember that Cromwell banished the decent Irish people from the North, East and part of the South to Connacht. It was, &ldquo;To Hell or Connacht.&rdquo; We have there tens of thousands of people who are trying to exist in what Cromwell considered to be the worst part of the country.  We are trying to keep these tens of thousands there.</P>
      <P>It is true that there has been an industrial revolution to some small extent in this country and that Connacht has changed somewhat from what it was in Cromwell's time.  But if we think that we are going to industrialise Connacht or the congested areas, I think we have another guess coming.  I do not imagine the Minister, for whom I have a lot of respect, is so foolish as to imagine that we can industrialise even in a very small way the Province of Connacht or the congested districts.</P>
      <P>In this particular section, power should be given to the board, not to the Minister, to come to the assistance of industries or of industrialists who propose to start business in all parts of the country, because I rather imagine that one result of this Bill will be that there will be unfair competition.  Business people and industrialists in the Province of Leinster consider that there is unfair competition between them and manufacturers in the City of Dublin. I could quote one particular case in my constituency of a furniture factory.  It is not a very big business.  I think, however, that this particular firm will not be very pleased if a similar type of factory is to be subsidised in a place situated, say, about 100 miles from the City of Dublin.  That firm in Wexford Town will be labouring under the same difficulties and disadvantages as the firm situated in the West 100 miles from Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that the board in determining the people to whom they will give assistance will take all these factors into consideration and preserve that balance whereby there will not be unfair <Col N="815" /> competition so far as the industries established in the West will be concerned.</P>
    <P>I think, though I do not believe it properly arises under this amendment, that the first effort Fianna Fáil made to industrialise the West and to relieve the economic situation there was the establishment of the Tuam beet factory. I think that is recognised as one of the biggest mistakes Fianna Fáil ever made.  I have no political axe to grind in this.  I must confess I could not persuade the last Government, of which I was a junior member, or some of my colleagues who were of the same opinion even though politically opposed to me, that that factory should be transferred to somewhere in the South, preferably New Ross, and that the building itself should not be closed down but should be used for some purpose, such as the manufacture of artificial manures, in order not to inflict hardship on those at present employed there.</P>
    <P>Every year the managing director of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann has submitted in his report that the Tuam factory is not an economic venture. To-day, beet grown by farmers in Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny is being sent up there via Carlow to keep the factory going.  I say that merely to sound a note of warning in order to ensure that the board will not lash money around all over the West to establish white elephants there.  Undoubtedly the Tuam beet factory is a white elephant.  The western Deputies will not agree with me on that but I respectfully submit that that was a blunder by Fianna Fáil away back in the 1930's.  That blunder was not made by the experts who were studying the problem at the particular time.</P>
    <P>I agree that if the Minister has the right or power to determine the area to which the Act will apply there is a possibility that it may be very well used.</P>

      <P>In time they can be included by Order of the Minister.  If we try to put every area in at this stage probably nothing will be done and I believe it is wiser to have the provision there that at any time when the Minister, no matter of what Government he may be a member, is fully convinced that an area is not alone congested but also depressed he can include it under the Bill.  If the resources are available and there is a certain amount of capital for the establishment of an industry, then the concessions being given to the present congested districts under this Bill can be made available to other areas.</P>

I think that is wrong.  Deputies may have a good knowledge of the difficulties that exist in certain areas but we are not at the moment in a position to pass judgment as to what other areas should be included.  I think the present provision is the lesser of two evils.  It is better to have that power there so that if the Minister, having taken everything into consideration and with the advice of experts available to him, decides that an area should be included it will be time enough to consider its inclusion then.</P>

On the other hand, <Col N="817" /> if the Minister is susceptible to political influence he must bow to one's demand.  Whatever is done should be done by statute so that everybody will know to what exactly people are entitled.</P>
      <P>If people think it is unwise to include the areas of which they have knowledge, but which are not included under this Bill, I will argue here and now for certain areas.  I disagree with the Minister when he says that the congested areas were established because of density of population and so on. That was only part of it.  I remember the evidence tendered by the various counties before the Congested Districts Commission and I know why certain counties were excluded.</P>

      <P>This commission was set up in 1902 or 1903.  I can turn up the records of the evidence tendered at the particular time.  What I am arguing on this amendment is that the principle that the Minister can grant a favour by including an area is wrong; vice versa, he can punish an area by excluding it.  If one gives him power to put them in, one also gives him power to keep them out.  If it is there by Order, it must be at his will and pleasure and at the will and pleasure of the Government.  It is on the principle of that section that I am arguing.  If the House is of opinion that somebody should have the power, then I think the best person to exercise it is the Minister.  I do not care how political he is or how politically-minded he may become because, in the ultimate, he has responsibility to this House.  I am prepared to give the Minister the power which, I think, he ought to have.  He can answer to the House.  I would much prefer that the Minister would have the power rather than some person over whom we have no control except, perhaps, the power of dismissal.  Then we would have a row.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should carefully consider the whole matter of taking <Col N="818" /> this power.  There is a great inclination on the part of Governments and of civil servants, in particular, to give Ministers the power practically to legislate by Order.  We have that in practically every Bill coming before us.  The Minister is given power to do something which this House itself should do.  I do not think that is wise. I think that the Minister and the Government should seriously consider this question not only in regard to this Bill but to every Bill, that is, the question of letting us have statute law and not law by regulation or by Order.  That is a thing which, I think, has gone too far already and is not in the interests of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Congested Districts Board was set up in 1891.  I do not think the Deputy was very much interested in its proceedings then. The congested districts were defined as areas where more than 20 per cent. of the population lived in electoral divisions of which the total rateable valuation, when divided by the number of the population, gave a sum of less than £1 10s. 0d. for each individual. That formula was applied and the result accepted regardless of any other consideration.  If we could get a corresponding formula now and apply it we could equally accept the result with a reservation, however, that the aim is to induce private enterprise away from the East if it can be done. I think we would have that aim, irrespective of the applicability of that or any other formula to a particular western county or to any county on the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had thought of several alternatives to what is in the Bill as it stands, that the Minister can extend it to other areas by Order.  I do not think that will be done in the circumstances visualised by Deputy MacEoin, of local deputations coming up and saying &ldquo;We are in a bad way in this area&rdquo; and &ldquo;Make an Order extending the Bill to our district,&rdquo; assuming that there are that many projects forthcoming.  It will be some group of people who propose to engage in an industry coming to the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="819" /> and saying: &ldquo;We are agreeable to locate this industry in some of those districts, West Cavan or North Longford or some other, provided we can get for that industry the same help which we would get if we had gone into one of the congested areas&rdquo; and on that case the Minister would make his decision.  The amount of help would be decided by the board, the board being empowered to apportion the help on the basis of the competitive disadvantage which the project would suffer by being in that area.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies are thinking of this Bill functioning as a result of the activities of local development committees or organisations of that kind.  I hope that such committees will be formed and will get some useful projects put forward for consideration, but I think it is likely to be far more effective in another way.  Already, there are some people who have shown an interest in the provisions of the Bill, people who were contemplating engaging in industrial enterprise in any event.  Every other day we have individuals or groups of individuals coming to the Department of Industry and Commerce to discuss ideas they have for establishing a new industry, or for participating in some industry already established, and asking for information about the market for their products, about the protection in force or the help which the Government might give.  When that happens in the future, the official discussing their ideas with them can inform them of the help the Government might be able to afford.  He will be able to say to them that if they go to some of those districts, then, over and above the help which they would normally get, they will get this additional help subject to the approval and decision of An Foras Tionscal.  It is in that way that any development that takes place under the Bill will, in the main, be secured.</P>
    <P>If there was in the minds of Deputies any apprehension that the Minister might respond to political pressure in the making of Orders, or might make such Orders for political purposes, I would be quite willing to put into the Bill a provision requiring such Orders <Col N="820" /> to be submitted to the Dáil for approval.  I do not think, however, that it would be desirable to do that.  That might help to arouse doubts in the minds of people promoting an industry. The position would be that they would not know, finally, whether they were going to get help until the Order had been approved by the Dáil.  On the other hand, I think it would be unwise to limit the Minister's power to extend the Bill to counties which are contiguous to those named in the Bill, because if other counties are named for that purpose no Minister on earth could resist the pressure that would be exerted on him to make an Order to extend the Bill to the whole of a county.</P>
    <P>I realise that it would have been easier for me to get the Bill through the House if, instead of being in this form, I had brought in a Bill which said that an undeveloped area was an area that was declared to be an undeveloped area by ministerial Order. The argument against that is that it would have made the purpose of the Bill less clear.  It was only by naming the congested areas in the Bill that it was made abundantly clear that the purpose of the Bill was to get development towards the western seaboard counties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the establishment of the Tuam beet factory.  I would not like any false deductions to be drawn from his observations regarding it.  It is quite true that when putting the beet factory in Tuam the Government acted against all the expert advice which they had sought before determining the location of the three factories on which we decided on at that time.  If we were to rely on expert advice, however, there would be no industrial development in the West. The experts will always say that the most suitable location for a major industrial project is at a large port or in a large centre of population, or where the facilities of a large town are available.  They nearly always exclude the West of Ireland.  If, therefore, we are going to organise industrial development there, we have to act in the teeth of expert advice of that kind. We need not be too anxious about the <Col N="821" /> result.  It is quite true that the Tuam beet factory never got in the area its normal supply of beet.  Beet had to be transported to it from other areas. For a long time the energies of the Government were directed towards getting enough beet grown in the area by the farmers there.  Now another development is being attempted.  The beet company has taken large areas of bog, the aim being to develop these to grow enough beet.  Should that aim be realised, there will be a further benefit conferred on the area.</P>
    <P>There was a factory established in Castlebar by private enterprise which, I understand, is exporting more than half its production to European countries at the present time.  That factory would never have been established there if purely commercial considerations had applied. I think it was Emerson who said: &ldquo;If you invent something new, even a new mousetrap then, although you live in the depths of the woods, the world will beat a path to your door.&rdquo;  And who knows we may get, through the ability of some individual or the enterprise of some group, an industry which can develop, even in the unpromising conditions now existing in the congested areas, to be of major importance.  You do not know till you try and, while State enterprise may always be cautious&mdash;whenever a Bill for the promotion of State enterprise is brought to the Dáil there is always a demand on the part of Deputies for the production of the expert reports upon which the Government took its decisions&mdash;private enterprise will take a chance.  That is why I think we are far more likely to get development of industry generally in the West through private enterprise, assisted by the State, rather than by State corporations. The State would naturally be confined to industries of a kind that had not previously existed in the country while private enterprise, even under this Bill, can engage in any industry getting no more help through Foras Tionscal than it requires to offset competitive disadvantages attaching to location.  It would be wrong I agree, in the light of what Deputy Corish said, to give an industry in the <Col N="822" /> West such help that it would have a substantial competitive advantage over an industry in Wexford or any other east coast county.  The aim should be to level up.  Deputy Corish mentioned furniture factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It induces me to say that there are numerous industries throughout the country producing kitchen furniture and farm furniture and engaging in other enterprises of that kind, which I do not think should be assisted at all because they are functioning now in normal competitive conditions.  They have the advantage of a local market in which they have not to bear heavy transport costs to other areas.  It is only where there is a competitive disadvantage that help should be given and the help should be related to the competitive disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In a way I would be very anxious to get agreement from the Dáil on this section, but I would despair of that if we were to depart from the existing definition of the congested areas.  This definition is taken from the 1909 Land Act and to attempt to attach on to that other areas&mdash;I would have no hesitation in putting in West Cavan, North Longford and West Limerick, but if I put them in, many Deputies would say the next area is in need, if not quite the same need, of help.  I know there is one Deputy who wants to include an area in County Louth. But I do not think that that help should be given under this Bill which is for taking industry away from the East to the West.  It does not mean that no State help would be given to an industry anywhere else.  If it was given, it would be given under some other measure.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given an indication of what his intentions are towards the other amendment. If I had known them when moving this amendment, I would have been much more specific.  Let us get these two points clearly.  The Minister says that the main purpose of the Bill is to develop the congested areas.  He <Col N="823" /> is going to give a sort of prompting to the people of those areas for the purpose of this industrial development.  I think he is right in doing that but I want him to carry on the main purpose of the Bill so that the same thing would be done in those other areas which are only excluded from the congested areas for certain reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am personally prepared to give the Deputy this assurance: that I would regard the areas of West Cavan, North Longford and part of West Limerick as quite eligible for inclusion under the Bill.  If propositions came from those areas I would not hesitate to make an Order under this Bill to include them.  I think it is unwise for us to get away from a definition of the congested areas that is already there because we would get ourselves into a lot of difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>But it can be done by the Minister signing his name.  On the other hand, if it had to come through the House it would be a different thing.  The Minister has been correct when he said he considered getting Dáil sanction for the Order.  He is quite correct in the line he takes to do that without unduly holding up the development.  I think it would be bad if development were held up for the purpose of deciding at length what the <Col N="824" /> Dáil thought.  However, I do think it is a better principle but in my anxiety to have the work proceeded with I will not hold up the matter any longer.  I have drawn attention to the danger.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given an undertaking binding himself and his Government &mdash;and his predecessor has given it&mdash;to ensure that there will be no partisanship in it, that it will be done in the most objective manner and in the interests of the people.  I accept that and I, therefore, withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (a), line 24, before &ldquo;Leitrim&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Cavan&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The people of Cavan have been very dissatisfied because Cavan has not been included under this Bill which is designed to aid industrial development in undeveloped areas.  From a consideration of the facts and statistics which I propose to place before this House, I trust the Minister will accept this amendment.  I would like to ask the Minister what were the qualifications or the determinate factors which guided the Government in selecting counties or portions of counties.  Were these based on the number of home assistance recipients, on congestion, or were they based on the numbers of people who failed to register for Fianna Fáil in the last election?  I wonder did any major blunder occur in regard to Cavan's geographical position, or was there an assumption on the part of the designers of this Bill that we were not part of the Republic but were governed by Stormont?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here statistics of emigration figures which I will read out&mdash;emigration figures for the years 1936 and 1946. <Col N="826" /> These are as follows: Cavan, 8.2 per cent.; Sligo, 7.5 per cent.; Leitrim, 12.4 per cent.; Roscommon, 6.5 per cent.; Donegal, 4.2 per cent.; Galway, 1.8 per cent.; Mayo, 8.2 per cent.; Kerry, 4.2 per cent.  That is an illustration that, as regards emigration figures, we are second to Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I will now produce further statistics which will show we should not have been excluded from this industrial Bill. These figures relate to home assistance recipients, and surely people who are well off do not look for home assistance. I am giving the 1949 figures:&mdash; Cavan, 2.6 per cent.; Sligo, 1.24 per cent.; Leitrim, 1.51 per cent.; Roscommon, .1 per cent.; Donegal, 1.01 per cent.; Galway, .99 per cent.; Mayo, 1.3 per cent.; Kerry, 2.08 per cent. These figures clearly illustrate the fact that the number of home assistance recipients in Cavan is nearly twice what it is in other counties.  This clearly demonstrates the point that the Government should have included Cavan in this Undeveloped Areas Bill.</P>
    <P>I will mention a few counties which have farms under 15 acres:&mdash;Cavan, 34 per cent.; Leitrim, 27 per cent.; Galway, 26 per cent.  These figures clearly illustrate that the congestion in Cavan is much higher than in some of the counties that have been included under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask, if he accepted this amendment, what could be done in Cavan.  Many advances could be made there towards industrialisation. In Cavan, we have an abundant supply of raw material for ground limestone.  If we had the money and the machinery this material which has had to be imported from the Counties of Donegal, Dublin, Louth and Monaghan, could be developed in Cavan.  Not alone would it give employment, but it would bring our land back to a state of fertility and production.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, West Cavan is a barren, mountainy country, but if money were made available it could be utilised for the development of afforestation.  I think the Minister would be well advised to see that forestry inspectors are sent down <Col N="827" /> there.  They would undoubtedly come back and give him evidence that more employment would be provided if afforestation were introduced there. While afforestation would be on its way, it would give employment to our people who are leaving by the dozen every day.</P>
    <P>We have also in West Cavan a coal mine at Gubaveeny&mdash;a place where employment is needed.  Although this coal mine is in its crude state at the moment, the coal there will be found to be of very good quality.</P>
    <P>If money could be spent on industrial development in Cavan it would not only solve the problem of unemployment in that district but it would also, in no small way, give us the material which we have to obtain with great difficulty at the moment.</P>
    <P>Cavan and Donegal have grown flax very extensively.  I feel that if a linen factory were erected there it would give employment to our people, especially on the processing part which has to take place at the present time at the Belfast spinning mills.  I would strongly recommend to the Minister to use his influence in that direction.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the effort to help these undeveloped areas, I cannot see why Cavan is not included, and I sincerely hope that it will be included. Nobody can dispute the fact that we in Cavan are a people who are worthy of encouragement.  I cannot see why we should have been omitted, and I would recommend to the Minister when the Report Stage comes along that he will include Cavan under the scope of this Bill.  If the Minister will not accept this amendment, I would suggest to him that he should call this new Bill, which I am afraid has been nicknamed, a Gerrymandering Bill designed to recover lost seats.  We in Cavan cannot see why this Bill is applied to places such as Roscommon and why it cannot be applied to Cavan. I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position and to include Cavan as suggested in my amendment.</P>

      <P>I think there is no point in moving the amendments separately when the Minister has taken a certain view on them.  All that we can do is make our arguments on them now, instead of moving them separately.  Let me say in regard to the amendments which Deputy O'Reilly and I have put in, that we want to stress the main object of the Bill and to apply it to those areas so that we can give an incentive to the local people to put their best efforts into this project.  If these areas are included, an incentive is given to the local people and to private enterprise to come forward to give the assistance necessary to make the Bill a success. It is, I think, agreed that the Bill can best be made a success through local initiative and private enterprise.  By including at an early stage an area such as Longford, you make sure of getting the support of the people of <Col N="829" /> that area for the project which the Bill envisages.  I remember quite distinctly when I was five or seven years old the evidence that was tendered by certain people to the commission set up to establish the congested areas and the criticism which was made at the time of members of Parliament for County Longford because of their failure to support the local people, in North Longford in particular, who came up to Dublin to give evidence on the proposal to include North Longford as part of the congested areas.  The average valuation in North Longford&mdash;that is in the areas which I have set out in amendment No. 7&mdash;is under £2 and the number of people resident in the area is more than the number resident in even the most congested areas in either Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Donegal or any other place I know.  The people are very hard working and industrious and if they get the opportunity or the incentive, there is no doubt they will give the Minister the co-operation that may be needed.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil came into office one of the first things they did was to declare these electoral divisions&mdash; I do not know the exact wording of the declaration&mdash;the equivalent of a congested area so that the benefits accruing to congested areas might also be applied to that area.  As I stated on Second Reading, good work was done under that Order but what I objected to then was that the Minister could by a stroke of the pen put in North Longford and by another stroke of the pen take it out.</P>

      <P>That is what has happened in the past.  As the Minister knows, once there is a precedent established in a Department it is like the laws of the Medes and Persians ; it cannot be changed.  The precedent is nearly equal to a statute.  I am therefore moving that the Minister should accept as congested areas the areas mentioned in amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5.  Failing that I think that he should accept amendment No. 7.  In doing that, he would be doing only what this Government did <Col N="830" /> under a previous administration.  I am merely asking that he should now do by statute what was previously done by Order.  If amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 were accepted perhaps amendment No. 7 would not be really essential but if the three first amendments are not accepted I would ask the Minister at least to accept amendment No. 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the proposal that Cavan should be included in what are known as the undeveloped areas.  I think the Minister has already admitted that West Cavan should be brought within the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It was stated that this particular area of West Cavan was not known as a congested district.  My information is that it was and is still, because at the moment there are two Departments' overseers employed in that area for the purpose of distributing seed oats and potatoes at a cheap rate to poor farmers.  That in itself shows that it is a congested area.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Reilly has referred to coal mines in West Cavan.  I was on a deputation some time ago to the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to a coal mine which was being opened down there by a farmer. That farmer spent over £4,000 to make a road into this mine.  He was at the end of his resources when he had spent this money and had no more funds at his disposal and the result was that he had to give up the project.  That is one of the reasons, as well as others, which convince me that this area of West Cavan should be included in this Bill.  I should like all Cavan to be included, but the eastern part of Cavan could not be classed in the same way as the western part.  I hear a lot of talk about &ldquo;west of the Shannon&rdquo;. I should like to remind Deputies that the Shannon rises in Cavan and that part of it is west of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a question yesterday in connection with the quantity of land offered to the Department of Forestry for afforestation purposes and the answer that I got was about 5,000 acres.  Most of the land offered is in West Cavan.  That is proof to me that the people of this area want assistance <Col N="831" /> in some way or other. I also put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to mineral deposits in West Cavan and the Minister stated that there were mineral deposits there. The fact that the Minister admitted that should be a reason why Cavan, especially West Cavan, should be included in the Bill.  I do not like to say hard things about anybody, but I cannot understand why the Minister for Local Government who sits in the Cabinet had not this part of Cavan, or all Cavan, included in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to help out in this respect and see that we will get every help in regard to new industries there.  For that reason, I support this amendment and I ask the House and the Government to accept it.  If it is not accepted, I am afraid we shall have to have a division on it and I shall have to look on it in a way which I do not like and in which other Deputies look on it&mdash; that this Bill was conceived and designed more for political or Party purposes than from a national point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quite follow how it could be argued that it is for a Party purpose.  Let me start off by removing any false impression which might be created by the remarks of Deputy O'Reilly.  Cavan is not excluded from the Bill, nor is any other county for that matter.  As it stands, the Bill must apply to certain named counties and areas and it may apply to others.  I have argued against departing from the definition of the congested areas set out in the Bill, because I think it is safe to stick to that in view of its long association in the public mind with a certain part of the country and the fact that it is something we did not think of ourselves because it was taken from existing Acts unchanged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I said that personally I would not have the slightest hesitation, if a proposal for a new industry came to me from West Cavan, North Longford or certain other areas, in making the necessary Order under <Col N="832" /> this Bill which would enable An Foras Tionscail to consider whether any assistance was required.  Deputy O'Reilly, Deputy Tully and other Deputies, if they had moved amendments, would find themselves in this position, that they would hesitate to exclude any part of Cavan.  I am sure that if they attempted to define certain townlands in Cavan for the purpose of including them in the Bill and left other townlands out, they would have some difficulty in explaining to residents in an adjacent townland why they were not included.</P>
      <P>Is it not true that Cavan as a whole, without any assistance under this Bill or any corresponding legislation, has already had a significant development of industries?  I may say with good reason that industrial development in Cavan, whether this Bill is passed or not, has not stopped. But, if we include the whole of Cavan, how can we argue that we should not include Monaghan?  Are not the circumstances there the same as in Cavan?  If you do not exclude Monaghan, how can you exclude Cooley in North Louth?  Once you start departing from the clear definition of congested areas so as to include other areas, you will be driven back in such a way that the whole country will be in the Bill and the purpose of the Bill will be lost.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to attract industrial development over towards the West.  I urge, therefore, that these amendments be not pressed.  I do not think that any Deputy need have any apprehension that any Minister for Industry and Commerce would not deal with the areas of West Cavan which have been mentioned, North Longford and other areas contiguous to the congested areas as being similar in character and, consequently, entitled to the help of this Bill if, in an individual case, An Foras Tionscal decided that help was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to mineral development.  I already expressed the view that, generally speaking, mineral development would not qualify, in my opinion, for help under this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to give certain financial help to projects which are <Col N="833" /> developed in the western area but which, without that help, would have been located in the East.  Mineral development must normally take place where the minerals are and, consequently, there can be no question of that project transferring somewhere else.  That does not mean that help will not be available for mineral development.  It has been given in the past.  There is a proposition before the Department in relation to the coal deposits in Cavan to which Deputies referred.  That application can be considered without any reference to this Bill and would normally be considered without reference to it.  In fact, I think it is necessary to emphasise what I have said already, that help in the special circumstances contemplated when this Bill was framed to offset competitive disadvantage will be given on the decision of An Foras Tionscal, but other forms of help can and will be given, as in the past, to sound industrial propositions anywhere.</P>
    <P>In my view, most of the worthwhile mineral deposits in the country can or will only be developed with Government help in some form, at least Government help to offset the heavy initial expenditure which sometimes has to be incurred before actual profit-earning can begin.  There was also no help for the construction of roads or the removal of overburden or opening up of mineral deposits.  Mineral development has been in progress now for a long number of years and it does not depend on this Bill whether or not that will continue.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Dáil to leave the Bill as it stands.  I think we are safe so long as we stand over the present definition of the congested areas because no Minister can stand up to a refusal to extend the Bill to an adjacent area of similar character if there is a sound proposition put up to him that should be submitted for consideration by Foras Tionscal.  But even if the Minister makes an Order, it does not mean that help will be given.  The decision as to what help or how much will be given will be taken by the organisation on its own initiative and will not be subject to any sort of Government interference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be quite as specific as that.  If there was any competitive disadvantage in working minerals I imagine that as far as mineral development is concerned any board functioning under this Bill would help.  The fact that minerals happened to be located in one county rather than another is relatively unimportant because one can easily contemplate circumstances under which the processing of minerals in a particular place instead of somewhere else, or some other development of that kind, might be worth encouraging by giving financial assistance.  For example, in one of the western counties at the moment there is a mine producing minerals which are exported in the raw state.  I would be very keen personally to encourage any progress towards the processing of these minerals so that to a greater extent than at present the production of usable materials would be done here.</P>

      <P>It is an indication to the Minister in charge of the Bill that this particular section will be opposed.  I think it is proper that it should be opposed and that is why I put it down.  In fact, I want to oppose this section very strongly.  I think it a very serious matter and one which must give rise to a considerable amount of alarm as to what exactly is going to happen if it is passed.  I gather that there are really three Acts dealing with pharmaceutical chemists, druggists and the people covered by this Bill.  The original Act was the Act of 1791 which was passed by the old Irish Parliament, then the Act of 1875, which is the principal Act, and the amending Act of 1890.  Under the Act of 1890, there was a provision, very clearly set out in the Statute Book, that a person who had completed a period of four years' apprenticeship, satisfied the examiners by passing an examination, made an application to the register for enrolment, paid a fee of two guineas and made certain statutory declarations, would be entitled to be registered, and that the council could not refuse to register him.  I think that was a very important protection for the student. I am referring to Section 8 of the 1890 Act.  Under Section 10 of the same Act, so long as he completed his apprenticeship, applied for registration and passed an examination, he was registered, and the society could not prevent him being registered.  What was done in the Bill under discussion at present?  Sections 8 and 10 were abolished and nothing was put in their place.</P>
      <P>My concern for this started when I heard Deputy Brady saying the other evening here that the council intended to alter the provision whereby, after spending four years' apprenticeship and passing an examination, a person would be a qualified chemist.  Deputy Brady said that the council are to introduce a new provision whereby a person has to give three years' apprenticeship and then to spend one year in some type of school or college where he would have to study, hear lectures and note them down.  During that period, no provision is made by anybody for his maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look at it from the point of view of <Col N="841" /> the student from a rural area who wants to serve his apprenticeship to become qualified and who is faced, or his parents are faced, with the additional expenditure, or they may be.  If we take out these two sections and deprive the students of their rights, I do not see what is to prevent the council saying that he will have to do two years or maybe three or four years in a school.  I would like to hear the Minister saying what protection there is under the law as it stands if we eliminate these two sections which give such important rights to those apprentices.</P>
    <P>I can understand the council deciding to make some change, but if they made the change then I think they should have written that change into the Act so that each and every one of us would know where we stood.  We would know what we were inserting for the important provisions that we were taking out.  For these reasons, which I am putting in very brief form at the moment, I oppose very strenuously the removal of those two very important sections of the Act of 1890.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy is arguing exactly on those sections as they stand in the principal Act.  The kernel of the whole Bill is this: it is to discontinue the class of druggists.  Section 8 of the 1890 Act laid down the condition under which a druggist could qualify in regard to apprenticeship.  He does his four years and then passes an examination and becomes a registered druggist.  That is the law as it stands under Section 8 of the 1890 Act.  What we are trying to do now is to say that will only apply to those who have started their apprenticeship, and for the future no person can start as an apprentice to a registered druggist.  The object of this Bill is, in time, to do away with druggists and to have all those who are dealing with medicines and poisons in the pharmaceutical class.  If we are to proceed with this Bill that would be absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of the principal Act gives a person an alternative way of becoming a pharmaceutical chemist, if he does four years as an apprentice to a druggist and then does two years with <Col N="842" /> a pharmaceutical chemist, after which he can take an examination.  The effect of this section is to see that no person can be taken as an apprentice in future by a druggist.  A person who wants to go into the business as a pharmaceutical chemist in future will have to enter as assistant to a pharmaceutical chemist, not a druggist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And that thereafter any young person who can conform to those conditions and pass the examination is entitled to require the Pharmaceutical Chemists' Organisation to register him as a pharmaceutical chemist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the deletion of the two sections of the old Act referred to remove that obligation on the Pharmaceutical Chemists' Organisation to register the young person who has complied with the approved, requirements? Does it create a new situation in which discretion remains with the Pharmaceutical Chemists' Organisation to register him or not when he has passed?  Is there any ground for the apprehension that if these two old sections are repealed a situation may arise in which the Pharmaceutical Chemists' Organisation might say here after: &ldquo;There are enough pharmaceutical chemists to do all the business that requires to be done and we do not propose to admit any pharmaceutical chemist for a period of five years&rdquo;? That is what I would apprehend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to accept the proposition that the characteristics of druggists and pharmaceutical chemists should be merged now in one approved course of education and examination. But I would be very reluctant indeed to agree that we should confer upon the Pharmaceutical Chemists' Organisation the right in their own discretion <Col N="843" /> to register or not to register a young person who had conformed to the standard requirements as approved by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither this section nor the Bill makes any difference whatever in the powers of the Pharmaceutical Society with regard to the registration of apprentices or qualifying apprentices as pharmaceutical chemists.  The effect of this section is to discontinue the alternative way in which a person could become a pharmaceutical chemist.  Up to this he could start with a druggist and change over to a pharmaceutical chemist and do his apprenticeship in that way. Under Section 10 he cannot do that in future.  Anybody who is there at present can pursue that course.  The removal of Section 8 means that no apprentices can do that in future.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister reassure us that in accepting that change hereafter he will be obliged to review regulations made by the Pharmaceutical Society as to education and examination and that once they are approved any citizen who goes through the course and meets the academic requirements of the examination approved by the Minister for the time being, will have a right to demand registration as a pharmaceutical chemist from the Pharmaceutical Society?</P>

      <P>I should like to clear up a few points in connection with Deputy Dillon's remarks.  All regulations made by the Pharmaceutical Society must be approved by the Minister. That was the position and that position remains.  As regards this section which Deputy Cowan is worrying about, the position has not altered at all except that under this Bill, as we said last week, apprentices coming into the business will be registered as pharmaceutical apprentices.  After the appointed day there will be no more registered apprentices to qualify for the druggists' examination, but <Col N="844" /> apprentices who are serving their time at the present time before the appointed day, can go for qualifications as registered druggists.  The Pharmaceutical Society must, and will, hold an examination for these people but after the appointed day, the difference is that there will be apprentices for the qualification of pharmaceutical chemist only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been said removes a considerable amount of the worry I had.  As I said, that worry was caused by the reference made by Deputy Brady to the fact that there was to be an alteration in the terms of study and that, instead of a period of four years of apprenticeship, there is going to be a final year of study in some school or college.  That was the part that was worrying me.  I gather that has not yet been approved by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps no harm has been done in drawing attention to the fact at this stage so that the Minister will have those matters in mind, if such a new scheme is submitted to him.  If it has been agreed between the two parties concerned with this Bill that the elimination or removal of these two particular sections is not going to affect study in future, then I am perfectly satisfied. I am certainly satisfied with the assurance the Minister has already given and with having had an opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention to the objection, that there may be an alteration in the educational programme of the Pharmaceutical Society which might involve parents in substantial additional expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May we assume that the Minister's view, broadly, is that reasonable standards of education and examination shall be maintained and that anybody satisfying them will have the right to be registered as a pharmaceutical chemist?  I am primarily concerned to ensure that the objectionable principle of an artificial delimitation of the number of persons entering the pharmaceutical profession will not be brought in by any side-wind, <Col N="845" /> or by a standard of examination which is unattainable by the average student or by setting some other test as an indispensable prerequisite to registration, so as effectively to prevent new entrants being admitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that the first part of Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is already in the Bill and the second part merely arises for discussion now.  I am, however, asking for a shorter period than is mentioned in the Deputy's amendment as necessary for a resolution of annulment, because there would be a number of bodies waiting for the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="846" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The shorter period makes the matter more businesslike, I think.  My main purpose in putting down the amendment giving a power of annulment arose out of the fact that this Bill proposes to do a thing that will create a considerable number of difficulties that have not yet all been explored or assessed.  I pointed out on Second Reading what some of these difficulties are.  We are now imposing on young people who have received their university qualifications as doctors the obligation of spending another year at a mixture of work and study in a hospital and we are preventing them practising in the ordinary way until they have gone through that year.  Sufficient facilities for carrying on that work and doing that study do not exist in the voluntary hospitals and in the hospitals that have been recognised as teaching hospitals up to the present, and the question arises where accommodation is going to be found for giving these particular classes the required instruction or experience.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated on Second Reading that, I think, the Irish Medical Registration Board had gone into some examination of that situation and had reviewed the facts.  I asked the Minister whether he would be able, in dealing with the Committee Stage, to give us any information arising out of that examination.  If it is clear that the teaching hospitals or hospitals that have been regarded as teaching hospitals up to the present cannot take in, in the form in which they are asked to take in, these interns, it would be necessary to extend the list of the approved institutions for the purposes of this Bill and to take in a number of other voluntary hospitals and hospitals run by local authorities. I ask the Minister, can he give us any information as to what is likely to happen in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, if provisionally qualified doctors are to be required to spend a year without earning any normal income, I ask what arrangements are to be made to maintain these provisionally recognised doctors in the institutions in which they are to serve <Col N="847" /> and what kind of payment is going to be made to them to enable them to maintain themselves, apart altogether from having a roof over them, and having food and other necessaries provided in these institutions.  It is quite clear that somebody will have to provide the cost, both of their maintenance and the cost of whatever payment is to be made for the services they will render.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, is quite clear as to what is involved in that way.  As far as the local authorities are concerned, the obligation would no doubt fall on them to provide that. As far as the voluntary hospitals are concerned, it is well known that there are substantial deficits attached to the carrying on of those hospitals.  I wanted to know how these deficits will be made up.  I felt it was necessary to put in an amendment such as the Minister has now put in for the purpose of giving the House an opportunity of raising these questions again if, by the time the appointed day comes round, matters have not been settled in as satisfactory a way as I think the Dáil requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a purely procedural point, is there any precedent for the 12 days in the amendment?  The 21 days is a well-recognised precedent for the purpose of retaining the ultimate authority of the Dáil to annul an Order.  I view with some alarm the introduction of 12 days if this is the first place where the period for annulment has been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister concede the maintenance of the 21 days? I do not suppose an Order is annulled once in ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble I had was that the other House does not meet as frequently as we do and 21 days might take us over a long period.  I feel that, as a rule, if a person is going to object to something he will probably do it fairly quickly, that he will do it within the 12 sitting days, which, of course, is what this is.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be another complication which would perhaps make this acceptable.  If the 21 days were pressed, that might raise another question.  The powers of the Seanad are rather curtailed from what they were when the draftsmen in the early days drafted this regulation about the 21 days.  In the amendment, you are giving power definitely to the Seanad to annul an Order bringing the Statute into operation.  The Seanad at present has no power which would enable it to annul a Statute.  It has only a delaying power.  There might be too many questions to be solved in regard to the 21 days in respect of the Seanad.  Power is being given to the Seanad under the Minister's amendment definitely to annul an Order so as to prevent the Act coming into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the other point raised by Deputy Mulcahy, unfortunately I have not got a clear-cut statement to make with regard to the interns and their salaries, treatment, etc.  The Medical Registration Council have estimated that there will not be more than 300 qualified in one year.  They do that on their experience over many years.  Taking the number of students and the qualifications over three or four years, according to their calculation, the number will not exceed 300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of them may go to England for internship, but the council have based their calculation on the <Col N="849" /> assumption that they will not go.  Even on that assumption, they think they can fit them all in.  Their present intention is to place about 220 in the voluntary hospitals and about 80 in the local authority hospitals.  They think that there should be more of these interns in the voluntary hospitals on the per bed basis than in the local authority hospitals.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the question of remuneration and cost of maintenance, they have to take into account what the hospitals are paying at the moment.  The local authority hospitals are paying their house surgeons and house physicians £150 a year, I think&mdash;I am not sure about that&mdash;and are also maintaining them.  It would not be unfair to the hospitals to say that they must pay £120.  There must be some allowance made for what they are paying already.  The same would apply to the voluntary hospitals.  There are a number of rather difficult and complicated calculations to be made, but I am quite sure the Medical Registration Council will have got over these at a very early date, and will then be in a position to tell the hospitals what they expect from them.  Before we mention the appointed day, I think that should be done.</P>

      <P>On the section, it would be worth while harping back to the point raised by Deputy Dillon as regards the 12 days as against 21 days.  The reason for asking for amendment No. 1 which the Minister has put in is that we may have power to intervene in the matter and have a chance of getting information.  Under Section 3, power is provided for setting up approved hospitals and institutions in which the internship will be worked out.  Does the Minister contemplate that such certificates as are to be issued will be ready for issue immediately after he makes the Order with regard to the appointed day so that the information with regard to the type of hospitals approved will be available to us to enable us to make up our minds whether a motion is necessary to consent to the appointed day Order or not?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (6), page 5, and substitute the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) The council may, if it thinks fit, in lieu of or in addition to, including the separate part of the register referred to in sub-section (5) of this section in the annual publication of the Medical Register of Ireland, cause a list of persons provisionally registered to be prepared at least twice in each year.</P>
      <P>(7) A list under sub-section (6) of this section shall be prepared in the prescribed form and shall be compiled by reference to a date directed by the council and specified in the list and the council shall cause copies of the list to be available for purchase by any person on payment of the prescribed fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(8) A copy purporting to be a copy referred to in sub-section (7) of this <Col N="852" /> section which is for the time being the latest such copy shall be evidence in any court until the contrary is proved that every person whose name is entered therein is provisionally registered in accordance with this Act and that any person whose name is not entered therein is not so registered.</P>
    <P>(9) A certificate purporting to be signed by the registrar and to certify that on a specified day or days or during the whole of a specified period a particular person was duly provisionally registered or that on a specified day or days or during the whole of a specified period a particular person was not provisionally registered or that on a specified day the name of a particular person was erased from the separate part of the register referred to in sub-section (5) of this section shall, without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate or that he was the registrar and notwithstanding any discrepancy between the certificate and any list under sub-section (6) of this section or copy thereof, be conclusive evidence of the matters certified by the certificate.</P>
    <P>The Medical Registration Council came to me and told me that on consideration they thought that the printing of a special part of the register would be a very onerous job because examinations are held in the various colleges twice a year and it would mean printing the list many times in the year.  They thought it would be sufficient to have what is provided in this amendment; that is, that a list of persons would be provisionally registered.</P>
    <P>In that way a typed list would be sufficient for the purpose.  It would, of course, be open to inspection and it would be supplied to anybody who had a right to see it, such as universities, hospitals or anybody else who might have reason for examining the list. Extracts would also be sent from the list in the same way as from the register on payment of the usual small fee.  I must say I agree it would be a very onerous job to have the list printed several times in the year.  I think this is quite sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises some difficulty because obviously internships will have to be arranged for a certain date, say, 1st January and 1st July each year. As Deputies are aware, the final examinations are usually held in June and December.  I think, therefore, internships would start in the following month.  That is a matter, however, for the council.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose it is open to any layman to argue the necessity for this continued extension of the academic course to which a student is committed.  It is worth remembering, however, that the doctors who attended us when we were children graduated in three years and they were extremely good physicians.  I am not suggesting that because that was so it is necessarily enough to qualify a doctor now; but I do suggest that some advertence should be had to a tendency, which is I think growing amongst technically qualified persons, to build up a greater and greater complexity of preliminary study before a man can embark on the practice of a profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The three years' course was extended to four.  Then it was extended to five.  Then it was extended to six-no, there was a pre-medical year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the sixth year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a pre-medical year stipulated for.  Now there is a post-medical year stipulated for.  That makes it seven.  I do not think I am wrong in saying that many reputable physicians and surgeons would be prepared to maintain that, if the existing curriculum were carefully scanned, while many of the additions would certainly be approved, good grounds <Col N="855" /> could be brought forward for eliminating certain of the somewhat archaic requirements which have been left in the curriculum while necessary additions were being made.  Ordinary people in a society like ours ought to have as ready access as possible to any professional vocation that they feel called upon to assume.</P>
      <P>Would it be improper for Oireachtas Eireann, in enacting this measure at the instance of the medical profession, to suggest to the profession that, while the Oireachtas is prepared to accept their professional view as to the necessity of this intern work, they think that, in the light of the addition of the pre-medical year, the profession should instruct whatever body is charged with the consideration of such matters to discuss with the medical faculty of the universities the curriculum with a view to seeing whether, by the elimination of certain branches of study which might have become a supererogation over the last 50 years, they could not avoid increasing the student's period of apprenticeship from seven years as now contemplated to six years as a maximum, including the pre-medical year and the intern year envisaged? Would the Minister consider that?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal of foundation for the irritation which has been expressed by Deputy Maguire and Deputy Dillon and for what the Minister says.  Is it not a fact, however, that the whole of this situation is involved in this, that we are maintaining reciprocity with the medical organisation in Great Britain, and that the reason why we have so <Col N="856" /> strongly to maintain that is that 70 per cent. of our finished products as doctors go to Great Britain or go abroad?  Therefore, there is very little chance of protecting them except in this particular kind of way.  That is what is involved, and not the Ministry here discussing matters with the medical fraternity here, but rather the medical fraternity and the Ministry trying to get a different kind of approach, if a different type of approach is wanted by the medical authorities in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical faculty in Britain stipulate for certain things to get reciprocity, but not for seven years. If we get the programme done in six years and satisfy them that it was done in six, that would not interfere with reciprocity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, I think the Minister would find a fairly considerable volume of authoritative medical opinion here in favour of the idea that the course here could very definitely be shortened, and that the year which is being added on in this particular way could be subtracted in other ways.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 5, line 51, to delete &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is being moved because I thought, after examining the Bill when it passed through the <Col N="857" /> Second Stage, that there was no necessity for the council to have the approval of the Minister for the persons appointed as visitors to hospitals and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to say that the Oireachtas would expect a Minister, having the duty of approval, automatically to give it unless in very exceptional circumstances. But you know these exceptional circumstances sometimes arise. You may get a most admirable person appointed a visitor.  He is a normal, genial and rational person until he assumes the role of visitor, whereupon he becomes an extremely difficult person.  I have had long and bitter experience of most respectable gentlemen functioning as visitors under an ancient statute in the case of various bodies.  They were as decent a body of men as you could meet in a day's march, but once the mantle of visitor was thrown around them and they marched into institutions, pandemonium broke out, and then it became a very great difficulty to know how you could avoid quite unnecessary upsets of that kind.</P>
      <P>I, certainly, am not in favour of extending bureaucratic control, but sometimes I think it is a good thing to be able to say, without in the least casting any reflection on any particular person, that you would prefer if the name of some other person were submitted for the role of visitor.  You can get a terrible lot of trouble if some well-intentioned man comes in as visitor.  He may appear to be in every sense admirably suited for the position of visitor, but it turns out that he is not just suited for that purpose, and so he may cause a lot of unnecessary irritation.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Dillon, in view of the fact that he sat in this House when we were dealing with the Health Bill of 1945 and, later, with the Health Bill of 1947. I think the Minister should be commended for taking his finger out of a responsibility that can very well be left to the Irish Medical Registration Council.  The visiting of institutions approved by the Medical Registration Council as institutions in which the intern work can be properly carried out can, I think, be very well left to the council whose whole responsibility this scheme is.  I think that approval by the Minister would be just inviting ministerial interference in an arena where such interference has created an awful lot of upsets in the past.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to sub-section (2) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d)  The electoral division of Carlingford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment because of the fact that Carlingford embraces, in addition to Carlingford itself, the area known as Omeath.  As far as my memory goes, Omeath was looked upon 40 or 50 years ago as a Gaeltacht area.  In fact, there was a Gaelic college there one time.  It is a district which is very much akin to the districts on the western seaboard; it is mountainous and has very little good land, and the people there have to earn their living mostly by migrating during the summer months to places like the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. I feel that, in all justice, this area has the same claim to be included in this <Col N="863" /> Bill as have the areas which have, in fact, been included.</P>
    <P>Another reason which prompted me to put down this amendment was that, at the moment, that area is more or less threatened with further unemployment due to the closing down of the Greenore line which has been a great boon to that area so far as the tourist trade is concerned.  I can quite understand the Minister's difficulty in regard to the question of keeping that line open, but I want to remind him that it will have a detrimental effect on employment there.</P>
    <P>So far as the development of particular areas in the future is concerned, I think that the people of Carlingford can put forward as good a claim as the areas which come under the scope of the Bill under discussion.  The areas of Carlingford and Omeath are inhabited in the main by a very industrious type of people.  I think I am correct in saying that the population per square mile there is greater than in any other area of the Twenty-Six Counties.  In fact.  I think it is the most thickly populated area in the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the industry and thrift of the inhabitants of the district.  I would appeal to the Minister, if at all possible, to place this area on the same plane as the other areas mentioned in this Bill, namely Leitrim, Donegal, Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Kerry. Anybody visiting this area will see that it is very much akin to the areas to which I have referred, being a mountainous district and noted for its scenery.  In fact, travelling through it, if one were not familiar with the district, it would appear as if one were travelling through the districts mentioned in the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to include this area for the reasons I have already mentioned; there is not any industry there, and there is a large incidence of migration each year.  The young men and the young women go every summer to the Isle of Man and to other centres of tourism across Channel in order to eke out a livelihood for themselves and for their families.  They return to their homes in wintertime and have to <Col N="864" /> depend absolutely on what they have earned during the summer and on sheep rearing, etc.  There is no such thing as anything approaching continued employment in that area which is a very thickly populated one.  So I would make a final appeal to the Minister to bring it under the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are special problems in the Cooley area.  I think the Deputy is aware that I have pledged myself to give all the assistance in my power to anybody undertaking industrial development there.  The Deputy is aware, no doubt, that that pledge is in process of being redeemed.  The Bill under discussion is primarily designed to give special assistance to industrial undertakings in the western portions of the country&mdash; assistance designed to offset the competitive disadvantage of western location. We would be made to look a bit foolish if we included, by special mention, an east coast town.  In case the Deputy has in mind that the absence of any reference to Carlingford in the Bill would prevent assistance being given to that area as far as industrial development is concerned, I would like to correct him.  So far as I am concerned, I will honour the undertaking I gave, and give whatever help is required to a sound industrial project in that area.  I would be glad if the Deputy did not press his amendment here, because I do not think it would make any practical difference whether the area was mentioned or not.  It seems to me that Foras Tionscal which is set up for a specific purpose, would be less sympathetic towards helping an industrial project in that area than would the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>The decision as to what amount of help would be given would be made by the board set up under the Bill.  I think myself that <Col N="865" /> Foras Tionscal would be less interested in an approach coming from an east coast town, having regard to their special function, than in projects coming from the areas mentioned in the Bill.  I feel that the special circumstances of the Cooley area must be taken into account as a special problem rather than a portion of the problem with which this Bill is meant to deal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might make some remarks with reference to the effect of the section.  The House will remember that concluding the Second Reading debate, I had only five minutes to speak and I did not deal with some of the points of detail that were raised in the debate.  Some of these points of detail have been cleared up since but there were a couple of matters mentioned to-day to which I think it would be well to make reference now, so as to put the position clear. Under this section of the Bill, the board can provide premises or give other help to persons proposing to embark on industrial projects.  I am anxious that there should be no misunderstanding as to how that section <Col N="866" /> will be worked.  First of all there must be a project.  I mean that some group of people who have got some financial resources and the technical competence to run the particular industry they have in mind, must put up a proposition to establish a factory for the purpose of engaging in that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>They must take the initiative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>And they must have the technical competence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be competent to manage the industry.  The point I was trying to stress in speaking on Second Reading is that the board will decide upon what help is required by any particular project and will give that help, but they will have nothing more to do with the project, once it is started.  From that on, the project will be on its own.  It will succeed or fail according as its direction or management is competent.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the provision of technical help or advice to industrialists. That will be available in some measure through the Department of Industry and Commerce, not through the board.  In other words, the Department of Industry and Commerce is not just bowing itself out of the picture of industrial development in the West and the services and help which it can give to persons engaging in any new industry in any part of the country will be equally available to persons engaging in industry in undeveloped areas.  That help will be a continuing help; it will not be merely advice or help given at the initiation stage but will be available at all times to persons engaged in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that Foras Tionscal will not have this power of initiation was mentioned here during the Second Reading. That does not mean that the Government, or some Department of the Government, may not initiate projects in these areas but if they do, it will be under the authority of different legislation, existing or yet to be enacted, and any such project, to the extent that it requires help out of public funds, <Col N="867" /> will get it under some other authority. That help will not come out of the funds provided under this Bill.  The funds provided under this Bill will be administered by Foras Tionscal for the sole purpose of providing help for industrial projects in their initial stages.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the industrial survey undertaken by American experts under an E.C.A. technical assistance project.  I have not got the report of that survey yet.  In any case, the second stage has yet to begin.  The intention was that the experts who came here should take a look at the general position and then recommend a more detailed examination of certain possibilities for which a second team of experts would be required.</P>
    <P>Any information forthcoming as a result of these surveys, or other technical assistance projects, will be available to anybody interested in the particular matters to which the reports refer.  If, arising out of those reports, some people get the idea of developing a new industry in any of the undeveloped areas, they will come along, take it to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and bring it to the stage where they can put up a definite proposition to Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already to-day, and it is no harm to repeat it, that I contemplate the Bill functioning in this way: People who come into the Department of Industry and Commerce with an idea for a new industry or with the intention of engaging in some industry will be told there whatever they want to know concerning the market possibilities or given the help which the Government would ordinarily give to people undertaking such developments. They will also be told that over and above the help and advice they may ordinarily get, if they locate that enterprise in one of the undeveloped areas, then they can get this further assistance, and it will be mainly as a result of these contacts and discussions that projects that might otherwise have developed in an eastern area, or which might not be developed at all because of financial problems, will nevertheless proceed in western areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> It is true, as Deputies know, that most people who come at present to the Department of Industry and Commerce with an idea for a new industry or to discuss some industrial plan of theirs, generally come with a location in mind.  They have got some particular reason for choosing the location, or have already contacted people in the area who are going to participate in the financing of the enterprise or to help it.  Occasionally, some people come who have no fixed ideas as to where the proposed enterprise will be located.  In such circumstances, it would be the aim of the officers of the Department assisting these projects to put the promoters in touch with local development committees or organisations which could give them information as to the facilities available in particular towns or as to financial participation in the development of the industry that might be forthcoming in particular areas.</P>
    <P>As a rule, these local development committees are merely concerned to get a factory.  They do not mind very much what sort of factory or they have not a very clear idea of the sort of factory that might be practicable.  It will be appreciated that the desire to get a factory, or willingness to raise the money locally, does not necessarily get one established, until the desire and financial resources are linked together by somebody who has the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and the capacity to supervise its management.  It is not intended that Foras Tionscal should participate in the financing of any industrial enterprise on a shareholding basis.  Aid will be given in one or other of the forms set out in the Bill&mdash;the erection of a factory, the giving of grants towards the building of a factory or towards its equipment, grants towards the training of workers, or things of that kind.</P>
    <P>When it has made its decision and furnished that help, that is the end of any contact between that particular industrial project and An Foras Tionscal. If the project runs into difficulties afterwards, it is to the Department of Industry and Commerce those concerned will have to come, not to An Foras Tionscal.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of providing or facilitating the provision of sites or premises for the establishment, development or maintenance in an undeveloped area of an industrial undertaking ....</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; is also mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b).  Does that not seem to suggest that the board can come to the rescue of an industry afterwards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in that wording because I thought it covered the point of helping existing industries. But that was not the intention of the draftsman and that is why we put in another amendment to achieve that result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For what purpose?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the purpose of providing sites or premises, not for any other purpose.  On the whole, I think, the wording will not cause difficulty. Some Deputies have put down parliamentary questions asking whether under this Bill a grant can be given for a harbour scheme in Youghal, a viaduct to Valentia Island or some other transport or public work of that kind.  In theory it could, but only if that work is necessary for the development of some industry.  In other words, the fact that a public road a bridge or harbour work was desirable for the general development of an area would not in itself qualify it for a grant.  It <Col N="870" /> must be a road, bridge, harbour work or railway siding required for the development of a particular industry in the locality.  If, say, in the case of Youghal a case can be made for Government assistance for the development of the harbour, that can be given under another Government scheme, but it cannot be given under this Bill. It can only be given under this Bill if it can be shown that the establishment or development of a particular industry in that centre necessitates the construction of the proposed work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If a firm offers to establish a new industry in one of these areas and asks for a substantial subsidy from the Government, will the Minister take steps to protect a similar industry in an adjoining area which is getting no subsidy?  In other words, will the Minister allow one industry to crush out the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the job of An Foras Tionscal.  If an industry is established in a county in the West and is operating there profitably and successfully, then the obvious conclusion is that that industry is at no competitive disadvantage because of its location and, therefore, a similar concern in the same locality would not be entitled to any help.  It could be effectively established by a private group without any special Government help such as is contemplated in this Bill. The purpose of An Foras Tionscal will be to decide if there is any reason why a concern should not be able to establish itself without any help and be able to meet competition from a similar concern somewhere else.  If it decides that, the board will not give any help.  It is only where it comes to the conclusion that the western location is a competitive disadvantage which should be offset that a contribution will be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>In your opening remarks the other day you said that you would protect any industry in these undeveloped areas from any foreigner coming in and competing, but you said that you would not prevent any internal competition in the country.  Supposing you establish an industry in one of these undeveloped areas and somebody <Col N="871" /> in Dublin, who has an existing factory, thinks he can produce something similar to what is produced in the undeveloped area, are you prepared to prevent him from duplicating the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the help will be to give a factory in the West an opportunity of meeting competition from Dublin, but, equally, the board must consider the measure of help necessary to get that result.  If it is decided that no help will put that factory on level terms, they will decide that it is an unsuitable industry for the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that when it is already established in the West somebody in Dublin or Cork may find that he can develop such an industry in Cork or Dublin.  From your statement, it would appear that you are not going to prevent that person from competing with that factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there will be no restriction on internal competition.  It is true that that was our original idea for getting industrial development in the West, to give a reserved commodity licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.  It was intended that when a new industry was established in the West, a similar industry could not be established elsewhere.  It was found, however, that that was open to the objection that you would be giving a virtual monopoly to that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a firm established in the West and somebody in Cork or Dublin thinks he can add that line of business to his existing industry, it is not fair to expect the industry in the West to carry on successfully against such competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are given help under this Bill, they will be started with a very considerable reduction in their capital charges and liabilities and with the release of their own financial resources for working capital purposes to an extent that would not be practicable if the industry was located somewhere else.  That is the theory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The improvement of fishing harbours or piers will not arise under this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture has got control of certain funds for that purpose and I am sure he will use them.  I know that some tidying up has to be done because, at present, before any such work can be undertaken, the Department of Agriculture, the Board of Works and the local authority have to get all their engineers together to agree and the Parliamentary Secretary has some idea of simplifying that procedure.  If a factory was established in Ballyvaughan which required harbour facilities for its development, then it would be possible, under this Bill, to give help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question to-day to the Minister for Agriculture in connection with the setting up of a ground limestone factory in Kenmare.  If a number of people come together and form a company with the intention of setting up such a factory, would that project qualify under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly qualify.  I do not want that to be taken as a promise that help will be given. It will be entitled to apply for help; but I can contemplate a decision by Foras Tionscal that a ground limestone factory in Kerry to supply Kerry should be capable of being operated without any special help.  On the other hand, there may be a decision to give help.  I think we will have to look into the whole question of ground limestone production.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride suggested that one form of help would be a flat rate charge for transport.  I think that is completely impracticable.  A flat rate charge contemplates the same rate per ton whether the goods are carried for one mile or for 100 miles.  If you institute that then Córas Iompair Eireann will get the thin end of the wedge.  They will be carrying the 100 miles and the private lorry will carry the one mile because a flat rate can only be operative if the carriage of goods is prohibited in any other way except over Córas Iimpair Eireann and exclude private lorries altogether.  Córas Iompair Eireann would have to try to make up by the higher profit on the short haul for the loss on the long haul.  Unless you can guarantee the short haul Córas Iompair Eireann will carry at a loss.  A flat rate charge will not work out unless you can guarantee the whole of the business.  Where that can be done, as in the case of contracts with individual firms, flat rate charges are in fact in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters referred to was the desirability of developing coastal shipping in order to open up the industrial possibilities of the West.  I am personally very interested in the possibilities of coastal shipping services. I have stated that it is the Government's view that they should be provided by private enterprise.  I know <Col N="874" /> some people are in fact interesting themselves in the possibilities of that development.  But I think it should be made clear that the provision of shipping services does not mean anything unless the local traders in the ports concerned are prepared to consign their cargoes through the ports.</P>
    <P>At the present time State funds are being expended on the improvement of a number of harbours&mdash;Fenit, Limerick, Sligo and Ballina.  Money has been spent on Westport and Buncrana and other harbours along the coast.  But the shipping services have not come.  The reason for that is not that the people are not prepared to provide shipping services but the habit of consigning goods by inland transport rather than by coastal services has become so strong amongst the traders concerned.  If the new effort, which I understand will be made to develop coastal shipping, is to succeed it will only succeed if local traders in these centres avail of the services, services which I think would prove to be to their substantial advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to the possibilities of developing the tomato industry.  I understand the Minister for Agriculture has some plans for that development.  I think the processing of tomatoes for various purposes would be a very suitable industry for the West.  It is one which I would be particularly keen to encourage.  I am afraid, however, that I cannot promise help to the poteen industry to which the Deputy referred.</P>

    <P>(2)  Where the board is satisfied that the establishment of an industrial undertaking is desirable in an undeveloped area, and where it appears unlikely that any person, or company, will undertake such development, the board may, with the consent of the Minister, take steps to promote the establishment of an industrial undertaking in such area, and for this purpose may invest funds in and take all steps as <Col N="875" /> may be necessary to establish such industrial undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now discussed the section and he has made points which he did not mention the last day. Realising, as we do, that the strength of a chain is reckoned by the strength of its weakest link, I believe that the strength of this Bill can be reckoned by the fact that the weakest link in it is that it is left solely to the initiative of private enterprise.  It is true that the Bill in itself offers certain concessions. It is also true that the Minister may by Order have other areas included, areas which I on the last day described as depressed areas.</P>
    <P>The board may afford such facilities as are mentioned in the Bill.  They may finance the building of a factory and its equipment.  They may make provision for the improvement of roadways, etc.  No later than this evening, the Minister has reiterated the one outstanding feature; that is, that when the factory is built and equipped, the people who start the industry must straight away paddle their own canoe. That might be all right in small industries. That may be all right where a group of industrialists, with the aid of technical advice from people sufficiently well informed as to the possibilities of manufacture, proceed to manufacture an article for which there is a ready and guaranteed sale.  That would naturally provide a certain encouragement to manufacturers to start such an industry.  They may be quite satisfied to do so when they know that they will get financial aid in the erection and equipping of a factory.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the picture. In considering the other side of the picture, we must also consider some of the outstanding events of the past. Many speakers have adverted to the fact that consideration should be given to the manufacture of synthetic products from seaweed and kelp.  I believe such a development would not attract private enterprise.  I do not believe any group of people would come from the West or the South before this board and say that they were prepared to start off on a big scale.  People are entitled to invest, as the majority of <Col N="876" /> investors do, in the safest securities they can find.  To-day, people want to invest in old-established industries that pay a fair dividend.  If we pin our faith on the fact that people from these areas will come forward and invest their money in such industries and put products on the market for which they will have no assurance of a ready sale because of competition within the State itself, I believe there will be a difficulty.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to remember that we have one outstanding industry, the sugar beet industry, which has created a lot of employment not only in the areas concerned but particularly amongst the farming community and the country as a whole.  It would never have been started if left to private enterprise.  I am not blaming people if they would not invest their money in it at the time.  It may have seemed to them that the risk was too great.  We all know that, at the time the Carlow factory was built, the number of individuals in this State who would be willing, on their own, to start such a factory, even with help from the State, was relatively small.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to-day to the Tuam factory.  We know that at the present time the sugar company have purchased land in its vicinity.  We know from the quantity of beet sent into that factory that the local people did not find it safe for themselves to invest in it.  Bearing in mind the circumstances surrounding the building of the first sugar factory in the country, we get a clear indication that there will be different lines of approach to the starting of any industry, and that we will not be able perhaps to get individuals or groups of people to make a start on their own.</P>
    <P>I believe myself that, as regards the West, the best line of approach would be to consider the possibility of starting an industry for the manufacture of products from kelp and seaweed.  We know from what is being done in other countries, that there are vast possibilities in that direction.  Of course, such an industry would need the assistance of the highest type of technical skill. Even when allowance is made for the various grants that may be available, <Col N="877" /> the people who would be anxious to start such an industry may not be in a position to secure the highly skilled technicians required.  It is, unfortunately, true that highly qualified people are leaving the country day after day.</P>
    <P>The newspapers reported some days ago the departure of a man of that type who had gone across to the big firm of Vickers-Armstrong.  If possible, I believe that we should keep such people at home, but the trouble is that industrialists in the West or the SouthWest may not be in a position to offer them salaries attractive enough to keep them at home.  That is why I urge on the Minister that power be given to the board to start industries in places where it is proved conclusively that we will not be able to get, through lack of finance or otherwise, groups of persons to start industries. You may find groups of people here and there who would be anxious to start certain industries in their areas, but who may be discouraged through difficulties arising from lack of transport or the fact that the raw materials required may be far removed from a seaport or large town. In those circumstances, they may not be prepared to act as pioneers in such an industry, particularly if there is the likelihood that their investments are not going to prove profitable.</P>
    <P>With these considerations in mind, I consider that it is the duty of the State if we want to make this Bill a success, to step in and build up an industry in an area where it is proved that it is possible to do so.  I am not advocating, of course, that we should go around the country and start an industry irrespective of all other considerations, but I think it should be the duty of the State to start an industry in any particular area where we cannot get local enterprise or local finance to do it.  If the State made such a start and if, after a number of years, they were able to build up an industry on satisfactory lines, I would see nothing wrong with the State offering that industry to the local people to be worked by them on a co-operative basis.  It could be offered to them on their undertaking to invest <Col N="878" /> their money in it.  I believe we would be able to get that done, especially if the people were assured of a fair return on their investment.  On the other hand, if we expect people to invest their money at the start in an industry, I believe that this Bill will be found wanting.</P>
    <P>This amendment has the full support of every member of the Labour Party. We maintain that you simply cannot sit back if you want to make the Bill a success and if you want to get the industrial arm in the West in full swing or even in medium swing.  It would not do for the Minister to await the arrival in his Department of would-be industrialists, because many of them may fight shy of these projects.  The Minister made it clear time and time again that after the giving of grants at the start and after the factory has been built and after grants have been given towards equipment, full responsibility will then devolve on the people themselves.  It may be all right to give certain contributions by the State.  These will be a help.  I believe that in view of the restricted number of products which people may think of going into they may ultimately be driven to take up some line of manufacture which would need the assistance of highly qualified technicians. That applies to a certain extent to the slate quarries.  It is clear, at the present time, that some of the slate quarry owners are not in a position to work the quarries economically because they have not proper machinery.  The Minister may say that certain facilities are available to them from some other source, but what is to happen if those people do not even look for that consideration?  With all the materials that are available, are we to continue roofing our houses with concrete tiles? I know, of course, that the manufacturers of those tiles and the users of cement, and Cement Limited are anxiously awaiting the time when our slate quarries will not be working to full capacity.  The tendency at the present time would appear to be to use any type of roofing material other than slate for our houses.  The fact, however, is that we have large deposits of slate which are undeveloped.  These deposits will never be developed if the development <Col N="879" /> is left to private individuals.  I believe that the acceptance of the amendment would make the Bill a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully support the Deputy's insistence that the State should play its part in the industrial development of the West, I am absolutely opposed to the amendment because I think it would do the Bill a considerable amount of harm. This Bill, as I see it, is a pilot scheme. I say that because of the limited amount of money to be made available. The object of the Bill is to see if industrial development can take place in the West.  If we are going to mix State development with the Bill, which is obviously designed to stimulate and encourage private enterprise, then I think you are going to discourage private enterprise.  Take any area in the West of Ireland where there are people who want to start an industry. If they think the position will arise that that industry may, at a later date, be in competition or may be superseded by a State industry, I think the whole countenance of private enterprise in the Bill is going to be interfered with.  I would far prefer to see this Bill go through as it is, without any amendment, and wait and see what the result will be.  I am sure that there will be some result.  I do not want to relieve the Government of its responsibility to provide employment where private enterprise cannot provide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Deputy who spoke is, evidently, a great believer in private enterprise.  The reason why I am supporting this amendment is that I know of a number of industries that have been dependent for years on private enterprise and have absolutely failed, for instance, the barytes mines in West Cork.  Before this State was founded there was a great export trade from these mines.  When the State was formed the vested interests in the mines did not think it wise to continue them, and they are closed down since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous to the first World War <Col N="880" /> there was a great demand for barytes, not alone in England but in Europe. It took a Hungarian to come into this country and to charter ships and take away the barytes which remained on the surface since the period of the first World War.  He shipped it to England and elsewhere.  A group of individuals here would not develop the industry, even with encouragement from people who knew how to develop it.  There was such an export trade of barytes from Cork during 1914, 1915 and 1920 that the dockers in Cork had to get a special rate for handling this volume of export trade.  We are told now that we must wait until private enterprise will come along and develop that industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond has adverted to slate quarries.  During the last Government's régime, I tried to get something done about developing these quarries, not alone in Cork but in Clare as well.  I felt that it was a terrible state of affairs that we should be covering thousands of our houses with artificial slates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What do you do in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>In Cork we have a slate quarry which has been working for years.  There were 130 men employed there at one time, and now there are only 50.  People in charge of Killaloe told me that the Dutch would take all the slates that they could give.  Killaloe's biggest customer was the Glasgow Corporation. Yet houses are being roofed by municipalities in this country with a type of slates or tiles imported from Holland or elsewhere.  I watched three lorries taking imported tiles from the quayside in Cork last Sunday to districts in West Cork.  Yet we are told that we are acting unfairly when we interfere with private enterprise; we are told we might discourage it.</P>
      <P>I have letters in my possession from Killaloe saying that the reason they cannot develop the slate quarries there is that they have not sufficient capital. A certain amount of expenditure would be needed to clear away the waste and get down to the slates proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> I heard Deputy Flynn asking a question recently about slate quarries in Kerry.  The answer he got was that they were inspected and that the report which was got back was not favourable.  I suggest to the Minister that the reason that report was not favourable was that private enterprise did not want any interference with the slate quarries because they are doing very well and receive substantial dividends.</P>
    <P>I have a letter in my pocket from Carrick-on-Suir asking if anything could be done about the slate quarries located there.  Must we wait on private enterprise to achieve what we want done?  I am quite satisfied that if we are waiting for private enterprise to start the industries, large or small, in the undeveloped areas, it will not do it.  I would suggest to the Minister that you will not get people to invest money in that type of industry while they are able to draw big dividends elsewhere.  We are not going to depend on private enterprise to develop even small industries.  I am rather keen on starting small industries right through undeveloped areas along the coast of this country.  I support this amendment for the very good reason that private enterprise will not do the job. If we were dependent on private enterprise to establish our industries and to help the people of this country, we would be disappointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have wasted a lot of time on this particular amendment, which seems to me, on the face of it, to be unnecessary.  We have established a board to assist private enterprise.  Why put on that board the additional function of running industries? I think it would be complicating matters somewhat for the board, and I doubt if it would be able to fulfil the dual purpose of developing private enterprise on the one hand and establishing industries on the other.  I do not think it is necessary to wait for any length of time for the development of any industry which cannot be undertaken by private enterprise. If there are mineral deposits in an area, or a slate quarry which is capable of being developed by the investment <Col N="882" /> of capital, I think that the Minerals Development Company should be instructed to undertake the working and development of that particular industry.</P>
      <P>I think we should aim at leaving this board to deal with the functions which are given to it.  If there is other work outside that such as mineral development it should be left to a State company established for the purpose.  If there is an opening for some other industry in the matter of developing essential raw material, it might be necessary to establish another State company to undertake that work.  The functions of the new board should not be overlapped or functions should not be transferred to it which are outside its scope and which it might not be equipped to undertake.  I have already mentioned how all this industrial development could very profitably be undertaken by a State company established for the purpose.  Any development in regard to turf, for instance, could be undertaken by Bord na Móna. Similarly, any development in regard to electricity could be undertaken by the Electricity Supply Board.  Also, it may be necessary to establish a State company to deal with the marketing of fish.</P>
      <P>If it is necessary to establish a State company for any other branch of production, particularly in the matter of raw materials, whether it be lime or ground limestone or anything else, I do not see why it should not be done. There is nothing to prevent it from being done.  I do not think there is any real reason for imposing upon the board established under this Bill the additional function of running industries. It may, as a matter of fact, impede it in doing the work which is entrusted to it under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we are all in agreement as to what ought to be done.  We are all in agreement with the proposal that whatever resources are in the country, whether it is slate, phosphate rock, limestone rock or anything else, that require development, ought to be developed as far as possible.  There is no necessity for waiting any length of time on private enterprise.  If the board or the Minister sees that the <Col N="883" /> particular line of production cannot be undertaken by private enterprise, he can go ahead and promote public enterprise in that particular direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for taking part in this debate is that, listening to the remarks of Deputy Hickey, I felt compelled to stand up and agree with him so far as private enterprise is concerned.  He has mentioned slate quarries in the Killaloe area.  As a young lad, I remember the stone quarries in Doonagore, which were worked by an English firm long before we had the freedom we now enjoy to-day.  They came from England and not alone did they work those quarries but they developed the harbour in Liscannor to ship from Liscannor the products of those quarries. After some years, they fell through for some reason or other.  Deputy Hickey mentioned the Killaloe slate quarries. As I said here the other night, and say again now, I would ask the Tánaiste to extend this Bill to the slate quarries at Killaloe.  These quarries were never properly developed and in what I might call the miniature attempt that had been made to develop them by private enterprise, they have still been a great success so far as the slate is concerned.  I would like the House to remember that after 100 or 150 years they are still there to the good when the compositions that are put in the roofs of our houses will have fallen down and gone.</P>
      <P>In regard to private enterprise, the Minister knows just as well as I do that during the emergency when the farmers could not get manures to carry this country through the scarcity&mdash; because of which the farmers had undoubtedly to produce more and would have been unable to do so without manures&mdash;it was the phosphate mine in Doolin which produced the manures and enabled the crops to be grown to feed the people of this country during that emergency.  That was done by the Government and not by private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been proved here in the course of the debates for the past fortnight or three weeks that some people can <Col N="884" /> never see the sense of investing money in their own country.  It has been invested with our neighbour and at a very small rate of interest.  If that money could be used at home&mdash;and I do not see why the Government would not insist that it should be so used&mdash; it would give us a chance to develop industries here and that is essential if you want to make the Bill a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Cogan and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll are under a misapprehension about the amendment suggested by Deputy Desmond.  This is not an attempt at nationalisation of industry of any kind in these congested areas but is merely an attempt to ensure that where private enterprise does not develop industries in these particular districts this board, after detailed examination, will, where it sees fit, advise the establishment of an industry that will be appropriate to a particular locality.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister is providing a good financial incentive to industrialists or manufacturers in an attempt to get them to carry out to some extent the industrialisation of the West.  This is a suggestion to him, to go just a small way in nationalisation of a particular type of industry in the congested areas and in the West generally. Nobody suggests that the Government should set up any type of manufacturing industry but the amendment does seriously suggest that the Government would interest itself in the development of the natural resources of the congested districts and all the other places mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond has made a very good case for the inclusion of this section and Deputy Hickey has followed on on practically the same lines. I think it is evident for a long time that the development of the natural resources of the country as a whole is in need of greater exploitation by somebody.  Private enterprise has not done it.  Private enterprise for years failed to take an interest, for example, in the development of electricity in this country.  The State had to do it. Private enterprise failed to take an interest in the beet sugar industry in <Col N="885" /> this country and again the State had to do it.  The Minister himself admits to-day that the Government of around 1934 took steps in the direction of establishing a beet factory in Tuam. He admitted that for years that particular factory has not been an economic success&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case private enterprise failed to take any interest in the development of the sugar beet industry in this country and the State had to intervene.  I think everybody recognises that the development of the slate industry, for one example, is an absolute necessity for this country.  For some unknown reason private enterprise has failed to take any interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to believe that anyway.</P>
      <P>In any case there is a market for slates in this country and, if private enterprise does not develop slate quarries, we suggest that it is the State's duty and function to do it, because it is ridiculous importing or using slates that are not suitable for houses in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another example where private enterprise has failed and where the State has had to step in in recent years. Private enterprise in many towns and counties failed to take an interest in house building.  The result was that local authorities in different places had to step in and provide the houses themselves. Nobody can deny that there was a market for houses and that there <Col N="886" /> was a reasonable profit for private enterprise in the house-building industry but, for some unknown reason, private enterprise took no interest in it.  Local authorities had to take a hand and build in some cases by direct labour.  As I said, this amendment is not intended to provide a method in substitution for private enterprise and we do not disagree with any financial incentive that private enterprise may get towards the establishment of industry in the congested areas.  We merely say that where private enterprise fails to take an interest and where the board thinks it would be desirable and feasible to set up an industry, that they should do so.  The Minister has expressed the belief that the natural resources of the West can be developed by private enterprise but if private enterprise does not proceed to develop them, will he avail of the terms of this Bill to enable the board to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has all the necessary information at his disposal but there seems to be something mysterious about the failure to produce slates in this country.  A quarry that was opened in Louisburgh in my own county has failed.  A similar complaint has been made about Killaloe out of which, beyond question, a very good slate was coming at one time.  The same is true of Driminagh in West Cork and of a quarry which was opened in Galway.  Why is it that these quarries have been a failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer is, although I should not like to express it as an authoritative opinion, that the Irish slate is a small slate and its utilisation for roofing involves the use of a considerable amount of timber and timber is very dear at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard that. Deputy Hickey referred to the Carrick-on-Suir slate quarry.  I think, if my memory is correct, that we got that quarry started twice and it failed twice in my own time.  We spent a great deal of money in West Cork trying to <Col N="887" /> develop the quarries there.  The Louisburgh quarry was also opened with the aid of State money at one time.  I think if the total amount lost by the State in an effort to keep these quarries open, even at a time when tiles had not become so popular as they have since, were computed, it would amount to a considerable sum.  I think it was Deputy Corish, rather than Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, who misunderstood this amendment.  Deputy Corish said that the purpose of this amendment was to ensure that the Government would interest itself in the development of the natural resources of the congested districts.</P>
      <P>The Government is quite prepared to interest itself in the development of the natural resources of these counties but the amendment suggests that the development of any enterprise on which the Government decided to embark should be undertaken through the board.  That is the only issue between us.  I listened to Deputy Desmond and, to a large extent, I could not disagree with his arguments.  It is true that we cannot leave the development of our natural resources and of industrial possibilities to private enterprise alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that, to the extent to which private enterprise is either unable or unwilling to avail of the industrial possibilities that exist, the Government should undertake the task itself through some State organisation but I think that, if it does, it will have to be done through some specialist organisation. I do not think it practicable to give the three men who will constitute the board the task of running any industry.  That must be the job of people who have technical knowledge of the particular enterprise concerned. Even if the members of the board were technicians they may have technical knowledge in regard to only one enterprise and they would have to confine their activities to that.  If there is a case for State activity in the production of sugar, fertilisers or sea-weed, or the products of sea-weed, then it will have to be done by a specialist organisation directed by people chosen because of their special knowledge of <Col N="888" /> that one task, who can bring to it the concentrated attention it would require.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended to provide assistance for private industrial firms undertaking industrial activity in these areas.  If over and above all that any private enterprise so assisted can do, there are other industrial possibilities which because of their complicated character, risk or some other feature, are not likely to be attractive to private enterprise, then I agree the State should try to undertake such developments.  Looking back over the past twenty years, a good deal has been done by the State in that direction but it was done by specialist organisations set up by Statute.</P>
    <P>That is the way to handle such developments.  My disagreement with Deputy Desmond is not on the principle that State activity should supplement in these matters whatever private enterprise can do, but on the practical issue that the State must work through some organisation other than that contemplated in the Bill.  This board will have one function&mdash;to administer the finances provided under the Bill.  Any other function concerned with development must be carried out by some organisation specially set up for the purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, apart from the functions of the board, the State has already ample legislation to set up industries if they wish to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Particular industries. The State has set up the alginate company for seaweed industries along the western seaboard.  Bord na Móna for the production of turf and the sugar company for manufacturing sugar. There are other State concerns of that kind.  Some of these will extend their activities into new lines, which are within their powers as defined by law, but if there is a new enterprise likely to be deemed practicable for these areas, the right way is to entrust the development of it to people who know something about the industry and give them powers under a special Act.  If funds are required the State would not have the right to call on the funds <Col N="889" /> provided by this Bill, because these funds will not be more than sufficient to finance private enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I waited with interest to hear what the Minister had to say as to why the amendment should not be accepted.  I listened to Deputies who signified their opposition to it to see if they could give any reason in the world why the right should not be given to the board to initiate a scheme in any undeveloped area under the Bill. No one pointed out what harm it was to have this power in the Bill.  Assuming it never did any good, surely it would be there as a spur, as a precautionary measure, to ensure that where private enterprise did not&mdash; either because of the fact that the promoters were not going to get dividends or because they had already started an industry in the East which might clash with some of the industries established in the West&mdash;take the initiative, the board would act.  Surely it is only reasonable to expect that private enterprise will not attempt to enter into the West until the promoters are satisfied that big dividends will result.</P>
      <P>If they find from their expert advisers that that industry can be established in some western area which would be just sufficient to pay the wages of the workers and the overheads of the factory, but which would not yield very much in dividends, would it not be a national dividend to us to have the workers of those areas employed and kept at home even though we do not gain very much else from it?  Is it suggested that private enterprise is interested in the Gaeltacht areas for that reason alone?  Business people are not worried whether the people find work in the Gaeltacht areas or anywhere else.  The only interest they have is in getting dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a good many industries, such as fish curing, which may not yield a big dividend but which could be run by this board.  The Tánaiste made the point that these men will not be experts.  Nobody expects them to be experts themselves but, having been advised that there was a possibility in a certain industry, surely they could, <Col N="890" /> with the money in their hands, employ experts who would run the industry for the first few years and, as Deputy Desmond said, then invite shares to be taken by the people of the area? They could contact the local development committees or even the local authorities and point out what had been done over an initial period of five years, what were the profits and the results from the industry, and then invite the people to take £1 shares or some shares of that kind.  I feel that if the right to initiate industries was put into the Bill it would improve the Bill, even if private enterprise had the first right to try to establish an industry before the board started.  Therefore, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the debate on this particular point and in the amendment because it is I think a rather important matter.  I am particularly interested in the Tánaiste's reply. This Bill will be welcomed by all sides and it is very desirable and necessary in the circumstances.  Unfortunately, it is not unlikely that the pattern of industrialisation which should and will, I hope, follow the allotment of this money to the West will follow the lines of going to Westport, Castlebar and the largest towns, because, if an industrialist wants to make money out of an enterprise, he will find in those areas water, electricity, etc. and the other things which are necessary for the establishment of an industry.  I have no experience of industry, but I find it difficult to imagine an industrialist taking a look at Lettermore or Lettermullen and establishing an industry in either of these places owing to the attraction of Galway.  There is very little money in those areas and, consequently, there is unlikely to be any great capital forthcoming from the inhabitants for the establishment of an industry.  Therefore, I imagine that in the area from Spiddal up to Carna and all round the islands there will be very little development by private enterprise under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Admittedly, it is a pilot Bill and for that reason it is worth watching.  If it does not give us all the things hoped for it will at least show up some mistakes and in that way we can learn <Col N="891" /> from the experience we get.  But there is the difficulty that you have in those areas poor people with very little money.  The spoken language is largely confined to those areas and, consequently, taking Connemara anyway, it is an area in which I imagine the Government would be interested in seeing that certain employment is provided. One of the unfortunate things there is the lack of the necessities for modern industries such as electricity, water, etc.  The other thing which I personally have some experience of was the lack of available employees over the whole year.</P>
    <P>It was possible to get people for a certain number of months in the year, but it was not easy to get a good pool of employees for any industry over the whole year.  Consequently, there are such considerable risks in that particular area that I wonder if the Tánaiste has given the matter consideration and if he is prepared to have a recommendation put forward by this board at the end of a particular period that the problem of preserving what remains of the language in that area is not adverted to in this Bill and that it will be necessary for the State to take a hand and establish small industries there.</P>
    <P>I feel that the people who framed the Bill have taken most of the facts into consideration and will bear them in mind, knowing that this matter has the sympathy of all sides of the House and that it is an extremely difficult task in those cases.  Most of us have very great sympathy with and understanding of the matter and we wish them every encouragement in carrying out this job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to a rather specialised problem and it is no harm that I should mention it, because it was also discussed during the Second Reading debate and I did not have an opportunity of commenting on what was said.  I do not think that this Bill will in fact benefit the half dozen parishes or so that constitute the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I do not think that it is desirable that we should actively try to attract industrial development by private enterprise in <Col N="892" /> those areas.  I think that private enterprise in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht would only have an anglicising effect.  If there is to be development of industry or other activities there, it must of necessity be done by State organisations, organisations which will have instructions to subordinate commercial success to the preservation of the language and the Gaelic character of the area.</P>
      <P>After this Bill was announced, I had a discussion with the executive of Comhdháil Náisiúnta on that question and I expressed the view that no financial help we could give would in fact attract a private industrial group into the Fíor-Ghaeltacht instead of into Galway or Clifden or some of the towns in the vicinity and they, in fact, said that that is what they would prefer. They wished to see industrial employment developed in the areas around the Fíor-Ghaeltacht so that those who had to leave it, or desired to leave it for economic reasons, would not wander too far from their homes and would still be in contact with the home atmosphere. They represented that in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht development would have to be through State organisations and I fully and completely agree with that.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider then an amendment on the Report Stage to the effect that the board would have power to initiate the establishment of an industry without investing funds in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That implies a different type of organisation from what I have in mind here.  I contemplate under this Bill an administrative organisation which will have funds, which will receive propositions and assess their merits from the point of view of permanency as set out under the Bill and assess the competitive disadvantages of a location and, having made that assessment, appropriate aid under one or other headings of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That contemplates an organisation that will go out, investigate, get expert advice on industrial possibilities and then prepare propositions.  That will be a different type of organisation altogether.  I think that is work for the <Col N="893" /> Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to keep in mind the position of the Industrial Development Authority in this connection.  Under the previous régime that authority was snowed under with administrative responsibilities. It was handling export and import licences and other administrative duties of that kind to such an extent that it could in fact do little else.  I have taken all those functions from it and I have given it a list of industries which are of major importance and which are only likely to be established here if someone goes out to plan them.  That authority has got the job now of planning the development of these industries.</P>
    <P>In some directions at least they are making considerable progress.  If they produce a sound plan for any one or other of these industries entrusted to them, a plan which seems practicable for the West, and if we cannot get that plan put into operation by private enterprise then we will contemplate doing it as a State enterprise.  But all that work of planning industrial development, considering the possibilities, getting expert reports and making that information available to people who may be keen to follow the information up, all that work will be done by the Industrial Development Authority in respect of one group of industries.  In respect of all the others it will be done by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is only when all that has produced a particular project that the board will come into the picture to decide what inducement can be offered in respect of that project to establish it west of the Shannon instead of east.</P>

      <P>I can understand Deputy Desmond's anxiety in this matter and I can view his case with a certain amount of sympathy.  I do not believe there is a Deputy who does not know of at least one undeveloped area in his constituency.  In our constituencies in the South, we are faced with problems that were created by the departure of the British from this country and they have remained unsolved ever since.  In Cobh, the departure of the British left 2,000 skilled workers unemployed from 1922 to 1939.  In 1939, Irish Steel was established and that eased the pressure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond has Passage West on his side of the river.  We hoped there that employment would be found in the Rushbrooke dockyard but, unfortunately, Rushbrooke is being squeezed out by Dublin.  Kinsale is in practically the same position.  The town of Fermoy is derelict.  In both those towns, employment was given either by the British Navy or because British forces were quartered in the area.  Fermoy has remained undeveloped ever since the British left. I hope that in the next six months a decent industry will be established there but I do not want an Undeveloped Areas Bill in order to have that industry established.  I hope we will get it without that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the particular purpose behind this Bill.  I know the areas it is hoped to cover.  Ever since I came into this House close on 25 years ago, we have listened to continuous complaints by western Deputies of unemployment and of people emigrating year after year.  That has been used as a lever in order to extract from the <Col N="895" /> Land Commission land in Meath and other counties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words by way of reply.  I was rather surprised at Deputy Corry taking the line that he did and I was wondering what the Minister was thinking of it.  It now seems he cannot make up his mind.  We thank Deputy Cogan for his opinion that the Minister can arrange for State enterprise in other directions.  That line was taken up by other Deputies.  To be quite frank, I do not know what line Deputy Dr. Browne is taking.  He was for and against the amendment. Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll used the words, appropriately perhaps, that this was a pilot Bill.  He considered that because, being a pilot Bill, it was of importance and it should get a good try.  Coming as I do from a seaboard area, the word &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; has to me a certain significance.  People living, perhaps, in inland areas may not take the same notice of it that I do.  But the fact is that the materials, the goods and even the passengers who come into this country are at all times dependent on the services of a pilot. The pilot must go out to the various liners that come into Cork Harbour. If this Bill is to be considered as a pilot Bill and if the pilot fails, then the Bill is on the rocks.  I maintain that the Minister who introduced the Bill must accept the responsibility of pilot.</P>
      <P>The Minister said something that I was not aware of before, that there has been a loss on the manufacture of slate.  If there has been, is that not an indictment of the manner in which private enterprise has dealt with the industry?  Otherwise, it must be due to lack of necessary machinery, equipment or technicians to operate such an important industry.  It is one important industry which may have resulted in a loss of money simply because the available resources were not being utilised by the industrialists themselves, or because they may not have been in a position financially to avail of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned that he had in mind the idea of small industries. On the Second Stage of the Bill, <Col N="897" /> I referred to the importance of local industries which industrialists either will not operate or may not be in a position to operate.  The Minister did mention, in connection with some of these possible larger industries, that other boards or bodies may be set up to deal with them.  I think he did mention during the debate that a list of possible industries has been given to the Industrial Development Authority. What I am anxious to know is whether there is such a thing available as a true sense of co-ordination. I am not, of course, attacking the Minister, because I believe that this is a matter which should have been considered not within the last few months but 30 years ago.  If we have these bodies dealing with possible industries, and if we have a true sense of co-ordination existing between them, it should be possible, within a short period of time, to embark on some of the larger ones which the Minister must know industrialists will not embark on.</P>
    <P>The duration of this Bill is for a period of seven years.  We know, of course, it can be extended.  The term of office of the three members of the proposed board will expire after five years.  They, too, can be re-employed. The point that I want to make is, are we going to wait for seven years to find out whether private industrialists will be able to, or will agree to, undertake the development of various manufactures and processes in the West and South West?  According to the statement of the Minister, it seems quite evident that, because we are leaving this entirely to private enterprise, we cannot embark on the alternative system whereby, within a shorter <Col N="898" /> period than seven years we should be able to move in the opposite direction of State enterprise.  Deputy Kyne and myself have indicated that we would be quite willing to see these industries based on a sound paying basis and that after a number of years arrangements could be made for offering their shares on the market.  If that were done, the State would be relieved of all responsibility, provided we could make them pay.</P>
    <P>I think it is perfectly evident from what has been said here, for and against the amendment, that this Bill will not operate successfully, and cannot give the desired results unless we are prepared here and now to put certain facilities at the disposal of this board.  The Minister knows quite well that there is not behind the amendment the suggestion that the members of the board should run any of these industries.  He made it clear, when presenting the Bill to the House, that even in the case of private enterprise, the duty on the members of the board is finished when the factories are erected and the equipment for them provided. The Minister has stated that the members of the board will have a staff to help and advise them.  If private enterprise cannot succeed in dealing with a certain industry, I believe that the only feasible way in which we can operate the Bill is by telling the people in the West and the South West areas this: that the Bill can be made a success if they work together in harmony and in conjunction with one another by promoting private enterprise, and that where that is not possible the State will help through State enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the success of this whole Bill will depend on the extent to which Section 5 is used for the purpose of establishing industrial undertakings in what may be described particularly as the western areas.  Quite frankly, as I said on the Second Stage of this Bill, I do not think it is wise on the part of this House to give the impression that the enactment of this Bill in its present form will produce an industrial revolution in the West.  I am quite satisfied it will do nothing of the kind, the pattern of life being what it is in the West.  The West is mainly a trading and pastoral area and it will be <Col N="901" /> extremely difficult to induce the ordinary private person to establish industries in the West, even with the facilities provided in this particular section.  After all, considerable difficulty is experienced in inducing the ordinary private investor to put his money into an industry in urban areas or in city areas because in this country, unfortunately, the establishment of a new industry is accompanied by more than the normal growing pains. The private investor has to face up to the problem of acquiring premises, converting green labour into skilled labour; he has to face up to the problem that there is an industrial tradition in particular industries.  The accumulative effect of even these three sets of difficulties is such that it imposes considerable handicaps on any new industry.  That is inevitable and it is something that we cannot get over.  It is part of the price we have to pay for the policy of developing our secondary industries.  In the case of many of the industries which have been established in urban areas, even where the labour position might be considered to be better from the standpoint of starting an industry than a western area, or where other difficulties might not be as obvious as they will be in western areas, investors have not got dividends for many years and some of them have not got dividends at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to call attention to those facts because of the disorderly interruptions of the company director in the other benches.  I say, Sir, that many of the difficulties which have confronted investors in the matter of investing money in eastern areas will be difficulties which will show themselves in a more intensive form in the development of industry in the West.  Therefore, I am afraid that reliance on the ordinary private investor to start industries in the western areas will not give us the response which is essential if we are ever to give an industrial pattern to these western areas.</P>
      <P>As I said on the Second Stage, the whole problem of the economic regeneration of the West resides not in reliance on the establishment of industrial undertakings alone; there are a wide variety of national activities which could be carried on in those areas involving the development of our sea fisheries, our mineral deposits, the fullest utilisation of land and the development of our afforestation programme.</P>
      <P>I do not want to develop the advantages offered by schemes of that kind on this particular section, but I believe it is only by a combination of all these activities that we can make a substantial contribution to the solution of the problem of the underdevelopment of the West and the constant emigration from these undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> It is because of that that I think the Minister will, before long, be forced to recognise that, while this Bill may make some contribution&mdash;I fear a very small contribution&mdash;to the industrialisation of the West, it will be necessary to have the efforts of this board supplemented either through the board or independently, by State activity calculated to ensure the development of our industries on the largest possible scale.  It is quite true, as has been said, that private enterprise has attempted on a number of occasions to exploit the mineral deposits and the state deposits in these areas.  Unfortunately, there is a long trail of failure and disappointment arising from these activities.  Very often, that has not been due, probably, to any want of enthusiasm on the part of private enterprise.  In many instances, it may be due to incompetent management, even due to incompetence, deliberate or accidental, on the part of imported technicians.  In some instances, it has been due to the fact that the industry ran into heavy seas and was not able to hold on because its financial resources did not permit it to do so.</P>
    <P>But many of the most successful industries in this country are industries which, if the spotlight of efficiency had been put on them at one time or another, might have been found sadly wanting, but they nevertheless managed to keep going and ultimately to triumph over their infant difficulties.</P>
    <P>I think the State would have at its command resources which will not be available to the ordinary small industrialist, or to any of the smaller undertakings which may be thrown up by the Bill.  It is because I believe that only the State has the financial resources necessary for the fullest exploitation of the areas, the ability to get the necessary technical assistance to command in any field the knowledge which enters into the necessary &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; of attracting technicians to this country, that I think it is necessary, through this Bill or an Order to cap or flank this Bill, for the State to engage in the fullest exploitation of these areas.  What after all can private enterprise do in <Col N="904" /> the matter of developing mineral deposits in the West?  Does anybody know anybody in the West who in 1952 would invest money in looking for copper deposits there?  Does anybody know anybody in the West who would subscribe £100 to explore the possibilities of getting sulphur deposits in Connemara?  Of course they will not do that because they know too well that it is a line of country in which it is too expensive to try to plough the possibilities of success.  They know only too well that it is a line of country which can suck up a considerable sum of money.  If I may use a paradoxical expression, the loss of that money may be their only reward for investment of that kind.</P>
    <P>The position is different with the State.  The State has the resources to prospect and develop deposits.  The State has the resources, if deposits are found, to hold on until these deposits can be produced in quantities to make their exploitation a commercial proposition. The State has the resources to get the necessary technical aid from wherever that aid is available.  It is the State, and only the State, which can ensure that whatever deposits are in the area will not be lost from the standpoint of inadequacy of financial assistance to ensure their fullest exploitation.  The Minister, however, has indicated that he does not want this board to have the responsibility of setting up such undertakings.</P>
    <P>If the Minister takes that line, I regret it but I urge him to recognise at the outset that the response under Section 5 is, I fear&mdash;and there are good grounds for the fears&mdash;likely to be disappointing and that if any real progress is to be made towards bringing industries to the West, then it can be done only by the State occasionally participating in the establishment of those industries into which, for one reason or another&mdash;many of the reasons may be good reasons&mdash;it is not possible to attract private investors.  I urge him to recognise that the other way in which we can help to bring industrial employment to the West is by supplementing the activities of private enterprise under the Bill by State activities on a large scale, with the development of other activities by other Departments, <Col N="905" /> so as to help to make a general contribution towards providing in the West of Ireland employment, the absence of which to-day unfortunately sends many of our people overseas to find a living which they cannot get at home.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the House very long as I merely wish to comment on the speech which has just been delivered.  Deputy Norton, apparently, does not understand the most simple requirements necessary to bring industry to the undeveloped areas.  He does not realise that what has militated against the development of industry there in the past is the fact that the market for the disposal of whatever goods might be produced there, will not in the main be in the West.  Obviously nobody is going to start industries there, confronted with the disadvantage of competition from better placed industries from the point of view of a market.</P>
      <P>Apparently he does not understand that this Bill is going to attempt to attract industries in that part of the country by giving them certain advantages in order to make their products as competitive as if the factories were functioning in the biggest centres. Deputy Norton does not see the many problems that face persons investing money in industry.  In his heart he has a horror and a hatred for what he described as the capitalist mentality.</P>

      <P>He did not refer to the fact that under this Bill there could be a reduced charge for electricity, as compared with the charges in similar industries situated on the eastern seaboard. He did not realise that there was further assistance from the State, <Col N="906" /> in the provision of a subsidy for the erection of a factory, reducing the capital cost in the actual building. There is also to be assistance provided in the acquisition of plant.  In other words, in order to balance the disadvantages of a western location, this Bill seeks, as a beginning, to attract industries to the western seaboard by taking away from investors handicaps which they normally would incur in setting up industries in these areas. When Deputy Norton says he fears the Bill will not be a success, I think he wishes and hopes it will not be a success.</P>

      <P>I am as entitled to answer an interjection as the Deputy is.  I believe that a very substantial change of outlook with regard to the need for the establishment of an industry on the western seaboard has taken place.  I believe it will attract private enterprise.  When the Deputy talks about the other industries in regard to which State assistance is necessary, if the Deputy listened to the Tánaiste when he spoke on amendment No. 10 he would have found that that was clearly stated.  This Bill is limited to giving assistance to private enterprise for the establishment of industries with the consequent employment they will give and the saving to the national economy by establishing them in parts of Ireland where industries have not been traditionally known.  I am satisfied that this is a good Bill, that it will have good results, and when the £2,000,000 provided has been exhausted <Col N="907" /> more money will be provided for such industrial development.</P>

      <P>A good deal of discussion has centred around the fact that industries in the West may suffer because of the distance from the ports here.  We should not lose sight of the fact that we hope that the market for some of these industries which may be established may be our own country. We hope that the people of this country will purchase a large portion of their output.  Let us hope also that they will have a good exportable surplus. On the Second Reading, I said that the development of other ports should ease the present situation and help towards breaking up the monopoly which exists to a large extent by having all the traffic canalised through the ports of Dublin and Cork.  We all know that during the last emergency we were dependent on these two ports for the import and export traffic of the country.  The development of other ports is essential, particularly in the West where most of the industries will be established under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware that all the western ports such as Limerick, Galway, Sligo, etc. are being improved and extended with State financial help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="909" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that they have been improved very much but further improvement is necessary.  It will also be necessary for some Department to put before traders the necessity of diverting some of their traffic to these ports.  It is not good enough to spend sums of money in the development of these ports if they are to be allowed to lie idle.  Some efforts must be made to induce traders and others to use these ports.  Prior to the first world war most of the western ports were very busy centres of activity.  The first world war disorganised that trade and the western ports have never recovered from that.  That has been a huge loss to the country and I believe is responsible for the lopsided working of Córas Iompair Éireann in recent years.  It is not a good thing that the bulk of the traffic should virtually be confined to two ports.  The volume of traffic has increased very considerably in recent years.  Now that quite a few of the western ports have been put into a reasonable order by the expenditure of public money, coupled with this Bill there should be an increase of activity in the Department to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the trade will be diverted to those western ports so as to get them going again. We hear a lot of talk about people not investing in enterprise in the so-called undeveloped areas.  If what I suggest is done there will be a change of attitude in regard to that.</P>

      <P>This is the most important section in the Bill because it includes the general powers of the board.  While I agree with Deputy Briscoe that it is a good Bill, I only say it is a good Bill because it is not a bad Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I would not wax too enthusiastic about it.  I have expressed fears and I trust that my fears are unfounded.  I would like stronger assurances from the Minister in relation to the question of competition with eastern industries. We have given substantial sums of money and we have bent a tremendous amount of effort towards the preservation of the Gaeltacht, the Breac-Ghaeltacht and towards the preservation of the people in Connacht generally.  This <Col N="910" /> is just another effort to keep the people in the Gaeltacht by providing employment for them.</P>
    <P>I have no decided views on the matter and I have no suggestions to make to the Minister but if I were to tackle the problem I would do the reverse of what Cromwell did when he gave the people the choice of hell or Connaught.  I think we should industrialise that portion of the country best suited for industrialisation and we should develop the West in an entirely different fashion.  Deputy Norton is not very optimistic about the Bill.  I may appear optimistic when I say that I do not want to see a number of what I describe as artificial industries created in the West, artificial industries which may try to command from the consuming public artificial prices.</P>
    <P>I want to see the natural resources of the West developed.  I want to see processing industries established there. I want the resources that are actually there developed.  I think I am right in describing industries such as the toy industry, which requires its raw materials to be transported to the West and the finished product transported back again, as artificial industries.  To some extent the West is being pampered under this particular measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>For a number of years the Government has given food subsidies.  It gives the same subsidy to the man in the West as it does to a man in the City of Dublin or the town of Wexford.  Here it is proposed to give a subsidy to an industrialist who wants to go to the West and to the people who are living there.  I suggest that the East is industrially underdeveloped.  There are unemployed in Wexford town, in Enniscorthy, Gorey, and New Ross just as there are unemployed in the towns of Wicklow and Louth and Dublin City. They are unemployed because we are not fully industrialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to urge upon the Minister that he should impress upon the board that it should not encourage in the West the establishment of artificial industries which would be in unfair competition <Col N="911" /> with those established elsewhere throughout the country.  I rather imagine that the board should have greater powers to implement a policy of decentralisation and I would like to see power given to the board to give a certain concession, whether it be a tax concession or a rates concession, to every industry established outside the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the provincial towns we have to-day industries which are suffering from unfair competition.  I might name one of which the Department has knowledge and which was set up at the instigation of the Fianna Fáil Government from 1932 onwards.  I refer to the Irish Driver-Harris Company.  Recently a similar industry has been established in Dublin and the former is suffering unfair competition because of the burden of transport charges.  There is nothing that the Minister can do about it at the moment but I suggest that the Government should give some type of protection in order fully to implement the wishes of the House in relation to decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I impress upon the Minister that he should urge this board to give assistance and encouragement only to industries which are absolutely appropriate to the West.  He should not try to develop a part of the country which is not suitable for industrial development. Perhaps in the future we will have a measure to discourage the industrialists from setting up their industries in the City of Dublin which has become top heavy and to give them the fullest encouragement we can by way of tax concessions and so forth to establish themselves in the provincial towns where they will absorb the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I am wondering why the board is given power to give financial assistance to ensure the maintenance of a factory or a business.  I cannot understand what type of assistance will be given or under what circumstances it will be given.  I cannot see why a grant should be made for maintenance purposes to an existing industry.  To my mind that is giving a grant more or less in retrospect. These people have taken their chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to be a draftsman but the grant is given <Col N="912" /> for the establishment, development and maintenance of an industry; in other words, help cannot be given merely to get the industry started if it is going to flop immediately.  There must be some assurance that it will be maintained and the grant is given for the purpose of ensuring that, if it is established, it will be maintained.  I agree the legal phraseology is a bit misleading.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Norton spoke on the section, I listened carefully to him and I found very little difference of view between himself and the Minister.  I think an examination of what he said will indicate that.  It is being sought on this section to discuss the relative merits of private enterprise and State enterprise.  I am one of those people who believe in State enterprise as the more satisfactory method, but, as far as this Bill is concerned, its object is to encourage private enterprise, and for that purpose a particular type of board is provided for in the Bill.  I do not think any sensible person could give to the type of board visualised and provided for in this Bill the power to set up State industries. I do not think that is feasible at all.</P>

      <P>I think there was no necessity for a discussion on this section on the relative merits of these two ways of doing a particular job. Everyone agrees that this is one of several measures designed to assist in the development of industry in the western seaboard areas.  We have the activities of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, the activities of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, mineral development by Mianraí Teoranta, the <Col N="913" /> Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna, and the Industrial Development Authority&mdash;we have all these State organisations&mdash;contributing in one way or another to the desirable objective of providing employment in those undeveloped areas, to stem emigration and raise the standard of living of the people there.</P>
      <P>I can see, in regard to this measure, that it has an exceptionally good objective. It is desirable to encourage industrialists to get industries going in these areas.  It seeks to encourage local effort by local development associations in the starting of industries in those particular areas.  I think criticism on the line that the Bill is not going to do any good, or is going to do comparatively little good, is not desirable.  I think that what we ought to do is to encourage both industrialists and local organisations to avail of the provisions of this Bill.  I should certainly like to see the £2,000,000 provided in the Bill expended as quickly as possible.  If that money is expended, it will achieve the object of the Bill.  It may be that this Bill will not achieve its purpose and that more radical steps will have to be taken.  That may be necessary.  I hope it will not be necessary, but if it is, at least we will have had the experience of this Bill to guide us, because everything that could possibly be done to encourage industrialists to start industries in the undeveloped areas is to be found in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government and this House are providing the money and providing all those exceptional facilities.  I think that the Bill ought to leave the House with the blessing and support of every Deputy so that industrialists and local associations will be encouraged to avail of the very fine financial provisions that are in it.  As I said at the beginning, I do not think that this particular section afforded a suitable occasion for a contest on the issue between private enterprise and State enterprise.</P>

      <P>That was the issue in the amendment we have just voted <Col N="914" /> on.  What I want to say is that State enterprise can be more efficiently provided for in another measure, because to give the board that is visualised by this Bill power to set up industries would mean giving it work which it was not fitted to do under the Bill.  I think that is perfectly clear.  This Bill provides financial assistance for private industry to create, establish and maintain industries in the undeveloped areas.  I think we should leave the Bill in that form.</P>

      <P>Where the board gives a grant either for the cost of construction of premises or providing equipment, it can attach such terms as it thinks fit.

But I do not think he should restrict himself to the word &ldquo;grant&rdquo; in this section, and even more so than it applies in this section, it applies in Section 6 in connection with machinery.  After all, premises cannot move overnight, machinery can.  If it is a grant it should be made subject to the condition that the business remains in the same place</P>

      <P>Yes, but would it not be a proper technical way of doing what the Minister has in mind to provide that the board may give a non-repayable loan if the conditions are carried out?  As I see this from a legal angle, you can give a grant but you cannot provide that the grant can be repaid because it is a grant.  If you gave a loan it could be turned into a grant and you could provide that, in the event of a breach of conditions, the money would be repaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I am inclined to think that if the board give a grant of, say, £50,000 to set up an industry in, let us say, Belmullet, the board may wake up some morning and find that the machinery for which they gave half the cost has gone.  They would have an action perhaps against the company which may be then in liquidation; the company liquidators will have done nothing wrong in paying out the proceeds of the sale, because until such time as the board get their decree that the conditions of the grant have been broken, there will not be a fixed claim against the liquidators and the liquidators will be entitled to distribute the assets.  If it was a loan, repayment of which would be waived provided the conditions were kept for a period of seven years or whatever the period was, then the liquidator would not be in the same position.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make a speech on the Committee Stage of this Bill but having heard speeches from some of the Deputies, particularly my friend Deputy Peadar Cowan, I think it would not be right to let them pass without some comment.  I heard <Col N="917" /> the Tánaiste to-day saying that the purpose of the board would be to give grants not loans&mdash;I think I am quoting him correctly in saying that.  But we find under this particular section that the board may acquire land and may build premises and then it may look for recipients for the grants.  I think the Tánaiste said in reply to a question to-day that they built a beet factory in Tuam, and that they found difficulty in procuring beet.  They had to encourage the local farmer to grow it and they had to transport some.  We may find the board acquiring premises and land, and building premises, but then they may find no private enterprise.</P>

      <P>That is the only thing I see wrong with the section.  I welcome the Bill.  The one criticism I have is that it includes too many counties.  I think it should be confined entirely to the electoral areas of the old Congested Districts Board.  I do not for instance see that the entire County of Roscommon should be included. I am saying on the Committee Stage what I should have said on the Second Reading.  As I say, I welcome the Bill but that is the one fault I find with Section 5.  The board may acquire premises and land.  It would be much better if they let private enterprise acquire land and build premises and then give them the grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would acquire it at market value.  My idea is this.  Private enterprise would acquire it much cheaper than a public board and I think if we made the grants available for the purpose of acquiring and erecting the premises and establishing industry, it would be much better than having the board acquire the premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>On this section I sought to include an amendment, the purpose of which was not to displace private enterprise as a means of developing industries in the West but rather to supplement it by encouraging the State to come in and develop industries in areas where it was satisfied private enterprise was not likely to come in and start an industrial undertaking.  It was not, therefore, the desire on our part to replace private enterprise by State enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our desire was, in our anxiety to <Col N="920" /> develop the West, that the State should be entitled to encourage private enterprise to come in and start an industrial undertaking and that, at the same time, where private enterprise was likely not to be forthcoming the State should itself undertake the establishment of these industrial undertakings, so providing employment.  We feel that the State should step in where private enterprise was unwilling, even with the advantages set out in this Bill, to establish industries.</P>

      <P>We welcome this Bill. Deputy Briscoe has sought, in his typically mischievous way, to misrepresent our attitude towards this Bill.  Every Deputy on these benches welcomed this Bill and supported it on the Second Stage.  Our main desire is to ensure that the Bill is utilised to the fullest extent as a means of planting industries in the West.  Our fear, however, is that this may not be done satisfactorily, having regard to the magnitude of the task, by relying on private enterprise alone.  We in the Labour Party seek to supplement private enterprise by State activities. We believe that a combination of both will give the West more industries than they will get by a reliance on private enterprise alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Bartley) Gerald Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that private enterprise could not have done more in the West, and the reason it has not done more is the very basis of this Bill.  As the Minister has pointed out, the people who had the money and those who had some technical skill knew very well that they could not hope to compete successfully with a similar industry operating elsewhere.  I cannot understand the viewpoint of the Deputies who say that the activities of Foras Tionscal should be directed, in the main, to what I would call basic industries, or industries founded on the mineral deposits of the West, and that the setting up of secondary industries ought not to be encouraged in that area.  I do not see any virtue in that argument.  I would say that export commodities should be given priority in the <Col N="921" /> West because, in any event, they would have less fear from internal competition. It would be a matter of exporting the goods from the nearest harbour.</P>
      <P>On the question of secondary industries, I will make the following comments. Is there any reason why ropes could not be manufactured as economically in Connacht as in Leinster?  If the raw material for secondary industries has to be imported, I feel that it is quite immaterial where these industries are placed.  It seems to me that secondary industries should be encouraged in the West more so, in fact, than in the East for the reason stated in the introduction to the Bill; where you have not got good land, then you must endeavour to keep the population from emigrating by some other means.  It is quite possible that we can increase the total population of the country by a scheme of general industrialisation without reference to any particular area.</P>
      <P>I take it that the purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the population will be distributed as fully as possible over the entire country.  In view of the fact that the preservation of the Gaeltacht is inextricably linked up with these proposals, I think that the encouragement of all types of industry west of the Shannon will help to achieve that objective.  These Gaelic speakers mostly emigrate to towns, whether they be in England or in America.  The function of this Bill is to secure that the industrial centre will be as near to their native habitat as is possible to achieve.  The fact is that the population of Connacht has been falling more heavily, proportionately, than in any other constituencies in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the speakers who brought up questions such as land development, or even mineral exploration, have a proper conception of what the problems are.  What we should encourage are industries that can be most readily established, because of the urgency of this problem.  Mineral exploration in the West is a very problematical proposal entirely.  A fair amount of prospecting has been carried <Col N="922" /> on there.  The people who undertook it told us that the minerals were there all right but they were not satisfied that they were there in sufficient quantity. Whilst in operation, these works give employment, just as the making of bog roads, which is also a very useful activity, gives employment.  It is not, however, the type of employment that induces men from the West to make their homes here, because their future is doubtful.  We are making a new departure under this Bill in setting up ordinary industries which will hold out an inducement to young men to settle down and make their homes here.  That is what is required.</P>
    <P>With regard to State industries, we have made an attempt in that direction. We have in the West alcohol production, sugar production, boatyards, knitting, weaving, spinning and the manufacture of toys&mdash;all State industries.  Everybody admits that the way to solve the problem of inducing private enterprise to engage in industrial development in the West is to encourage and protect it.  Here for the first time we are developing the idea of home protection by creating a bias in favour of these areas.  It is for that reason that I think the idea enshrined in this Bill is a good one.  Industries are the only way by which you can stop emigration which is a problem apart from, and which has nothing to do with, land development, afforestation or anything of that kind.</P>

I have had very practical evidence of that in one particular town in the West of Ireland.  It is a new idea and it is putting the question up to private enterprise which, I think, is desirable.  All the handicaps which existed against private enterprise are now being removed.  If private enterprise in the West does not now take advantage of its opportunities, then, as the Minister has said, he will have to see what other powers he will use to achieve this purpose.  If it cannot be achieved, we have got to look forward to the continued depopulation of the West.  It has been suggested that we might transfer workers from the West to other parts of the country but how that would affect the Gaeltacht I do not know.</P>

      <P>(3)  The remission shall, subject to sub-section (4), have effect in respect of the local financial year next following that in which the decision to grant the remission is made and in respect of each of the next nine local financial years.</P>
