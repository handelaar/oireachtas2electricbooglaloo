      <P>Under sub-section (6) of Section 6 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, the stamp duty on conveyances and leases was reduced from 5 per cent. to 1 per cent. in the case of houses qualifying for a grant under the main provisions of that section. This relief operates where the house is purchased by an Irish national and where the relevant document has endorsed on it a certificate under the seal of the Minister for Local Government that a grant under the section <Col N="1118" /> will be made to the purchaser when the house is occupied by him.</P>
      <P>The general reduction in stamp duty from 5 per cent. to 3 per cent. provided for in this year's Finance Bill will come into operation on 1st August, 1951.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that portions of carcases of cattle sent to knackers for disposal are being sold for human consumption.  For the purpose of taking appropriate steps under the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, for the prevention of the sale of contaminated meat to the public, I would welcome any information which the Deputy may be in a position to furnish in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister realises the seriousness of the implications involved in this question?  I assure the Minister that, with the prices of meat at their present levels, there is considerable temptation to salvage considerable portions of these carcases and sell them for human consumption. Will the Minister take such steps as are open to him to direct the attention of his veterinary inspectors or the officials of local authorities to the necessity for supervising knackers' premises, so as to ensure that no contaminated meat is sold to the public, and will he also make it clear that anybody caught trading in the sale of this potentially contaminated meat will have the full rigour of the law enforced against him?</P>

The band, which is administered by a committee under the control of the Commissioner, is permitted to accept engagements to play at social and sporting functions of various <Col N="1123" /> kinds, but the use of the band in connection with commercial advertising is, I think, to be deprecated.

      <P>I am aware that a deduction of 10d. a day from some 61 married personnel, living locally with their families, was made on the 23rd February, 1951.  This sum was intended to meet the extra cost to married or single personnel who might find it necessary to engage lodgings.  The position is that, on the examination of the allowances for the purpose of the readjustment mentioned, it was found that the existing regulations enabled the 61 men referred to to receive the same allowance (4/1 a day) as men living in lodgings.  As that allowance contained an element in respect of the cost of lodgings, it would have been inappropriate that they should continue to draw it, and they were placed on the appropriate allowance of 3/3 a day.</P>

I may add that many people do not know when an Act of Parliament is passed and if, therefore, the Minister considered extending the period by a short Act, everybody in the House would be indebted to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the duty of a Minister to consider every aspect of a problem, but the very fact of giving an assurance that such a matter would be considered sometimes carries the implication that an amending Act would be introduced and I must say that I am not in a position to give any such assurance.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> In proposing this motion, I would not like any Deputy to think that this is a move by the Government to stifle discussion on the Estimates.  Far from it. The position is simply this.  The Government was anxious to complete all business by Thursday, 19th, and I got in touch with the Whips of various Parties to see if agreement could be reached.  As a result, it was suggested that a meeting of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges should be called to discuss the matter.  The meeting was held last Thursday and a programme was drawn up and agreed to. The programme was based on the assumption that the Agriculture group of Estimates would be completed on Thursday.  This did not materialise and it is now proposed to give two more hours to complete them, otherwise the programme, as agreed to, is the same.</P>
    <P>The matter is now entirely one for the House to decide but in view of the fact that it is an agreed programme I am sure that, with the wholehearted co-operation of the members, there will be little difficulty in carrying it into effect.</P>
    <P>I should mention that sittings on Thursday, 12th, and Thursday week, 19th, would be from 10.30 a.m. to 5 p.m.  If necessary an extension of sitting may, by agreement, be arranged for Thursday, 19th.</P>

      <P>In view of the arrangement which the House has just <Col N="1138" /> arrived at concerning the allocation of time for the debates on the remaining Estimates, including Agriculture, it is not my intention to detain the House to any great extent now.  On the last occasion on which I was speaking on this Estimate I referred to the strong criticism which came from the Fianna Fáil Party regarding the Danish butter. That criticism was to be heard from every Fianna Fáil platform, and it was used as a weapon against the former Minister for Agriculture.  It was said that the butter industry had dropped to a very low level in this country and that butter was being imported which was distasteful to our people.  That butter was described in many different ways on the Fianna Fáil platforms. Even from the Minister's own platform in his constituency of Kilkenny-Carlow, the question of the importation of Danish butter by the outgoing Minister for Agriculture was used as a weapon against that Minister and the matter was regarded by the Fianna Fáil spokesmen as being of paramount importance.  I should like the Minister or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party to tell us what objection they had to eating Danish butter.  Is it not true that for years we have been endeavouring to make butter in this country on the same lines as the Danes make it&mdash; and even better, if possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not further true that the real difference between our butter and Danish butter is that the Danes make their butter from ripe cream&mdash;in other words, sour cream&mdash;and that we make our butter from sweet cream?  I understand that, as an experiment, the Danes manufacture butter from sweet cream and that it is identical with ours.  I fail to see justification for the very serious objection which was raised in regard to Danish butter.  Is it not a fact that very recently&mdash;since the Minister took office&mdash;the Danes have been asked to carry out a further experiment in the manufacture of butter from sweet cream and that they have been requested to depart from the manner in which they make their butter now from ripe cream or sour cream?  I should much prefer to see Danish butter in this country than to go back again to the days when Fianna <Col N="1139" /> Fáil provided our households with a 2-oz. ration per person.  I hope we will never go back to those days again.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to repeat in any way my protest against the stupidity of the Minister in permitting the price of butter to be increased on the poorer sections of our community.  During the past week-end, the chairman of the Council of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers stated that on the 23rd June he received a telegram from the Minister stating that he was prepared to receive a deputation to discuss milk prices.  The chairman further stated that after the meeting the Minister went into the Dáil and disclosed the new price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny it absolutely and completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I expect, will also deny that it was the civil servants who increased the price of butter.  I am very glad to see that he has taken full responsibility for that action on himself now.  I hope that what I fear will not come to reality.  I hope that the Minister's Department is not going to run by itself and that the civil servants will not have complete control.  I am very proud and pleased to hear now that the statement made to the effect that it was the civil servants who increased the price of butter on the poor and provided an increase <Col N="1140" /> in the price for milk to the dairy farmers is not true and that it was the Minister who did so.  The Minister has also assured this House that he did not remain deadly silent during the interview which was mentioned at a recent meeting of the creamery milk suppliers in Limerick.  I am very pleased the Minister has taken this opportunity of denying these charges. If what the Minister says is true, and if his statement is to be accepted, I think that an apology should be forthcoming with the least possible delay from Mr. Fletcher and from those who made that statement concerning the Minister.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate to this House what plans he has in mind for the development of agriculture?  Can the Minister indicate what other plan he has in mind besides the complete elimination of black pigs?  Does the Minister himself take the responsibility of ending for all time the population of black pigs in this country&mdash;or is he throwing that responsibility on the civil servants?  I should be very pleased to hear now whether the decision to eliminate the black pig from this country was made by civil servants or whether it is just another crazy idea which we would expect to come from the people at present occupying the Government Benches.  When the Minister comes to give us his reasons for the elimination of the black pig from this country, there is one thing that we can safely say and that is that the Minister finds himself in the position of having to admit that there are pigs in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been supplies of pigs for the past three years.  The Minister can recall the days&mdash;his colleague, the present Minister for Local Government, was then Minister for Agriculture&mdash;when bacon in this city and country was only a memory.  There were ample supplies of bacon and pigs were plentiful in the past three years. That must be admitted.  What plans has the Minister and what statement will he make, when concluding this debate, to indicate that there will be no shortage of bacon at reasonable prices for the people of Dublin?  Will he give a guarantee that in the years <Col N="1141" /> ahead there will be ample supplies of bacon for everyone who requires it?</P>
    <P>I should like to know what changes the Minister has in mind concerning the land rehabilitation project.  I should have expected, and anyone would have expected, in view of the opposition that came from this side of the House when Fianna Fáil were in opposition that one of the first acts they would perform would be to eliminate completely the land rehabilitation project despite the fact that it was denied that members of the Fianna Fáil Party bitterly criticised the scheme and warned smallholders and others that if they availed of the land rehabilitation project their rents, rates and taxes would go up sky high.</P>
    <P>I should be very pleased to hear what alterations the Minister proposes to make in that scheme in view of the fact that one of the first statements he made at a meeting of the Carlow Committee of Agriculture was that the scheme was a good one but required alterations.  We are entitled to know what alterations he proposes to make in that connection.  We are entitled to know what the Minister's beliefs are so far as the scheme is concerned.  Will the Minister tell the House it was a bad scheme or will he tell the House that it is a good scheme and one which should be encouraged and developed? I would be very anxious to hear from the Minister in that connection.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister read the debates on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture when he was on this side of the House?  Apart from reading his own speech, which will be distasteful to him, has the Minister read the speech made by Deputy Moran, the Deputy from South Mayo?  Has the Minister ascertained how many cattle died in South Mayo and has he ascertained the cause of death of those cattle?  Deputy Moran said in this House six weeks ago that every second beast was falling dead in South Mayo.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Minister is going to do for the small farmers in South Mayo in this connection.  I should like to know whether his advisers have now informed him that <Col N="1142" /> not one beast was lost in Mayo; that the statement made by Deputy Moran was a personal statement and a personal attack on Deputy Dillon, the previous Minister for Agriculture; and that there was no foundation whatsoever for the allegations concerning the imaginary, deplorable conditions that existed in South Mayo.  I think it is only right that the Minister should present the House with the facts concerning that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Finally, might I ask the Minister to give effect to one of the 17 points, that a measure of co-operation would be provided and support given to develop agriculture?  The only one real measure of support in that connection would be to know what the Minister is prepared to do in regard to making loans available to small farmers at cheap rates of interest.  It is unnecessary to remind the House that the farming community are a community upon which very great demands are made.  They have now to face an increase in the rates of pay of agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to know that the Minister has the question of wheat prices under review and that in the next few weeks he will make an announcement concerning an increase in the price per barrel of wheat.  In order to assist the farmers to pay the increased rates of pay given to the agricultural workers&mdash;rates of pay which should be further increased&mdash;I hope that no time will be lost in having an announcement made to increase the price per barrel for wheat, oats and barley.  I hope also that an announcement will be made substantially increasing the prices per ton for beet. I want to be helpful to the Minister. In view of the ever rising cost of living and in view also of the increased cost for the carrying out of repairs to agricultural machinery, I hope the Minister will take steps to ensure that the prices of all agricultural products will be increased forthwith.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to make some announcement, one which would be welcomed by the majority of small farmers, concerning what financial scheme he has in mind to enable small farmers to stock their lands. Does the Minister still expect small <Col N="1143" /> farmers to have recourse to the Agricultural Credit Corporation or has the Minister any alternative scheme in mind?  When a farmer is applying to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan either to assist him in the purchase of live stock or in purchase of machinery, one of the first questions on the application form concerns how much money he has in the bank.  Does not the Minister consider that to be a very silly question to ask a farmer who is applying for a loan?  I hope so far as the Agricultural Credit Corporation is concerned that we will have a completely reconstructed and more generous scheme whereby small farmers will be able to obtain loans.  I hope that the red tape which existed there will be eliminated so far as loans of this kind are concerned.  We all know that the banks are very slow to give money to small farmers.  The very same guarantees required by the banks are also required by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Does not the Minister consider it to be very humiliating for a small farmer to have to request his neighbours to sign bank bills?  The very same type of procedure exists so far as the Agricultural Credit Corporation is concerned.  The same guarantors have to be provided before the farmer can get a loan, even for the purchase of a cow.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was on this side of the House he and his colleagues criticised the inter-Party Government for not completely relieving the plight of the small farmer who they said was prevented from taking part in the drive for increased food owing to the lack of capital.  Now that Deputy Walsh is Minister for Agriculture, I hope he will take steps to have this deplorable grievance of the small farmers remedied and that an announcement will be made indicating that loans will be made available for all small farmers who require them for the purpose of restocking their lands and assisting them to purchase machinery. It is quite true to say that loans, on which interest at 4 per cent. is charged, are made available by the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the purchase of <Col N="1144" /> live stock, manures, seeds, machinery and implements.  It is quite true to say that loans are available for the the erection of dwelling-houses, hay barns and other farm outbuildings.  We all know that those loans are available, but they are wrapped up in such coils of red tape that it is impossible for the farmers to get at them.  The loans are there on paper for the farmers to see, but when farmers go to obtain the loans they have the utmost difficulty in obtaining them.  Will the Minister undertake to cut completely the red tape which is standing in the way of farmers availing of the present loan system of the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  It might be very interesting to know that the Agricultural Credit Corporation work completely independent of the Minister's Department and independent of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>That is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that.  I should like to know from the Minister the number of applications which were made for loans in recent months and the number which were refused.  I know very well that it is large.  I know very well that in my constituency, and I am glad that Deputy Davin is present to vouch for the accuracy of what I am about to say, in the Luggacurran electoral area of County Laoighis the farmers availed of a scheme sponsored by a former Minister for Agriculture following on the very bad summer some years ago.  This scheme came to the rescue of the farmers by making loans available to them, and the farmers availed of the scheme.  Some of them found some difficulty in making the payments on the date required but, on the whole, they were decent, honest men and they kept their word.  They paid their instalments as promptly as they possibly could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, some of these farmers are in the Minister's own constituency in the Castlecomer area of North Kilkenny in the parishes of Doonane and Tolerton and in the coal-mining district of Laoighis.  These farmers have reached a stage at which they require some further financial assistance.  They <Col N="1145" /> have not yet completely paid off all the instalments under the scheme I mentioned earlier.  What steps will the Minister take to come to the rescue of the small farmers who now require loans?  I hope these people will be enabled to secure loans at a lower rate of interest than 4½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I think it is bad policy on the part of the Government and the Minister, who profess themselves anxious to relieve the plight of the small farmer and anxious to encourage agricultural production, to leave these farmers in the position in which they find themselves at the moment.  I think the first step that should be taken is to provide money for those farmers who need it in order to produce food for man and beast.  I think that money should be provided at a much lower rate of interest and, if possible, free of interest. I make no apology for advocating loans free of interest for farmers who want to increase production or improve live stock.</P>
    <P>To what greater advantage could money be spent if not in improving the productivity of our land?  Some of the millions that are lying idle should be put into production and should be given to those people who are engaged in our most important industry working on the land.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear from the Minister what plans he has for the development of agriculture.  In what way can he improve on the great work done by his predecessor?  I am glad the Minister realises that he has now to follow in the footsteps of the best Minister for Agriculture in Europe, Deputy James Dillon.  As Minister for Agriculture, I hope the present occupant of the post will enjoy the best of health during his period in office and that that period will be short and brief and that it will not be long until we have again in that position that Minister for Agriculture who succeeded in putting agriculture on the map.  No man ever did as much as Deputy James Dillon did.  No man ever had the interests of the farming community so deeply at heart as Deputy James Dillon had.  I hope it will not be many months before we again have Deputy James Dillon where we want him, <Col N="1146" /> helping the farmers to progress and to advance their industry towards the status we would all like to see a flourishing agriculture enjoying in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>When the present Minister for Agriculture was a Deputy on this side of the House he did not, perhaps, visualise how rapid his promotion would be.  Possibly he was carrying out the plans of the council of perfection of Fianna Fáil when he said while in opposition that he did not believe in the land rehabilitation project and that he thought the arable land should be improved before we proceeded towards the conversion of the scrub-lands.  He mentioned fertilisers in that connection. He was very anxious about fertilisers. It was not just prior to the dissolution that he mentioned fertilisers; he mentioned them on several occasions while occupying these benches.</P>
      <P>Has his promotion, like good or bad wine, gone to his head?  Has he forgotten that there is such a word as &ldquo;fertiliser&rdquo;?  In answer to a Parliamentary question of mine on 28th June, at column 747 of Volume 126 of Official Report, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have not yet had an opportunity of going closely into the matter, and I am not therefore in a position to state when, if ever, a subsidy will be given to farmers for fertilisers.  It will nevertheless be clear to the Deputy that as no provision has been made in the Estimates for such a subsidy it is very unlikely that any can be paid this year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a practical farmer, I dare say the Minister is aware that certain lands require fertilisers particularly for the production of grass in the months of November and December.  He is equally well aware that only a Supplementary Estimate can be introduced here between now and this time 12 months.  I remember a scheme which the present Minister flaunted when he was in opposition in relation to fertilising arable land so as to put it into production.  The Minister has said that no provision is made in this year's Estimate.  Was provision made for the recent increase in the price of milk, an <Col N="1147" /> increase which will have the effect of doubling the profit about which the present Minister for Education, Deputy Seán Moylan, when in opposition, stated at column 125, Volume 1573 of Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some 130,000 cwt. of butter, if my anticipation in regard to production is reasonably sound, will be produced from October to May and, without any advance in the price of milk, the return to the Exchequer from this, as a result of the advance in the price of butter, will be £121,000.  Deduct from this sum the £75,000 paid for summer milk by the Exchequer and we discover the net profit on the transaction to the Exchequer is £46,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we double that by a simple mathematical calculation, we get £92,000. Why not put the £92,000 now into fertilisers? Would that not be a constructive policy?  Would that not enhance the land and give us a good grass crop?  I know many people are not in favour of grass.  Some people were much more in favour of tillage when they were in opposition.  The Minister, as a Minister, knows now that it is not treason to grow grass.  It is not treachery to the nation to grow grass.  If the Minister retains his present ministerial rank, I would like to take him down to Castlecomer and make him swallow the statement he made here on one occasion.  I had a better opinion of the Minister at one time.  Whatever else he had not, I thought he had guts.</P>

      <P>It was a slip.  I would like to hear from the Minister with relation to this famous statement made by Mr. Fletcher, chairman of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, that he was in conference with the Minister an hour before he made the statement in this House, and that the price <Col N="1148" /> of milk was increased by a decision of officials in the Civil Service.  I know very well that the price of milk was increased as a result of political expediency. They had to do something to cool off Fletcher, Barry and Feely or if not they would become rampant again.  They did not intend that their organisation should be allowed to slip. There are something about 670,000 dairy cows in the country and they rake in 1/- a cow.

If I am not making a mistake, the Minister did not see one of these costings.  He just said 1/6, without giving any deliberation to it, a price that, as Deputy T. Walsh, he said on this side of the House was an uneconomic price.  How does the Minister reconcile allowing only an increase of 1d. per gallon when according to the Minister for Education, speaking when he was plain Deputy Moylan, there was a profit of £46,000 made by Deputy Dillon on that transaction when he increased butter by 1d. per lb.?  At the moment the present Administration is going to make a profit of £92,000 on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>How did the Minister find the extra money to pay for the milk if there was no provision made for it in the Estimates?  If he can find that money, he should also be able to find money for fertilisers.  Here is a statement for the month of May in respect of a small farmer who had only three cows: Milk received, 2,376 lb., test 3.7; butter fat, 88 lb., price 1/5.39, separated milk, 3½d. per gallon.  This farmer received a cheque for £17 19s. 11d. for three cows for the month of May, apart from supplying the needs of his own household and selling a share of the milk.  In face of that can the Minister say that the dairy farmers of Munster and most of the creameries are serving a dual purpose? If they are not manufacturing cheese, if they are not manufacturing chocolate crumb or powdered milk, they are sending supplies to the creameries which are manufacturing them and are getting the benefit of the extra price.  Any farmer who can get 1/8 per gallon for milk in the month of May is not so badly off, but when the Minister was over here as Deputy T. Walsh, that price, according to him, was not sufficient.  We had a statement by that irresponsible individual from East Cork, Deputy Corry, that we should raise the price of milk to 2/10. The only costings of any consequence the Minister has in his Department are the costings of the Mitchelstown creameries under the directorship of Professor Murphy, which show a figure of 11.94d. taken over the year.  The Minister has officials at his disposal to <Col N="1150" /> find out what the cost of production in summer time would be like.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear of the extermination Order made the other day by the Minister in respect to the black pig.  Apart from the value of the black pig as a source of food, there is a sentimental or traditional value attached to him.  I remember when I was pretty young, imbued with a certain amount of principles, I read that the fight for freedom would be finished and that freedom would be attained in the valley of the black pig.  We have not attained full freedom yet but the Minister decides to exterminate the black pig.  I would ask the Minister at least to leave one in the valley and not do away with all of them.  I do not know exactly what his value would be as a bacon pig.  I know something about the large White York from the point of view of bacon production.  He is the best pig that can be produced in this country from the point of view of the seller.  I know very little as I say about the black pig, apart from what I have read, but I would appeal to the Minister not to exterminate him entirely, if only for sentimental considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the campaign&mdash;a scandalous campaign to say the least of it&mdash; which was carried on in regard to the foreign butter which was coming into this country, certain people maliciously defamed our rival producers in other countries.  If the Minister for Agriculture knows anything about butter he will know, as Deputy Flanagan said, that it is only a matter of processing. A different method of processing is used in other countries from that which is used here.  In Denmark the butter is manufactured from sour cream; so is all the farmers' butter here manufactured out of sour cream.  I dare say the Minister knows that.  There was propaganda about yellow butter radiated from this House which percolated throughout the whole country.  I ask the Minister now does he intend to import more of this yellow butter, because a lot of people who swallowed the propaganda about the butter are very anxious now to get that butter again&mdash;even Dublin people.  I thought that we should be above using that <Col N="1151" /> scandalous type of propaganda against two countries that are in competition with us in the manufacture of butter. Perhaps when negotiating a trade agreement with countries outside these two there may be repercussions on account of the attitude adopted here by an irresponsible Opposition which was only imbued with one intention, namely, to try and get back to the other side of the House as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister is it his intention to maintain the 8 oz. butter ration for the winter and is it his intenton to maintain the present 12 oz. ration which milk suppliers are at present getting twice monthly from the Mitchelstown creamery.  The butter is not sold <i>ad lib</i> as it was sold when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture at 3/8 a lb.  It is now 4/-. Farmers who supply milk get two rations of 12 oz. per month.  I cannot understand how a creamery like the Mitchelstown creamery can only afford to give a ration of 12 oz. of butter to milk suppliers.  In answer to a question of mine in this House to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to whether a new building at Mitchelstown creamery was for a cheese factory or a bacon factory, I was told that owing to the increased export trade for cheese the creamery had asked permission to forego the bacon factory and make it a cheese factory.  If that is so, I should like to know why this creamery is confining the milk suppliers to a 12 oz. ration of butter and if we are exporting all our cheese to feed John Bull.  If we are, that is treachery.  I think that the accusation which the Minister made from this side of the House will act like a boomerang&mdash;he accused Deputy Dillon of treason&mdash;if we are going to send our milk products to feed an alien race and allow the children of tender age in Deputy Cowan's constituency to develop rickets for want of fats.  I should like to know what is the Minister's intention with regard to that.  Is he going to maintain the 12 oz. ration for the milk suppliers all the year round?  I shall conclude by giving the Minister <Col N="1152" /> one piece of advice and that is to make the following morning offering: &ldquo;I will not wilfully offend or easily be offended; for what I have done I will make amends and put up with what cannot be amended.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to refer to the Estimate in general as I am aware that there is an arrangement that it should be concluded within a certain time.  There is, however, one matter which is of very urgent importance to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. We in the dairying areas were considerably perturbed over the week-end when we read in the newspapers that a section of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association intends to take strike action as from next Saturday afternoon. A month ago notice was served to this effect and, failing an agreement being come to, we believe that this is now to take effect as from the 14th instant.  I would draw the attention of the Minister and the House to the fact that an area of three counties is affected by this from which 240,000 gallons of milk are supplied daily to the Dairy Disposal Company, and that if the strike takes place it will entail in one single week a loss of £16,500. This would represent for one week alone a butter ration for 1,260,000 persons which indicates the gravity of the situation, and I would ask the Minister to see that conciliation machinery is set up with the utmost despatch in <Col N="1153" /> order to prevent this strike taking place.  The greatest of goodwill has obtained between these creamery managers and the milk suppliers in these areas, and it would be a pity if anything should arise which would throw the whole of that important section of the agricultural industry into chaos.</P>
      <P>It will be readily appreciated that farmers cannot keep over this commodity and that it is vitally important that the Minister should take prompt action to see that some conciliation machinery is set up to deal with this very urgent matter.</P>

      <P>I notice that the city population were not at all favourably disposed to an increase in the price of butter.  That was due to propaganda indulged in by the Opposition. It is hardly fair or reasonable.  I would ask the Minister if possible to see that loans will be available to farmers at a lower rate of interest.  It may appear strange, after the activities of the best Minister in the world, but it is a fact that farmers are not at all in the strong position that we were led to believe they were in.  Agricultural production has fallen very considerably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1949.  That is another argument to show that the ex-Minister was not as efficient as many members of the Opposition try to persuade us that he was.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider that point.  Farmers will need money at a lower rate of interest.  Their overhead costs have increased very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to decide on the policy that will be pursued as regards live stock.  Most farmer Deputies are aware that in the last three, four or five years there has been a very considerable number of inferior cattle at all the fairs.  I do not attribute that to Deputy Dillon's activities. By 1 o'clock in the day almost 30 per cent. of the cattle at the fair is unsaleable. There is a number of very poor calves.  That is due, not to the fact that there was no hay but to the fact that there is something wrong with the breeding.  Some time or other we must decide whether we will pursue a policy of exportation of high-class store cattle or a policy of milk production.  I do not think that we will be able to carry on the two things together efficiently <Col N="1155" /> because a very large percentage of the young stock reaching Meath and other midland counties is extremely inferior and, owing to the arrangement that the ex-Minister made with the British, we have reached the stage when there is very definite high-class grading of cattle.  The result is that nothing but the very best is purchased.  Few cattle reach the top grade.  Unfortunately, most of our cattle are only second grade and the price given for that grade is generally the price for exportable cattle.  Therefore, I would urge on the Minister that he should very carefully consider that aspect of the problem.  I say that from a national point of view. Our trade deficit is gradually creeping up and if the cattle trade could be increased, if we had more high-class stock to sell, that deficit would be reduced.  As we stand at present, the deficit is on the increase and that means that the outlook is extremely bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express a hope that the Minister will not do away with any of the existing schemes that were started by his predecessor, particularly the land rehabilitation project and the development schemes proposed for Connemara.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points I would like to urge on the Minister relating to exports.  The development of the export trade is vital to our economy. No export trade which is dependent entirely on one market can ever be satisfactory.  I think it is within the power of the Department of Agriculture and of the Minister to foster very specially the development of an export trade to countries other than Britain. In present world conditions there is a market for agricultural produce, particularly carcase meat, and also for shell fish, outside the British market. I know that fishing has always been more or less the cinderella of the Department of Agriculture but I would urge on the Minister the importance of developing the export trade in shell fish both to the United States and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the development of the carcase meat export trade I would suggest <Col N="1156" /> to the Minister that one of the first essentials is the provision of at least two medium-sized refrigerator ships that could maintain a regular service between the ports of Dublin and Waterford and Bristol and London. I know that there had been some negotiations before the change of Government as to the provision of such ships.  I would urge the Minister to pursue the possibilities to their uttermost limit.  It is only by the provision of a regular service of this kind that it will be possible to develop a substantial export trade in carcase meat. The development of the carcase meat trade is, of course, important to us by reason of the by-products.  We suffer from a permanent shortage of hides; we have to import hides, which seems anomalous having regard to our exports of cattle.  The development of a carcase meat export trade would enable us to, at least, provide a larger proportion of our requirements in hides and also their by-products.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  The Minister will, no doubt, be aware that under the E.C.A. agreement there is a counterpart fund consisting of grant moneys.  The last Government had considered the allocation of, at least, a proportion of these sums.  One project which had been more or less generally agreed to was the provision of an agricultural or central agricultural institute, and also of extension courses.  Quite a substantial sum of money had been earmarked for that purpose.  This is a long-term policy, a long-term policy which, I think, would benefit the country and the agricultural population generally.  I would, therefore, urge on the Minister the wisdom of pursuing the plans which had been made in that direction.  I know, of course, that there are a great many difficulties.  I also know that, naturally, when there is a large sum of money which is available free, all the different Departments are inclined to vie with each other in order to obtain the largest share of the money which is thus available.  I trust that the Minister will fight his own corner in order to ensure that a sufficient sum will be made available from the E.C.A. grant counterpart fund for <Col N="1157" /> the provision of a central agricultural institute, such institute being, of course, independent of the Government and of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter I want to refer to.  It is in relation to the increase in the price of butter. Deputy Keane, a few moments ago, said that there had been a lot of propaganda by the Opposition in relation to the price of butter.</P>

      <P>I remember seeing a half-page advertisement in all the newspapers of this country, the daily newspapers, the weekly newspapers and the provincial newspapers, two days before the general election, a half-page advertisement of a housewife, quite a good-looking housewife, but perhaps not a very typical one. She had well-painted finger-nails, she had a worried expression on her face, she had a notebook in front of her and a pencil in her hand, and she was sketching on her forehead with the pencil.  This was an advertisement published by the Fianna Fáil Party about rising prices.  One of the first items on that advertisement was butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Within four weeks of the publication of that advertisement, as soon as the public had been properly <Col N="1158" /> carted by the advertisement, the first act of the Fianna Fáil Government was to increase the price of butter, though they had published and had spent, I would say, not less than £20,000 on the publication of that half-page advertisement in every newspaper in the country, telling the people that Fianna Fáil were against an increase in the price of butter, and that if they did not vote for Fianna Fáil the price of butter would, in fact, be increased. Butter was the first item in the left-hand corner of that advertisement, printed in large block letters.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister should really engage in a discussion on that issue.  I think there is no answer to it.  I think it was a dishonest piece of propaganda, having regard to the action of the Government since.  I think that the Minister is a decent man, and I do not think that he should approve of methods of that kind.  I think that, instead of interrupting or trying to justify it, he should acknowledge that it was wrong, but that circumstances forced him to increase the price of butter.  It is a type of action which, I think, is bad for public life generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention to some extracts from a summary of the National Nutrition Survey which were given by Deputy Derrig in the House some time ago. The information which he gave was taken from page 16, paragraphs 3 and 5, of the Summary and Findings of the National Nutrition Survey.  The first states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The deficiency in calcium was mainly due to low consumption of milk and cheese.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was one.  Another was as regards children in Dublin:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The main defects of the diets were an insufficient intake of milk and lack of variety among the poorer and larger families.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that an increase in the price of butter, and an increase in the price of milk with, I expect, a consequent increase in the price of cheese, is going to help the poorer and the larger families in the cities and towns of Ireland?  Does he think it right that, if money is going to be given to the farmers, it should be given at the expense of the lives of the children of working people?  Does he not know that he now has a colleague on that side of the House, Deputy Dr. Browne, who has been appealing for sufficient fats, milks and foods for the working people of this country so that they might not contract tuberculosis? Had it not been thrown at the same Deputy Dr. Browne across this House, when he was in the Clann na Poblachta Party, that it was his case that malnutrition was the cause of the troubles of the people of Ireland?  In view of that, how can the Minister stand up and talk of broken promises when the working people in the City of Dublin who, admittedly, are already undernourished in milks and cheese, will <Col N="1161" /> have to face in April, 1952, as a result of an Order made by him, a further increase of 4d. per gallon?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the very same survey pointed out that a child under 15 years of age needed two pints of milk per day, that an expectant, or nursing, mother needed two pints of milk per day and that an adult needed one pint of milk per day?  It would not take a very great mathematician to work out what is the annual levy that the family has to pay by way, not of cash, but of reduction of their consumption of butter and milk so that the promises made by the Fianna Fáil Government to the farmers of this country could be kept.  I would prefer, and all the Deputies listening to me would prefer, that we should pay the farmers of this country as fair a price and as high a price as possible for milk.  I believe that the solution of the farmers' difficulty is not in an increased price, which would be reflected in the increased price of butter, but in better production by adopting the method advocated by the previous Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the gradual substitution of the 500-gallon cow for the present 350- or 400-gallon one.  If we in the industrial world seek an increase, we are told that we have reached the peak and that if we need further money to improve our standard of living we must produce more.  Should not the same be said of the farmer?  Should it not be pointed out to him that he is working with the tools of his grandparents and that only by modernising his farm, by employing up-to-date methods and by improving his herd can he win for himself and for his family their just entitlement&mdash;a fair living?</P>
    <P>I feel that I have justified my position as a Labour Deputy by the above remarks.  However, there is one point of local importance in my constituency to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  That is in connection with the export, or the sale on the home market, of very early potatoes.  In Ballinacourty, Dungarvan, early epicures are grown for the export market in Great Britain.  Smallholders endeavour very hard to make a living on a very limited amount of land by growing these potatoes.  This year, due <Col N="1162" /> to the late season, these people found that when their crop had come to maturity there was a very limited time left during which the export market in Great Britain was open.  They appealed to the Minister to use his good offices with the British Government with a view to extending that period.  That was done, and I desire to give full credit to the Minister for his action. Unfortunately, the extension was insufficient and it was found that, due to no fault of this Government, but because of circumstances over which they had no control, the main bulk of the early potato crop was left in the hands of those small farmers.  I suggest that, in future years, steps should be taken by the Government to guarantee at least a minimum price for homegrown early potatoes.  I find it difficult to believe, in view of the price charged for potatoes in Dublin shops at the present time, that, if the Government had purchased the surplus potatoes from the growers in Ballinacourty, they could not readily have found a market for them in Dublin or in the vicinity of Dublin.  This transaction would have entailed very little loss for the Government and would have proved a considerable saving to the inhabitants of Dublin.  I appeal to the Minister to plan in future years so that the potato growers of Ballinacourty and similar areas such as Rush will at least be assured of the minimum price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House very long, nor do I intend to go into much detail.  I would, first of all, like, as the youngest member of the Minister's Party, to congratulate him from a very full heart on taking over the Department of Agriculture.  I would further like to congratulate him for taking full cognisance of the plight of the dairy farmers and for his generous effort to meet them by giving them a very necessary increase for a very necessary product, namely, milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go into detail, but I believe the Minister is conscious he has taken over a very important Department. He has taken over our main artery, so to speak, in taking over the Department of Agriculture. <Col N="1163" /> I have no doubt that under his leadership the Department of Agriculture will flourish and will operate to the advantage of all sections of our people.  I am sure it is the object of all members of this House to bring about adjustments that will generally raise the living standards of all sections of our people.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community is the backbone of this nation, and if all other sections are to flourish it is necessary that every effort should be made to put the agricultural community in a prosperous position.  I have no doubt that that will happen under the leadership of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>We all have the desire to improve our lot generally as a people.  Many ways are suggested towards this end. In my short span I have heard many false doctrines preached in an attempt to convince people that it can be attained by certain ways.  In my view there is only one avenue open to us if we are to endeavour seriously to attain that end.  That avenue is open to the Minister for Agriculture by making the people engaged on the land more prosperous and, by price inducement, enabling them to step-up their production.  If we are to make ourselves better off we can only do so by more production per man per acre.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask the Minister, by his policy as Minister for Agriculture, to induce agricultural workers, and the farmers by attractive prices, to produce more.  I have heard revised monetary systems expounded, false doctrines, and have seen printing presses brought into play, and so on. Nevertheless, I do say there is only one avenue&mdash;more production per man per acre.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to discharge his duties effectively, he must get the co-operation of all sections of this House.  It is only with the co-operation of all members that the desired goal can be attained.  I am confident that such co-operation will be forthcoming from the younger members in particular. I have purposely refrained from speaking here on a few occasions on certain items because of the strained <Col N="1164" /> atmosphere that existed.  Excuses can be put forward on behalf of the older members that cannot be tendered for us.  I, therefore, as a younger member, confidently appeal to the younger members to give their wholehearted co-operation to the Minister in his very difficult task.  As I have said, the Department of Agriculture is the most important Department of our State.  I have no doubt that, with the policy and the leadership of Deputy Walsh, not alone will the farming community gain but the whole people of Ireland, as a community, will benefit by his exertions in the very near future.  I congratulate him and wish him a long life and a very successful one as Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Dublin representative, I could not allow the opportunity to pass without voicing my protest on behalf of the people of Dublin against the increase in price of butter brought about by the increase in the price of milk.  One of my colleagues on the Labour Benches quoted from the report of the nutritional survey which was presented to this House some time ago and which we read with alarm.  It told us that the children of the working classes were not getting sufficient milk or butter and the increase in the price of milk, and consequent increase in the price of butter, is not going to ease the situation or bring about the improvements which that report would desire to have brought about.  Before the elections, the members of the Government made a very vicious attack on the inter-Party Government on the ground that the cost of living was going up every day, but the first action of the Minister on getting into office was to increase the price of butter on the people.  It will have a very serious effect on the people, because it is an increase in the cost of living and I think it is a wrong action.  The country was led to believe by advertisement, speeches and innuendo that the new Government was going to reduce the cost of living.  Instead, their first move &mdash;evidently in fulfilment of a promise to somebody; who it is, I do not know, but they were very quick to fulfil the promise&mdash;was to increase the price of milk in order to hold these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> The schoolmeals committee of Dublin City give out 45,000 small bottles of milk and 45,000 sandwiches per day, and the sandwiches are buttered.  The committee has recently been informed that they will not get the subsidised flour in the sandwiches they give to these children.  That, again, is an increased expense on the ratepayers because the municipal authority, of which many Deputies are members, will not reduce the supply of sandwiches or milk which is given to children attending these schools.  The sandwiches made from subsidised flour should continue to be given.</P>
    <P>This is the last opportunity for fully three months that any member of the House will have of talking about butter, milk or meat, because the House is adjourning until the end of October within a week or so, and what I am afraid of is that during the adjournment, when the people will have nobody to voice their claims or grievances something will happen in the shape of further increases.  There is a particular matter which is causing a good deal of worry to butchers in the City of Dublin.  They have to go to the market and buy meat at prices which enable them to sell at the controlled price, and these prices are going up every day.  The butchers say they cannot continue to sell unless the Government step in and buy.  If the Government would appoint agents to go to the market and buy cattle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some questions were raised to which I intend to try to reply, not in any great detail, but so far as I can.  Deputy Rooney raised a question about the export of horses.  The export of horses, either alive or in carcase form, is a very difficult and thorny question. If they are sent out in carcase form, it means technicians and more <Col N="1168" /> equipment, but this is a matter I intend to examine.  He also raised the question of hides.  The differential he has mentioned here, from 10d. to 4/6 is quite right&mdash;35 pence.  There is a big gap there, but the amount of money got from hides and carcase beef is helping to bridge that gap.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne mentioned the price of milk being increased in April, 1952, by 4d. a gallon.  That is wrong.  There has been an adjustment of price regarding April but it will not affect the consumer in any way.  That is a matter between the consumer and the wholesaler.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister assure the House it will not be passed on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not.  The adjustment of price will not permit it to be passed on.</P>
      <P>Regarding ware potatoes being sent to the alcohol factories, an arrangement has been made whereby the farmers will get an increased price, which will be determined at the end of the season when the transport and other costs are taken into account and a flat rate will be given.</P>
      <P>The egg and poultry prices depend on agreements made with England.  At the moment, our officials are in England negotiating a price.  I would remind Deputies that when Deputy Dillon was on this side of the House he neglected to make any agreement for 1952.  The present agreement terminates in January, 1952, but no provision had been made for the sale of eggs or poultry, or even old hens, in 1952.  We are making agreements and will try to make better ones than were made heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the price of milk, Deputies on that side must remember the attitude of Fianna Fáil, not now but 12 months ago.  There is nothing political in this question and it is not one of political expediency.  Twelve months ago, a motion was put down here by Deputy Cogan and Deputy O'Reilly, that an increased price be given.  I argued from that side of the House then that the price should be increased&mdash;so also did other Deputies &mdash;and we tried to convince the Minister <Col N="1169" /> of that time that an increase was justified. We went so far as to walk into the Lobby to vote for the increase. Prior to the election and during it, we promised the farmers that if we were returned&mdash;not to office, as we did not know at the time, prior to the election, whether this Coalition Government was going to last any longer than last May&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They were the principal critics.  In regard to the price of butter, the Exchequer has contributed £400,000 in order to subsidise the price in this case.  The consumer is asked to contribute 2d.  We have here for over 12 months an unrationed commodity, butter.  What price was fixed for it? I heard Deputy Dillon, when he was Minister, boasting of the consumption of butter and the amount that was consumed off the ration, but there was no question then from Deputy Flanagan or any of the others about the increased price that had to be paid for unrationed butter.  It was perfectly all <Col N="1171" /> right when the Coalition Government did it.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil was criticised because they gave that increased price to the people producing the raw material.  There is an increase which means a 1d. per head per week and no more.  Do the people of Dublin not realise that it would be much better for them&mdash;if it is possible for us to produce it, and I hope it is possible&mdash;to get Irish butter, even at a 1d. per head per week, than to import foreign butter.  We imported foreign butter last year.  We know the type it was and we know what the people of Dublin said about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the report given by officials of my Department:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to maintain the 8 oz. ration of butter and off-ration butter sales, it was necessary to import New Zealand and Danish butter.  Negotiations for such purchases were commenced in November, 1950, by the Butter Marketing Committee.  The quantities of imported butter were: New Zealand, 40,000 cwt.; Danish, 50,000 cwt.; making a total of 90,000 cwt.</P>
      <P>The stock of this Danish butter in store on the evening of the 16-6-1951, was 2,794 cwt., value £50,000.</P>
      <P>Since the 7th of May 640 packages representing 338 cwt. of this Danish butter have been rejected by the firms in the butter trade and the general public including creameries in Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are 258 packages representing approximately 130 cwt. <Col N="1172" /> of such rejected butter lying in one of the Dublin cold stores.  Another sample of this butter had a &lsquo;dirty flavour, bad odour and was badly discoloured&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was one of the legacies I got when I went into office and I am trying to ensure that the Dublin people will not get that again.  One of the reasons that I have increased the price of milk is that legacy of rotten, stinking butter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon never lost an opportunity of telling the people things, so if the Deputy goes to him he will tell him.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that the Exchequer is already subsidising butter to the extent of between £3,000,000 and £3,500,000.  Are we asking too much of the consumers of this country when we ask them to give a chance to our milk producers to go ahead and produce more milk and receive adequate prices?  I believe that I am not too far wrong in saying that this will help considerably towards increased production of milk and, consequently, increased production of good palatable butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that subsidy goes towards reducing the price of butter. The economic price is 4/- per lb., but the consuming public buys butter at 3/- and the difference is made up by subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not raise the whole lot by way of subsidy in the same way as you do for the flour millers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Another question in which a lot of our people have been <Col N="1174" /> very interested is compulsory tillage. Compulsory tillage was not introduced by Fianna Fáil in peace time and neither should it be necessary, but it is necessary in war time, and even when the Coalition Government were in office preparations and provisions were made for the introduction of compulsory tillage during war time. Deputy Dillon as Minister announced on one occasion anyway that he would introduce it in case of war.  I quote the report which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 30th September, 1948, of a speech which the Minister made in Clonmel at a meeting of the South Tipperary Agricultural Committee:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the event of war the Minister said that this country was carrying 12 months' supply of wheat and a survey was being made at the moment of the whole tillage area of the country so that it would be possible in 48 hours, if there was war, to tell each individual farmer the type of crop he would be required to grow on his land.</P>
      <P>This was entirely different from the procedure in the last war, when every farmer was required to grow the maximum quantity of wheat irrespective of the varying qualities of lands.  The farmers would be under compulsion so long as the emergency lasted, but when the rest of the community were no longer under compulsion the farmer would no longer be under compulsion.</P>
      <P>&lsquo;When I start compelling ople,&rsquo; said the Minister it will be a very detailed and drastic procedure because you will grow what you are told and grow it right.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the compulsion that Deputy Dillon had in mind.  If there is a war there must be compulsion because the people who are loudest in their condemnation in this House of compulsory tillage are the very people for whom we must introduce compulsion in order to save them from starvation.  I have heard Deputies Corish, Flanagan and O'Higgins, not one of whom produce a lb. of wheat for themselves but who eat as many loaves as anyone else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We said no such thing. We are talking now about compulsory tillage and the reasons why we must introduce it.  I can assure the House that there is no necessity to introduce compulsory tillage if the Government give an adequate price to the farmers. One of the planks in our platform is to give guaranteed prices.  We will not pursue the policy that has been in operation for the last three years; we will get away from that.  We are not going to leave a record like this at the end of our term of office: the pig population down and our production of poultry and eggs dropped.  We had last year in this country 644,000 pigs; they have dropped this year to 531,000. We had, last year, 12,787,000 fowl: that total has dropped now to 10,739,000. Last year the total of ducks, geese and turkeys was 1,232,000; now the figure is 1,031,000.  In addition, there has been a drop of 500,000 acres in tillage and we have lost 28,000 people from <Col N="1176" /> the land.  We are not going to pursue that policy.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,384,580 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in <Col N="1179" /> connection therewith; for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, etc,; for Expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Defence Vote for 1951-52 as printed and presented to the Dáil, was framed by the previous Government, and, therefore, while I am responsible for the sum of £5,076,870 which the Dáil is asked to vote, my present function is simply to explain in broad outline how that sum was arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £5,076,870 shows an increase on that of the past year of £1,100,160, but if a Supplementary Estimate of £252,623, taken in March, be taken into consideration, the increase is reduced to £847,537.  That increase is mainly due to the provision made for clothing, general and warlike stores, Civil Defence and the Reserve.</P>
    <P>The peace establishment of the Army, which is the framework of subheads A., E., and P.2, consists of 1,270 officers, 3,650 N.C.O.s, and 7,823 privates, that is 12,743 all ranks, but the potential average strength over the whole year for which the Estimate provides is 1,132 officers, 2,402 N.C.O.s, and 4,348 privates, that is 7,882 all ranks, or 4,861 all ranks below that of the peace establishment.</P>
    <P>The actual average strength maintained during the 14 months from April, 1950, to the end of May, 1951, was 1,083 officers and 6,749 other ranks, that is about 50 under that provided for in the Estimate.  The number of enlistments and re-enlistments of other ranks accepted for service during the same period was 1,113, but against that there was a normal wastage due to discharges, etc., of 1,540, so that the intake was less than the wastage by 427 other ranks.  It is hardly necessary for me to say that this is a serious position which calls for immediate attention.  The present Government <Col N="1180" /> does not consider that position as in any way satisfactory and one of its immediate tasks will be to do its best to stimulate recruitment for the regular force.</P>
    <P>Deputies have already in the Book of Estimates details of the expenditure covered by the Defence Vote, so I think that, for practical purposes at least at this stage, it will be sufficient to summarise it under the following broad headings:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I have been assured that the morale of the Army is being maintained, that its discipline is good and its health excellent.</P>
    <P>As regards the training of the Army, every means possible is being availed of to keep our officers and other ranks abreast of the latest developments in military and technical science.  During the year, 29 officers were sent abroad on special courses and, when they returned, they imparted the latest information thus obtained to others. In addition, 116 officers attended courses at home and, subsequently, they also acted as instructors for others.  When the Reserve, First Line, was called up during the year, training in platoon and company tactics for the different corps and services was carried out, and the reservists themselves received refresher courses in weapon, tactical and technical training. As regards the F.C.A., we are hoping that by the increase in the number of regular training officers made a few months ago, the training of that force will be developed and its service rendered even more attractive.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to avail of this opportunity to appeal to Deputies and, through them to the able-bodied youth of this country, to aid me in my task of building up the forces of the State, so as to be in a position in case of an emergency, to <Col N="1181" /> defend our country's integrity.  Men are wanted for each arm of the service, and I appeal to them to come forward and follow in the footsteps of those who secured by their sacrifices our liberty and freedom.  To ensure the continuance of that independence is surely an ideal which should commend itself to the manhood of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this particular Estimate, I have only one or two points to make and one or two questions to ask.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that the number of reservists turning up for training is gratifying, and that the number of F.C.A. turning out, as a result of the later regulations, is considerably higher now than it was at any time in the past.  I believe that more and more attention will require to be given to the training of the F.C.A., not only by the Minister but by the Army also.  There, there is an immense potential, and we should aim at having every available young man in the country a member of the F.C.A., equipping himself for a soldier's task during his off-duty hours and during his holidays in preparation for the day of emergency.</P>
      <P>I think the F.C.A. more or less was in the past treated as the Cinderella of the services.  I think that was a major blunder.  Whatever machinery there is available in the country for the training of our young manhood it should be utilised to the very fullest extent.  In addition to that, no Minister for Defence, no member of a Government and no member of the Dáil possessing a full sense of responsibility can completely ignore the financial side of the matter and the fact that money for the Army, as for any other purpose, cannot come from anywhere except out of the trousers pockets of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are living in an unsettled world. We are living in a state of semi-emergency. That state of semi-emergency may last for very many years.  We are not so wealthy that we can afford to maintain a huge and very costly standing Regular Army.  To keep immense numbers in an army in times of semi-emergency <Col N="1182" /> is bad policy in my opinion. There is no place that one can find the manhood to put into an army except within the country.  If 5,000, 6,000 or 8,000 extra soldiers are taken into the Army that is 8,000 more of the youngest able-bodied men in the country taken away from the fields and from the factories.</P>
    <P>If this state of semi-emergency ends at some time or another in actual war, then these years are invaluable for increasing production and for building up our reserves.  These years are invaluable for building houses for our people and building hospitals, not alone for our civilians but for those who may be injured in the event of future war.  If huge numbers of able-bodied men are taken away now from the civilian population there will necessarily be a steep drop in production and a reduction in the amount of building. If adequate machinery is provided for training these men outside the barracks while allowing them to carry on their ordinary avocations, then there will be an immense national gain.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the cost of a soldier to-day is not what it used to be; the cost of a soldier to-day represents a considerable sum of money. When we talk in terms of 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 extra soldiers we are talking in terms of £ millions per annum extra as an imposition upon the taxpayers.  I will admit that a man is better trained if he is a wholetime member of the Defence Forces rather than if he is merely a member of the F.C.A.  But two world wars have shown us how very rapidly soldiers can be trained for the non-technical services.  If a man is doing his week-end training, if he is doing his annual training and if the inducements are sufficient to attract more and more into the F.C.A., to turn up for annual training and for week-end camps, then such a man should be very, very highly trained indeed without the necessity of taking him into the Army as a whole-time soldier.</P>
    <P>The bigger you build up the Regular Army the less attention will be given to the F.C.A.  Double the strength of the Regular Army and the F.C.A., the Irish Volunteer force of to-day, will <Col N="1183" /> wither to half its present strength. There is a potential in the F.C.A. that can be built up to the 100,000 mark. Give that body sufficient attention, give it sufficient training, let the Army officers continue to lean on and rely upon that body as a major potential force, training its members higher and higher in the handling of arms from the rifle up to the machine gun, forming their own transport, their own artillery, their own signals, then I believe you can have a really effective force, immeasurably stronger than ever you will get through pursuing a policy of building up a whole-time Army, at far less cost to the people.</P>
    <P>If it is the Minister's intention to proceed, as he has indicated, to build up a vastly greater standing Regular Army, there is no good in coming in here and appealing for co-operation in getting recruits.  People look upon a soldier's career nowadays as a matter of business, certainly in the absence of actual war.  They weigh up the prospects, financial and otherwise, of a soldier's life as compared with other walks of life.  Army pay was very frequently adversely criticised here. Army pay was, so far as it could be, equated to that of the Civil Service at the last pay survey and the arrangement made was that when the Civil Service rates went up the Army rates would go up in proportion.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Arbitration Board reported some time ago in favour of new rates.  That report was adopted by the previous Government.  It was also decided that the Army and the police would benefit from the award. That award in the case of civil servants dates back to the 15th January.  If the Minister is thinking of embarking on a recruiting campaign, the first businesslike step in such a recruiting campaign should be to come to a decision with regard to new rates of pay and then announce them.  I take it the Government is adhering to the decision of the previous Government and that that award will apply alike to the Army and the Guards.  If the Minister believes that it is imperative to have a bigger Army and have it rapidly, why the delay about announcing the new <Col N="1184" /> rates of pay?  There should not be any great delay with regard to the machinery.  There could not be any case for considerable delay with regard to the rates.  In my opinion it is futile to be talking about recruiting when the prospective recruit does not know what his prospects and his rates of pay are to be.  I would ask the Minister to let us know what progress is being made, when these rates are going to come into being or from what date they will apply.  Will they apply, as in the case of the Civil Service, back to the 15th January or will they apply only from the date on which they are announced? If they are to apply only from the date on which they are published, then it is grossly unfair to delay announcing them.  Every day, every week that passes by represents a loss to the members of the Army.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not believe that it is good policy to go in for a big costly standing Army.  I think that it is a mistake in a country like ours, mainly made up of a rural population, with the people in the city and the more densely populated areas engaged in building and industry, to suck off more and more of our manhood from general utility work and take them into the Army, if it is possible to have them trained as soldiers through machinery such as that provided by the F.C.A.  You have the right in an emergency or in a state of war to mobilise the F.C.A.  Every member of that organisation is an attested member of the Defence Forces liable to call up in the event of war.  In my opinion more and more time and energy should be devoted towards building up the F.C.A. and making it more efficient.  I have heard and read speeches from Deputies referring in more or less contemptuous terms to the F.C.A.  I believe the F.C.A. has an immense potential, and if we are to keep such a force on its toes and at the very top of its form, a warm interest must be shown in its training and in its activities.  Confidence must be shown in the force, and the Minister in particular must convince every individual member of the F.C.A. that his eyes are cast in that direction, that he is relying on them, that they <Col N="1185" /> are an immensely powerful force and that if they are trained the country has nothing to fear, but I believe one policy is antagonistic to the other.  I believe that if we go in for a big standing Army that means, in fact, the withering of the Irish volunteers of to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that the Government intended to treat the Army as a very important factor in our national life. I think most people will agree that the last Government treated the Army and the defence of this country with absolute contempt.  They made no attempt to provide a defence for this country at a time when every other country in the world was looking upon the state of affairs that existed as most serious, to the extent even of putting aside all civil occupations and calling on the people to prepare for the defence of their country.  When this Party was in opposition, we appealed to the Government to treat the defence of the country as an important matter. The present Tánaiste told the Government of the time that we would not criticise any expense incurred in preparations to defend the country and he promised that we, as a Party, would not attempt at any time to criticise efforts made to provide a proper defence for the country.  Instead of that, the whole position was absolutely ignored.  It appeared to the ordinary man that we were going to rely on the resources of other countries to defend this country against any action any Power might take against it.  We believe that it is possible for us to remain neutral in any future war as we did in the last war, but that it is our duty to defend this country against any Power that tries to attack it. Believing that, we think it is right that we should use whatever resources we can to strengthen the defence of the country.  We believe that a certain Army strength is necessary and that at present the Army is far below that strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the last emergency occurred, as well as the Army we had a pretty strong Volunteer force which was <Col N="1186" /> established by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  The members of that force had gone through their annual training and were fit to take over as officers and N.C.O.s when called in to join with the Regular Army during the emergency period.  There is no doubt that were it not for that great organisation which was there, we would not have been able to build up our defences as we did during the emergency.  I agree that the F.C.A is a very important factor in our defence, but that force got very little encouragement during the last three years.  If you can get men like those in the F.C.A. to give their services in their spare time and get trained, undoubtedly they will be the best backing that any permanent Army can have.  But you must have a permanent Army of sufficient strength to maintain the different barracks and carry out other duties and be in a position to bring along the F.C.A. and the other volunteers who will be required in any emergency which may arise.  Not very long ago, our attempt at forming a navy was sneered at; they were called the &ldquo;rubber ducks&rdquo;. Whatever attempt is made to improve the defences of our country should not be sneered at.  The people who volunteer to defend us, instead of being sneered at, should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to look seriously into the question of pay if he wants to get a proper Army.  Soldiers expect to be paid as well as civilians. We should not confine the Army to men who cannot find any other occupation. Conditions should be such that the Army will attract men who would prefer an army life and who will join the Army in preference to any other occupation if they are in a position to keep themselves and their families on the pay they receive while in the Army. Another matter that was very much neglected was the housing of our soldiers and their families.  I can say that the married quarters in Cork, for instance, are a disgrace.  I suppose they are in the same condition as they were in the British time, but if men are expected to be physically fit they should not be confined in cramped quarters as they are at present.  The vast majority of the men who are living outside the barracks have no proper <Col N="1187" /> housing accommodation at all.  I know soldiers in Cork with families of seven and eight who have to live in one room. If we expect men to train and to fight as soldiers and, if necessary, give their lives in defence of the country, they deserve better treatment than they are getting at present.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the Minister's attention to the question of the civilian workers in the barracks. Civilian work in the Army, whether for labourers or clerks, should be confined as far as possible to Old I.R.A. men and ex-Army men.  So far as Cork is concerned, during the past few years I know of cases of Old I.R.A. men who gave good service to this country not being appointed to these positions and of other people getting them over the heads of these men. That is a matter which I hope will be rectified.  Then the civilian workers have not got an increase since 1948.  I think those men, who in the main are the best of the type of men I spoke of, are entitled to get the same pay when working for the Department of Defence as they would when working for outside employers.  I also ask the Minister to take into consideration the question of I.R.A. pensioners, especially those who are drawing a special allowance.  Men over 70 years of age were dealt with fairly generously last week by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied.  I should also like to direct the Minister's attention to the position of Haulbowline. I know the matter is under consideration, but it is a matter on which our defence will have to depend in a very big way.  I think that we should have oil supplies stored in Haulbowline even before the deep water quay is finished.  The oil tanks there are probably the biggest we have in the country. Those tanks should not be left empty.  In case of an emergency it is essential to have all possible stores. Some means should be devised whereby the tanks could be filled pending the construction of the berth for which I know the Minister is anxious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was only half way through his speech when he said he was about to conclude. The Minister said that he was alarmed at the failure of recruiting.  I thought he would conclude by saying that he proposed to encourage recruiting by making the Army more attractive than it is to-day.  I thought he would tell us about the Civil Service award and would indicate that the soldiers and their wives would get their share of it and the date from which they would get it.  Soldiers, especially married soldiers, have to meet the increased cost of living.  The Minister has asked us all to help him in the matter of recruiting.  We would all be most anxious to do so and to have the Army at the desired strength but the Minister must make the Army attractive. He must pay decent wages.  He must give allowances for wives and families that will enable them to live in comparative comfort, on equal terms with their neighbours.  That is one of the difficulties I see about the Army, that it seems to be the Cinderella of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of temporary postmen, soldiers are the lowest paid State employees.  The Minister should try to make the Army more attractive by providing sporting events and a better quality uniform.  We are all <Col N="1189" /> very proud of the Army.  We are proud of its achievements in the sports field. We are proud to see the soldiers on parade.  A soldier wants for his wife and family the same level of comfort that is possible for the families of men in other employment.  He wants the same pay.  Our soldiers cannot live up to the standard displayed by members of other armies when they visit this country.  This country could not afford that standard but at least our Army personnel should be paid a higher rate of pay than they are getting at the moment and there should be a higher standard in the matter of uniform and the quality of the material used.  The soldier must ask himself the question whether or not he would be in a far better position at the end of 21 or 25 years' service had he been in outside employment as a plasterer, a bricklayer or a carpenter.  I would ask the Minister to appoint a committee composed of the heads of all departments in the Army to suggest improvements and means of making Army life more comfortable and the Army more attractive for our splendid men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take any remarks I have to make as being of a constructive nature.  I feel the time has come when we should review the position of our Army in the light of modern conditions.  One cannot help feeling that in many respects our Army has not progressed since the pre-war period.  One feels that it is to some extent the type of standing Army which one expected to find in the 1920's or 1930's.  It seems to me that the time has been reached when it is necessary to re-examine the position as to our Defence Forces generally and to determine the line of policy that would be acceptable to all Parties in the House because, obviously, the question of the Defence Forces should be outside any question of Party politics.  I do not think that we do need a large standing Army.  The ideal thing would be to have a small, highly trained, highly efficient, well-paid, standing Army, every member of which would be capable of becoming an N.C.O. and probably an officer in time of emergency, that would form <Col N="1190" /> the framework of a large Volunteer Army.</P>
      <P>In order to obtain a standing Army of that type we must recognise that every private in it must be a technician, must be of sufficient ability, intelligence, education and training to become at least an N.C.O. at a week's notice.  In order to attract the type of men you want in an army of this kind it is necessary to pay them well.  It is necessary to pay them at the same rate as technicians are paid in industry.  A large portion of the work of the Army is of a scientific or technical nature.  I am afraid we still live a little bit in the atmosphere that a soldier is just the first person you meet and recruit, who is very badly paid and who becomes a soldier because he has no other job open to him.  We must get away from that mentality and create a really first-class small Army.  Undoubtedly, that will mean offering a much higher rate of pay than the rate to which we have been accustomed.  I know the Minister will probably have a considerable amount of difficulty in persuading the Department of Defence that this is necessary but it is the only hope of building up a proper Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with this highly trained, highly efficient standing Army there is, as the Minister has emphasised and as I am sure he is anxious to do, an urgent necessity to develop the Volunteer force, the F.C.A.  I am sure every member of the House will gladly join in giving the Minister any assistance possible in that direction.  It does appear, probably due to the lack of sufficient training personnel, that the F.C.A. at the moment are very badly in need of training.  I cannot say that I have any expert knowledge beyond the knowledge that a Minister acquires from attending a great many functions from time to time at which units of the Defence Forces parade but one cannot help noticing that in some cases the standard of training is extremely low, lower I think than we were accustomed to in the Volunteers, even in much more difficult circumstances.  There seems to be very little pride in the efficient execution of a movement but no doubt that is due to the inadequacy <Col N="1191" /> of training personnel.  It is a matter that should be attended to.</P>
    <P>One of the suggestions which I brought forward on a number of occasions when we were discussing the Defence Forces in the Government was the possibility of utilising the Defence Forces, at least the technical branches, on constructional work undertaken by the State, not as a means of getting that constructional work carried out more cheaply, but as a means of providing training for the engineering corps, for instance, in land reclamation, in arterial drainage and even in bridge construction.  It often occurred to me that the engineering corps of the Army could undertake not to do the whole job, but to do a job, thus acquiring valuable experience and at the same time popularising itself with the public by showing that it was capable of doing a useful piece of peace-time work.  It occurred to me that the importance of this aspect was increasing nowadays, since a large portion of the work of an army in wartime involves the utilisation of modern machinery, such as bulldozers and dredgers of one kind or another, in order to prepare an airfield or the construction of a bridge.  In that way, the Army would gain useful experience and would partially pay its way in respect of the particular jobs it undertook to do.  I emphasise the words &ldquo;would partially pay its way&rdquo; because I think it would be very bad if it were expected that the Army should pay its way by doing work of that kind, but it would certainly pay for part of its experience and for part of its training by carrying out engineering tasks of that nature.</P>
    <P>Likewise, if I may turn from the Army to the naval service, I suggested on a number of occasions that it might be possible to utilise the naval service to run an efficient school: that, if the naval service had a number of small deep-sea trawlers of the type used particularly by the Spaniards, which come into Bantry and fish off the southwest coast and which are able to withstand any weather, it could undertake the training of our inshore fishermen. We lack a naval tradition, we lack, <Col N="1192" /> even, a fishing tradition to any degree. The vessels which we have at the moment are not ideally suited for their purpose.  In the first instance, they can only enter two or three of the harbours off our coast.  They may be very fine vessels from one point of view, but, I think, they are not suited for the purpose for which we require them.  The vessels which the naval service should have would be capable of entering any of the small ports around our coast.  We probably would have a more efficient coastal service, from the point of view of keeping away poachers, if we had a greater number of these small vessels.</P>
    <P>At the moment, I think we have two vessels in commission.  It takes them a long time to get around the coast.  The poachers, or the would-be poachers, know that one is laid up.  They know that the other one is on the east coast, and that they are quite safe in fishing off the coast of Donegal.  Therefore, it would be much better if, instead of having these larger types of vessels, we had say half a dozen small fast fishing trawlers which could be utilised at the same time for training.  In that way, I think there would be no difficulty in obtaining the additional funds, because there, again, the naval service could justify itself, even in peace time, from the point of view of providing a necessary national service.  The training and the development of our inshore fishermen is very badly needed.  If our naval service could provide a training school for the fishermen along the western coast it would, to a certain extent, be doing good work on behalf of the nation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister proposes to deal with the position of the Air Corps when closing.  I think the public have been somewhat disturbed recently at the accidents which have occurred in the Air Corps.  One wonders whether all the precautions that should be taken have been taken. One also wonders whether the equipment and the machines used were up to standard.  One wonders, occasionally, whether, possibly, the cheeseparing attitude of the Department of Finance does not preclude the replacement of machines or parts <Col N="1193" /> which should have been replaced.  I am sure the Minister shares my anxieties in the matter and will investigate that aspect of the question. It would be, of course, appalling if our Air Corps were limited in its requirements to an extent that would endanger the lives of any of its personnel. I am sure that the Minister will have the support not only of the Government but of the House in ensuring that the machines and the materials used are of the best.  I merely mention the matter in the hope that the Minister will investigate the position.</P>
    <P>Again, from the point of view of utilising our defence services in peace time in such a way as to popularise them and in such a way as to justify the increased public expenditure which undoubtedly is necessary, it has occurred to me that, possibly, the Air Corps could be utilised for the purpose of making available and of running an airfield in Cork, with possibly one in Galway and one in Donegal.  It seems to me that these would be military necessities from the point of view of our own Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the amount of internal traffic available would justify expenditure by the Department of Industry and Commerce in the creation of such airfields.  I think that these airfields from a commercial point of view would be a loss, but if such airfields were constructed and run by the Air Corps of the Army, and were also utilised for civilian purposes, the Air Corps would be rendering a useful service from the point of view of the development of our own internal air services, and would, at the same time, be justifying its existence to the public to a greater degree.  In other words, it would be availing of the opportunity to do a good public relations piece of work.  I merely put the suggestion to the Minister.  It occurs to me that one of the tasks of any Minister for Defence would be that of public relations in order to justify to the public the expenditure which is necessary in peace time.</P>
    <P>I think that the rate of expenditure at the moment on our Defence Forces is inadequate.  I feel that it would be <Col N="1194" /> necessary to increase that rate of expenditure if we are to have any kind of an efficient Defence Force.  As already indicated, the rates of pay for privates should be very substantially increased so as to ensure that we will have first-class technicians in the Army.  The additional increase in expenditure, which I believe to be necessary as far as the Defence Forces are concerned, must be, to a certain extent, sold to the public.  I think it would be possible to do that more easily if the Defence Forces could participate in various development projects here which, commercially, would not be justified but which, on a joint commercial and strategic basis, could be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We need an effective army in this country.  I am aware that during the past three years the attitude of the previous Government has been to demoralise instead of make efficient any portion of the Army or of the Navy.  I give as one such instance the amount allocated to these services in the Estimate.  At the present day there is nothing more demoralising for members of a navy than to know they are useless and that, in the event of their being called upon in an emergency, the ground has been cut from under them.</P>
      <P>Fancy a navy based in Haulbowline which, as a result of the attitude of the previous Minister for Defence, if it needs refuelling has to go to Dublin for a few gallons of oil and then come back again to Haulbowline.  I wonder how much fuel is consumed on the outward and inward journeys and if having arrived at Haulbowline after refuelling at Dublin, the vessels have to go back there again for further fuel, and have just enough left for that journey.  Such is the present position of the naval vessels based in Haulbowline. I think it is a scandal that public money should be wasted on a navy which has been hamstrung and rendered ineffective.  When I heard this matter first I was shocked, and I maintain that the state of affairs that exists at our naval station in Haulbowline has a demoralising effect on our Navy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in expecting a man to put his heart into training and to do his part in an army or a navy of defence if he knows that the moment war is declared his share in that war is to tie up his vessel in port because he has no oil to take her out.  When I see the sums allowed here for the commanders <Col N="1196" /> and the rest of the Navy, I say it is a waste of public money unless that arm of our Defence Forces is rendered effective.  The way to render it effective is to provide for the fuelling of vessels at their base. You can imagine those vessels lying there.  A declaration of war comes.  The Navy is ordered out.  The Commander of the Navy says to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army: &ldquo;We must wait a couple of days until I get a few gallons of oil from Dublin.&rdquo;  It is a joke.  I know the feelings of the Navy in Cobh towards that condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>It is a public scandal that although you have on that island, under the control of the Defence Forces in this State, tanks and storage for up to 20,000,000 gallons of oil, the Navy cannot get a gallon of oil out of the 20,000,000 that could be stored there to take them as far as Roches Point.  That is the present position of the Navy, of that arm of our Defence Forces, as handed over to our present Minister for Defence.  I am only giving here what I had extracted by question and answer from the previous Minister for Defence.  He told me: &ldquo;Yes, they will go on tour to Dublin for the oil and tour back again with it.&rdquo;  As soon as they arrive they will have to tour again to get more oil.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of storage under the control of the Defence Forces in Haulbowline.  It is our largest store for oil in this State to-day. In previous years, ways and means were found by which these tanks were kept filled.  It brought a very considerable income to the Cork Harbour Commissioners&mdash;something around £12,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I suggest that portion of that £12,000 could be used and very effectively used towards improving the position both in the deep water quay and in the oil works in Haulbowline.  When these oil works were in bad condition before, ways and means were found, not alone for filling these tanks but for seeing that pumping facilities were provided for every vessel coming into that port. There should be nothing impossible in it.  It would be far more in the line of our naval and Army engineers to turn their mind to that and to give a little <Col N="1197" /> attention to finding ways and means of filling those tanks than going out on Deputy Dillon's bogs in connection with the reclamation scheme.</P>
    <P>There is very little use in talking about increasing the pay of officers and men if the Department of Defence then extracts from them an extortionate rent for the houses in which they live, and I say that 50/- per week charged to a naval lieutenant or ensign in Haulbowline is an extortionate rent.  I ask the Minister to look into that matter also.</P>
    <P>I can cast my mind back to 1939 and see the position of affairs then.  I can see the position in which our young men whom we called to training and endeavoured to form into a defence force for the protection of this nation were, and particularly the arms handed to them to fight with, and I suggest to the Minister that if we are, as I expect we now are, going to prepare this nation so that it can at least do something for its own protection, we will not beg any foreigner to protect our nation and our people.  Too many lives were lost in the fight for the freedom of this nation without that and without our giving up the ghost now.  I suggest to the Minister that he should see what stores of arms are available in an emergency for the men who would be asked to sacrifice their lives in such an emergency. I can think of the situation in former years when 70 men were served out with shotguns, with Springfield rifles more antiquated than the rifles the Boers had in 1902.</P>
    <P>We are spending £5,000,000 on the Army and I regard it more or less as an insurance policy, just as in the case of wheat.  If we are going to spend that money, let us see that it is well spent, that we have an effective force and that we will not have the joke and the scandal in regard to the Navy which was carried on by the previous Government.  The Minister has been only a short time in office and I do not wish to overburden him with questions, but unless some steps are immediately taken by his Department to render usable the oil storage capacity which is available at Haulbowline, he will be spending a few nights here from 10.30 until 11 p.m. I do not wish to go further than that.</P>

      <P>For a long time, for the three and a half years about which Deputy Corry spoke so often in his speech, we had from the Fianna Fáil Benches an hysterical cry about preparation for war, about increasing the strength of the Army and about the inadequacy of the civil defence preparations in this country. To his credit, I suppose it is, but because he had been a Minister previously, we did not hear the same hysterical cry from Deputy Traynor, as he then was.  I now suggest that Fianna Fáil have an admirable opportunity to do all the things which Deputy Vivion de Valera, Deputy Corry and others in the Fianna Fáil Party suggested might be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can, with these remarks, I want to make a fair speech.  Deputy Corry talks about an efficient and effective Army.  I should like somebody to tell me what would be an effective strength for the Army.  What strength should we have?  Should it be 8,000 or should it be, as suggested by the officials of the Department and by the officers in the Army, 12,500?  Is that an adequate Army?  Would it be an effective Army for peace?  Would <Col N="1199" /> 24,000 be an effective strength in time of war?  Nobody has yet said what should be the strength of an Irish Army in time of emergency and for that reason I think the suggestion of Deputy MacBride is worthy of the Minister's consideration.  He suggests a small Army somewhat in line with the present strength, or perhaps a little more. I would personally be in favour of an Army which would be slightly stronger, by, say, 2,000, but let us have it an effective Army, a well-paid Army and a well-drilled Army.  So far as the defence of the country is concerned, after that, in time of emergency, all of us have obligations.</P>
    <P>As taxpayers, every one of us assumes responsibility for the economic well-being of the country and we assume responsibility for general administration and Government administration. I suggest that every male in the country has a responsibility so far as its defence is concerned, and I advocate now, as I advocated when in opposition and subsequently in Government&mdash;I am not one of those who wants to advocate conscription: to advocate that there should be a long period of Army service for the people or that, in time of emergency, men of a certain age should be forced to join the Army&mdash;that every male in this State at a particular age should be compelled to take two or three weeks' training as a member of one of the Defence Forces, because, invariably, we notice that many of the unfortunates who find themselves in the Army&mdash;this is my experience&mdash;especially from the rural areas, find themselves there because they could not get a job at a particular time.  I do not mean that as slight on anybody who ever joined the Army, but I submit that, especially at a time like this, a man would prefer to work for the county council, even though he might be paid £3 10s. od. per week, or as an agricultural labourer, for which he will be paid, in some counties, at least, £3 7s. 6d. per week, rather than go into the Army.  If you reckon the pay of Army men, counting the emoluments, it may come to more than £3 10s. od. or £3 7s. 6d., but still it is not attracting men into the Army.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> One may talk of patriotic motives and the ideals they had in the past and the spirit in the hearts and minds of Irishmen regarding defence, but at times like this when there is no emergency, no real danger of war, a man looks upon the Army as a career and asks himself and the Government and the Minister for Defence: &ldquo;If I go into the Army, what am I going to be paid for it?&rdquo; I think that is perfectly reasonable and normal in a man who is going to join an army, whether Irish, British or American.  The last Minister for Defence made an honest attempt to increase the Army strength, but that attempt, even if it were made by any other Minister would, in my opinion, have got the same result&mdash;and we all agree that the results were bad.  If every Deputy and every newspaper asked by way of speech or advertisement for young men in rural areas and in towns and cities to join the Army, I would say that the response would have been just as bad as I think it is agreed it was in the last five or six months.  With the present standards and rates of pay in the Army, if we are ever to attain to a figure of 12,500, we can only get it by improvements. If we had the Minister for Defence, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Seán MacBride and others going around asking the men to join the Army, with conditions as they are, I do not think we could increase the strength effectively.  Therefore I say that we should concentrate on a moderate Army, highly trained, highly efficient, but well paid, and then depend on the ordinary civilians&mdash;as it is their responsibility, just as it is the responsibility of the man who is paid as a member of the National Army&mdash;to undertake the defence of the country.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy McGrath who talked about the bad way the F.C.A. were treated during the last three years.  Whilst many Deputies here can suggest improvements in the F.C.A. that might have been effected in the last three years, it was not a period when you had men wanting to flock into the F.C.A.  In 1940, when the L.D.F. was inaugurated, we were falling over ourselves to get into it.  It was a new idea and it attracted most of us.  Of course, we were threatened <Col N="1201" /> at that time to some extent and, because there was a spirit inherent in us, all of us tried to get into the F.C.A., to play our small part, no matter what it was.  We were all attracted by the idea of marching up and down, carrying the big heavy rifles and taking commands and orders.  But during the last three and a half years, or even in 1947 and 1946, when it seemed to people that there was no danger of an immediate emergency the F.C.A. was out of fashion.  The only way we can bring it into fashion again is to make it attractive.  If money is to be spent on defence, I suggest that a substantial portion of it be spent on the F.C.A. to make it attractive.  There is no use in appealing to people by public meetings and saying: &ldquo;You must join the F.C.A. because the situation in Korea suggests there might be a major conflict in the immediate future.&rdquo;  It will have to be attractive and the conditions of the F.C.A. will themselves have to be attractive.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask, first of all, what is an effective Army (a) during peace time and (b) during an emergency.  I also support the idea of Deputy Seán MacBride, that we have a small, moderately sized Army, that we have it efficient, but that we should seek more of the ordinary civilians.  It is not fair to suggest that the men of the National Army should bear the brunt of it.  Let the solicitor, the bank official, the civil servant, the local government official, the farmer, the business man and the shopkeeper make their contribution, however small it might be.  At the present time, outside the Army we have a very limited number of people who are taking any interest in the F.C.A., and consequently there is very little interest in the defence of this country or the preparation for its defence should an emergency arise.</P>

      <P>I got the impression, when listening to Deputy MacBride speaking on this Estimate, <Col N="1202" /> that he has got a sense of humour but does not know it.  He tells us that the F.C.A. is in need of training, that their standard of training is extremely low, that they have little pride in execution &mdash;I take it, of drill movements.  He develops the argument that we must have a &ldquo;standing army&rdquo;&mdash;as he calls it, but which I prefer to call a &ldquo;permament force&rdquo;&mdash;composed of specialists who will devote their time to technical training&mdash;I take it, technical training of themselves.  Then he advances the extraordinary argument&mdash;it is not new; it has been urged over and over again by people who do not understand the necessity or use of an army&mdash;that the Army should be used for land rehabilitation, that our Navy should be used to teach how to fish, and that our Air Force should be used to construct airfields in Cork, Galway and Donegal&mdash; without any advertence whatsoever to how these dangerous things, once created&mdash;airfields&mdash;would be protected. Are those airfields to be created so that the American bombers will land on them any night they wish?  Are they to be an inducement or an invitation to the Americans or somebody else to come in and land?  Or is it to make the problem of the Minister and the Department of Defence more difficult?</P>
      <P>Having had some little experience as a soldier, I have always believed that an army should be organised and trained to be an army and not to be draining bogs or teaching how to fish or matters of that kind.  I think that that viewpoint would be held by the very experienced individuals who form our general staff, and on whom the Minister must rely for advice.  Let the Army be an army, and let other Departments teach how to fish or how to drain land.  Let the Army concentrate on its own training and on its own organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our F.C.A. do not appear to be as smart as the Royalettes in particular movements on the stage that is no disadvantage now because all modern training is to teach the soldier how to fight and it has tended even since 1939 to get away from all this nonsense of spit and polish and get down to the real business of fighting.  The soldier who can hit with his weapon is a more <Col N="1203" /> efficient soldier than the soldier who can form particular revolutions or movements in the smartest possible way.  The F.C.A. need not worry very much about the criticism that they take no pride in execution.  If the F.C.A. are properly organised to fight, to use their weapons effectively, to make the best use of cover, either to defend or assault a position properly, then I think they would be much more useful to the country than if they were the most expert ballet movers we could possibly recruit.  I do not take the point of view that their standard of training is deplorably or extremely low. Naturally, the Minister, the general staff and everybody concerned with the Army would like to see an increase in the standard of training of every element or component in it, but I do not think it was right to say that the standard of training of the F.C.A. was extremely low.  I do not think that the Parliament of this nation should be used to make that criticism of the young boys who are in the F.C.A., who devote their evenings and week-ends to training and who are doing their best.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister has only just taken over responsibility as Minister for Defence but I have listened to him during the past three years when different Army Estimates, Army Bills and matters dealing with the Army came before the House and he made very constructive suggestions. I think he can take it from me that he will have the very best wishes of the House in putting into operation those very constructive suggestions he made while he was in opposition.</P>
    <P>Naturally I support the Deputies who have recommended an increase in pay for the Army.  I have always felt, even when I was serving in it myself, that Army pay was disgracefully low and I often wondered why any person served in an army at all.  He takes certain risks in time of war or emergency but he often takes serious risks in time of peace in training and he was and is paid a totally inadequate wage. The soldier does not exist for the purpose of protecting the slums; he exists <Col N="1204" /> for the purpose of protecting the system of society, the banks and the wealth of the country and if so the banks and the wealth of the country should contribute towards paying him a decent wage or salary.</P>
    <P>An announcement has been made by the Government that there will be an increase in pay and allowances for the Army.  I hope that they will be put into effect very soon and that they will be properly back-dated.  Although there is considerable discontent regarding pay, however, there is also discontent regarding quite a number of other minor matters.  I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;I will put it in a broad way&mdash;that quite a number of the existing outdated disciplinary regulations should be looked into and revised and if that is done many regulations which are causing trouble and discontent will be removed.  While the soldier would like to be well paid there are other matters which cause him more trouble than pay and they are the regulations which he considers to be unjust and unfair.  Many soldiers and officers have from time to time serious complaints.  There is a section of the Defence Forces Act which deals with grievances but that section has been entirely useless and I would suggest to the Minister that he should have on his staff an officer of high rank to be called &ldquo;Military Secretary&rdquo; or anything else he likes and to whom personal grievances for the Minister's attention could be referred directly.</P>
    <P>Matters in connection with a soldier's or officer's pay, his marriage, his station or location are personal matters and it is in connection with personal matters of that kind that most difficulties, trouble, complaints and grievances arise and I have felt during my own service and on considering the matter since that the Minister should have such an officer as I have mentioned. After all the battalion commander, brigade commander, divisional commander, command commander or any other units that fit into the machine are not very much concerned with those personal grievances.  It is important that that type of personal grievance should be remedied if possible or reduced, in so far as these <Col N="1205" /> grievances can be reduced or remedied. The Minister can do that by having the type of officer on his own staff that I recommend.</P>
    <P>There are matters of policy and of the utilisation of the Defence Forces that I should like to deal with, but I realise that with the very short time at our disposal these matters cannot even be touched upon.</P>
    <P>I say again to the Minister that he has my best wishes and that he will have the best wishes of the House in trying to remove from the Defence Force all these grievances that have been and that are responsible for keeping it much below its present establishment strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty of getting men into the Army has been mentioned in this debate.  There is one difficulty in that regard which affects men in the Cork Harbour area.  I believe that it is detrimental to the interests of these men to be in the Army in so far as they are suffering financially at present.  Because of a lack of adequate housing accommodation for the men who belong to the Defence Forces in Cork City, where they are stationed, they find it necessary to live in quarters in the Crosshaven Harbour district, which is about 14 miles away.  These men, who have given many years of service to this State, must be in their barracks in Cork City every morning and they have to travel from the Crosshaven Harbour district, and even to Ballincollig, which is a further seven miles away, from their barracks in Cork City. They are expected to pay, out of their weekly wage, the full bus fare, because the Army authorities cannot provide housing accommodation for them in the Cork city area.  These bus fares cost these men about 16/- or 17/- a week&mdash; and more, if they have to go as far as the Ballincollig district.  I believe it is our duty to try to remedy that situation. I do not blame the Minister for not having remedied this grievance in the few short weeks he has been in office.  I raised this matter a couple of years ago.  I think that it is not so much the Minister&mdash;no matter what Government may be in office&mdash;as the administrative staff dealing with these <Col N="1206" /> men who are responsible.  I wonder if it is because these men are privates that due consideration is not given to the fact that they have to incur this extra expense every week of the year.  I understand that the men went so far as to indicate that they were willing to pay for the petrol if an Army lorry was put at their disposal to transport them to Cork City. We know that for years past many an Army lorry went on journeys that were not necessary.  It is essential that these men should be treated properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke about Cork Harbour and he dealt especially with the question of the naval force.  There is another matter in relation to Cork Harbour that Deputy Corry may not have mentioned and which I think is important.  There are forts in Cork Harbour which were handed over to this State about 1937.  One particular fort is called after a prominent Englishman of his time, Lord Camden, and within 50 or 100 yards of it is the remains of a quarry known as &ldquo;The Convict's Quarry&rdquo;.  Irishmen were brought from Spike Island to build these forts.  If we want to recruit men from the armed services it is essential, as other Deputies have stated, that they be properly and adequately equipped.  What about the danger of putting them into a death-trap?  The men stationed in some of these obsolete forts in Cork Harbour during the 1939-1945 period were definitely placed in a death-trap.  These forts are a hindrance to us at present unless we modernise them.  If we do not intend to modernise them I think they should be scrapped completely.  If there should be another outbreak of war, under modern war conditions, every man placed in these forts is definitely doomed.  I realise that it would take a lot of money to improve and modernise these forts, but why not make a start?  Why not ask for a certain amount each year until we can be sure that every man who is stationed in these forts will be adequately protected and will be able to give good service to his country? Deputy Corry mentioned the past three years, but he forgot to mention that the one thing about Fort Camden under foreign rule was that it contained the most modern workshops and <Col N="1207" /> machinery of the time.  Various equipment was being supplied to the Curragh and to other parts of this country from that fort.  But long before the inter-Party Government took office, the previous Government scrapped all the machinery in that fort. Even if it was derelict before that, it became a scrap-heap then.  I do not wish to criticise in any destructive fashion, but it is essential that we should understand that our soldiers must be adequately equipped and protected.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of Army payments.  I agree with the other speakers who said that it is essential that the members of the Army should be adequately paid.  I know that during the emergency years many a lad who joined our Army crossed the Border and went into the Six Counties because the pay he was receiving here was not satisfactory.  I hope that these men will be placed in a better position financially.  I realise that everything cannot be done overnight.  The Department of Defence is one Department of State in respect of which there should be full co-operation with the Minister by all the members of this House.  I ask the Minister to take this House into his confidence so that everything possible can be done to have these difficulties ironed out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned the position of the naval men in Haulbowline.  I know the area well.  I believe it would be a good thing if, as part of the training of our naval men, the Minister would provide a control system around our western seaboard and the Kerry and Cork coasts, and train our men by asking them to keep an eye on the foreigners who come within the three-mile limit.  These foreigners can often be seen poaching inside the three mile limit.  It may be said that this matter is outside the scope of the Estimate but I say that our naval men should patrol the coastline within the three-mile limit.  This would train them and at the same time it would be a means of protection for the poor, unfortunate fishermen who are being harassed so often by foreign trawlers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As time is running <Col N="1208" /> out, I shall be very brief.  I want to confine my remarks to the F.C.A.  The F.C.A. is, I think, the ideal solution to the defence problem of a nation such as ours.  It is for a small nation the ideal type of force and it is a force which can be maintained without unnecessarily interfering with the ordinary work of members who are employed in field, factory or other walks of life.  Somebody said that the F.C.A. was not as fashionable nowadays as it was during the emergency; and that people had not the same interest in the F.C.A. as they had when it was first established.  I do not agree that there is any real difference because we have the young people coming along who are equally anxious to be members of the F.C.A. if it is made sufficiently attractive and if training is so arranged that it will not unduly interfere with their work or, one might say, with their pastimes.</P>
      <P>During the emergency, members of the F.C.A. sacrificed practically all of their leisure time to take part in this emergency service.  Training in the F.C.A. might be so arranged that it would not take up so much of the time of the young men who join that voluntary force.  I think that more funds should be made available to those in charge of the F.C.A. in order to place better training facilities at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be better social life in the F.C.A.  That would be one way of making the force more attractive. Those of us who had experience in the force during the emergency found that one of the things in which we took the greatest interest and in which all the men were most keenly interested was the shooting competitions.  Unfortunately, these shooting competitions did not take place as often as the men would have liked and this was due to the fact that ammunition was not placed at their disposal.  Those competitions were something in which the men took a real interest.  While engaged in these competitions, the men were learning and they were also training themselves in one of the most essential aspects of a good defence, the ability to shoot straight.  If sufficient ammunition were placed at the disposal <Col N="1209" /> of the F.C.A. to encourage its members and enable them to take part in regular shooting competitions, in addition to the valuable experience acquired by way of shooting practice, the competitions would also be one of the best methods of holding on to those who are in the force and encouraging others to join up.</P>
    <P>I think that much more attention could be given to the tailoring of the F.C.A. uniforms.  One might say that that is not important but it is really important.  Men like to look smart, particularly when they are on parade in a force like the F.C.A.  If they had a uniform similar to that which is issued to the Army, they would appreciate it very much.  The members of the F.C.A. were particularly keen on having a peaked cap.  The Army seemed to rule against the cap and are in favour of the forage type of cap or the present beret type which is being used.  You will find that for dress purposes, anyhow, the men are particularly keen on the peaked caps.  It is only a simple matter and it would be a particularly good thing if peaked caps were introduced.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention is that in regard to men employed in factories and elsewhere.  The employers of these men should be instructed and encouraged to give every facility to their employees in regard to suitable holidays for their training.  It sometimes discourages young men from becoming members of the F.C.A. if they think that their employers would not be particularly satisfied if they had to get holidays in order to attend training at week-ends.  Employers should be encouraged to see that those men get every facility to permit of them taking part in all the duties that are necessary in the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>The matter of maintaining proper discipline in a voluntary force is a most difficult matter.  Men are free to come on parade and every means has been tried to ensure that the men adhere to some discipline, such as is done in the Army.  It is impossible to enforce the same discipline in a voluntary force as in the Regular Army.  For one thing, you have not the same grip on the men <Col N="1210" /> in a voluntary force.  I think that some means should be adopted whereby those in charge of the force would have a better grip on the members of the F.C.A. in order to enforce a little more rigid discipline which ultimately would be for the general good of the force.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people who would like to join the F.C.A. are not encouraged to do so when they see men not having the proper discipline.  The main offence in that respect is the wearing of uniforms off duty.  When you meet members of the F.C.A. wearing their uniforms or part of the uniform, which is worse, it creates a bad impression. Some means should be provided where more rigid discipline could be enforced. The F.C.A. provides an ideal solution to the defence problem in a country such as ours.  The Minister should do everything to encourage as many as possible to join the F.C.A.  In joining it, the members should get every encouragement to do their training properly and to attend their weekly and monthly parades.  They should be perfectly trained to cope with any emergency that might arise.  They should be so trained that they might be absorbed into the Regular Army or take their part in the defence programme and be as good as the members of the Regular Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long.  I should like to concur with some of the remarks passed here to-night by Deputies as regards training and equipping of an Army.  I do not think that the Deputies are really in earnest when they ask the Minister for Defence to equip that Army in such a way that it will be able to meet any invasion or any emergency. I believe myself&mdash;and I think that every Deputy in the House knows &mdash;that, in a little island such as this, it would be an utter impossibility for the Minister for Defence to get all the instruments of war and all the modern weapons of destruction which in the last two wars, and particularly in the last one, made of Europe the desperate wilderness it is to-day.  I think there ought to be no cause for anxiety as regards our Navy because we can be quite certain our shores will be well <Col N="1211" /> guarded, and, whilst they may not be guarded in our interests, they will certainly be guarded in the interests of some other nation and particularly in the interests of our nearest neighbour. I think the most we can ask the Minister to do to-night, or any future Minister, is to establish a decent standard in the Army, set up a decent well-trained Army, a well-equipped Army and, above all, a well-paid Army to guard the people's interests.  All I hope is that that Army will never be asked to do any more than that because God help our country if we are ever called to take part in a major war or defend ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this debate, above all others, should be dealt with from a non-Party point of view.  To some extent I regretted the tone of part of Deputy O'Higgins' speech inasmuch as he seemed to have an idea that there was a definite cleavage between the Opposition and the Government on the question as to whether we should have a larger standing Army or a larger F.C.A.  I think we should not allow ourselves to get into the rut of thinking that the Opposition stands for the F.C.A. and the Government stands for the Army.  That is a fateful policy, as was proved clearly in relation to agriculture, when we had the Opposition standing for tillage and the Government of the day standing for cattle, etc.</P>
      <P>We should approach this matter in a realistic way.  If we approach it in that way we will realise that we cannot have a large standing Army and that the largest Army we can have is governed by our financial resources. Our financial resources confine us to an Army of limited size.  Despite all the efforts the Minister may make the Regular Army must inevitably be a small Army.  For that reason it is essential that the other wing of our Defence Forces should be developed to its fullest extent, and that every available young man should be encouraged as a national duty to join the F.C.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> Listening to this debate, one would be inclined to conclude that Deputies are either much wiser or more foolish than the spokesmen of other nations. All over the world to-day we hear the cry that war is very close and that it is inevitable.  Here we seem to live in an atmosphere in which war appears to be very far removed from us.  Deputy Corish says that there is no immediate danger of war.  I do not know what his sources of information are on that point, but there appears to be a general feeling throughout the rest of the world that there is a real and immediate danger of war.  Anyone who studies the Press, if that can be relied on, must acknowledge that there is certainly a danger of war.  Whether that danger is real or proximate, it is difficult to discover.</P>
    <P>I think the danger does exist. Because it does exist there is an obligation resting upon the country to make our defences as perfect as they can be made in relation to our limited financial and economic resources.  The Army cannot be very large, but it can be efficient.  In that connection I will repeat what I asked last year: is everything being done to secure for our Army the most efficient equipment available?  We must all agree that the soldier here, as in every other country, cannot give of his best unless he is properly equipped.  One cannot expect the morale of an army to remain high if the officers and men realise that they are equipped with arms which do not compare favourably with those available to other nations.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, therefore, what is the purpose of our Defence Force?  Is it not to defend this country &mdash;not to defend, as Deputy Cowan said, the wealthy or the banks, but the ordinary people, their lives and their liberties?  We have seen what has happened in Czechoslovakia and in Hungary and in other countries in Eastern Europe.  We have seen how religion has been trampled under foot and human liberty destroyed.  Should it not be the first purpose of our Defence Force to prevent such things happening to our people?  Since that is true, we must ask ourselves then from what source is the danger likely <Col N="1213" /> to come?  There is no use planning the defence of our country unless we plan realistically.  We must realise that the only danger of attack is from the forces of world Communism.  People may say, as the last speaker has said, that other countries will defend us.  I think that is neither a wise nor a courageous attitude to adopt.  Other countries may endeavour to defend us or they may find themselves too busy defending their own territory to do that.</P>
    <P>We have to think not alone of attack by sea but also of attack by air.  In modern warfare it is possible, as was borne out in the last war and the possibility will be even further advanced in the next war, that our people may find themselves subjected to attack from the air and to airborne invasion, a very effective method of invasion of a country which is undefended. I think, therefore, that we should not hesitate to ask the most important of the freedom-loving nations, the United States of America, to share their equipment with us and supply us with the most modern equipment at their disposal.  If we are so supplied we can assure them that our Army with such equipment will be quite capable of defending the Twenty-Six Counties either from airborne invasion or any other type of invasion. I think that is the realistic way to approach this matter.  It is no use keeping an army merely for ornamental purposes or to raise the dignity and status of the country.  If we keep an army at all, it must be an effective army for the defence of the liberties of our people.</P>
    <P>If we intend to strengthen the F.C.A. we ought, I think, to make it a little bit more attractive to the younger generation.  There is a good deal to be said for the improvement of the uniform.  A smart uniform often promotes that efficiency and smartness which Deputy MacBride complained are lacking in the F.C.A.  I would suggest, too-possibly this idea may not meet with an enthusiastic reception&mdash; that one unit of the F.C.A. should be reserved for boys in their 'teens, in which they would find companions of their own age group with kindred interests. That would make the idea of <Col N="1214" /> army life more attractive to our younger people.  It is the younger people we should encourage into the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I have only just one observation to make.  It would be a sad reflection on our history, and on the proved capabilities of our manhood, to find that men who have passed through the stirring events of our own days should suggest that the defence of our nation should be left to others.  Such a policy would leave us wide open to occupation, not only by our enemies but also by those who profess to be our friends.  We know from the events of our own time that our nation can be organised in such a way that, at any rate, any enemies who might have designs on us would think twice before making the attempt.  With the co-operation of the Army, which is now very efficient, the F.C.A. and the other voluntary services, I have no doubt whatever that our fighting men would make the brave show here that they have always made should occasion call for it.  We can see from Press reports that all the small nations of the world to-day are organising their defences, not for an aggressive war but for their own self-protection and safety.  That is all we ask for here and I am sure, with the inspiration that has come to us from the past, the organisation which is now there, with whatever equipment is available, will enable us to defend the interests of our own land and the liberties that in our generation we have won for this part of our country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister on my own behalf and on behalf of my Party that we are always prepared to co-operate with him on matters of defence.  This is a very important Estimate and I feel that all members of the House, regardless of political leanings, are with the Minister in any sensible progressive defence programme he may consider necessary to undertake.  I believe that the F.C.A. <Col N="1215" /> provides the solution to this problem of defence because in a small country like ours a big standing Army would be very expensive and I am convinced that this country could not in ordinary times afford it.  For that reason I believe that if the Minister and the officers of his Department could concentrate on the reorganisation and building up of the F.C.A., it is the best and the most economic method of dealing with this problem.  In world conditions such as we live in, we must realise that the forces of evil are at large, forces that are opposed to our way of life&mdash;the Catholic way of life.  This being a Catholic country, I believe that it would be very easy in a period of grave emergency to unite our forces in defence of faith and fatherland.  That has been, I am glad to say, the tradition of good Irishmen down through the centuries and I believe that the present generation would answer the call just as nobly and as bravely as did our forefathers in times gone by.  For that reason it would not be prudent in my opinion to try to build up a big permanent Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable, but I am convinced that it is true that the greatest stumbling block to the building up of a Defence Force in this country arises from emigration.  That applies in a particular way to the west of Ireland. At the present time, emigration on a large scale takes place there.  That exodus has been going on for a long number of years.  The majority of our young people, boys and girls, are forced to emigrate due to bad economic conditions. You can hardly expect a migratory labourer&mdash;we have many of them in the west of Ireland and particularly in my native county&mdash;or you can hardly expect people who are unable to eke out a living at home, to be really interested in the defence of their country for the reason that they are forced, due to economic circumstances, to emigrate.  It is a sad state of affairs but it has existed in this country under successive Governments.  I suggest to the Minister here that he should use his influence with the Party to which he belongs to try to bring about a state of affairs whereby we can secure a reduction <Col N="1216" /> in the number of the young people who emigrate and to create in this country conditions under which our boys and girls can live at home and be really interested in the defence and in the welfare of the country generally.</P>
    <P>Prior to my being elected as a Deputy, I always had the impression that this question of defence was taken very seriously by this House, but I must say I have got quite a different impression here this evening.  From reading the papers I was aware that the question of defence was debated on many occasions in this House.  I was always of the opinion, and I am sure many others were, that the question was always debated in a serious way.  But after what I have seen here this evening I will be able to go to bed with my mind very much at ease that this country is in no way in danger from outside, because I observe that on the Government Benches there is just a handful of Deputies present for this important debate, so that all the loud talk over the years was just so much humbug, so much tommyrot.  The Government Party are not really interested in this debate or in the defence of this country as there are only half a dozen Deputies on the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>A short while ago Deputy Corry stated that the outgoing Government treated this question of defence with contempt.  My impression from this debate, judging by the number of Government Deputies in attendance, is that if there is any Party who treat this question with contempt it is the Government Party.  Deputy MacBride does not need anyone to defend him here.  But when Deputy Corry tries to slight or belittle the name of MacBride in this chamber or anywhere else, he is barking up the wrong tree, because the name of MacBride is respected and honoured, not alone in this country, but throughout the entire world.  As I said, it does not need a humble individual like myself to defend Deputy MacBride here, but as a Mayo man I want to say that I am proud that there is in this House a man of the name of MacBride.  In Mayo, we are proud of that name and I am sure that the Irish people at home and abroad are also proud of it. <Col N="1217" /> If the Deputy who tried to belittle the name of MacBride had as proud a record as Deputy MacBride or those who came before him I am sure he would have a lot more to say in this House.</P>

      <P>I suppose the best thing I can say is that I will have all the points that have been raised in the discussion very carefully examined and dealt with where it is possible to deal with them.  The salient point to which perhaps I should refer is that in respect of Army pay.  As far as we are concerned, the arbitration award will be honoured, and whatever amounts the Army are entitled to receive will be given to them at the earliest possible date.  It will be possible perhaps to speed that up in some respect by providing an instalment of the money in case any of the men are anxious to get it at a particularly <Col N="1218" /> carly date and the balance can be given to them later.  I can assure Deputies that it will be given with the least possible delay and that it will be dated back to the period agreed to by the Arbitration Board.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Army has been discussed by many Deputies.  Nobody will suggest for a moment that an Army of 12,700 is a large Army; it is very much less than a division.  As far as we are concerned, its purpose is to provide a sort of reservoir for the Reserve.  Without a Reserve it would be impossible for us to carry on.  If the recommendations of the Army Staff in former days had been carried out even during the period of office of the last Government we would probably have at least 6,000 or 8,000 more in the Reserve than we have to-day.  As I said when I was interrupted at the beginning, every point made by Deputies will be carefully examined, and where it is possible to give sympathetic consideration to suggestions made, I can assure Deputies that it will be given.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,917,600 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health, and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that having so recently resumed the responsibilities of Minister for Health, it is necessary for me to confine, as far as possible, my remarks on the present Estimate to a few statements.  The many major matters of policy which require decision cannot all be dealt with in the course of a few weeks, but the House will have an adequate opportunity later of considering the decisions which are taken.  I wish to repeat, however, that the Government intends to extend health services, including a mother and child service in accordance with the general intentions of the Health Act, 1947, and with the provisions of the Constitution and its social directives.</P>
      <P>I think it appropriate that I should give a résumé of the vital statistics for 1950, in view of their great significance both on health and social grounds.  The figures, I may say, are at this stage provisional.</P>
      <P>The birth-rate per 1,000 of the population for the year 1950 was 21.0 as compared with 21.5 for 1949.  While this is above the average for the decade preceding the recent war, it is the lowest rate recorded since 1941. The birth-rate for England and Wales for 1950 was 15.80 and the rate for Scotland was 17.9.</P>
      <P>The marriage-rate for 1950 was 5.4 per 1,000 of the population, the same as that for 1949.  The 1950 rate for England and Wales was 8.1 and for Scotland 7.8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The death-rate for 1950&mdash;12.6 per 1,000 of the population&mdash;was a little below the rate for the previous year but above the very low figure of 12.1 <Col N="1220" /> for the year 1948, which, incidentally, was the lowest rate ever recorded for this country.  While international comparisons of death-rates may not be quite valid, it is of interest to note that the death-rate for 1950 for England and Wales was 11.6; for Scotland, 12.4.</P>
    <P>The infant mortality rates, at 45 per 1,000 births, although still too high, is the lowest ever recorded.  It compares with a rate of 53 for 1949 and an average rate of 68 for the ten years to 1949.  The fall in the rate is attributable to some extent to the reduced mortality from diarrhoea and enteritis. The number of deaths from this disease in 1950 among children under two years of age was 256, the lowest ever recorded for this country.</P>
    <P>These figures indicate that the special measures taken in recent years with the encouragement of the Department of Health to deal with the problem of infant mortality have been effective, but the position is not yet satisfactory.  The 1950 infant mortality rate for England and Wales was 30 and for Scotland 39.</P>
    <P>Deaths from most infectious diseases were also below the figures for the previous year.  The provisional figure for deaths from all forms of tuberculosis during 1950 was 2,353, representing a death rate of 78 per 100,000 of the population, as compared with 91 and 104 per 100,000 for the years 1949 and 1948 respectively.  The rate recorded in 1950 is, I am glad to say, the lowest in our history but, like the infant mortality rate, it is still too high and the national effort to reduce it must be maintained. That there is ample room for improvement will be realised from the fact that the 1949 rate in Denmark was only 19 per 100,000 of the population, less than one quarter of our rate.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths from diphtheria was five as compared with ten during the previous year; from measles 31, i.e. 25 less than the number during 1949, and from whooping cough 60, which is less than half the number during the previous year.  Deaths from poliomyelitis, however, increased slightly from 21 in 1949 to 23 in 1950.  Deaths from influenza also increased although the recent epidemic did not reach this <Col N="1221" /> country until early in January, 1951. Deaths from this disease in 1950 numbered 307 as compared with 280 during 1949.</P>
    <P>The death-rate from cancer was 130 per 100,000 of the population in 1950, as compared with 139 for the previous year.  This figure is very high and emphasises the need for the improvement of our cancer services to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into any of the general questions because, as there is a limited time allowed, I feel Deputies should have an opportunity of using that time to the maximum extent.  I will be very happy to deal with any points that may be raised at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, appreciate the difficulty in which the Minister finds himself recommending these Estimates, which are really the Estimates of the last Government, to this House and his difficulty in framing new policies and in deciding on major policies in the very short space of time he has had since he came into office. At the same time, realising all his difficulties and also appreciating his desire not to occupy the time allotted for the discussion of this Estimate by an opening statement of any great length, nevertheless, I regret that there are one or two omissions from his statement of rather prime importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his remarks about matters of major policy, the Minister indicated that it was the intention of himself and his Department to extend the health services, including a mother and child service in accordance with the general intentions of the 1947 Health Act and with the provisions of the Constitution and its social directives. I would have wished that the Minister would have interpreted those words for the House and for me in particular.  Since the Party which now forms the Government promulgated its <Col N="1222" /> programme of 17 points, which included as its fourteenth the matter of health services to which the Minister has referred to-night, no indication has been forthcoming or given in any way as to the principles which will guide the Minister and his Department in formulating schemes for the extension of the public health services and in particular for mother and child services.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what is the purport of the phrase which the Minister repeated again to-night from the fourteenth point of the new Government's programme, that these schemes are to be formulated in accordance with the intentions of the 1947 Health Act, the provisions of the Constitution and its social directives.  I have no desire, nor have I any intention, to reopen the very painful controversy which arose about a previous so-called scheme for mother and child health services, but I do think that we are entitled to know, and the people are entitled to know, on what principle the Minister intends to formulate his new proposals for the extension of health services and particularly for the services relating to mothers and children.  What is the significance of the use of the phrase from the Constitution &ldquo;the directive principles of social policy&rdquo;?  We know, the House knows and the country knows, that in reference to the scheme for mother and child an authoritative opinion was sought from the Catholic Irish Hierarchy.  They did not give it from their own mere motion.</P>
    <P>They were asked by a then Minister of State for an express specific <i>ad hoc</i> authoritative decision on the principles which should guide a Government in formulating a scheme for a mother and child service under the then existing provisions of the Health Act, 1947. That authoritative decision is now available.  Why the shyness of the Minister and his Party in keeping away from that authoritative opinion or in referring to it in any way either in their programme or in the announcement of policy given by the Minister in his statement to-night?  We have in the Constitution these directive principles of social policy but we have in reference to this particular scheme which has caused so much controversy an <i>ad hoc</i> specific directive given <Col N="1223" /> authoritatively in answer to a request made by a then Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if it is the intention of the Government, when formulating this scheme which he has stated it is his intention to formulate, presumably at some early date, to formulate it in accordance with the directions given in the authoritative decision of the Irish Hierarchy? I want to know why the shyness?  Why is this phrase taken from the Constitution? Is it taken as a subterfuge to avoid referring to the decision of the Irish Hierarchy?  A very grave national disservice was done to this country by certain members of this House who denied the right, or challenged the duty, of the Irish Hierarchy to pronounce upon matters of faith and morals in answer to a specific query put to them on a particular topic.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that this is not what it appears to be, a mere subterfuge, something which will continue the damage which was done by those people who denied that right, and challenged the duty of the Irish Hierarchy.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons why I feel impelled to-night to intervene in this debate is because of an omission from the Minister's statement.  I realise and appreciate, as I have said, his desire to give as much time as possible to private Deputies to discuss this Estimate, but I do think that he ought to have given this House some indication of the reasons which impelled him to dissolve the joint medical committee which I set up, when acting as Minister for Health, for the purpose of formulating the best possible medical service for this country.  It appears from the newspapers, and from the proceedings of the Irish Medical Council in Galway last week, that that joint committee has been dissolved. I think that we were entitled, and that the House was entitled, when a major decision of that kind was reached by the Minister, apparently very shortly after taking up office, to have been fully informed as to the reasons which actuated that very serious action on his part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> I felt, in the conditions which subsisted at the time that I set up that joint committee, consisting of representatives of the medical staff of the Department of Health and representatives of every branch of the medical profession in this country, general practitioners and specialists of every kind, that that was the way to deal with the problem as it existed at the time.  My experience, during the course of my short time as Minister for Health, of the deliberations of that joint committee convinced me that the course which I took was the correct course, that it was the one that was best calculated to achieve beneficial results for the health of the people of this country, and of all sections of the people.  I have seen no reason since to change that view.  In the absence of any explanation from the Minister, I feel a very great deal of apprehension as to this very grave decision that he has taken, and of the effects which it will have upon any scheme which he may endeavour to formulate and put into effect in the future.</P>
    <P>I must assume, in the absence of any such explanation, that the dissolution of this joint committee which was working harmoniously, and working well in the interests of the people, was another part of the price which the Government had to pay for certain political support from certain benches in this House.  I do hope that it does not indicate anything more than that on the part of the Minister or of his ministerial policy.  I do hope sincerely that the present Minister, belonging as he does to the medical profession, will not adopt that attitude of aloofness, that attitude of disdain, that attitude of turmoil, of strife and struggle which was the characteristic of his predecessor, of the Minister in charge of the Department, before I took up that office.  I feel that the present Minister will not adopt that same attitude of strife towards the medical profession and his colleagues, and that he will realise that the only possible hope for any extension of health services in this country, and for the beneficial working of those health services in the interests of the people and in the interests of all sections of the community, is by securing the willing co-operation of the <Col N="1225" /> medical profession, of all and every section of it.  That that willing co-operation is available and is cheerfully forthcoming, is beyond all question.</P>
    <P>The principle of improving the health services has been accepted by all responsible moral and social institutions in this country.  Church and State, the members of every political Party in the State, and the medical profession are agreed upon that principle. But what the aim must be, and what must be achieved, is the working out of details which will not conflict either with moral principles or with the just requirements of the community.</P>
    <P>How is that to be achieved?  I thought when I had responsibility&mdash;I think so still&mdash;that the best way of achieving the ideals and the ideas which we all believe in, was to secure co-operation which, as I have said, is freely available and is willingly forthcoming, from the medical profession, from those who will have to work the scheme, and from those who are in a position, by reason of their specialised knowledge and lengthy experience, to give advice to the Minister, to his Department and to his officials.  I believed in the principle of co-operation in all Departments of Government while I had responsibility as Head of the Government.  I believed in consulting the interests of those people who would be affected either by proposed legislation or by the administration of any Department.  I believed in consulting the persons who would be willing, able and qualified to give advice and assistance.  I believed also in the principle of consulting those whose interests, private or public, would be affected by any act of Government or any act of administration.</P>
    <P>It was because I believed in that, and believed in it firmly, that one of my very first acts as Minister for Health was to set up this committee consisting, as I have said, of the representatives, highly qualified representatives, of the Department of Health and representatives of various sections of the medical profession.  They met and sat and worked in harmony.  During the weeks when they worked under my administration I left them alone, but I <Col N="1226" /> do know this, from a report I got just shortly before I left office, that a very considerable amount of beneficial work had been done by that body.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere of suspicion which had surrounded all discussions, the friction which had been engendered in the previous months had all passed away.  The result was that the representatives of the Department of Health and the representatives of the medical staff of the Department of Health had pooled their knowledge with that of the specialists, the general practitioners and the other qualified persons who gave freely their experience and their knowledge and their zeal to this committee and its working. A vast amount of work was done, and I believe firmly that, as a result of the discussions that went on for those weeks, a considerable number of the difficulties have been dissipated, and problems dissected.  It was reported to me that they were well on the way to producing a practical scheme for the principal cities of this country&mdash; Dublin, Cork and Galway, and that they proposed taking over other centres of population in a short time and dealing with very difficult problems relating to health and, particularly, relating to mother and child schemes for rural areas.</P>
    <P>Now, apparently, all that work is to be cast aside.  That is the price that has to be paid for the support of two, three, or perhaps more of the Independent Deputies who are keeping the Government in office.  I have no objection to that.  If the Government are prepared to pay such a price for that particular support it is their affair.  What I do object to is this, that politics have been placed before the public interest and the interests of the community.  I do certainly hope that, whatever motives may have impelled the Minister to dissolve that committee, he will avail himself of the goodwill which is forthcoming in abundance from the medical profession, notwithstanding the gross slanders, libels and lies that were disseminated about them during the past six or 12 months.</P>
    <P>That committee sat for some weeks. Their terms of reference were short <Col N="1227" /> and comprehensive.  So far as I directed them at all in their work, and I met them but once, I told them that they knew more about the problems that had to be solved than I did.  They knew the directives that had been given by the Irish Hierarchy.  Subject to those directives, I told them to bring forward the best possible health scheme they could for all sections of the community. These were the only terms of reference they had, to give their advice, to place at my disposal or that of my successor, or the then Government or any subsequent Government, the benefit of their knowledge gratuitously, voluntarily and freely and to give their advice in order that the best possible health scheme, the best possible over-all health scheme would be devised and put into operation for all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I was told in the course of the general election campaign that it had been disseminated abroad in certain of the Dublin constituencies that I had given as one of the directions to this committee that they were to have a means test for any scheme that they would put into operation.  I was denounced from platform after platform on that basis. I acquit the Minister and his colleagues of any such defamatory campaign. Those who took part in such a campaign know to whom I am referring.  One of them told me that he campaigned against me on that very basis.  I asked him where he had got the information. No such directions were given by me.</P>
    <P>This committee, as I said, and I repeat and emphasise, worked and acted in harmony.  No deliberative assembly, whether it be great or small, is worthy of its setting up or worthy of its continuance unless there is brought to bear upon the deliberations, the tasks and duties of a legislative assembly, a variety of opinions and different viewpoints. The members of such an assembly should bring forward different arguments which should be cogently put and hotly debated if you like.</P>
    <P>It is thereby that any proper decision can be arrived at, by consideration of all the difficulties and all the various points of view.  That is what this committee <Col N="1228" /> was doing.  They were meeting voluntarily, giving their services voluntarily, and the thanks they got from certain Deputies in this House was to be told that they were looking only for their own class interests and for their own pecuniary advantage.</P>
    <P>It was stated that I had handed over the fate of the mothers and children of this country to the medical profession. It was stated that I had done so because of my family connections with the profession.  I regard with nothing but contempt all of those who uttered those slanders about either me or the followers of the honourable vocation of medicine.  What I do object to, and where there is a great disservice to the public is the fact that efforts were made to disillusion the ignorant people of certain parts of this city and to pour poison into their minds for the purpose of getting a few votes here and there. Even individual members of the medical profession were lampooned and slandered from public platforms. Specialists were held up to ridicule and scorn.</P>
    <P>I may be accused, as I have been accused, of being the advocate of the medical profession.  If that accusation is made, as it probably will be, I here and now, in advance, plead guilty, freely and fully, to that charge, if it be a charge.  The medical profession is an honourable vocation.  Many of its members, individuals, have been dragged in the mire by members of this House for the purpose of catching votes.  I have been slandered, and members of the medical profession, as a whole, have been slandered.  The endeavour has been made to disillusion the people and to resurrect or to implant in the minds of certain sections of the people of the City of Dublin something very much akin to class hatred.</P>
    <P>It matters not what damage is done to me or any individual members of the medical profession.  We are strong enough to bear those slanders, and people know the value of them.  The real damage is the damage to the public interest, and that damage was done, and done to a very great extent. I hope the present Minister will undo it.  I hope that he will see the value of co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I hope that he will realise that there is available to him a vast reservoir of goodwill.  People of all kinds, with specialist knowledge in the medical profession, are ready to give their services to him and to his Department.  I do hope that this decision, to which he has not so far adverted, is merely the price that he has to pay for two or three votes in this House and does not indicate a policy of aloofness, struggle and strife, which was the dominant characteristic of the administration of one of his immediate predecessors. Schemes for the health of the people should not be made the sport of politics nor should any effort be made, by lampooning individuals or the medical profession as a whole, to gain a few votes for passing political kudos or power.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will not cast aside the services which are freely available to him.  Let it not be said, if it be the excuse for the dissolution of the Joint Medical Committee, that it is the function of his officials to advise him and that, therefore, it is better that they should not be attached to a joint committee of this kind.  I have no doubt that these very eminent officials, medical officials of his Department, officials to whom I should like, in passing, to pay a tribute for their efficiency and loyalty and service to the country, have obtained great value, much knowledge and great experience from their deliberations in this committee, that the cut and thrust of argument and discussion and the dissection of difficulties and problems has enabled them to see the difficulties in proper perspective and has enabled them to see how these problems can be grappled with and a real solution found for the various problems facing us in connection with the health service of the country.</P>
    <P>There is an ideal to be sought after, the ideal of getting the best possible health services for all sections of the community.  That is not an ideal that can be attained in a day, two days, a year, two years or even ten years, and we have to have a long-term policy and a short-term policy.  It is not by dragging around catch-cries at elections or putting them on posters to be <Col N="1230" /> carried around by women at election meetings that we are going to secure the best possible scheme.  It is by getting the best possible advice from those who know, from those who have worked amongst the people, who are familiar with the problems and who know the kind of solutions that can only be effective and made to work that you can get any sort of health service that will be of any use to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>This joint committee had done useful work.  It pointed the way through the difficulties and showed how it could be done in Dublin, Cork and Galway. There was no scheme in existence here during the course of the general election for mother and child or anything else.  There was nothing but a political catch-cry, nothing but broad, general outlines with no details worked out.  In the City of Dublin, there was no co-operation secured from the three maternity hospitals, but the catch-cry of the &ldquo;free for all and no means test&rdquo; was waved before the people and the medical profession was slandered and defamed for the purpose of securing votes.  I believe the Minister will not carry out that policy.  If he does not and if he goes in the way which we believe is the right way, he will secure our support and active co-operation.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which extension of health services can be secured. The mother and child principle has been mentioned by the Minister and the directive principles of social justice have also been mentioned by him.  May I direct the Minister's attention and the attention of some of the Deputies to one of the phrases in one of the directives on social policy in the Constitution? One of these directives is that the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.  To those who spent their time defaming me, the members of the medical profession and the medical profession as a whole, I commend that phrase in the Constitution.  They are members or would-be members of what is probably the paramount institution in this State, <Col N="1231" /> the Parliament of the people, and if justice and charity are, in accordance with these directive principles of social policy, to inform the institutions of this House and Parliament, they ought to inform the actions and words of each member of this House.</P>
    <P>I brought away from my short period with the Department of Health one paramount impression, apart from the fact that that Department had loyal, faithful and efficient servants at the disposal of the people, and anything I may say now is not in any way to be taken as in the remotest degree reflecting upon them, their efficiency, their loyalty or the great public service they have given and are prepared to give to the people and to any Government which represents for the time being the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I did notice that there was, in the course of the day-to-day administration of this Department, being done, by administrative action, something which was, slowly, no doubt, but steadily and surely, leading to socialised medicine. I have nailed my colours to the mast long ago on the question of socialised or State medicine.  I will have nothing to do with it, in or out of Government, and I will do everything in my power to see that no Government or anybody with whom I am associated does anything which will bring about, or in any way help, the cause of socialised or State medicine.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Department, in the course of its administration, whatever head it may have had, with the possible exception of one, had no notion that it was heading in its administration policy towards socialised State medicine, but look at the number of salaried medical officials scattered throughout the State at present&mdash;surgeons, medical doctors, obstetricians, pediatricians, all the various specialised services and all being subjected to the system of salaries, the system of control by nonprofessional people who have not the knowledge, experience or training to fit them to deal with matters which these specialists and general practitioners have to deal with in the course of their work.  They are rapidly becoming <Col N="1232" /> form-fillers, civil servants, to the detriment of the professional work they ought to be doing for the people. The Minister ought to watch that tendency very closely to see that the actions of these professional men, whether in the public service throughout the country, under local authorities or otherwise, are not either confined or limited by the crippling action of bureaucracy, or by the necessity for complying with the manifold regulations of the Department, in their professional work and the work for the benefit of the sick, the poor and the insane whom they have under their care.</P>
    <P>There is one other, somewhat of a personal, matter which I wish to mention on this Estimate.  Very shortly before the general election campaign was about to start, I received a deputation from the nurses' organisation representing nurses and midwives.  They put before me their case for increased remuneration and betterment of conditions.  I can say now, as I did not say then, that I am, and was, entirely sympathetic towards the point of view they put forward.  I declined to take any action because of the pendency of the general election and a possible change of Government, because it might be said, if I expressed my sympathy or did what I could well have done, directed an increased remuneration and a betterment of their conditions of service, that I was doing it solely for political purposes.  I think I can rely on the present Minister to deal sympathetically with the claims of these nurses for increased remuneration and betterment of conditions and to give kind consideration to the claims for increased remuneration and betterment of conditions of midwives.</P>
    <P>The last thing I wish to put forward as a point for the Minister's consideration is that he should take into sympathetic consideration the position of the jubilee nurses.  They have rendered very good service to the poor people throughout the country, and particularly in the poorest sections along the western seaboards.  They do not quite know how they stand at the present time.  I believe it was never the intention of my predecessor as Minister for Health in any way to put an end <Col N="1233" /> to those services or do anything that would act to their detriment.  I would be glad if the Minister would give an assurance that they will be looked after and that their services will be availed of in the future as they have been in the past.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House has listened to the speech Deputy Costello has made with its usual respect for his powers of oratory, but let that speech be examined and what do we find?  We find that under the 1947 Act provision was made for the establishment of a mother and child scheme and steps were taken to implement that provision.  We know that the medical profession opposed the mother and child scheme, and were violent in their opposition to it.  We also know that they were in conflict with Deputy Dr. Browne, the Minister for Health, on whom the responsibility in implementing that particular scheme rested.  I do not want to go into recent history in all its details.  We do know that Deputy Dr. Browne was removed from office; we do know there was a general election and we do know that the Government that removed Deputy Dr. Browne from office was itself removed from office.  Those are the simple facts of the case.  Some Deputies who are styled Independent Deputies in the House here, voted for and brought about the change of Government, simply because of the attitude of the last Government in regard to the mother and child scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision of Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Health, in dissolving this joint medical committee that was set up by the previous Government after Deputy Noel Browne's services were lost as a Minister&mdash;for the time being, at any rate&mdash;to the State.  I agree with Deputy Costello that this State wants the best possible over-all health scheme, to include the mother and child scheme and many other schemes that can follow from the Health Act of 1947; but I do not agree that the best people to formulate that scheme are the doctors.  When Deputy Dr. Browne ceased to be Minister, there was rejoicing in the Irish Medical Association and when those people who <Col N="1234" /> had obstructed him in every way were invited to go down to the Custom House and to formulate a new scheme, they went there feeling victorious in their fight against their colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne.  Can anyone imagine that they were the best people to formulate a mother and child scheme that would benefit the ordinary people?  Were they to formulate a scheme that would benefit the people as a whole or would benefit their own profession?  I would like to know what reports they made.  What are those marvellous reports that they submitted to the last Minister for Health, the last Taoiseach, Deputy Costello? I should like Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Health, to make those reports available.  Let us see what the results of those conferences in the Custom House were and what real steps they took towards the establishment of an acceptable mother and child scheme.</P>
    <P>Health&mdash;public health &mdash; is the problem that is before us at the moment.  Many problems have been faced by society, not only here but elsewhere, in the past.  When it was a matter of dealing with the landlords, with the iniquities of landlordism, of trying to improve the position of tenants, was it a committee of landlords that was set up to do that? When child labour was to be ended in the mines and in the industries, was it the capitalist employers of the children who were to be set up as the committee to deal with that evil?  In this, we find a committee of members of the Irish Medical Association sent down to the Custom House, vested with all the powers they require to make a scheme that would be beneficial to the ordinary people of this country.  It would take more than Deputy Costello's oratorical powers to put that over on the people.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister took steps to dissolve that committee and I hope that, in accordance with the principles of the 1947 Act, he will establish a scheme that will provide a mother and child scheme for this country without a means test.  After all, where the people did get an opportunity of speaking on that in the recent general election they spoke on it in no <Col N="1235" /> uncertain manner and those of us who did stand for a mother and child scheme without a means test were elected.</P>

I am sure that some of the big vote that Deputy Oliver Flanagan received in Laois-Offaly can be attributed to his support of Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>

He made it perfectly clear that because of the administrative and other difficulties there was only one way it could be and that was without a means test.</P>

      <P>As I was saying when Deputy Flanagan interrupted, I was delighted that the Minister did what he did, and I hope that he will follow the line of his own argument in this House when the 1947 Health Act was going through: that there would be a mother and child scheme and that it would be put into operation without a means test.  Why should any father of a family, any husband whose wife requires essential medical treatment, have to go before a local authority or Government official and disclose to him all his private means and circumstances, his mortgages and his debts, in order to get the medical treatment that is essential for his wife?  Why similarly should a father whose child requires expert medical attention have similarly to expose his whole private condition to the person who comes along and asks what he earns and owns, and what he has to support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look on that means test as an iniquitous thing.  I have always condemned that means test, whether it be in social welfare with regard to old age pensions or otherwise, and I am glad to know that in condemning that means <Col N="1238" /> test I have the support of the organised trade unionists of this country behind me.  Deputy Flanagan might consider that apart entirely from a document which was sent privately to the Head of the Government, there has been no teaching by any bishop in this country on the mother and child scheme without a means test, no teaching that would bind any Catholic in this country, and Deputy Flanagan is welcome to find an answer to that anywhere he likes.  I cannot be bound and nobody else can be bound by documents sent secretly that are not part of the teaching as teaching should be done.</P>
    <P>When I said recently, dealing with this matter at a public meeting, that now that the election was over I was prepared to deal with it with anybody who wanted to raise it with me there was an immediate disappearance into the trenches, there were no further attacks, no further onslaughts.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>
    <P>This mother and child scheme without a means test is a very big issue.  It resulted in one Minister leaving the Government; it resulted in the defeat of a Government.  The country is adamant, if I understand it aright, that it wants a mother and child scheme without a means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement from the Minister that there is no health scheme in being at the moment, but I also share Deputy Costello's apprehensions on the dissolution of the Health Council.  I naturally feel that the possibility of the return of the Browne scheme, on account of the political developments that have taken place in the last month, is possible.  I had the privilege as a doctor of being present at the biggest collection of Irish medical men that ever took part at a meeting in Dublin. At that meeting we had general practitioners, dispensary doctors, private practitioners and specialists in all shades and walks of their profession and unanimously we were agreed that <Col N="1239" /> the Browne health scheme was absolutely a flop from every angle.  It was unworkable.  It was unworkable for the reason that we had not the hospital facilities in this country to cover it.  It was unworkable for the reason that we had not the staff to cover it, and it was also unworkable for the same reason that the health scheme is failing in Britain to-day, that we have not the money to run that scheme.  It might have been a civil servant's dream.  It might have been all right on paper but as far as the doctors were concerned and as far as the nurses were concerned and I can assure you that as far as the patients were concerned it was no dream for them.  It was the most unworkable and unsatisfactory scheme that could ever have been conceived. I would even go further and say that it was not a scheme at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan took the opportunity, when he was speaking a few moments ago, to offer a gratuitous insult to the profession to which I have the honour to belong.  He suggested that the relations that existed between the landlords and the tenants are the same relations that exist between the doctors and the patients.  If there is any medical man listening to me in this House to-night, be he a specialist or a general practitioner, or whatever walk he comes from in the profession, he will know, and the people in this country who have been attended by doctors will know, that the relations between the doctor and the patients are relations of friendship.  He will also know&mdash;and if he does not know I am going to tell him here to-night&mdash; that the Dublin specialists work for four and five hours every day in our public hospitals and institutions, for which they do not get one shilling in return.  I am stating that because Deputy Dr. Browne, in his public utterances with regard to my profession, let it go out to the general public that there was no free treatment for people in Dublin, in rural Ireland, or, in fact, in any part of the country whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a few suggestions, as one who has practised in rural Ireland for a great many years, with <Col N="1240" /> regard to our health scheme.  As a doctor, I feel that it is necessary for us in Ireland to have the best medical services we can get for the unborn children who are going to form our race in the future.  We want an ante-natal service&mdash;but a workable ante-natal service&mdash;run as a practical scheme.  Already in our bigger towns &mdash;in Waterford, Cork, Dublin and Limerick&mdash;we have ante-natal clinics. I suggest to the Minister that in every town with a population of over 3,000 we should have an ante-natal clinic.  If the Minister wants a good example of such a clinic I suggest that the next time he travels in his constituency he should stop at Arklow and go into the clinic there&mdash;a clinic, I might add <i>en passant,</i> that exists by the generosity of the Countess of Wicklow, who had it built and equipped at a cost of £3,500.</P>
    <P>This clinic is serviced by the jubilee nurses to whom Deputy Costello has referred and who are doing good work up and down the country.  In this particular case, the jubilee nurse, instead of having to go round from morning till night on ante-natal work, has the facilities, thanks to the generosity of the Countess of Wicklow, which enable her to deal with the people who come to the clinic.  As a result, the death-rate and the ante-natal and post-natal troubles of the women and children in that area have diminished considerably.  I suggest that the Minister should adopt the idea of having an ante-natal clinic in all towns with a population of over 3,000 if it is going to cost only £3,500 to build a clinic such as the clinic at Arklow and a house for the jubilee nurse, who services it, to live in.  The county council supply the clinic at Arklow with free calcium, free Virol and free cod liver oil&mdash;the essential ingredients for ante-natal and post-natal work.  The county council pay the local dispensary doctor for his attendance there once a week.  Record sheets are kept and the necessary tests, essential to a woman when she is in that condition, are gone through.  That is one of the things we could have in this country.  We do not need any means test for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan is worried about a means test.  We do not need any means <Col N="1241" /> test for clinics such as the clinic at Arklow.  Anybody who wishes is free to go to see it&mdash;I have checked it up carefully&mdash;anybody who goes to the clinic at Arklow is, in the majority of instances, a necessitous person requiring free treatment.  Nobody is forbidden to go there.  Anybody is free to go who pleases.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he begin at the bottom of the ladder.  Our dispensary system in Ireland may be a bit obsolete but it is not as obsolete as that.  It has served a function here for a great number of years.  The Minister's first aim and object should be to put these dispensaries into decent working order.  I am not a dispensary doctor but from time to time I have serviced a dispensary.  In one dispensary in particular which I call to mind, I was obliged to mix bottles of medicine for patients with what was tantamount to bog water.  There was no water laid on in that dispensary: there was no decent lighting or heating and there was no waiting-room.  In another dispensary in a town with a population of 5,000, the patients were standing on the roads in the winter months.  I mention that in order to point out some of the things which I believe are essential in Ireland to-day. The best place to start is at the bottom of the ladder.  Instead of talking about free medical services for all, let us talk in a rational and sensible way.  Let us get a health service together&mdash;an ante-natal clinic and a decent dispensary service.</P>
    <P>I come now to nurses.  With the exception of the jubilee nurses, the Lady Dudley nurses who function in the West, we have not in Ireland to-day these nurses at our disposal. Deputy Dr. Browne's scheme envisaged enormous health centres and clinics everywhere.  Where was he going to get the nurses?  I know he could not get them.  They do not exist.  The scheme I suggest is feasible to work with the nurses that exist already.  If nurses have to go down and work in remote parts of the country&mdash;they are only human people, the same as anybody else&mdash;they will want a decent salary and a decent standard of living. You cannot expect highly and well-trained <Col N="1242" /> girls to accept service in the Irish medical service and live in a remote part of Ireland if they have not sufficient financial remuneration to enable them to get about occasionally and get a bit of entertainment.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words now with regard to the Irish Bishops.  Why did the Irish Bishops intervene in Deputy Dr. Browne's scheme?  They intervened in Deputy Dr. Browne's scheme &mdash;and the Deputies opposite, no doubt, will agree with what I say as well as the Deputies who are sitting behind me on these benches&mdash;because it was their lawful duty to do so.  They intervened because they wanted to preserve the sanctity of the home.  They wanted to preserve the Heaven-sent right of the mother and father to safeguard the health of their children.  They did not want the State to adopt the position of usurping the function of the parents. It was their duty to do so and I am proud, as an Irish Catholic, to say they did right.  Why in Soviet-controlled countries and in Communist China are the bishops, the priests and the clerics paying the extreme penalty?  Because they are espousing the principles which the Bishops of Ireland espoused, the principles of freedom.</P>
    <P>This question is grossly misunderstood. Decent people, not of our religion, believe this was some form of Catholic interference.  It was not. The Hierarchy were simply standing up for the rights of free people everywhere, no matter what their religion, be it Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. It is no great thing to have to say about the free world, and to know that some portion of the Press in this country.  I regret to say, and in other countries thought fit to throw mud at them and accuse them of trying to use the situation for their own interests. If this country is misfortunate enough ever to become conquered or overcome in a time of aggression, who will you have to stand as the voice of freedom? You will have the Irish Bishops. As they stood on this question they will also stand on other matters appertaining to freedom.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say except to assure the Minister, as a medical man and as a member of the Irish Medical Association, that he will have <Col N="1243" /> from this side of the House and from me as a doctor all the co-operation we can give him to further and improve the welfare and the health of the mothers and children of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put before the Minister a few points which occur to me as an ordinary member of a public assistance committee.  I do not speak with the legal training of Deputy Costello, nor with the authority on Church matters that Deputy Cowan professes to have, but I feel that I can indicate the view of the ordinary local representative of a committee whose function it is to look after the health of the inhabitants of our area.</P>
      <P>One thing that struck me was that in dealing with those who suffered from tuberculosis we were inclined to overlook many of the illnesses that beset us in the country.  The Minister, in his opening statement to-day, drew attention to the serious fact that deaths from cancer have seriously increased. He has indicated that it is his intention to give more time and, I presume, more money to combating this dreadful scourge.  I would plead with him to keep his promise in that regard because whatever the number of deaths from tuberculosis there is no relation to the dreadful pains and sufferings of those who have the misfortune to die from cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem which we on the local authority find is pressing very seriously on us and that is the problem of children who are mentally deficient.  These, because of the scarcity of homes or places in homes where they can be taught and educated, and sometimes possibly taught a trade, are placed in an unenviable position.  We have quite a large number of children on the waiting list and each year their chances of receiving the greatest benefits from these hospitals are dwindling. I understand that there is very little hope that any of those on the waiting list in my constituency will find a place for the next four or five years.  In one case so acute was the problem that I know of an infant of only 12 months who had to be placed in the care of the mental hospital.  I think it is an indictment <Col N="1244" /> of our Health Department that we have not a place suitable for these children or that we are not likely to have a place for them in the near future.  I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to indicate&mdash;I am aware it will be of special interest to many other local authorities &mdash; what plans there are or what plans he intends to make for the care of these mentally deficient children.</P>
    <P>Another matter is that in a number of small sanatoria set up under county councils the patients are left to lie there for quite long periods, awaiting transfer to regional hospitals.  Very little medical attention can be given to them that is of any great use and because of the want of something to occupy their time, such as instruction in some handicraft like basket-making, leather work, making gloves or handbags, time lies heavily on their hands. Because of the weariness of the long day and very often of the long night they reach a stage that their rest rather than being of assistance to them is actually a handicap.  We had an unfortunate experience in my constituency. The Irish Countrywomen's Association volunteered a free teacher who would attend a number of evenings per week and instruct those patients so that they could occupy their time.  The offer was turned down because of some red tape rule or regulation.  I feel that anyone who is willing to help those people who lie in hospitals should not be strangled by any regulation or by any sub-regulation of the Department or by any rule of a county medical officer.</P>
    <P>Since this debate began, I was hoping to hear advocated the cause of one section who served the interests of health in this country.</P>
    <P>Up to now I am afraid it has not been stated.  I refer to the midwives who work for the local authorities. These are so ill-paid and so ill-treated in relation to holidays and allowances that in many cases vacancies cannot be filled because there are no applicants for the posts.  Surely it is not unreasonable to suggest that a midwife in charge of a district extending over 15 miles should be given a mileage rate sufficient to enable her to run a car.  A mileage is at present paid to subsanitary <Col N="1245" /> officers and to sub-health officers, together with a six weeks' university course, to equip them to inspect houses with a view to tenancy lettings.  Surely the work of bringing a worker's child into the world and of saving the life of the worker's wife is more important than the letting of a county council cottage.  The health inspector who may visit such a cottage on three or four occasions will probably get 6d. per mile allowance for his motor car.  The midwife will have to travel on a bicycle, in a donkey and cart or in whatever mode of conveyance the husband can provide for her. Should she hire a car that car will have to be paid for out of the pocket of the worker whose wife and child she is attending.  I think that position ought to be remedied.  Its solution is not an impossible task.</P>
    <P>In 1950 Deputy Dr. Browne, then Minister for Health, outlined a sevenyear building programme for hospitals. What progress has been made with that programme?  In my constituency in Waterford we have been promised a district hospital since 1934.  The building of that hospital has been put back for ten or 15 years.  We were told to carry out reconstruction work to tide us over.  If the Minister will check the files of his Department he will discover that our architects, our quantity surveyors and our local representatives are unanimous in informing the Minister and his officials that money spent on the reconstruction of the hospital in Waterford will be money thrown down the drain.  Our county surveyor offered, if it would convince the Minister, to resign his position so that money would not be thrown away.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider the decision in connection with Waterford hospital?  Linked with that is the question of maternity hospitals at Lismore and Dungarvan.  Is the policy of the last Minister to continue, the policy that only certain named hospitals will be built over the next seven years?  If that policy is to continue we have very little hope of satisfying an urgent need in providing maternity facilities for the working people around Lismore and Dungarvan.  I hope the Minister will see his way to reconsidering the present position and allowing <Col N="1246" /> even a limited number of maternity hospitals to be built, not only in my constituency but in other constituencies also where the need is equally great.</P>
    <P>Because most Deputies will seek an opportunity of saying a few words in this debate and because our time is limited, I will follow the good example set by the Minister and come to a speedy conclusion.  In connection with the mother and child scheme, I believe there is need for such a scheme.  I believe that scheme should be as wide and as free as possible and should embrace all the people who may need it.  I appeal to the present Minister, as I would have appealed to the last Minister had I had an opportunity to do so, to let us have that scheme with the goodwill and the blessing of the Church.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like briefly to refer to a couple of points to discover the Minister's views in regard to them. My first point concerns the county homes.  Shortly after taking office as Minister for Health, which, strangely enough, embraced responsibility for looking after the county homes, I took an opportunity of visiting many of them.  Following on that visit I gave vent to a violent condemnation of what I considered then to be the scandalous conditions under which our old people spent the closing years of their lives.  I spoke in perfect honesty at the time. Possibly I spoke too much from my heart and too little from my head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are particular instances where Christian local authorities have taken steps to improve the situation but, generally speaking, I gathered the impression that we lagged far behind the conditions and standards which could be rightly demanded by a community so complacent in its professions of Christianity and its adherence to the Christian way of life.  In order to find out whether I was exaggerating the conditions which prevailed generally, I established, with the consent of the Government&mdash;and this is a matter upon which I doubt if there will be any difference of opinion&mdash;a committee of civil servants to investigate conditions in our county homes.  Civil servants are not prone to emotion or to sentimentality. <Col N="1247" /> They are concerned merely with hard work and fact-finding in spite of what many people believe.  They set about their task diligently and conscientiously, and in due course they presented me with a report from which I got little satisfaction when I discovered that it largely corroborated many of the general impressions that I myself had received in my visits to these institutions.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned at this stage with criticism of those conditions.  I merely want to inquire from the Minister whether he has yet had an opportunity&mdash;it is possible that he has not&mdash; of reading this document and studying it, and whether he has considered the recommendations contained therein, and whether he will obtain the sanction of the Government for the implementation of those recommendations, recommendations involving the expenditure of a good deal of money, in order to bring our county homes somewhere near that level which any community professing Christianity should expect to find within the confines of their State.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell further on this particular point because I do not believe that it would help just at the moment but I can assure the Minister and the House that I propose to return again, and yet again, to this problem on every possible opportunity that presents itself and where the opportunity does not arise, I shall do my best to make it arise because I am satisfied that we should be thoroughly ashamed of the conditions under which many of our people are living.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that we should take it upon ourselves to encourage the Government, and if necessary to drive the Government, to tackle this problem as a matter of urgency, to see that these institutions are properly equipped, heated and properly ventilated, that lifts are provided where necessary, and that proper kitchens with proper kitchen equipment and proper staffs are provided.  To a limited extent I attempted to eliminate, as far as I could, the appalling prevailing sense of pauperism which exists in these institutions, relics of 100 or 200 <Col N="1248" /> years ago, when the Governments of those times deliberately set about to bring this atmosphere of pauperism into the lives of those of our people who were not blessed with worldly wealth. It is a tradition which I certainly shall work towards eliminating from out our life.  As I say, it is a tallish order.  To a certain extent, I must accept blame for not having got more done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister will accept it that there is a very serious problem there.  It is an extensive one and I am quite certain that our Government will face it as such and feel that any money would be well spent, and rightly spent, in improving the lot of these people.  They are a section of the community who have little voice in our affairs.  I do not think they matter very much from the voting point of view, or from a purely sordid political point of view, but they are one of our responsibilities and we have tended to neglect them up to the present.  Admittedly past Governments have had serious and very big problems to deal with, but I do not think that that should exculpate future Governments or the present one, from tackling the problem in an energetic and conscientious way or from doing something to right the very serious wrongs which exist at present.</P>
    <P>I have not had the opportunity or the experience of Deputy Dr. Esmonde of attending the meeting of the mutual admiration society in Galway, or wherever it was held, of the medical profession.  I happen to be a doctor and it is probably useful that I should say that we should not allow ourselves to be carried away by the perfervid oratory of a doctor who thinks that all doctors are fine fellows.  I think we should approach the problem of our health services in a reasonable and rational way.  So far as I am concerned, I share the views of Deputy Costello, the views of all of us here in this House, that we must have the best possible services for our people.  Where we differ&mdash;and many of us differ pretty violently on occasion&mdash;is as to the methods whereby we can achieve this objective of the best possible service for our people irrespective of wealth.</P>
    <P>I believe that the medical profession <Col N="1249" /> contains just the same proportion of saints and angels, good, hard-working members, lazy, slothful, dishonest, corrupt, conscientious and sincere human beings as there are in any other branch of society&mdash;whether they be carpenters, butchers, bakers or any other section of the community.  It is about time that we got out of our heads the idea that just because a man's people had enough wealth to put him through a university and to make him a doctor, he suddenly had a halo put around his head and acquired certain standards and certain principles of behaviour which render him a man apart from all human beings.  I think that is an idea that should be exploded.  We are no better in that regard than anybody else in this House.  We work because we are paid to work.  We employ the ability we acquired in the pursuit of our profession and we see that we get fairly well paid in the process.</P>
    <P>I was naturally very glad to know that the Minister had the courage to act as a Minister should in this matter.  As a doctor, he may not share the same views as I have.  It is one of the principles of democracy that we can all differ if we wish, but I am glad to see that he had the courage to decide to remove these people from the Custom House where they were enthroned by the previous Minister for Health, the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Costello. They had, of course, no right whatsoever to usurp the powers of the man appointed by this House to act as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Medical Association is a trade union.  It has all the rights of any trade union, to fight for improved working conditions, higher pay, better wages and better salaries for its members. It has the right to go to Ministers, to make representations to Governments, to recommend increased salaries, improved working conditions and all these other things, but it has no right to trample on this House.  It can make recommendations to the Minister and he has a perfect right, if he wishes to do so, to reject these recommendations.  The previous Minister for Health had no right whatever to hand over his authority to these people as he would have had no right to hand over to Deputy Seán Dunne <Col N="1250" /> of the Labour Party, liberty to go to the Department of Agriculture and run that Department, or to Deputy Larkin to go to the Department of Industry and Commerce to run the industry of the country.  What right had these people for special consideration over farm labourers, industrial workers, technicians or carpenters?  Until he has been given such powers by this House, no Minister can delegate his power to these officials.  So long as I am here I shall fight for the supremacy of the Oireachtas against the medical profession or any vested interest which tries to usurp the powers of this House.</P>
    <P>As I say, we shall probably have an opportunity of discussing the mother and child scheme at a later date.  If it is intended to bring a means test into the scheme, I am advised that it will need legislation, and we shall have an opportunity of discussing that legislation. For the information of the Minister, I may tell him that I propose to vote against any legislation that will introduce a means test.  Forewarned is forearmed possibly.  I think the people generally know me well enough to know that I would not accept and will not accept this ridiculous 18th century incubus being imposed on the people; that they are to have these inquisitions and inquiries as to whether they have this money or that money.  I do not mind whether it is done by the doctor or not.  It is all the same.  It is inquiring into the private life of people.  I want a service available to men, women and children just because they are sick&mdash; the same standard of service, not one for the rich and one for the poor.  I assert that there is such a service at present.  I object to the means test for many reasons, and I will give them later on if there is a debate on the subject. Firstly, I think that administratively it is stupid, it is idiotic and will not work in time.  Secondly, I believe that it is medically a bad principle.  I believe that medically it is not a question of what I believe or think or what airy fairy notions I have.  The fact is that you have a dispensary red ticket system, which is a bad system, and, on the other hand, you have the nursing homes, the private beds, the private wards and consulting rooms.  If you <Col N="1251" /> want to see the difference, go to Deputy Esmonde's dispensary, and then go to a Merrion Square consulting room and see if there is any difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave Deputy Flanagan to make his own speech.  It is all very well to blind your eyes to this.  It would be nice for me to get up and say nice things about my own profession.  It is no fun to have to say these things, but I am facing realities and facts.  As far as I am concerned, I have been sick a long time, and I have never received anything but the greatest kindness, courtesy and care from my medical colleagues.  But that is not the point.  It is not a question of how you are treated or I am treated. It is a question of how the underprivileged, the poor man, the man who has nobody behind him, who has no wealth behind him, no power behind him is treated.  These are the considerations which must be faced.</P>
      <P>The Medical Association naturally did not like my scheme.  How could they like it?  They probably would not get paid as much under my scheme as they are getting paid at present.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde said that I had made a certain statement about doctors.  I did not.  I made it quite clear that they are no worse than any other section. I think that generally speaking our general practitioners do a fairly good job, but if we are to have a first-class health service we must eliminate the differences between the two types of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately I believe we will have a full-time salaried service.  I know that is unpopular with my medical colleagues. But I am certain that it will come, and it will depend on the social development of our State whether it will come quickly or slowly.  We are living in the same T. model stage of social development as any young State. We are taking on the same levels, the same divisions as existed in England and other nations which are already growing out of these things and casting them aside as providing an indifferent service and reducing the quality of <Col N="1252" /> existing services.  I think that for the time being the full-time salaried medical officer would not give us the best service.  I think Deputy Costello was hardly kind or fair to the full-time officers throughout the country who are doing a pretty good job in difficult circumstances at present.  When I say that, I do not think the full-time salaried officer is likely to be desirable at present though it may be the ultimate ideal.  We must remember that everybody in this House is a salaried man. The man who works for his salary is not a new institution; it is not a new idea.  Why should not a doctor work just the same as a teacher or a T.D. or a civil servant or a shopkeeper?</P>
    <P>There is a lot of nonsense talked about the doctor-patient relationship. That relationship is an important thing.  But there is no reason in the world why it should be interfered with or why it should be altered just because under a State service you do not happen to have to hand over £5 or £2 2s. to a doctor; that it is done by the local authority or by the State. Why should that interfere with the doctor-patient relationship?  The fact that you hand over the money or that the State hands over the money, why should that interfere with a doctor's treatment of you or your respect for him?  I do not think that it would interfere.</P>
    <P>As I said, I believe that ultimately we will have a full-time salaried medical service even if we do not want it. The fact that there has been such a development across the water will inevitably mean that most of our young doctors who are being taught to take part in a full-time service will accept it as perfectly normal and natural. They will come back here and these ideas will be accepted.  As I say, it is a thing which will come by evolution and will take time, but it is inevitable and cannot be avoided by the Medical Association or by any inept, incapable or indecisive Government.</P>
    <P>It is likely that we will be discussing this matter again, but it is worthy of note, first of all, in relation to the mother and child scheme that Deputy Costello stated that there was no such scheme, that it did not exist at all, and various other things.  The fatuity <Col N="1253" /> of such a suggestion from a man who was head of a Government which voted the best part of £1,000,000 for the scheme hardly bears examination or listening to.  As the same man negotiated as an advocate for such a service with the Medical Association on his own admission, that takes a little bit of believing or accepting from one for whom we have the right to have a certain amount of respect.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde suggested that the equipment was not there, that the hospitals were not there and the staff was not there. It would be interesting to know, if there is a limitation in staff, a limitation in equipment, a limitation in hospital services, who is getting the services at the moment.  Would it not be correct to suggest that in many cases the people who are getting the services at present are the people who can pay for them, the people who have money?  Even if there was a limitation of hospitals, nobody has suggested that there is any limitation in the number of doctors throughout the country who would be available for this service.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the Oireachtas in 1947 laid it down that there shall be no means test in the mother and child scheme.  It is also important to remember that nowhere throughout their condemnation of my scheme did the Hierarchy object to this scheme because there was no means test.  There was no specific mention throughout their condemnation of a means test as such.  The only people who objected and passed resolutions against this scheme because it had no means test were the Medical Association. It is the Medical Association that we are fighting here on behalf of the people.  It is they who attempted unsuccessfully to usurp and to repudiate the will of this House, and it was in defence of the will of this House and the supreme authority of this House that I took the steps I did take at that time.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I would like to refer to the Minister.  It is in connection with the salaried officers whom the Medical Association are very anxious to remove from their posts.  One of the most satisfactory things which we had the pleasure and privilege of doing in the Department <Col N="1254" /> of Health was the establishment of full-time salaried officers of a very high level, specialist level.  We intended to carry out extension of this service.  We started off with a thoracic surgery service. It was the intention to develop an orthopædic service, then as Deputy Costello suggested, gradually to develop pediatric, gynæcological, obstetrical and radiological services, and to have such schemes on a regional basis. That is an excellent idea, and one that will materialise in time, I am certain, but it looks as if the Medical Association are anxious to destroy that proposition at this early stage.</P>
    <P>The House does not have to accept my word or my suggestion or my view on this.  The realities are these, that we started two and a half to three years ago to do something in relation to thoracic surgery in this country. The position was&mdash;I myself knew it only too well&mdash;that it was not possible for a man who did not have money, outside two sanatoria in the country, to obtain essential major thoracic surgical operations which might save his life, and at that time we set about establishing a regional thoracic surgical service which is now in being. Most Deputies are probably aware that in that service, probably one of the few things in which we are, we in Ireland are right up in the European class.  Our people can feel quite satisfied that as far as this particular State service or public service, whatever you like to call it, is concerned, we have as good as there is in Europe and I think as good as there is in the world.  In that service there are full-time officers doing a great job and saving plenty of lives.  The extension of that service to orthopædics has begun and the Medical Association are anxious to destroy it.  The idea is that they want to save some jobs for their friends who used in the old days travel from Dublin, Cork, Galway or Limerick, wherever the family cliques and rings were, and take these county jobs whenever they had the time to collect the five guineas or whatever it was. That is the blank truth.  It is not very pleasant.  I fought it successfully in the thoracic business and was in the process of doing so in the orthopædic business.  I wanted to do it in the case <Col N="1255" /> of every branch and if God gave me the opportunity to get back again as Minister for Health I would pursue that policy to its logical conclusion, so that we would have what we profess to want, the best medical service for all our people, irrespective of whether they have money or not.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made in recent months to stay the progress of this Department towards the ideal which it should be the intention and the object of every member of this House to achieve, that is, that in that part of our life where the health of our people is concerned we should not start to readopt the old ideas, the old social forms of the people who left 30 years ago, when the community was divided into the people with money and the people without money, the haves and the have-nots.  Where did we get this idea that we, a people who 30 years ago all belonged to the same level, the same social class, the same economic class, should now start to divide up our community again in respect of our health services?  Personally, as far as that is concerned, I consider it to be a major political issue, which I hope we will have an opportunity of discussing more fully at a later date, because to me it involves a division: on one side the people who showed themselves so clearly in the election to be the adherents of the old régime, the old ways, the ways of privilege, the ways of wealth, the ways of the rich against the poor, the ways of the strong against the weak.  As long as I am in this House, unashamedly, no matter what it may cost in votes, popularity or prestige, I will fight those people as long as there is breath in my body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The regrettable controversy which has raged in the country over the last few months over the mother and child scheme, served at any rate one useful purpose.  It has focussed the attention of the public for the first time in any large degree on the question of the health services. While, since the foundation of this State, much progress has been made in alleviating the social ills which obtained in this country, the health services of the State have been one of the social problems which, up to recent <Col N="1256" /> years, have been comparatively neglected. To my mind, it augurs well that so much interest, so much controversy, even though it was so heated and so bitter at times, has now been focussed on the health services of our State, because I am convinced that the health of our people is now the major social problem which faces any Irish Government that may be in office.</P>
      <P>In tackling the public health services, the Minister, as Deputy Dr. Esmonde has pointed out, should start from the bottom of the ladder.  Whether or not there may be a case for abolishing the dispensary system which is known as the red ticket system and for introducing some sort of national contributory insurance scheme, there is still, none the less, in the short-term, a great and vital need for improvement in the dispensary system as we have it to-day.  Whether that system will be abolished or not remains a question for the future.  In the short-term, the task of the Minister at present is to see that the existing dispensary services are improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be quite obvious to the Minister, to any doctor, to every Deputy, to any patient who has had any dealings with the dispensary system that it is full of anomalies and most inadequate to meet its requirements. First of all, particularly in the Dublin area, there are not enough dispensaries; there are not enough doctors. It must indeed appear strange to Deputies that there is to-day the same number of dispensaries in Dublin as there was when the system was first established over 40 years ago.  I know that a recent survey has been carried out of the dispensaries in the Dublin area.  I think certain recommendations have been made.  I hope the Minister will act on those recommendations and that the number of dispensaries in the City of Dublin will be increased and that the number of doctors will be increased.  Similarly, one of the matters that requires attention in the dispensary system is that there is no secretarial staff attached to the dispensaries.  The result is that doctors have the task, sometimes the onerous task, of registering births and deaths, and so <Col N="1257" /> spending portion of their time which should be given in attendance to the patients doing secretarial work which could be done by clerical officers if appointed to the dispensaries.</P>
    <P>The third matter which requires attention relates to the buildings in which the dispensary services are operated.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde, speaking from experience, has told the House of the sort of buildings these are.  I think that his experience must be fairly common amongst dispensary doctors throughout the country.  It is an experience which is regrettable. This is a matter which calls for immediate attention and remedy on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to refer to page 65 in the First Report of the Department of Health. Deputies will see from that report that it is proposed to earmark £400,000 for the improvement of the dispensaries throughout the country. I should like to know from the Minister when he proposes to spend that money.  I hope it is his intention to expedite its expenditure in order to ensure that a service which is of daily and vital interest to our people will be improved at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the task of introducing the regulations to be made under the 1947 Health Act in relation to the mother and child.  Deputies will understand that these regulations will be of the greatest importance to the health of our people, and so the Minister, in drawing them up, will need to have regard to the existing facilities for mother and child welfare.  What, in my opinion, is more important than the drafting of the regulations, is the provision of adequate services to service the scheme when it is put into operation.  As regards the Dublin area, it is well known that the number of beds in the maternity hospitals is so totally inadequate that mothers have to leave them from five to eight days after the birth of their children.</P>
    <P>It is not merely the desire of the alleged social reformers that increased facilities should be provided in this respect, but it is the recommendation of that much maligned body, the Irish Medical Association, that additional bed <Col N="1258" /> facilities in the Dublin area be provided. I understand that the figure for the Rotunda hospital is 100 beds; Holles Street, 100 beds, and the new Coombe hospital, 250 beds.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in drawing up his scheme for the mother and child, must bear in mind that the facilities to work it must be there beforehand, and that these facilities must include ample bed accommodation for those in need of it. In the drafting of such a scheme, and in bringing his proposals before the House, I would ask the Minister to keep in mind a system of child welfare which has been started on a very small scale in this country, and which, I understand, is in operation in Holland and on a small scale in Denmark.  I refer to the system of health visitors. I think that if the Minister could introduce such a scheme here it would bring immediate benefit to our people.  If regulated in a proper way it could provide for a full and an efficient system of health visitors, who would visit the homes of the mothers after birth, advise them on such matters as hygiene and diet, the manner of feeding the child, on how the house should be kept, and, in recommending improvements.  This system has worked admirably in Holland, and it could be worked here.  One of the reasons for the high mortality rate amongst young children in this country is that sufficient steps are not taken on preventative lines.  We have not done enough in the direction of advising mothers on matters such as hygiene and diet in order to prevent the diseases which children are subject to.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider a scheme of voluntary contributory insurance which again is being worked in many other countries.  In America they have what is known as the Blue Cross system.  In Denmark, too, they have a system of voluntary health insurance.  In England, between 1932 and 1939 there was a large-scale system of voluntary health insurance. I would ask the Minister to consider the adoption of such a scheme here, so that our lower middle classes, who are really more adversely hit by economic conditions than any other class, would have an opportunity of contributing <Col N="1259" /> to it.  In that way, they could insure themselves against the expenses which so frequently arise during periods of ill-health.  Such a scheme, as I have said, has been operated successfully in other countries.  It could be operated here by a voluntary body, not under the control of the Minister.  It could be operated by a national medical council, such as that advocated by the Irish Medical Council and in the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation.  Such a body, while not under the control of the Minister, would, at the same time, require State assistance to ensure that its finances would be maintained on sound lines.  I think that such a scheme is worth considering.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to examine the Blue Cross scheme in operation in America, and the voluntary schemes which have worked successfully in other countries in order to see if we could introduce here, along with our present scheme of free, assistance for mother and child, a scheme by which those people, who do not come under the present free scheme, would be able to contribute to it voluntarily, and thus insure themselves against the costs which arise from medical attendance at birth and medical attendance for children.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, of course, be aware of the large-scale planning for hospitalisation contained in the report of the Department.  I think the House would like to know his views on this proposed hospitalisation, and whether he approves of the regionalisation of hospitals which the scheme proposes.  I think that the regionalisation of the hospitals of this country is an admirable scheme.  There has been too much centralisation in Dublin.  Such specialised subjects as pathology and radiography are largely centred in Dublin.  A scheme of large regional hospitals would tend to obviate that tendency.  I understand it was the intention of the last Government to do that.  It would help, to a large extent, to obviate the present tendency of centralisation of many of our specialist services here in Dublin.  It would also help to give a better service in those <Col N="1260" /> centres where the present specialist services are totally inadequate or nonexistent in some cases.</P>
    <P>Finally, in reference to this large-scale building programme which has been envisaged by the Department, I would like to say that I consider the provisions of the Public Hospitals Act which gave the Minister for Public Health such extraordinary and almost despotic power over the funds of the Hospital Trust, should be amended.  I think the power which is given to the Minister for Public Health under the Public Hospitals Act of 1933 should be cut down.  As it stands at present, I understand the law is that the Minister, without reference to the Hospitals Commission, without reference to the Government, without reference to the Department of Finance, can institute, how he pleases, such buildings for public hospitals, such improvements in existing hospitals and in the dispensary services as to him at the time may seem fit.  I do not think that that power has been abused in the past, but the power is open to grave abuse.</P>
    <P>There is not only the obvious abuse of political pressure being put on a Minister for Health to sanction payment out of the Hospitals' Trust Funds towards hospital building in one particular area.  There is one other abuse which could creep in of cutting down funds to voluntary hospitals in order to strangle them in pursuance of some doctrinaire policy which the Minister for the time being may hold.  These are real dangers, and at the present time we should take steps to see that they are avoided.  I would be in favour of seeing some sort of control over the spending of the Hospitals' Trust Funds either by means of the Hospitals' Commission as it exists at present, or by means of Government decision on any moneys that are spent by the Minister for Health in pursuance of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see some system instituted by which the House would have the opportunity of discussing any proposed large-scale plans for hospitalisation or the improvement of the existing hospitals in the country.  I advocate this because I feel that the <Col N="1261" /> danger I envisage is a real one.  The power put into the hands of the Minister for Health at the present time is an extraordinary one and, in present circumstances, a dangerous one.  My view, and, I think, the view of every Deputy, is a desire to have an improvement in the health services of this country.  I am completely in favour of spending the Hospitals' Trust Funds in a manner most advantageous to the country, but I do not think that these funds should be spent at the caprice of one individual Minister.  The Government should have a say in the spending of the money, and the House should have an opportunity of discussing such expenditure.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am in favour of the large-scale regional hospitals which are proposed. I am in favour of spending the trust funds money at present existing on improving our dispensary services and improving the existing maternity and voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin, and I urge the Minister to proceed, with all due expedition, with the work of spending that money.</P>

      <P>I would like, on this Vote, to pay tribute to the former Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne.  I pay tribute to him as one who saw his work and the effects of his work, not only in my own constituency but throughout County Cork. When he took over office he lined up the sanatoria at Mallow, Macroom, Skibbereen and Millstreet&mdash;four extra hospitals in three years.  There is many a patient at home in Cork, happy and healthy to-day, who would have gone to his grave but for the manner in which beds were provided by Deputy Dr. Browne.  I am one who was politically opposed to him during that period but, nevertheless, one who recognises his worth at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy D. Costello was aiming at when he pointed out that he was anxious to remove certain powers in regard to the Hospitals' Trust Funds from the Minister.  I am wondering if he is going to suggest that these powers should be handed over to the Medical Association.  As one who approached Deputy Dr. Browne when he was Minister for <Col N="1262" /> Health in connection with the regional hospital and the maternity hospital in Cork, I must say that the manner in which he treated us was a generous one.  I do not think that he should have had any political leaning towards Cork because, as far as his Party was concerned, it had got no seat in Cork County.  Still, he came to Cork and did his part.</P>
    <P>Our local Board of Public Assistance, who are getting roughly £3,000,000 from the Hospitals' Trust Funds, are going ahead with plans and specifications for the Cork regional and materity hospitals and are procuring specialised treatment for both.  I think that Dr. Browne's worth as Minister for Health was generally recognised and that the general run of the people of this country deprecated the manner in which he was removed from office.  I do not wish, a Chinn Chomhairle, to delay the House, as I understand that time is limited on these matters.  However, I feel that I would not be doing my duty to my constituents and as chairman of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance if I did not pay tribute to one who, whilst politically opposed to me, still did his work well and did credit to the office which he held.</P>
    <P>I have heard a lot of talk here about dispensary doctors.  I believe in having a dispensary doctor a whole-time official, paid as such and prevented from engaging in any private practice whatever.  My experience has been, and it is a pretty wide one, that a poor person coming to a dispensary doctor with a red ticket will be seen but once. When he comes a second time he will be given a ticket for the hospital.  Such has been my experience, in fact my general experience.  As one who has been a member of a board of public assistance for the past 26 years, I must say that, whatever good there was in the old people, there is much less in the present generation.  Indeed, the younger they are the less work they are inclined to do for the remuneration they receive. I would be totally in favour of a system under which a dispensary doctor would be a whole-time official, definitely prevented from engaging in private practice.  I did not hear much in this <Col N="1263" /> House about the £400,000 that is allocated for the improvement of dispensaries.</P>
    <P>If it is going, I can promise the Minister that I will be calling on him next week for a pretty good whack out of it, because there is no doubt that our dispensaries in the South Cork area need improvement and there is no Deputy here who is a member of the South Cork Board who will not agree with me in that.  I do not see why we, as ratepayers, should be asked to foot the bill, while Dublin, from what we can see, is to collar all the money.  If there is money going, we want at least our share and I can guarantee that, while I am here and while I have a good team representing the South Cork Board with me, we will get our whack.</P>

      <P>It was very amusing to hear Deputy Corry praising Deputy Browne, when we remember the first few months the inter-Party Government were in office and when Deputy Browne was carrying out an inspection in Deputy Corry's constituency of the conditions in relation to the need for hospitalisation.  It would be laughable if we could now quote the criticism directed towards Deputy Browne by the Fianna Fáil Party at that time because he was carrying out a personal survey of conditions in hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was I who, as a member of the Cork County Council, announced publicly that Deputy Browne's statement as to what he required the Mallow Hospital for had converted me to his viewpoint and who moved that he get Mallow Hospital. I give credit to a good man any time &mdash;sometimes even to Deputy Rooney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to contradict Deputy Corry's statement. The present Minister has taken over a Department which was brought to life by the inter-Party Government. Deputy Browne, as Minister, pursued the tuberculosis campaign vigorously and enthusiastically and his administration in that respect was eminently successful.  We have only to compare the programme now before the Department with the programme before the inter-Party Government when it took <Col N="1264" /> office to see the different approach to matters relating to the health of the nation.  It would be absolutely unfair to disregard the work carried out by Deputy Browne during his first years of office.  He certainly did his job well and he has the appreciation and gratitude of the nation, particularly in relation to tuberculosis, but apparently what happened towards the end of his period of office is somewhat similar to what happened to the cow that filled the bucket full of milk and then kicked it over.</P>
      <P>With regard to this problem of hospitals, we find, in general hospitals where there is a need for more accommodation, portions of these hospitals set aside for children and I advocate that we should have a proper children's hospital.  The medical profession in general are in favour of a hospital in which all children would be accommodated, instead of having a room full of children in one hospital and another room full in another.  One finds that position in many of the general hospitals in the city.</P>
      <P>The dispensaries which have been referred to are in many cases primitive. It was suggested that we should start at the bottom rung, and, if we improved conditions in the dispensaries, it would be a first step towards improving the health of the nation, because the dispensary can be regarded as the health centre in each locality.  A survey of County Dublin was carried out some time ago by the county medical officer.  He was accompanied on his tour of inspection by several councillors, and the primitive conditions existing in some of these dispensaries, with their lack of light and any kind of proper amenities, made us realise that the first problem to be tackled is the provision of proper dispensaries for the people in the different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to urge also that the pay and conditions of nurses should be improved.  The hours of duty are in many cases too long.  Conditions were improved, I know, both in the matter of pay and hours of duty, with the formation of the inter-Party Government, but there are still complaints by the nursing associations that the pay is inadequate and the hours of duty of <Col N="1265" /> nurses too long.  I hope that some new regulation will be brought into force to improve these conditions.  The profession of nursing is a vocation, and a very unselfish vocation.  It is more of a vocation than a profession because the conditions existing in it cannot be regarded as attractive and it must be an unselfish vocation which induces girls to take up nursing.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also have a survey of the hospitals carried out in order to ascertain the amount of improvement and maintenance which existing hospitals require.  Only yesterday, as a visiting governor to the Meath Hospital, I visited the hospital and saw the very great need that exists there for proper painting and cleaning up&mdash;something which has not been done for a very long time. Possibly that work might have been done but for the war, but there are probably other general hospitals which need similar cleaning up and incidental repairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> I heard Deputy Browne say that the service available to the poor is not the same as that available to the rich.  I do not think that is a fair statement and anybody knowing the service and the accommodation available to the very poorest of our people in Dublin Union will be ready to contradict that statement.  The service and conditions there are comparable with the best in Dublin City.  People become alarmed when it is suggested that they ought to go to the union, but, when they go, they are amazed by the wonderful service available to them.  The service is only the best and that is at it should be.  I hope that the conditions existing in Dublin Union will be provided in all other institutions in which the poor are being treated.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m., until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 11th July, 1951.</P>
