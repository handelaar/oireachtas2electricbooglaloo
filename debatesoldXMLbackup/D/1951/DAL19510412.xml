    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

Would the Minister investigate the matter and recommend that course to the Land Commission?</P>

      <P>I understand from the Irish Potato Marketing Company that some 6,730 tons of ware potatoes have been exported to Great Britain up to the 31st March, 1951.  Under the contract with the British Ministry of Food, the prices payable are £10 13s. 6d per ton f.o.b. for shipments up to the end of January, 1951, and £11 8s. 6d. per ton f.o.b. for shipments after that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Potato Marketing Company, which I set up last year for the purpose of handling and developing the export trade in seed and ware potatoes, is doing everything possible to dispose of any surplus potatoes on the most advantageous terms.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the seed potatoes that are now held in the country, that is, any surplus seed that still exists, can we take it that a market is available for them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy that unqualified undertaking.  All I can say is that every effort is being made <Col N="646" /> to find a profitable market wherein to dispose of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that if growers of potatoes were given to understand early in the season that there was a market for 50,000 tons of ware potatoes and if at this point we have exported only 6,000 tons odd, it is poor consolation to the growers concerned to tell them that they can go now and feed these ware potatoes to live stock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such allegation and the Deputy, I am afraid, is trying to be mischievous.  There is no reason why 50,000 tons of ware potatoes should not be exported to Great Britain, unless Deputies in this House sponsor the case made by certain potato factors in Great Britain, that the potatoes are not of good quality.  I intend to ship the 50,000 tons to Great Britain under the contract made with the British Ministry of Food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all the information we have sought.  It is now coming to the end of the season and only 6,000 tons, according to the Minister's own admission, have been exported so far.  The Deputy asked the Minister for an assurance that the balance will be taken by Britain in a reasonable period, and the Minister's reply was to say that the farmers can feed them to live stock&mdash;in the middle of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite misinformed as to what Deputy Blaney inquired.  Deputy Blaney asked if I would give an assurance to producers that an economic market exists or will be found for all seed and ware potatoes held by them at the moment.  I replied that the Irish Potato Marketing Company, which I set up last year for the purpose of handling and developing the export trade in seed and ware potatoes, is doing everything possible to dispose of any surplus potatoes on the most advantageous terms.  I then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would also like to stress that the present high cost of feeding stuffs affords farmers a favourable opportunity of disposing of surplus potatoes for the leading of live stock.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> Deputy Blaney then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But you are not asking the farmers to feed seed potatoes to live stock?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said that his question also applied to ware potatoes.  I hope that farmers whose circumstances permit will use potatoes for feeding.  I hope to ship the balance of the 50,000 tons to Great Britain.  I hope to ship such seed potatoes as it is possible to dispose of in the countries that still remain open for the purchase of such potatoes.</P>

      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I am satisfied that the increase of 1d. per gallon on the summer price of milk supplied to creameries, coupled with a long term guarantee, is sufficient to provide a stable and remunerative return to farmers over the next five years.</P>

      <P>Might I ask did the Minister consult with the representatives of the co-operative industry who recently met him before arriving at this decision to give a meagre increase of 1d. per gallon for the summer months for milk?  Did the Minister get the approval of the deputation which met him to this increase before he decided on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the fact that the retail price of bacon has now been reduced, he will ensure that farmers and pig producers will be paid an economic price for their produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the price of bacon was fixed by the Bacon (Maximum Prices) Order, 1951, curers have been paying up to 225/- per cwt. dead weight for pigs and this, in my judgment, is a price which will yield a fair return to producers, especially those who use a substantial proportion of home-produced feeding stuffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that, now that the price of feeding stuffs has in some cases gone as high as £15 a ton, the price of 225/- a cwt. is not an economic or equitable price at the present time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am quite satisfied that the price of 225/- per cwt. for pigs is an eminently remunerative price for the farmer who breeds, feeds and fattens <Col N="649" /> his own pigs.  The farmer who habitually purchases bonhams &mdash; or suckers, as they are called in the northern counties&mdash;and seeks to fatten them is imposing on himself a diet of skimmed milk, while he leaves the cream for the breeder; and there is nothing I can do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting and, I am informed, in accordance with usage, that I should explain to the Dáil very briefly the reasons which led me to resign my position in the Government. I am deeply grieved that I have found myself compelled to take this step.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister for Health I have striven within the limits of my ability to improve the health services of the country.  Some progress has been made but much remains to be done.  It is perhaps only human that I should wish to have the honour of continuing the work.  However that is not to be. To me the provision of a health scheme for the benefit of the mothers and children of our nation seems to be the very foundation stone of any progressive health service without which much of our efforts in other directions would prove fruitless.  It seemed equally important to me that any such scheme to be effective and indeed just should be made available free to all our people who choose of their own free will to use it without the imposition of any form of means test.  On this point did I stand firm in my negotiations with the medical profession.  On other matters I was willing and, indeed, eager that the profession should from their knowledge and experience play their full part in improving the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had been led to believe that my insistence on the exclusion of a means test had the full support of my colleagues in the Government.  I now know that it had not.  Furthermore, the Hierarchy has informed the Government that they must regard the mother and child scheme proposed by me as opposed to Catholic social teaching. This decision I, as a Catholic, immediately accepted without hesitation.  At the same time I do not feel that I could be instrumental in introducing a scheme which would be subject to a means test. Apart from my personal views about a means test I feel that in taking the decision which I have had to take, as a man privileged to hold my high office, there is another principle to which I had to have regard.  I have pledged myself <Col N="668" /> to the public and to the Clann na Poblachta Party to introduce a mother and child health scheme which would not embody a means test.  Since I could not succeed in fulfilling my promise in this regard I consider it my duty to vacate my office.</P>
    <P>While, as I have said, I as a Catholic accept unequivocally and unreservedly the views of the Hierarchy on this matter, I have not been able to accept the manner in which this matter has been dealt with by my former colleagues in the Government.</P>
    <P>In June, 1948, the Government, in Cabinet, authorised me to introduce a mother and child health scheme to provide free maternity treatment for mothers and free treatment for their children up to the age of 16 years.  At the meeting of the Government at which this decision was taken the question of whether the scheme should be free to all those anxious to use it was discussed.  The decision of the Government was, in effect, that there should be no means test.  I, accordingly, on the authority of the Government, wrote in August, 1948, to the Irish Medical Association to inform them that the Government had considered their representations on the question of a means test in the proposed mother and child health scheme and had rejected their proposal for its imposition.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the Department of Finance, agreement was reached on the financial aspects of the scheme, which was thereupon drafted. The Estimate for the Department of Health for 1950-51, with the consent of the Government, included almost £400,000 for a scheme without a means test, but as it had not been introduced, this money was not expended.  Nearly 12 months ago direct negotiations on the scheme were entered into with the Irish Medical Association.  A copy of the draft scheme, based on these principles, was also transmitted to each member of the Government for his information.  In the course of negotiations with the Medical Association, counter-proposals were made by them. These proposals were rejected by me as being in conflict with the policy in <Col N="669" /> relation to a means test which the Government had already made, and which has only formally been rescinded by them as late as Friday last.</P>
    <P>On the 10th October, 1950, I was informed that His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, wished to see me in connection with the proposed scheme.  I attended at the Archbishop's House on the following day where I met His Grace and Their Lordships, the Bishops of Ferns and Galway.  I was informed that at a meeting of the Hierarchy on the previous day at Maynooth, His Grace and Their Lordships had been appointed to put before the Government certain objections which the Hierarchy saw in the scheme; that I was being informed of these objections as a matter of courtesy before transmission to the Taoiseach as head of the Government.</P>
    <P>His Grace read to me from a letter which had been prepared for transmission to the Taoiseach.  A general discussion followed.  At the conclusion of this interview I was under the impression, erroneously as it now appears, that His Grace and Their Lordships were satisfied with my explanation of the scheme and with my answers and undertakings given in regard to the objections made by them.  On that day I was also informed by His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, that he was meeting the Taoiseach on the following morning, 12th October.  On the following day the Taoiseach spoke to me of his interview with His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, and he informed me he had been told by His Grace that he and Their Lordships were satisfied following their interview with me.  The Taoiseach has since denied that he made this statement.  What is certain. however, is that he did not give me to understand that His Grace and Their Lordships remained unsatisfied.</P>
    <P>About the 9th or 10th November I learned that the Taoiseach had received a letter, dated 10th October, 1950, from the Bishop of Ferns, as secretary to the Hierarchy.  The Taoiseach gave me this letter for my observations with a view to a reply. The objections in the letter appeared to be those read to me by His Grace <Col N="670" /> the Archbishop of Dublin, during my interview on 11th October, and, in the light of the later events, I concluded that it had been transmitted solely for the purpose of record and formal reply. I, therefore, acting on this assumption, prepared a draft letter for transmission by the Taoiseach to His Lordship of Ferns, as secretary to the Hierarchy, in reply to the various points raised in their letter.  In this answer I substantially recapitulated the case I had made when I met His Grace and Their Lordships at Drumcondra on 11th October.  I would like to emphasise that, as I still believed that His Grace and Their Lordships had been reassured by the case made by me on the 11th October, I merely regarded this reply also as being for purposes of record by the Hierarchy. I sent this draft to the Taoiseach shortly after mid-November to be forwarded by him to the Hierarchy.  As I heard nothing further about the matter from either the Hierarchy or the Taoiseach until a couple of weeks ago I had no reason to believe that the Hierarchy were not fully satisfied, and the work of preparing for the introduction of the mother and child scheme continued.</P>
    <P>From October onwards discussions were continued with the Irish Medical Association in an effort to reach agreement. The association was also interviewed by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  An account of that interview (which, I understand, was submitted to the Taoiseach) is contained in a circular letter issued by the Irish Medical Association on 12th December, 1950, to their members, in the course of which it was stated that it was the Taoiseach's considered opinion that neither the Dáil nor the Seanad would approve any amendment of the Act or regulations which would envisage the omission of a free service for all in connection with the scheme.  Preparations for the introduction of the scheme progressed and on 6th March its early implementation was widely publicised by me.</P>
    <P>In the meanwhile the Book of Estimates for the financial year 1951/52 had been published in which provision was made (page 403) for an expenditure <Col N="671" /> of £661,000 on mother and child services, and it was explained in a footnote on that page that further expenditure of about £300,000 in the year was probable, and that a Supplementary Estimate would be introduced.</P>
    <P>On the 9th March I received a letter from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin.  From this letter I was surprised to learn that His Grace might not approve of the scheme, and declared that the objections which had been raised by him in October had not been resolved.  I was surprised for the simple reason that I had heard nothing further, either from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, acting on behalf of the Hierarchy, or from the Taoiseach, acting for the Government, in the four months that had intervened since I had handed to the Taoiseach in November my reply to Their Lordships' letter.  Following receipt of His Grace's letter, a copy of which was sent by His Grace to the Taoiseach, the latter suggested to me on the 15th March that I should take steps at once to consult the Hierarchy regarding their objections to the scheme.  I then learned to my distress and amazement that the reply to Their Lordships' letter which I had prepared and sent to the Taoiseach in the previous November had, in fact, never been sent by him.  The Taoiseach has given three explanations&mdash;two to me and one to the Hierarchy and all differing&mdash;as to why he did not forward my letter to the Hierarchy.  One reason to me was that he considered the reply ineffective; another was that no covering letter from me was received with it and he did not realise that.  I wanted it sent to the Hierarchy.  In his letter of March 22nd the Taoiseach says that he explained to His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, his reasons for not replying to the Hierarchy, and that His Grace conveyed these reasons to the Hierarchy.  The third reason for not replying, which appears in the Taoiseach's letter of March 27th to the Hierarchy, was that he and His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, believed it to be more advantageous in the <Col N="672" /> special circumstances of the case to await developments.</P>
    <P>I told the Taoiseach orally that his failure to forward this reply had placed me in a very embarrassing position and might easily give Their Lordships the impression that I had omitted to give any consideration to their objections and that further I had been guilty of extreme discourtesy in failing to ensure that a reply had been sent to them.  I also pointed out that his failure to send this letter had the effect that I remained under the erroneous impression that the objections of the Hierarchy had been fully resolved and that I could proceed with the scheme.  I was surprised also to learn from the Taoiseach that he had been in constant communication with His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, on this matter since the receipt of the letter of 10th October from the Hierarchy, so presumably he was fully aware that Their Lordships' objections were still unresolved.  He offered no explanation as to why, in the light of this knowledge, he had failed to keep me informed of the position; had allowed me continuously to refer in public speeches to the scheme as decided and unchanged Government policy, and finally had allowed the scheme to go ahead to the point where it had been advertised at considerable public expense and had been announced to the public, both in these advertisements and by my radio talk. He, furthermore, offered no explanation as to why, being aware of the Hierarchy's objections to the scheme, he continued to allow the Tánaiste, Dr. O'Higgins and myself to negotiate with the Medical Association, and why, in the light of this knowledge to which he now confesses, he himself informed the Medical Association that the Government would not agree to the inclusion of a means test.</P>
    <P>This conduct on the part of the Taoiseach is open, it seems to me, to only two possible explanations&mdash;either that he would not oppose the scheme if agreement were reached with the Medical Association on the means test or that.  in the light of his knowledge of the objections still being made by the Hierarchy and withheld from me, <Col N="673" /> he intended that the scheme without a means test must never in fact be implemented.</P>
    <P>At this time medical opposition became very intense, however.  Yet I, acting on the Government decision of 1948 and my own convictions in the matter, remained constant in my determination to exclude a means test from the mother and child scheme.  On the 14th March the Taoiseach spoke to me in Leinster House concerning the growing opposition of the Medical Association and informed me that he now believed that there should be a means test and that he was in favour of the Medical Association's views on that matter.  I challenged him, as I challenged the other Ministers&mdash;Mr. Dillon, Dr. O'Higgins, Mr. Norton and Mr. MacBride&mdash;who made similar representations, that they should consider this matter not as individuals but as a Cabinet and if they so wished reverse their decision of 1948 to exclude a means test.  I would then take whatever action I considered fit in regard to my personal position.  They all refused to take this course.  On the 14th March I received a letter from the Minister for Finance pointing out that a change I had proposed that private general practitioners should be admitted to the scheme would involve a further expenditure of public moneys and that, consequently, the matter would require to be placed before the Government.  As the amount involved was very small in relation to the total cost of the scheme and as he had allowed the larger financial issues in the main scheme to be settled without formal reference to the Government, this attitude surprised me.</P>
    <P>Evidently at this time my former colleagues finally realised that I was adamant&mdash;that nothing short of a Government decision to the contrary would alter my determination to implement a scheme without a means test. They now revealed the final objection to my programme&mdash;the objection of the Hierarchy.</P>
    <P>Despite the representations of the Taoiseach on the 14th March concerning his fears of the repercussions from the opposition of the Medical Association and concerning his wish and <Col N="674" /> anxiety to retain a means test in the proposed scheme, and despite also the letter which I received from the Minister for Finance on the same day, which pointed out the importance of the economic implications in my proposed extension to include private practitioners, is it not strange that in the long and carefully worded letter of the 15th written by the Taoiseach on the very day following these various objections of money, means test, necessity for further Cabinet consideration on the scheme, the danger of opposition from the Medical Association&mdash;that none of these politically dangerous objections was mentioned, but the objection which, in his then view, was the only outstanding one&mdash;the views of the Catholic Hierarchy?  My fears at this stage that the Government were unwilling to ratify their decision of 1948 to initiate a scheme with no means test have been confirmed by the contents of this letter.</P>
    <P>The letter sent by the Taoiseach on the 27th March, 1951, to the Bishop of Ferns, in his capacity as secretary to the Hierarchy, enclosing my observations, refers to the scheme &ldquo;advocated by the Minister for Health&rdquo;, thereby implying that the scheme was not advocated or supported by himself or other members of the Government.  In a letter of the 5th April from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, written on behalf of the Hierarchy, it is stated that they were pleased to note that no evidence had been supplied in the Taoiseach's letter of the 27th March that the proposed mother and child scheme advocated by the Minister for Health enjoys the support of the Government.  I have, accordingly, regretfully come to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the Government decision of June, 1948, against the inclusion of a means test, the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government had, in fact, changed their minds about the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is a fact noted by many people that in no public speeches did Ministers of the Government other than myself speak in favour of this measure.  I regret that for the want of courage on their part they should have allowed the <Col N="675" /> scheme to progress so very far&mdash;that they should have failed to keep me informed of the true position in regard to their own attitude and the attitude of others.  I have, consequently, been allowed by their silence to commit myself to the country to implement a scheme which certain members of the Government at least did not want, on their own admission, to see implemented and which they were in fact aware could not be implemented.</P>
    <P>I trust that the standards manifested in these dealings are not customary in the public life of this or any other democratic nation and I hope that my experience has been exceptional.</P>
    <P>I have not, lightly, decided to take the course I have taken.  I know the consequences which may follow my action.  The honesty of my motives will be attacked by able men; my aims will be called in question; ridicule and doubt will be cast upon the wisdom of my insistence in striving to realise the declared objectives of the Party to which I belonged.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I was enabled to make some progress in improving the health services of the nation only because I received the generous cooperation of members of all political Parties and of all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I lay down my seal of office content that you&mdash;members of this House&mdash;and the people who are our masters here, shall judge whether I have striven to honour the trust placed on me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  If I can engage the attention of Dail Éireann for a moment about so mundane a matter as fish, I would ask them to take under consideration the Second Stage of the Sea Fisheries Bill, 1950, their assent to which I now respectfully request.  I thought it would be for the convenience of Deputies if, when this Bill <Col N="678" /> was circulated, I supplied them with what in the vernacular is described as a White Paper, and in that White Paper I have tried to make manifest the salient features of the proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>I would like, however, if I could, to crystallise in a few sentences the fundamental principle underlying this Bill.  The purpose of the Government is quite deliberately to reserve the domestic fish market for the inshore fishermen.  Deputies are no doubt aware that maximum wholesale and retail prices for fish obtain in this country.  I would ask Deputies to note that these were maximum prices, and that these maximum prices are admittedly higher than would be justified from the consumer's point of view if nothing but the legitimate interest of the consumer was present to the Government's mind.  If it was not the Government's purpose to protect and foster the inshore fishermen, the Government would not ask the consumer to accept maximum prices on the scale at present fixed but it is in order to ensure that the inshore fishermen on our north-west, west, south-west and, indeed, in certain areas on our east coast, would be able to get from their fishing industry a reasonable standard of living that we have asked the consuming public, with their eyes wide open, to consent to paying a higher price for fish than they would be required to pay if they had free access to the world markets in Grimsby and other British ports, and could get fish at the lowest price which competition would produce.  I think that, given the assurance that we can purchase by this device stability and a very modest prosperity for the fishing community in our country, we are getting very good value for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have carried on to date under the existing legislation, and I want to make this clear: It has become fashionable in certain areas to suggest that the Sea Fisheries Association to date has achieved nothing, that it has made a mess of the whole business, and that the purpose of this legislation is to end something which has completely failed of its purpose.  Nothing could <Col N="679" /> be further from the truth.  The Sea Fisheries Association over the last ten or 12 years has done admirable work with the resources at its disposal, and one of the most gratifying features of the present situation is that, six years after the conclusion of the world war, the sea fishermen in the great majority of cases have succeeded in paying regularly the instalments due on their boats and gear and, when you compare that situation with the situation that obtained after the 1914-18 war, when, three or four years after the war was over, practically every fisherman along our coast was bankrupt and could not pay the instalments on his boats and the boats were pulled up on the beach rotting, the Sea Fisheries Association has much reason to be proud of its work.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go to the other extreme and to claim that the Sea Fisheries Association has been attended in all it sought to do by unqualified success and triumph.  It has not but, considering the resources it disposed of, it did a very good job.  Now we want to go a step further.  We want to put the fishing industry on a permanent basis and we want to embark on a programme of expansion.</P>
    <P>What I want the House to understand is this: There are two bases on which we might found expansion.  One is, to build up a fishing industry analogous to the Icelandic, the Scandinavian or the British sea-fishing industry. The other is to build up a fishing industry on the basis of our own inshore fishermen, primarily founded on the domestic demand for fish.  I am perfectly convinced that if our territory and market are to be thrown open to unrestricted exploitation by steam trawling companies we may get cheap fish but the inshore fishermen will disappear for ever from our society.  So long as I am Minister for Fisheries, that will not be allowed to come to pass.</P>
    <P>I am deliberately asking the House to take measures, through the medium of this Bill, to ensure that that will not come to pass and that we shall seek an adequate supply of demersal fish for the domestic market at prices slightly <Col N="680" /> higher than may rule in the world market, but on terms which will ensure for our inshore fishermen a guarantee of a permanent and stable livelihood. Inevitably, when proposals of this kind are formulated the variety of interests concerned in the fish trade lose no time to make their claims for consideration and the wholesale fish merchants have not been backward in putting forward what they conceive to be their claims to rights and their representations have been very welcome.</P>
    <P>Now my attitude in regard to this Bill, and one of the reasons why its appearance has been somewhat tardy, for I forecast its appearance three years ago, is that I have a chronic disinclination to push my neighbours about and I sought to draft this Bill in a way which would enable the fundamental purpose to be achieved, which was the protection of the inshore fishermen, without treading on other people's toes in so far as I could avoid it.  Therefore, the scheme of the Bill is that the inshore fishermen would catch the fish, the Sea Fisheries Association would buy it from them and pass it into the retail trade, through the established channels of the fish wholesale trade which at present exists.  I do not want to become involved in the wholesale fish trade.  I do not want to become involved in the retail fish trade.  I do not want the Sea Fisheries Association to have the necessity thrust upon them to do any more than to deal with the inshore fishermen with regard to boats, gear and so forth, to provide the inshore fishermen with a guaranteed market for their catch and that done, to pass it into the ordinary channels of trade and in that way allow it to be marketed in the ordinary way.  But I do not want to divest myself of the ability to follow the fish into the wholesale market, or further if need be, should it transpire that any combination sought to array themselves against the overriding interest of the inshore fishermen, for whom I am asking Oireachtas Éireann to reserve the domestic market.  I think the House ought to know this though.</P>
    <P>One of the complications that has arisen is that because a price level was <Col N="681" /> sanctioned in the domestic market for fish, superior to or higher than that obtaining in the world market, a number of fish wholesalers legitimately aspired to make hay while the sun shone.  Some of them had trawlers prior to 1948.  Others proceeded to acquire large boats and put them to sea.  Their procedure was to land the fish catch on to a bigger boat.  Some of them who had retail shops liked to go through the catch, picking out the brill, the turbot, the sole and other prime fish, send it on to their retail shops, and send the balance of the catch to the wholesale market.  Others, having no retail shops themselves, but having large wholesale businesses, liked to bring the prime part of their boat catch to their own wholesale stores, thus ensuring that <i>vis-a-vis</i> anybody else, they had a regular supply of prime fish while others might or might not, as circumstances allowed.  They feel a certain sense of grievance that they are not to be facilitated in continuing to trade on that basis.  They feel it a grievance that they cannot go on bringing in their fish and securing for themselves that preferential position.</P>
    <P>The reason that they cannot be facilitated in continuing in that direction is that if they claimed that right and secured it, every fish wholesaler would do the same until ultimately we would have a situation in which there would be no market for the inshore fish and every fellow who is in the wholesale trade, and perhaps in the retail trade, will put his own boats to sea and swipe the profitable market, made profitable, remember, by the maximum prices authorised by the Government because it was assumed that the fish was going to be marketed on behalf of the inshore fishermen.  What the House has to consider is this: If the proprietors of the fishing fleets want freedom to land fish here for their own account, let them be free to do it but let world prices rule.  If you accept that view, that is the end of the inshore fishermen, but if anybody is to have that right, then all must have it.  The alternative is, therefore&mdash;and this is what I am asking Oireachtas Éireann to say&mdash;that the only people who may land fish for sale <Col N="682" /> and consumption on the domestic fish market of Ireland are the inshore fishermen <i>per se</i> or through their co-operative, the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
    <P>If we accept that principle, then it becomes the duty of the Sea Fisheries Association, acting on behalf of the inshore fishermen, to undertake to make available to every fish wholesaler who wants it, an ample supply of all varieties of fish in so far as circumstances will allow, wherever and whenever he requires it.  It is my intention, having fulfilled that duty, and having made the fish available, that the fish wholesaler should then be free to take it to the market and pass it on for consumption through the ordinary channels of trade.  I am sure the House will agree with me that if we create deliberately a price structure in this country designed to confer some benefit and advantage on inshore fishermen, we cannot, and will not, permit large mercantile interests to muscle in on that perfect situation, designed for the inshore fishermen, with the inevitable result that the inshore fishermen would disappear and the musclers-in would be claiming to get from the Irish fish consumer the prices envisaged for the benefit of the inshore fishermen but which are now yielding profits to the Irish counterpart of the Grimsby or Yarmouth trawler.</P>
    <P>I gather, from the general reaction to the White Paper circulated with the Bill, that the substance of this measure is not of a highly contentious nature.  I approach this problem on the assumption that, in regard to fundamentals in any case, we are all of one mind.  When I speak of fundamentals I mean that we are all primarily concerned with the welfare of the inshore fishermen.  That is the assumption that I am proceeding on.  I gladly join issue with anyone who puts the interests of the trawler owners against the interests of the inshore fishermen.  If that view be advanced I will challenge it and gladly contest it.  If we are agreed in principle, it merely becomes a matter of the most effective machinery to realise our common end.  If I am vouchsafed <Col N="683" /> advice and assistance by other Deputies who are experienced in these fishery matters I will welcome it.  If there is any suggestion any Deputy on any side of the House can make to me to improve these proposals for the better realisation of that common end, I will gladly welcome it.</P>
    <P>I could extend at great length my introductory observations by solemnly recapitulating the contents of the White Paper.  I mean no discourtesy to the House if I proceed on the basis that the contents of the White Paper may be taken as read.  I would invite Deputies, if they are concerned in the matter, to refresh their memories perhaps as to the background of the whole fish business of this country by referring them to the report of the sea and inland fisheries for the year ending 1949, in which a good deal of valuable statistical material is available for the guidance of Deputies who may wish to review the problem generally.  I am at the disposal of the House to answer any specific queries which Deputies may wish to address to me, but I forbear from unnecessarily expanding my introductory observations.  If there is any question which any Deputy has to address to me I will do my best to answer him the better to facilitate the House in debating the question at length in a formal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can find fault with the object of this Bill which, I take it, is set out in the beginning of the White Paper&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to ensure improved outlets, with particular reference to the home market, for landings made by the inshore fishermen.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Department of Fisheries, since this State was set up and every Minister for Fisheries who has operated from that time, have been aiming at that same object&mdash;to improve the market, especially with regard to the inshore fishermen.  The method which the Minister has adopted in this Bill would appear to be in the right direction, namely, to give wider representation on the board.  Formerly it was called the Sea Fisheries Association. It is now referred to as the <Col N="684" /> board.  The proposal is to give wider representation on that board and to give it more powers.  I think nobody can object to that.  Before leaving that matter I would like to say that I agree thoroughly with the Minister that the Sea Fisheries Association did a great deal of good work during the time they were established.  It is not because we have found fault with them that we are agreeing to another system, but rather because we think they could do better work under a new method of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do disagree, perhaps fundamentally, with the Minister on one point. I have always thought that it is not in the best interests of the inshore fishermen themselves that the entire business of catching fish should be left to them.  I have always regarded trawlers, whether owned by a company or not, as essential for the fish supply.  I think it could be argued, and argued very effectively, too, that one of our objects should be to see that consumers are supplied with fish.  But, unless consumers can get fish in reasonable quantities, and in reasonable variety, they will be dissatisfied with things, and will blame whatever system is there.  They will come to the conclusion that the inshore fishermen are not doing the business as they should. We all know that, at times, the inshore fishermen are not in the position to catch fish at all.  That occurs, rarely, I admit, only in times of very bad storms or something of that kind.  But there are longer periods throughout the year, when the inshore fishermen are not in a position to get particular varieties of fish, and when a trawler company will be in a position to do so, because it can go farther afield to look for those particular varieties.  Therefore, in order to supplement the supply of the inshore fishermen, and to add variety to the supply, I, at any rate, believe that trawlers are necessary.  To that extent I do not agree with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in control of this Department now, and if he thinks that trawlers should be controlled in a different way, well that could be considered. I disagree with him fundamentally on the point that trawlers <Col N="685" /> are not necessary.  I say they are necessary. As to how they should be controlled is a different matter.  The Minister mentioned that one particular set of trawlers was distributing the choice fish to its own retail shops and giving fish which was not so choice, to shops owned by other people.  In the case of other trawlers, he said that they gave the choice fish to their own wholesale business and distributed the rest otherwise.  I think that could be got over in another way if the Minister was so minded.  Of course, if he thinks that trawlers are not necessary, then the question does not arise.  If, however, his only object was to see that trawling was regulated in another way, there are other ways of dealing with it. There was a proposition before the Department of Fisheries for many years back, that there should be some additional legislation on the auctioning of fish.  Legislation of that kind could, I think, cover that matter by making it compulsory that fish from any trawler should go through, if you like, independent firms of auctioneers. However, we can leave that for the moment, and come back to it on another stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are not very many big principles in this Bill.  As a matter of fact, as the Bill stands that does not appear to me to be so.  I must admit that there are some provisions in the Bill which appear to be too difficult for me to follow.  There may be something in the Bill which deals with the licensing of trawlers.  But, as the Bill appeared to me from reading it, I did not think there was anything big in principle involved.  It is more a Bill to deal with matters in a different way and appeared to me to be one which could be discussed much more satisfactorily in Committee than on Second Reading.  In order, however, that we may be ready to deal with the Bill in Committee, there are certain questions which I would like to ask, and perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten us on them at the end of this debate so that we may have some information in advance on matters that will arise later.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated here to-day <Col N="686" /> what he has said very often since he became Minister, that he likes to give freedom to everybody as far as possible. Section 7 does not appear to me to be following that principle, because, when this Bill is passed, as far as I can see no man can land fish for sale in this country unless he is a sea fisherman and a member of the association. This is the first time compulsion has been introduced; up to this a fisherman could be in the association or out of it.  From the ordinary human point of view, that is a cruel thing sometimes, if it can be avoided.  The Minister may, perhaps, make a very good point against me on this and say that it cannot be avoided.  But, if it can be avoided, it is a cruel thing to compel a man to be in an association if he does not like to be in it, or if perhaps he is up against the committee of the association and has serious trouble with them, and says he will never have anything more to do with the association. You are removing a certain amount of human liberty from the man if you say, &ldquo;if you are not in the association you cannot land fish for sale&rdquo;.  As I say, this is the first time it has been introduced, and it has been introduced by the present Minister who declares very often that he is out for the liberty of the person, freedom of trade, freedom of action, and so on.  I do not know if it is necessary to bring it in now any more than in the past, but I am sure the Minister will deal with that point when we come to it.</P>
    <P>I can visualise a man who does not fish very often but who has done a certain amount of fishing every year for the last 25 or 30 years with a small boat, perhaps in a remote area where there are no other fishermen, and who has been accustomed to selling any fish he caught in the neighbouring houses. I know of certain men of that kind, men who never felt the need of joining the association because they never wanted a market.  The few fish they landed were sold around the houses in their own neighbourhood.  Under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, these men for the first time will be compelled to join the association.  If they do not join the association, they cannot sell <Col N="687" /> fish or, if they do sell fish without joining the association, they will be subject to fairly hefty penalties.  In fact, they will be put out of business.</P>
    <P>I should like a little enlightenment with regard to Section 12.  All of us will agree that if a man is convicted more than once of an offence under the regulations, the court should have the power to revoke his licence.  It is very hard, however, for a person like me to understand this section&mdash;perhaps a lawyer could understand it&mdash;because when we read it we see that if he has been already convicted and is convicted a second time, he loses his licence.  But it appears that before the justice can revoke his licence, the man must have habitually disregarded the conditions of the licence, or any of them.  I should like some information with regard to that.  I do not think I have any intention of offering any amendment, but I should like to be clear as to what exactly is meant, whether a person who commits a second offence may have his licence revoked or whether he must have been habitually offending before he loses his licence.</P>
    <P>In Section 14 there are provisions with regard to temporary restrictions on the grant of a licence.  We find that a licence shall not issue in favour of a person who is engaged in the distributive fish trade.  I should like to ask the Minister whether that applies to the people to whom he already referred in introducing the Bill&mdash; those who are the owners of boats as well as being in the distributive trade, whether as wholesalers or retailers or both.  If it does apply to these, the Minister, I take it, has some good reason for making that proposal, which he will explain more fully when we come to the section.  He should at least let us know how these people will fare, what will become of the boats which are there, whether they will pass into other ownership, or be acquired by the new board, or what is to become of the boats and the equipment and the organisation and so on if this section is applied as I think it is to be applied by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The members of the board are to be <Col N="688" /> nominated by the Minister.  I do not object to that because I do not think it would be possible to have the board elected on the basis laid down, namely, to represent not only the fishermen but those who are engaged in the trade as well.  With a board consisting of only five members, I think it would be impossible to have the members elected by the various interests and, on the whole, I think that they should be nominated by the Minister.</P>

      <P>You would have to have a much bigger board then and I think that a small board would be more efficient.  If the board is to be a small one, I think it must be nominated. I am not objecting to that, but other Deputies may; there are arguments for and against.  There is one point I want to make.  The Bill says that the board shall meet once a week. That appears to me to make it impossible for any man to accept nomination from the Minister unless he lives near Dublin.  I do not see how any man who has other business&mdash;and, of course, he will have other business, because, I presume, he cannot live on this job&mdash;and who lives more than 100 miles from Dublin can undertake to attend a weekly meeting in Dublin if he accepts nomination from the Minister. The Minister should keep that in mind.  I can see that a weekly meeting would be very useful.  Perhaps it can be got over in some way &mdash;that the chairman, the managing director and some other member could have weekly meetings and the board could meet once or twice a month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This board will carry on the business of the whole trade.  Now if they have to meet weekly, it will be quite impossible for a man who is a member of the board but who does not live convenient to the city&mdash;say within 50 miles of Dublin&mdash;to undertake to accept nomination from the Minister since he could not be expected to make that journey once every week.  I think that will severely restrict the Minister in making nominations.  If that clause were made a little bit more elastic and if it was provided that&mdash;this is a provision which appears very often in articles of association&mdash;the board would make their own regulations, could meet once a week if they wished, but would be bound to meet at least once a month, that would leave the Minister with a wider choice.  I would like the Minister to consider that suggestion before we come to the Committee Stage because, as the Bill stands at present, I think he would be precluded from appointing anyone except a man living in immediate proximity to the city.</P>
      <P>There is another point which needs some clarification.  It is provided that the quorum for the committee of the association will be four, of whom one at least shall be a member of the distributive fish trade.  Where two interests are concerned in an association such as this&mdash;one, the fisherman and, secondly, those who distribute the fish, either wholesalers or retailers, and there could be manufacturers, too&mdash;it is important that all those interests should be represented as well as the fishermen.</P>
      <P>Strangely enough, it is not stated here that one of them must be a fisherman and it would be possible, therefore, for a meeting of this committee to be held with the stipulated quorum present and yet not have a fisherman present.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter.  Perhaps he may, on reconsideration, bring in an amendment providing that at least one must be representative of the distributive trade and one representative of the fishermen.</P>

      <P>That is good.  The Minister has stated that he does not want to interfere with the legitimate business and so on.  Despite that protestation, I think there is one very bureaucratic provision in this Bill in relation to the chairman of the association.  This association after all will be an advisory body.  I think an advisory body should elect the members of the committee. That is the normal procedure.  They elect those members who will speak for them to the board.  If they want to get anything material done they will have to make representations to the board and they usually elect a committee to carry on negotiations on their behalf with the board.  Here the Minister proposes to nominate the chairman.  I do not know why the Minister should claim that right.  Why should he think it necessary to nominate the chairman?</P>
      <P>This will be a very democratic body because everybody who catches fish for sale, everybody who distributes fish, though they are not bound to be, can be members; every retail fish merchant and distributor of fish and every canner or processor of fish will all be members of the association.  They will elect their committee and I see no reason why they should not elect their chairman.  I see no reason why the Minister should nominate the chairman. He even goes further than mere election; he lays it down that no meeting may be held unless his nominee is present.  That appears to me to place too much restriction on these people. I think we are going too far into the realm of bureaucratic control there. The Minister will need to defend this particular provision very strenuously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure some speakers will hold that the subscription is too high.  I <Col N="691" /> know that it is the general rule to say that such subscriptions are too high. If the Minister can make a good case for the 5/-, we will not object to it. I would like to know, however, what these people will spend this money on; this association will elect its committee; that committee will come up to Dublin and meet once every two months; there will also be an annual meeting.  I do not know what particular business they will have to do except perhaps to meet the board and point out to the members that they are not doing things they ought to do or try to get more than they are getting or travel a little bit farther in the direction in which they would like them to go.  That is the sort of business I visualise in relation to this association. I do not know what they will spend this money on; it is not quite clear from the Bill what they will need the money for though it is quite clear that they will collect 5/- per member per year.  If the Minister makes a good case for this subscription I will certainly have no objection to it.  Membership of the present Sea Fisheries Association involves a subscription of only 1/- per year.  I cannot see any necessity for changing that.  The Minister may be able to make a case to justify the increase.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that if there should chance to be any serious difference of opinion between the board and the committee that might have the effect of seriously injuring the trade in general.  One would like to see some way in which such a difference of opinion could be resolved without any injury being done.  For myself, I cannot see any really satisfactory way of achieving that object.  An association veto on the board would be ineffective. The board must be allowed to act. The board will listen to the association but if they fail to agree with the association it is difficult to see what can be done.  If that happens on two or three occasions grave dissatisfaction may result and there will not be that enthusiasm amongst the fishermen that we think so desirable.  I was wondering if we could have some provision which would give the association at least some hope that their point of <Col N="692" /> view would receive consideration.  If they were turned down by the board and it was agreed that the Minister should hear them subsequently, that might be helpful.  All the Minister will be able to do, however, is talk to the board.  I do not say that he should be compelled to do that, but I do not think these people should be turned down without very good reason. I do not think the Minister should have any right to order, but he should have the right to ask them to reconsider the points put forward by the association in an effort to meet their point of view.</P>
    <P>I would not go further than that and, indeed, whether it is necessary to put that into the Bill or not I do not know, but it might be well to give the association some court of appeal.  If they are turned down more than once, especially on something about which they are very keen, they would then feel that their point of view was understood by someone at headquarters.  The Minister would be the best referee between them and the board, or their best advocate at the board, and they would feel that everything possible was done. As I said at the beginning, I think this is a Bill that would be more satisfactorily dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will not be surprised when he hears that I am very disappointed about not reconciling the interests of inshore fishermen with those of trawlers.  I always held the view, based on statistics taken from countries similarly situated, seaboard countries, that the fishing industry should occupy a very important place in the economic life of the country.  The Minister has given very considerable thought to this and has done very considerable research.  We have it now established in this Bill as a matter of policy and of legislation that this nation has decided by Act of Parliament to abolish fishing from large trawlers.  In considering that matter, we must have in view not only the interests of the fishing industry itself but also the interests of the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> I agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan&mdash;I am sure he largely culls his view in that respect in the same way as I do, representing the same constituency&mdash;that you can reconcile these interests.  If we are to base our policy on the survival of the fishing as such and on adequate supplies of fish for consumption by the public, very considerable care and attention and a very considerable sum of money will have to be devoted to restoring the smaller ports and harbours.  At present, particularly on the coast for which I speak, the coast of County Wexford, the large trawlers operate from well designed ports but inshore fishermen in remote country districts have to operate from small ports and harbours.  If in the future they must carry the production which was formerly the function of the trawlers, these small ports will have to receive attention.  I brought this matter to the Minister's attention on several occasions&mdash;not here in the House but otherwise&mdash;and I direct his attention to it now.</P>
    <P>There are some matters in the Bill which are properly referable to the Committee Stage, but I would like to draw the Minister's attention at this stage and put to him by way of question, as he has asked for it, the position which arises under Section 14.  Under it no trawler will be allowed to operate from the State which exceeds in length 80 feet.  We know there are some exceeding that length at present operating within our territorial waters.  Section 14 contemplates that owners of such trawlers must go out of business, unless some amendment is made.  As the Minister has decided that we are not to have fishing from trawlers in future, and assuming that that is also the desire of the House, I respectfully ask the Minister to ask his advisers whether Section 14 is not <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  I would not like to see a Bill passed though here and go forth, and afterwards find that a very material section of it was <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  The Minister can visualise what I have in mind, namely, that no power is given to this Assembly to take property away from a citizen or group of citizens without provision for compensation.  I would <Col N="694" /> like the Minister to say something about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Ryan has said, this is a measure which does not lend itself to very much discussion on the Second Reading, even though it contains 55 sections, but we shall have more to say on the Committee Stage. In his opening statement the Minister said that the intention is to protect the interests of inshore fishermen.  With that sentiment we are all in agreement, especially those of us who represent constituencies where the fishing industry is carried on.  Those engaged in it have, in my opinion, a traditional right to whatever protection the Oireachtas can give.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that there are two schools of thought in connection with this matter.  There are people who say that on no account should we engage in deep-sea trawling as it may interfere with the livelihood of the traditional inshore fishermen.  There are also people who think that it will not be possible to establish a market in this country for fish and preserve continuity of supply without having some trawling vessels as an adjunct. I think this is a matter that has to be very carefully examined because nobody, in my opinion, can be dogmatic about it.  A lot of people talk about the fishing industry and about what the trawlers should do and should not do; how the inshore fishermen could improve their lot and how their lot could be improved.  When you get down to the essentials of the problem, you find yourself up against great difficulty.  I think that it would be well for the Minister or for the board that is being set up under this Bill to lay down a certain period of time&mdash;say, 12 months or two years or some such period&mdash;during which an exact survey of the position would be made to find out what the potentialities of the inshore fishing industry are in reality and to ascertain how the development of these potentialities will fall short of satisfying the Irish market for fish.  That is what I wish to say in connection with the inshore fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there is always a question <Col N="695" /> of providing suitable boats for the inshore fishermen.  That has been the trouble and will continue to be the trouble, I suppose.  Boats and gear are becoming very expensive.  They will probably get more and more expensive as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde has referred to Section 14.  He has pointed out that the implementation or the attempt to implement this section would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  If that be the case&mdash;if Section 14 would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution&mdash;I imagine that Section 7 would be <i>ultra vires</i> as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a <i>prima facie</i> case to be made in any case, that they are <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, because the implication in both of these sections is that the freedom of the individual will be interfered with, but to what extent the State or the executive acting on behalf of the State, can interfere with the liberty of the individual is a very difficult point sometimes to ascertain.  The Minister has stated that the Sea Fisheries Association&mdash;the body which is now being replaced by new machinery&mdash;are deserving of a certain meed of praise for what they have done for the fishing industry in the past.  I think that is right.  While at times many of us could not see eye to eye with the way in which they carried on the work of the association, still we realise that they were dealing with a very, very difficult problem.  There was always the overriding question of finance.  I am sure that they would have done a lot more if they had had the necessary financial resources at their disposal. I see that we are now setting up a new board, the managing director of which and all the members of which will be appointed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Or without any stated reason&mdash;yes, but whether the members <Col N="696" /> of this board could be elected in any way by the members, we will say, of the association is another matter.  I do not want to go into that now.  We will have to examine it further.  It is a matter, I am sure, that can be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  Deputy Dr. Ryan has already referred to the chairman of the association as distinct from the managing director of the board or any member of the board, that even the chairman of the association would have to be appointed by the Minister.  Whatever may be said about the right of the Minister to appoint the members of the board, there appears to me to be no justification for the appointment of the chairman of the association.</P>

Is not what you want a chairman who will be a sort of neutral between all the uneven interests that are represented on the body and who will hold the reins between the wholesale fishmongers, retail fishmongers and the fishermen without any regard to the magnitude of the individual interests represented on the association?</P>

      <P>I am quite sure I am going to be the voice crying in the wilderness because I do not agree with this Bill at all.  Although the Minister purports to tell us that this Bill is designed to ensure the survival of the inshore fishermen, I propose to put on record my due and solemn warning that this legislation may be the very death knell of the industry it seeks to preserve.  To my mind, it represents an extremely retrograde step, because here we are in a deliberative Assembly relegating the fishing industry to a position in which it is a small insignificant adjunct of the Department of Agriculture.  By this measure, we are casting aside for all time whatever potential, from an industrial point of view, there may be in the well-known and popular fishing grounds that abound around our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill represents an approach to fishing which is appalling in its mediocrity, <Col N="699" /> which completely lacks courage in its vision and which certainly negatives completely the principles envisaged by the Sinn Féin movement in its conception of what could be made of Irish fishing.  I propose to tell the Minister from my limited experience but as representing a successful fishing area what the potentiality of fishing should be and I want him to disabuse his mind while listening to me of the bias so flamboyantly and typically expressed by him when he told us he hated fish and would prefer an egg any day.  I want him to approach this problem with the magnitude of vision with which he has been able to approach problems in the agricultural sphere, because by this Bill, if we are not careful, we are sowing the seeds of decay rather than progress.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself, I shall have to try to controvert, effectively, I hope, and with deliberate intent, the unanimity which seems to exist.  The Minister in this measure envisages not only the limiting of fishing to certain types and classes and to certain types of boats, but a controlled type of marketing and complete control in the matter of landing.  This Bill in its present form is so idiotic and chaotic that I should be transgressing the law if I rowed out in my boat with a mackerel spinner some summer night and brought back a few mackerel to put on the pan for my supper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get to grips with what is the real problem.  The <Col N="700" /> real problem in Ireland to-day is lack of fish.  There is no proper development of a fish market in this country. Every Deputy listening to me, even those who, like myself, represent fishing areas, knows that at times it is impossible, and never very easy, to get fish, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt at all about it that nothing like the quantity of fish that could be consumed in this country is caught and consumed.  There is no doubt that there is no development or expansion of the potential of a home market.  There is no doubt that proper attention is not given to the development and encouragement of the eating of fish.  It is quite certain and well known that at particular periods no fish can be bought in this country. What does the Minister for Agriculture suggest to us that he will do?  Again, in his flamboyancy, he described lacuna periods in which he is going to whistle to Grimsby or elsewhere to bring in fish through the medium of this new marketing body.  He did not tell us whether fish would be available to him at these periods or what quantity will be available or what type of fish it will be.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are facing an issue far bigger than we have conceived so far.  The Minister has incorporated a section in the Bill whereby, no matter what the inshore fisherman may do in his period of difficulty when he cannot fish, we shall have to go elsewhere to seek the fish to supply the essentials of the home market.  Can the Minister come here to me and explain what is inconsistent about having the equipage and the ability&mdash;owned, manned and controlled by Irish people themselves&mdash;to fill any lacuna period that may occur in regard to our fish?  What is sinister or terrible about the deep-sea trawling conception in this country? It could be used to bolster difficult periods for the inshore fishermen and, if properly conceived and worked, it could be built into the first-class industry that it is among some sea-faring nations, even smaller than our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent West Cork and I say without fear, favour or affection that some of the finest fishing done in the <Col N="701" /> interests of the Sea Fisheries Association is done from Schull Harbour.  The desire of the people you meet there is to extend the industry, to get bigger and better boats so as to enable them to follow fish and to get bigger catches. They will tell you themselves and they will tell the Minister if he visits them that the modern trend of fishing is to get a bigger type of boat so as to ensure less risk and less of the tragedies that unfortunately many of the fisher families of Ireland have known.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true, and I am warning the Minister that it is true, that if he cannot get a constant supply of decent fish for domestic consumption in Ireland the whole structure of the fishing industry will gradually disintegrate. That has not been done to date.  The only place where complete incompatibility can be found between the view that there can be a bolstering up of the inshore fishing industry by trawlers is in the Department of Fisheries and in the mind of the Minister for Agriculture himself.  What is Ireland's fishing potential?  If I drive down the road from Glengarriff to Castletownbere and to Bantry Bay I see trawlers of nations as far away as Spain.  I see Belgian trawlers and trawlers from all over the North Sea. They are sheltering there.  They are provisioning there.  For various reasons they may come into that bay.  But they have one common denominator&mdash; they are all fishing off the Fastnet lighthouse.  They are able to send out trawlers from all parts of Europe, provision and equip them for the journey to and from the fishing grounds, and fish them at a profit.  But for some extraordinary reason there is to be no development of a really substantial national industry based in Ireland, the nearest spot to the fishing grounds and able to compete on that basis with any of these foreigners.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly in agreement with the principle that we should preserve a way of life for the inshore fishermen, but no inshore fishermen will contend that they are able to supply the home market.  Nobody in this House could contend that the home market has been properly developed or has ever been properly supplied.  If the Minister, <Col N="702" /> instead of putting the cart before the horse, got down to the business of getting the fish and of developing the domestic market to its full capacity, then he would be able to review the position infinitely better than he is able to do so now.  You can drive through the principal provincial towns of Ireland, and I do so continuously on my way to West Cork&mdash;big towns such as Maryborough, Cashel or Cahir&mdash;and it is seldom if ever that you can get any variety of fish there, and certainly no choice, on a Friday.</P>
    <P>What is the real position with regard to fishing in this country?  The approach to it is too narrow and it is completely unrealistic.  We have built up a wealth of clash between two ideologies that could be complementary and the fostering of these ideologies has led to a lot of ill-feeling where no ill-feeling should exist.  Unfortunately, on very numerous occasions throughout the last fishing season, substantially sized boats, even 50-footers, were bound in harbour, not able to fish.  During that period any of us who tried to procure fish found that choice fish was almost unobtainable and fish at an inordinately high price was available in very small quantities to the very limited sections of the community that could afford to buy it. That situation should not exist.  I warn the Minister here and now that he must get down to a plan whereby we can supply the domestic market with fish caught by Irishmen, whether they be inshore fishermen or fishermen fishing in Irish trawlers.</P>
    <P>It is not right, I think, to allow the fishing industry in this country to become what this Bill envisages.  I wonder whether the Minister and his Department have ever really tried to explore the potential of the fishing industry purely from the point of view of domestic consumption in Ireland. Did he ever conceive the idea of using creamery halts or creamery sub-branches for the distribution of fresh fish?  A tremendous market is available for a substantially developed fishing industry if they would only look for it.</P>
    <P>We are running into a period of <Col N="703" /> rising international costs in many spheres.  We know that certain by-products of the fishing industry such as fish meal could be very useful if they were available to our producers at home.  Why does the Minister not therefore approach the fishing industry on a bigger and broader basis?  While he can ensure a market for the inshore fishermen why does he not allow his concepts to become broader and strive to build up an industry that could supply our market, export surpluses and supply raw material for adjunct industries which might be very helpful? Has the Minister considered all the implications of quick freeze, smoking and the various other ways of processing fish even to canning which could become part of our national economy?  He certainly does not envisage them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel that I will be a voice crying in the wilderness for the implementation of a wider and broader scheme which would tend to develop the industry, not cripple it.  The day of the small boat is gone.  Everybody knows that.  There are many reasons for it. You must travel bigger distances to follow fish now than heretofore.  Members who represent fishing areas will understand how that can arise; you can overfish certain areas or fish can change a run.  I am warning the Minister and the Government as solemnly as I as an individual can that they are deliberately turning their backs on the potential that may exist by envisaging this type of Bill which has a remarkable tendency towards bureancracy although it comes from a Minister who professes to be the complete devotee of complete democracy.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister has left the House because I want him to answer this question: What is wrong with a scheme whereby Irish trawlers manned by Irishmen&mdash;mind you the crews of many of the Grimsby trawlers and the trawlers of other fishing ports in England are Irish, many of them from West Cork&mdash;based in this country would work to fill whatever lacuna may be in the domestic market and to supply fish to the Irish people who want it?  What is there in that to conflict <Col N="704" /> with the interests of the inshore fishermen?</P>
    <P>Inshore fishermen&mdash;and the fishermen themselves will tell you so&mdash;are a diminishing class.  They have their difficulties and, as Deputies representing areas like mine know, emigration has taken its big toll of them.  They have not security; they have not the continuity of livelihood which would encourage them to stay and they cannot have if under this Bill as the boats will be too small.  They have longer distances to travel to fish and the growing tendency has been to make the boats more seaworthy, in itself, <i>per se</i>, a most worthy concept, because I am sure all of us are on common ground in hoping that the type of boats and equipment to be used by our fishermen in future will reduce the risks of loss at sea.</P>
    <P>Before we come to grips with the Bill at all we must decide whether this House will accept a situation that exists, a situation where fish is scarce &mdash;I defy the Minister to challenge me on this&mdash;where it is not available at all in a large part of the country, where prime quality fish at certain times of the year is practically unobtainable and when it is available only a very limited section of the community can afford to buy it.  We could reduce the impact of rising costs of such commodities as beef and mutton by developing a proper fishing fleet to supply an adequate amount of fish to the Irish people.  How many people throughout the length and breadth of rural Ireland never see fresh fish and seldom if ever see salt fish?  It is a deplorable condition when around this country are some of the finest fishing grounds in the world.</P>
    <P>I say deliberately that this Bill is a retrograde step from the point of view of improving the fishing industry. I think that the Minister can ensure the survival of the inshore fishermen far more effectively by ensuring that fish is available to supply the domestic market.  I have repeatedly clashed with the Minister on this issue, but I am taking this opportunity of putting on record in the House my confirmed belief that this particular type of <Col N="705" /> legislation will not achieve the purposes for which it is designed.</P>
    <P>I have heard laudatory comments passed here about the Sea Fisheries Association.  I am sure they do some good work.  I did not experience much of it, but I know this, that their outlook on fishing has never been broad enough or wide enough to envisage fishing as a major industry.  I think this Bill will for all time preclude fishing as a major industry.  Every facet of fishing, from the catching of fish, to the landing of fish, to the selling of fish and to the distribution, will be tied up and controlled under this Bill. And who will be the victim at all stages?  The unfortunate consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a situation arising where, through controlled channels, there are going to be delivered inadequate supplies of fish to meet the home demand.  Despite whatever controls the Bill may envisage, in a position of scarcity prime fish will find its way through sale channels the way prime pieces of any particular goods find sale.  I will repeat the question I asked while the Minister was out.  The Minister envisages buying fish elsewhere at lacuna periods to supply the domestic market.  Is there something wrong in Irish trawlers, manned by Irish crews and controlled by the Minister's Department, filling that lacuna period? Has he considered yet the potential of fishing as a major industry, with the adjuncts of freezing, smoking, canning and coarse fish going into fish meal?  I say quite seriously that is the way the problem must be faced.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for a moment suggest that at any time the domestic market is adequately supplied?  Will he indicate to the House what research of a market potential has been made?  Has his Department ever considered ways and means of getting fresh fish rapidly distributed throughout rural areas that nowadays, if ever, seldom see a fish unless on occasion a poached one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> This legislation as such envisages an idea that is infinitely smaller than my conception of fishing but, in so far as the legislation is before the House, there are defects I have noticed in it. Some of them have already been adverted to here, but I think we have all overlooked what to me is the most peculiar thing of all.  It is a very simple, innocent section, Section 6, dealing with Part II and it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Part shall come into operation on such day, on or after the establishment date, as the Minister may by order appoint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That certainly leaves an extraordinary position in relation to the whole of Part II.  If the Minister feels that it may take time to evolve the mechanics of this section, let him be generous with himself in the margin of time he allows, but to leave Section 6 in its present form might lead to either a too early implementation of this part of the Act, or it could conceivably lead to an indefinite postponement of the implementation.</P>
    <P>It did occur to me, and I think I mentioned it to the Minister in an aside, that Section 7 and Section 14 could both be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution. I am quite sure the Minister will have that matter examined on its merits by the authorities in his Department. If this Bill must be law, and if this niggardly conception of fishing must be the opinion of this House, I suggest that the Minister should seriously consider the whole problem of control again.  There is conceived in this Bill what one might describe as an executive committee as distinct from what the Minister might call a consultative committee.  I am not enamoured of that.  I do not think it would be impossible for the Minister to weld the two ideas into one.  I have a horrible feeling that this executive committee will be largely nominated from the Civil Service.  I have a feeling that this executive committee, designed as it is, may tend further to aggravate differences that exist among fishermen.</P>
    <P>I do not think&mdash;and I am saying it to the Minister deliberately&mdash;that he <Col N="707" /> found the best solution to problems that have arisen between the Sea Fisheries Association and Muintir na Mara in this type of legislation.  The Minister may well say that fishermen are difficult people to deal with, in bulk anyway.  I suppose that may be said of all people whose life is a difficult and hazardous one.  But I do feel that even on the basis of preserving inshore fishermen, that goodwill that could have been obtained, that cohesion, co-operation and co-ordination that could have been got, may well have been defeated by the abolition of the Sea Fisheries Association and the bringing into being of this new body. I am convinced that the Minister looks upon fishing as a kind of troublesome step-child of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the characteristic broadness of vision and the characteristic drive of the Minister for Agriculture are not enshrined in this measure nor, indeed, is there enshrined in it that spirit, so trenchantly flaunted in this House, and expressed in the statement that no inspector would cross the farmer's ditch unless he was invited.</P>
      <P>This Bill envisages very wide and very definite controls, very wide and very definite invasions of the business of certain sections of the community. It may be that the Minister can say, &ldquo;I must have this control because there is preference in the prices being given to the inshore fishermen in order to preserve their way of life,&rdquo; but I, representing, as I do, an important fishing community, am telling the Minister that this Bill will not preserve the way of life that it is sought to preserve, because he cannot build an economy of Irish fishing on the hope that in periods of scarcity he can purchase elsewhere fish that could be caught by Irish trawlers or by substituting for fresh fish foreign tinned fish which, despite the Minister's dislike, some people like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying deliberately that there is not enough fish coming into the <Col N="708" /> ordinary fish markets, that there is not co-ordinated distribution of fish, that there is no real analysis or conception of the potential domestic market.  In that situation, the Minister will have to face the problem of developing fishing as an industry capable of supplying home needs and of setting up adjuncts to that industry to use up surpluses that may periodically arise.</P>
    <P>I want to get the Minister thinking on the lines on which he thinks in the Department of Agriculture.  I want to get him thinking on the basis of preserving, certainly, for the inshore fishermen such of the domestic market as they can supply, and of having Irish-manned deep-sea trawlers, Irish-owned deep-sea trawlers, to fill the shortages that may arise and to meet the market demand when the inshore fishermen cannot fish, to make it a complementary and economic system. Let him envisage here and now the many subsidiary industries that he can build around the raw material abundantly present within convenient range of the Irish coast and of having harbours properly equipped to deal with deep-sea trawlers.  Let him explain to the House why these two ideas cannot be complementary, why they must be antagonistic, when the Minister in his executive capacity, can control the menace that the deep-sea trawler might be to the inshore fishermen if it were given complete, unharnessed freedom.  Let him remember and note well that many exiles of West Cork, Kerry and other places are seeking and obtaining a remunerative living as members of the crew and in some cases as skippers of the deep-sea trawlers that he so abhors.</P>
    <P>The three potentials are there.  There need not be any interference with the inshore fishermen.  The fish can be got; the boats can be got and, with the Minister's co-operation, Irish exiles can be brought back, fully trained personnel, to man trawlers that would ply from Irish harbours and not from Grimsby or other foreign trawling ports.</P>
    <P>I say deliberately to the Minister that the conception of this Bill is small.  It envisages, not an expansion <Col N="709" /> and development of a strong fishing industry, but an assurance that whatever limited quantity of fish is available will be sold for the benefit of the fishermen.  It would be infinitely better for the fisherman, even if his price was less, if he could get larger quantities of fish and a bigger and broader market.  I say quite seriously that if the question were properly tackled, infinitely greater quantities of fish than can be caught at the moment could be made readily available to more and more people at a reasonable cost and in that way fish would become part of the ordinary household diet.  That would help to counteract the impact of rising costs of other commodities that are included in the ordinary diet.  We must realise that we are facing a period when the costs of certain agricultural commodities that are consumed in the normal household will rise steeply, that beef, mutton, lamb and all these other household commodities are going to be a good deal dearer.  In that situation, we should be developing a bigger fishing industry and making more and more fish available to our people to meet some of the ordinary food needs in the home.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill itself is concerned, many of its features are new. I think the Minister, before this Bill comes to the Committee Stage, if unfortunately it should come to the Committee Stage, should try to find a more unified type of control.  Possibly on that stage we shall also have to deal with certain difficulties that have been raised by other Deputies, but I really want an explanation from the Minister, not based on any statement that there was a trawler company here some ten or 15 years ago which went bankrupt. That is of no interest to me.  I want to know from the Minister is there anything inconsistent, anything wrong or anything intrinsically menacing to the inshore fishermen in having Irish trawlers manned by Irish fishermen and complementary to the inshore fishermen, bringing home, as they can, material not alone for human consumption but for the subsidiary industries which could be built around the fishing industry?  We are investing <Col N="710" /> millions and millions of money in land reclamation and in capital expenditure of all types.  I say to the Minister: why not conceive again, with the original principles of Sinn Féin, an Irish fishing industry as a practical economic business, an Irish fishing industry that could compete with the boats which travel to our fishing grounds from Sweden, Portugal, Belgium and other countries? Why cannot we in Ireland, instead of condemning for all time by this piece of legislation, progress and the enlargement of this industry, envisage, as a complementary source of supply deep-sea trawlers to supply a market for fish at home that is not adequately supplied and cannot be adequately supplied until such time as the Department moves in the direction in which it should move, explores the potential of the home market, develops distribution on a proper basis throughout the country, and thus give the Irish people supplies of fish that in many parts of the country they seldom or never see?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I usually say something on fishing matters although since the present Minister took over he has indicated to me that he has not much interest in what I have to tell him.  That does not encourage one to put forward many suggestions and in the few remarks I have to offer on this Bill I am afraid I shall have to bear that particular attitude of the Minister in mind.  Co-operation in the fishing industry has usually been compulsory. Compulsory co-operation may be a contradiction in terms but, in any event, it has been of that sort.  The partial co-operation that we have had since the Sea Fisheries Association was founded has not succeeded in spite of what the Minister has said.  No essential <Col N="711" /> change took place from the time it was established, in spite of the fact that you had intervening the Fianna Fáil régime between that of Cumann na nGaedheal and the present régime. It is now being scrapped.</P>
    <P>The control of the association remained practically unchanged and it was quite impossible, or practically impossible, as I pointed out here on many occasions, to change it without an enormous effort, which really was not within the competence of any individual Deputy unless he gave practically all his time to the job of bringing that about.  Membership was not as confined as it is now proposed to make it under this Bill.  While there were additions to membership from year to year, voting rights did not depend on the fulfilment of their obligations by the members.  If a member defaulted in the payment of his sharecalls, all an applicant for election to the committee had to do was to go around the country, collect these papers, pay the shillings or whatever the amount was, fill up the ballot papers and send them in, so that the man with the largest cheque was sure of getting on the committee.  These and many other things were pointed out.  I must say that the advisers to the Minister, the officials, have not neglected or ignored entirely all the representations that were made to them from time to time.  I think that I, personally, can claim the credit for having the cumbersome electoral area broken up into four parts.  The only thing about the carrying out of these advisory functions is that the advisers seem to be very slow to react.  However, the reaction has come and it is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill is concerned, I think the most that we can say about it is that it is providing a new reorganisation of compulsory co-operation which is a feature of Government interference in the fishing industry.  I have nothing to cavil at about the compulsory nature of that co-operation. I do not even wish to make the point whether any of these sections will be <i>ultra vires</i> any provision in the Constitution. Whether the Bill can take a chance with the Constitution is <Col N="712" /> a matter of small concern to me.  I think the risk would be worth while.</P>
    <P>The Minister's objective is to maintain the inshore industry.  He told us on previous occasions that it is a way of life, and that, as such, he intends to preserve it.  I do not know whether I may be misjudging the Minister, but it seems to me that that indicates that his interest in the fishing industry is no more than what one would have in a museum piece.  He need not hearken &mdash;he did not do so in the past&mdash;to suggestions from this side.  He got them to-day in much more forcible terms from those sitting behind him.  I, too, do not want to see the inshore fishermen wiped out, but I would like to point out to the Minister that his purpose of maintaining the inshore industry, and of providing whatever development is possible on the basis of the home market, is going to be a very difficult proposition for this reason: that the home market for fish, just as the market for any other home product, is not likely to be capable of much development unless it can be supplied. In the matter of food, one expects to get continuous supplies.  I think everyone knows that our inshore fishing industry is not capable of providing that continuity of supply which is necessary to foster that market. Deputy Collins referred to that question and suggested means of meeting it.  Deputy Dr. Ryan did the same. Whatever the method may be by which the deficiency in the inshore industry can be met, I know that the Minister does not like the sound of the word trawler.  In any event, some means will have to be found to give that continuity of supply, if even the inshore industry is to be maintained.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the Minister that, along the coast, 30 and 40 years ago, when there were no engined boats, there were larger quantities of fish and a greater variety of fish available to the consuming fish public than there are to-day.  Now, we have the engined boats.  We have the association's standard boat of 36 feet over all. Yet, the varieties of fish have not returned in the same quantities as we had them 30 or 40 years ago.  I suggest to the Minister that he should ponder <Col N="713" /> on that and ask himself what is the reason for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have as fine fishermen as ever we had in places where they have not got beyond the row boat stage.  I think that subsequent to the first world war, with the development of the steam trawler, and the wider range of those trawlers, more and more of them found out our fishing grounds.  They came there and carried out intensive fishing.  There was also the fact that they could come to within three miles of the shore.  All that had a deleterious effect on the spawning grounds.  I think that is why various people in this House have recommended from time to time that something should be done with the international organisation concerned about getting an extension of that three mile limit if these spawning grounds are to be preserved.  The fishermen themselves will tell you that they have seen these trawlers&mdash;British, Spanish, French and of various other nationalities&mdash;on the west coast, and have seen immature fish being heeled over those boats in large quantities. That may be the cause of the shortage. The question arises, what is going to happen if that scarcity is to continue within easy reach of our shores?  Are we going to continue to provide large sums of money for an inferior type of boat, too small and not sufficiently powered, to go out where the fish is available, and capable of meeting the hazards, from the weather point of view, that must be met if the boats are to go farther afield?</P>

The Minister seems to have a bee in his bonnet about this trawling business&mdash;that it is going to kill prematurely the inshore industry.  I know we have had trouble around the coast where the new competition turned up on the scene.  We had it in Galway Bay.  There, again, the small size of our boats was the cause of that jealousy, because the boats which came into the new waters were unable to go out to the places which the foreigners could reach. Therefore, all our boats supplied by the association had practically to confine their activities to the scrapings up of our own bays and harbours.</P>

      <P>There are matters, as has been mentioned, that possibly can be better dealt with section by section. It seems to me, however, that sections of this Bill, particularly Section 14, will be quite unfair to certain people who are in the fish trade, who equipped themselves with good boats and who are now likely to be put off <Col N="715" /> the sea under Section 14.  If that happens, it will be quite unjustifiable and these people will have a very definite cause of complaint.  If people have been prepared to put their money into equipping good boats, giving employment to fishermen, and, incidentally, giving us a better and more regular supply of fish, they deserve well of the Minister, of the Government and of the fish-eating public.  I hope that nothing like that will happen.</P>
      <P>The question of the revocation of a licence ought not to be left to the courts.  The Bill states that people who have habitually disregarded the conditions of the licence, or of any of them, will have their licence revoked. If there is to be any assessment of habitual breaking of conditions, that can be done better by the people who issue the licence, who are in constant touch with the fishermen and who administer the entire business, rather than by a district justice, who will have only second-hand knowledge of the matter and will not be able to give as fair a decision as to habitual disregarding of conditions as the authorities in the association.  There will be many miscarriages of justice if that power is to be operated by district justices.  I have no doubt that representatives of the association will appear in court and give advice and assistance.  Nevertheless, it would be better if the matter were dealt with by the Sea Fisheries Association. These boats will be issued by the Department and will be provided by public expense, and the authority that administers these funds will have a closer contact with the operation of the boats and will be better qualified than a district justice to decide as to whether a man has been honouring his contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing noticable about this Bill, like all previous attempts to regulate the fish trade, is that it does not attempt to deal with shoal fish and to face the question of trying to market herrings and mackerel.  It is a pity that the Department which is now taking what might <Col N="716" /> be called totalitarian powers for the regulation of the fishing industry should not take its courage in its hands and include herrings and mackerel in its operations.  I do not suggest that it could on all occasions successfully handle all the mackerel and herrings that would be available; but there are many occasions in which it might find mackerel and herrings a very useful substitute when demersal fish are not sufficiently plentiful to meet the demand.  The question of what is a fisherman can, perhaps, be dealt with more effectively on the Committee Stage.  If a man buys a boat, would that qualify him for membership of the new association?  That is an important question and it ought to be made clear in the definition.  If he puts his money into the buying of a boat, he ought to be entitled to have some say in the matter, either directly or by proxy.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out when introducing the Bill, the choice in this matter was between free for all and complete control.  In present circumstances, of the two courses I think it was better to try the totalitarian method.  Under the Bill, nobody can engage in fishing unless he is a member of the association.  That seems a rather tall order, but, if the purpose which we all have in mind can be achieved by this method, it is worth trying.  Personally, I would not be too squeamish about taking risks with the Constitution.  Fishermen themselves are not terribly concerned about these matters and, if the industry can be developed, if the market can be expanded and, above all, if their income can be increased, I think they will take the same view as I take about it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is mainly for reorganising control and co-operation, and the co-operation remains compulsory as before except that it is now comprehensive and all-embracing.  The question of the landing of fish by people who are not nationals seems to have raised a query in the minds of some people who have read the Bill.  I take it that the landing of fish by people who are not nationals and who are not members of the association is controlled by the Control of Imports Act.  If it <Col N="717" /> is not, there is a flaw in the Bill which requires attention.  I hope that matter will be explained to us when the debate is being closed or during the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the old association is to disappear.  It was never really an association, because you could not get its members to meet.  Some reference was made to having a fisherman as chairman of a meeting.  At some of the annual meetings of the old association there was only one fisherman to about five or six non-fishermen members present.  You simply could not get a quorum of fishermen.  I hope that position will not be allowed to arise under this Bill and that there will be a periodical revision of the membership if the annual subscriptions are not paid.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly how the election to the advisory committee will take place and whether the abuses which existed in regard to elections under the old body will be eliminated.  In any event, it will not be so important now because the effective control of the association is in other hands.  At the beginning of the war, as a member of the committee of the Sea Fisheries Association, I recommended something of this kind because I knew, from my experience of the first world war, that during war periods the fishing industry requires very little artificial stimulation. It requires very little coddling from civil servants, committees or associations.</P>
    <P>The industry provides in war-time a food for which there is a ready demand and when one has an article for sale for which there is such a demand it does not require a great deal of organisation to sell it.  That was the experience gained in the first world war.  At the outbreak of the last war it was my view that that experience would operate again.  It did operate and I found personally that I did not have to give my time and attention to organising markets for the fishermen and I, therefore, severed my connection with the committee.  Before doing so, I proposed a resolution, which was carried, giving powers somewhat similar to those now contained in this <Col N="718" /> measure; I think events have justified my viewpoint.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, one fairly universal cause of complaint amongst fishermen during the war with regard to gear and equipment.  A great many people received quotations from across channel for gear at prices somewhat less than those charged by the association. Those enhanced prices of the association continued right through the period of emergency.  There were also complaints about distribution. However, that phase has passed and I hope that it will not be revived.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is an attempt to cure the defects and faults in the organisation of this industry. Naturally I welcome any attempt to give better organisation in the industry. I hope the Minister will give some attention to the fish consuming public.  If the industry is to survive it can only survive with the continued support of that public.  If one takes the view that that is the main purpose of the fishing industry, then one must recast one's views with regard to complete dependence on the inshore fishing industry.  That industry is gradually declining because of circumstances outside our control.  Very serious competition operates within three miles of our shores.  We can do nothing about that, however, since it is within the province of some international body.</P>
    <P>The home market can be revived and is capable of expansion in my opinion if the public is kept supplied with fish and if they can procure that fish in a certain variety.  It is no use expecting people to eat mackerel, herrings, excellent though they may be, or whiting all the time.  I agree with Deputy S. Collins that if one wants fish, constantly and in variety, one must come to Dublin for it.  In Galway and in other places one gets the tail-end of the supply that comes in.  The best fish is boxed and sent up to Dublin or out to the country.  Whiting has been described as the chicken of the sea, but one can get very tired of whiting.  Yet, as a rule whiting was the only fish procurable in Galway.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister will have <Col N="719" /> powers which no Minister has ever had before in relation to this industry I hope that he will utilise these powers to ensure a more rational distribution of fish in the future.  I have had the experience travelling up to Dublin from Galway of seeing a fish van at the end of my train; I have had the experience many times of passing a Galway-bound train with a fish van attached to it. The fish from Galway was being sent to Dublin while the fish going to Galway came from Grimsby or somewhere else.  I have mentioned that matter before.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now taking certain powers.  I know that the difficulties in the past were due in some measure to the fact that the fishermen wished to market the fish themselves individually, even in cases where they had signed a marketing contract and had agreed to market their fish through the association which had supplied them with a boat.  At a time when they thought individual marketing would bring in more money, human nature being what it is, they left the association's marketing arrangement and launched out on their own.  That was a big snag in any State operation which was not totalitarian in character.  I do not take the views some speakers have taken, and I hold that any defect in marketing cannot be remedied if one's powers are inadequate.  If it is only done partially, it seems to me that the defect will continually arise.  It is a case of &ldquo;going the whole hog&rdquo; or leaving it a &ldquo;free for all&rdquo;.  For that reason, I have no objection to the powers the Minister now proposes to take.  The Minister must admit that he is not applying the same principles in the fishing industry as he applies in relation to tillage.  He is taking the opposite view in relation to the fishing industry.  This is an experiment, and alterations can be made if it is not successful.  I hope that it will be successful. I am glad it is being tried and, if it does not succeed, let us try something else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because of the principal objectives <Col N="720" /> expressed therein.  One of those objectives is to ensure improved outlets with particular reference to the home market for landings made by inshore fishermen.  The first essential is to create a demand for fish.  The Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture and the Sea Fisheries Association have made no attempt whatsoever to create such a demand. I agree with Deputy Bartley that Dublin is the only place where fresh fish can be obtained at the moment. We must go down into the inland towns of Ireland, down into the houses in the rural areas and educate the people there into the advantages of a fish diet.  Some short time ago I put down a question asking the Minister would he consider the suggestion that films should be used for the purpose of displaying the various methods of cooking fish.  The buck has been passed in so far as that question was concerned; I have never received a reply to it.  I know that people in the inland towns and throughout the country generally abhor the taste and smell of fish simply because they have never been educated into its use and into the proper methods of cooking it. During the war the British Ministry of Food spent thousands of pounds in educating the people in the filleting and boning of herrings.  I will guarantee one will not get a boneless herring in any inland town in this country.  We must educate the people in the advantages of eating fish and having got the market we must look to the supply. There is no use in having a surplus supply with no demand.  The demand must come first and the supply afterwards. There must be continuity of supply.  So long as we cater only for the inshore fishermen, leaving the shore fishermen alone, we can never hope to get that continuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tell the House a true incident which occurred to myself.  I am the part owner of a seine net fishery.  Two seasons ago we were prohibited by the Sea Fisheries Association from fishing more than four days per week at Killybegs. On a Friday of a particular week when we were prohibited from fishing for more than four days, I was in a certain inland town and inquired from a Civic Guard whom I met in the <Col N="721" /> street as to where I could obtain a supply of fresh fish.  He directed me to a man on the corner, who had a supply of immature whiting in a dirty box.  I asked if that was the only supply of fish in the town and I was assured that it was.  I certainly do not blame the people in that town if they are appalled by the smell of fish.  No effort was made to bring in the fish which we could land in Killybegs to supply that inland town.</P>
    <P>One thing that must strike the people is that during the present century we have had on only two occasions a surplus supply of inshore fish.  Those occasions were, strange as it may seem, during the two world wars, 1914-1918 and 1939-1945-6.  During those periods the supply exceeded the demand.  We must ask ourselves why. It is fairly obvious to us all now that the reason why the inshore fishermen were so prosperous was that there was no outside trawling.  So long as we have outside trawling, we can never hope to have inshore fishing.  I agree with Deputy Collins that we must go outside if we cannot get fish inside to maintain the continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>There are two classes of fish to which we should look-the fresh fish and the salted fish.  The salted is the one of which we can get continuity, yet it is the one for which we are not catering. The cured herrings of this country are sufficient to guarantee a supply for the whole Twenty-Six Counties during the whole year, provided they are properly protected.</P>
    <P>The importation of fresh fish is prohibited except under licence, but salt fish can come in <i>ad lib.</i>  to compete against our cured herrings.  As a result, we cannot find a home market for the cured herrings and if we are not lucky enough to secure a continental market, these fish have to be dumped, as they were in former years. It is time we began to cater for a supply of salt fish during the scarce period of fresh fish.  By doing that, if we have a supply of salt fish, we can supply continuously that demand that we should create first.</P>
    <P>Having created the demand, we must continue the supply.  During the recent <Col N="722" /> world war we had a surplus of fresh fish at Killybegs and endeavoured to find home markets for it.  No person was more enthusiastic or worked harder to find an outlet than the local agent of the Sea Fisheries Association. He went around the local towns, around Donegal, Sligo and Ballyshannon, and procured people anxious to sell the fish locally.  When fish got scarce, what did we find the association doing? They let the market which he created go by the board and instead of supplying those local markets, the fish were being brought to Dublin and, as Deputy Bartley said, merely the tailend of the supply was sent to the consumers the agent had created.</P>
    <P>Again, in Donegal we have good sprat fish and on our sprat shores the average take was in the neighbourhood of £50 a year.  We have succeeded in finding an English market for this sprat now and in the last year alone we obtained £8,000 at the Port of Inver for the sprat exported.  Surely the sprat could be marketed, canned and sold in this country, or exported as canned fish, thereby creating employment, and not having them stored here and then sent out as demand requires them in Manchester.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us of the efforts he is making regarding storage for grain crops.  The sooner it is realised that off our coasts we have some of the finest fishing grounds in the world and the sooner canneries, quick freeze and good curing stations are created, the better.  If the Minister could&mdash;I suppose it is impossible for him to do it&mdash;give one fraction of the energy, the time and the ability which he applies to agriculture to the fishing industry, I would be satisfied that that industry would be on a sound basis for all time.</P>

      <P>I want to welcome the Bill, though I feel it is not going far enough and so far as the fishermen in Donegal are concerned it does not hold out much hope that the position will materially improve as a result.  The Minister is aware that the mainstay of the fishing industry in Donegal is the herrings.  We have a grudge against the various Ministers for Agriculture and the Department and the Sea Fisheries Association for a long time, that they pay very little attention to the herring fishing and to efforts to obtain markets for it.  For a number of years we have been asking the Department to arrange a system whereby herring fishermen in Donegal would at least get a minimum price for their product.  We have asked that, because for some years past the fishermen there are at the mercy of the private buyers.  There is no competition. The private buyers come along and form a ring and beat down the prices to whatever figure they feel they should give to the fishermen.  If the fishermen do not like to take that small price the herrings can rot.  It should be the duty of the Department to help the fishermen in whatever way possible by ensuring that there would be a minimum price at least and that the Department would take the fish over at that price rather than give them to these private buyers at such bankrupt prices as have often been offered by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the Deputies who have spoken are as one in the opinion that this should be one of the most important industries.  I have made this remark when the last Government was in office and I make it now again.  I say that until we have in this maritime country of ours a Minister for Fisheries, one <Col N="724" /> whose time will not be taken up by other important duties, I cannot hold out very much hope that the fishing industry will ever be the success it should be.  I am making no reflection on the capabilities of the present Minister for Agriculture.  I know that he is interested in the fishing industry and would be very glad to do all he could to make it a success.  I feel it is asking too much of any Minister for Agriculture to take over a Department that should be one of the most important Departments in this country.</P>
    <P>I feel that the fishing industry is the &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; industry in this country so far as all the Governments we have had since we got self-government are concerned.  Until we get a Minister for Fisheries or a Parliamentary Secretary who can devote all his time travelling around the country, seeing the fishermen and travelling round the piers and seeing what is being done and seeing the problems first hand of the fishermen in the various places from Cork to Donegal, I feel that the headway we will make in the fishing industry will be very slight indeed.</P>
    <P>I agree with what my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, has said with regard to the importation of fish.  It is a sad reflection on a maritime nation such as ours that, after so many years of self-government, it is necessary for us to import fish, fish that can be caught off our own coasts.  Surely, the Government should wake up to the potentialities of the fishing industry and see what it could do for our people if properly organised.</P>
    <P>So far as Donegal is concerned, I am afraid that if matters continue as they have been doing for the last few years, hundreds of our best fishermen will give up the craft or industry altogether.  Young people, now coming along, feel it is too much of a gamble and they are reluctant to get into the industry or spend the time and the energy that would be necessary to make it a success.  I have been speaking to many of them and they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; We may have one good season and four bad ones.  It is better for us to emigrate rather than stick at an industry that offers so little <Col N="725" /> wealth after so much trouble and danger on the high seas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the Government should, at this stage, show our fishermen that they are behind them; that they are willing to help the industry in whatever way possible and that minimum prices should be offered for the herring which is the mainstay of the industry in Donegal.</P>
    <P>After all, the fishermen look at the farmers and see that their products are guaranteed minimum prices.  They cannot understand why the foodstuffs that they land at the piers and harbours around the coast should not be similarly guaranteed in so far as prices are concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the home market, I think that part of the Minister's function should be to create a public demand for fish.  That could be done by spending so many thousands on advertisements in the daily and provincial Press.  They should take a leaf out of the books of manufacturers who have sold their products by continual advertisement.  A campaign of that sort, backed up by guaranteed supplies of fish, would be successful and I recommend it to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is very much more to say, except that Country Donegal has recently been responsible for focusing the attention of the country and the Minister on the question of inshore trawling.  The means they employed for focusing attention was, perhaps, rather drastic, but, at least, it brought home to the people the depredations of the foreign trawlers.  I hope that, in future, the Department will see that the coast is better patrolled and that the fishing industry will be left to our own people and that they will get every opportunity of enjoying the fruits of that industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>One can welcome this Bill because of the fact that the Minister is very much interested in looking after the interests of the inshore fisherman.  Whilst I appreciate that fact, I should like to remind him that, so far as a very big area in my constituency <Col N="726" /> is concerned, there have been times when there was no fish at all.  Owing to that fact, a man in my position is subject to great criticism. One week following another there is no fish to be got.  Whilst we are all interested in furthering the interests of the inshore fishermen, I think more regard should be had for the needs of the consumer.  It is for that reason that I welcome Section 18, which gives the following power, amongst other things, to the Sea Fisheries Association:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board to arrange for the importation of fish to supplement whenever necessary the supply of fish to the home market by Irish fishing boats and to arrange for the proper distribution of such imports to domestic consumers through the recognised trade channels.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome that section, in particular, because no matter what may be said about the importation of fish, the fact remains that the supplies are very uncertain.  I do not think it is fair to traders in Dundalk and Drogheda, who supply a very big hinterland, that they should have their shops empty and have to wire Dublin and other places with no results.  Yet if they wire across the water they will get boxes of fish in a few hours.  There must be something wrong there.  While Acts of Parliament are all right, I think that the fishermen themselves will have to co-operate and do a little more with the Minister and Government and see that proper supplies of fish are available for the people who want fish.</P>
      <P>I have been listening to many debates on this subject.  It is one of the most difficult subjects with which to deal.  The trade itself is very uncertain.  The fact is that we are not a fish-eating people and that is one of the great drawbacks in so far as the fishing industry is concerned.  Sometimes we have a feast and sometimes we have a famine.</P>
      <P>I was particularly struck to-day by the trend of the debate because, if my recollection serves me right, the whole force of the debate was concentrated upon improving the conditions of the inshore fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> The debate to-day would lead me to believe now that that is being set aside by a great many Deputies and that they are all out for the creation of what is known as a trawling fleet. They speak of the creation of such a fleet as if it were something that can be done overnight.  You cannot buy trawlers like buttons.  It takes a good deal of money to buy trawlers and a trawler fleet would cost the country a very considerable sum.  It is not such an easy matter as some Deputies would lead us to believe.  I know that on the far side there have been hundreds of these trawlers tied up for years and years and that the owners of these vessels have incurred enormous losses.  It is a question of whether this country can afford to go into that business or not.  I have no very strong views on the matter, but I would go so far as to say that I do not think we can have both a trawler fleet and a fleet for inshore fishermen. It is a very difficult problem and the fact is that each successive Minister has done his best to do all he could in the interests of these fishermen.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to do that, so far as it is humanly possible.  Certain sections may be subject to amendment when the Committee Stage is reached, but, so far as Sections 7 and 14 are concerned, I do not think there is any need for alarm with regard to their unconstitutionality.  If these sections were <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, all the rules and regulations of trade unions would be unconstitutional, because every trade union, whether a trade union of ordinary workers, the medical profession or the legal profession, makes rules which could, more or less, be argued to be <i>ultra vires.</i> Section 14 merely prescribes the length of the boat and Section 7 prescribes that a man must be a member of the association.  These rules are quite common in trade unions and in all classes of associations, professional and otherwise, and we need not waste much time in speaking of details of that nature.</P>
    <P>We want, within the limited resources at our disposal, to keep the men who are engaged in inshore fishing occupied and to give them as good a <Col N="728" /> return as possible for the labour they put into their work.  That is what the Minister is out to ensure, but he cannot do that without the goodwill and co-operation of the fishermen themselves.  Doubts have been cast on the wisdom of the Minister's action in trying to further the interests of the inshore fishermen, but Deputies must make up their minds that they cannot sit on two stools.  They must have either one or the other, and, if this Bill does not accomplish what the Minister hopes, it will be a matter of letting the best horse jump the ditch, of letting all trawlers come in in order to ensure a good supply of fish for the people.  We cannot have it both ways and the sooner Deputies make up their mind on that the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason, and no reasonable person could have reason, to complain of the tone of the debate.  It has been moderate and reasonable and has contained suggestions which will be very carefully considered on their merits.  I should like to reply, so far as I am able, to the specific matters raised by Deputies.  I agree with Deputy Coburn that one of the principal duties of any fishery authority such as that envisaged in the Bill is to guarantee the consuming public a supply of fish. I am a little disappointed that Deputy Coburn feels that the supply of fish in recent weeks and months has shown no improvement on the situation that obtained five or six months ago.  I had hoped that such an improvement had been effected and that I had been taking measures which had in some degree alleviated that supply position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past five or six months, we have succeeded in some degree&mdash;I will not say more than that &mdash;in alleviating a position which approximated to a chronic scarcity of demersal fish on the retail market.  We hope to improve on that as time goes on.  I want to improve it by increasing the landings of the inshore fishermen and arranging for their prompt distribution. What I think a good many people in Dublin, Cork and other urban <Col N="729" /> centres forget is that fish landed by our inshore fishermen is far superior to Grimsby trawler-caught fish because the fish our men land is marketed while it is still fresh fish direct from the sea.  In the case of the trawler going out on a three weeks' cruise, half the fish in that trawler is a fortnight old, lying in ice, before it is ever put on the wholesale market at all and then finds its way on to the retailer's slab and thence to the consumer's frying pan.  My objective is to keep the demand met by the landings of our own inshore fishermen but <i>ad interim</i> to fill the lacuna by imported fish.</P>
      <P>That brings me at once to the issue joined by Deputy Collins and one or two other Deputies with myself on this subject of trawlers.  Deputy Collins thinks it is a mistake that the lacuna in supplies should be filled by imports and not by trawlers, and says that I have a bee in my bonnet about trawlers.  So far as I am aware, I have no bees in my bonnet at all on the subject, but the plain fact is that if you want to operate trawlers, you cannot have much fewer than six if you want to operate a fleet.  Trawlers are expensive vessels, and, if you want to man and operate six trawlers, you cannot send them out to trawl once every three weeks.  They have to trawl day in and day out in order to earn their keep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are expensive commodities to maintain.  They carry very heavy overheads and they must be earning every possible day you can get them to sea.  But if you put a substantial and efficient trawler fleet to sea as often as it is possible to get it to sea and bring it back to port, loaded with fish, as frequently as you can get it back, it is only a matter of time, and a very short time, until the domestic market is so flooded with trawler fish that the inshore fishermen will not be able to dispose of the demersal fish at all.  The only reason why I brought in this Bill is that I am interested in the inshore fishermen.  If I did not believe myself to be working for the inshore fishermen, I should make a great stand to get out of the Department of Fisheries.  Let us be quite frank.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee <Col N="730" /> for retail or wholesale fishmongers or for trawlers.  I should let somebody else worry about them if they were the people concerned.  My only interest in fishing is the inshore fishermen. I believe I can make that community prosperous.  I believe I can give them a stable, decent standard of living.  I am convinced that the community at large is prepared to pay a small premium on demersal fish if they are reassured that that outlay on their part secures for the inshore fishermen the kind of living I think we can secure for them. They are under no obligation for that living: rather are we under an obligation to them.  Though the price paid by Irish consumers for the inshore fishermen's fish may be a trifle higher than that of trawler fish, it is certain that, in so far as the domestic demand for demersal fish is supplied by inshore fishermen, our people are getting better fish than trawler fish It is true that if there was open competition, the average consumer might content himself with the relatively poor quality fish from trawlers, but by actually paying a little more for inshore-caught fish the Irish consumer is, in fact, getting better value.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan apprehended that some isolated individual would catch a handful of codling and want to sell it to his neighbour.  These isolated warriors who operate their own boats may bring in a few herring or mackerel on a string and sell the fish among their neighbours.  If that is so, this Bill does not apply to them at all.  I have never heard of a man who went out and caught a couple of codfish or turbot and who then went out and sold it to his neighbours off a string.  Nelson had a blind eye, and if I can find such a man who sells fish to his neighbour, certainly if it is not a telescope that I should put to my eye, I should put a black patch on it, because such a man deserves to be allowed technically to break the law&mdash;if he exists, and I do not believe he does.</P>
    <P>Could I get Deputies to see, as set up under this Bill, a body of shareholders, which is the advisory committee: the directors are the board.  I want the board to meet regularly so <Col N="731" /> as to run the business in the most efficient possible way.  I want the advisory body to meet as often as it wants to meet.  The reason why I want the Minister to have the right to name the chairman of the advisory body is that if Deputies will look at Section 47 they will see that the advisory body is made up of sea fishermen, representatives of the retail fish trade, representatives of the wholesale fish trade and representatives of other interests.  When they come to elect their committee they are obliged to choose four representatives of sea fishermen, two representatives of the retail fish trade and two members representative of other interests.  But I cannot tell them to choose a chairman who will be one-eighth sea fisherman, one-eighth retail fish trader and one-eighth wholesale fish trader. You cannot divide one man into fractions.  What it seemed to me to be necessary was that when the whole advisory committee met there should be in the chair a neutral person who would hold the ring for all the contending interests there represented, all of whom would have an opportunity of speaking their mind and all of whom would have an opportunity of having their case fairly stated because the chairman would be neutral, nominated by the Minister and not by any individual representative in the association.</P>
    <P>I want to get a Bill that will do the job and make the inshore fishermen prosperous.  The 5/- fee is to pay for the ink, pens and stationery of the advisory body.  If it appears to the House to be too much, I will reduce it.  I should be slow to increase it materially. I do not think it is too much.  I think we want it at 5/-.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies who say that in their judgment this Bill could be discussed more cogently on the Committee Stage, if we accept the general underlying principle at all.  It is largely a Bill of detail.  I invite the House to accept the principle that it is the inshore fishermen who count.  If that is so, I think we may with propriety, pass the Second Stage of the Bill now and I am in the hands of the Opposition as <Col N="732" /> to when they wish the Committee Stage to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, I am afraid I will have to ask your indulgence and the indulgence of the House for rather a lengthy statement, but, however lengthy the statement that I must necessarily make may be, I am afraid I will not have time to answer in detail all the suggestions, innuendoes and charges conveyed in the statement delivered to-day by the former Minister for Health against myself and my 11 colleagues in the Cabinet.  At the conclusion of his statement I stated: &ldquo;I have seldom listened to a statement in which there were so many&mdash;let me say it as charitably as possible - inaccuracies, misstatements and misrepresentations.&rdquo;  I understated the position in that short phrase because I have never in the course of long experience heard such a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Answering these charges that have been made, I find myself in the position of very many like me who endeavoured to act the role of peacemaker and of friend anxious to help and who found their efforts repudiated and their actions misconstrued. Throughout the long and agonising months that have just passed, I and three or four of my colleagues gave of our very best, in a sincere desire to help our then colleague, the Minister for Health, and to get him out of the difficulties in which he by his own obstinacy had found himself. Repeatedly I said to him that we were willing and anxious to help him in any possible way and that he could call upon us at any time.  The last words I addressed to the Minister for Health as he left his Cabinet Colleagues last Friday, after the Government decision had been made, were to ask him to remember that in the last months we had been willing to help him and, as he was going away to consider his decision. <Col N="733" /> I wanted him to know that we still were willing to help him and did not want to turn the corkscrew on him.  My attitude during all those frightful months received the thanks embodied in the document read here to-day by Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
    <P>In order to answer those charges it will be necessary for me to go in detail through all the facts and all the talks that have emerged in the course of this controversy.  I could, of course, take up Deputy Dr. Browne's statement to-day and regard it as an indictment and answer each sentence, piece by piece and line by line, but I think that in this way the House and more particularly the public outside this House would have a better perception of the true facts and would be able to put into proper perspective the reckless and untrue charges that have been made by Deputy Dr. Browne against me and my friends and colleagues in the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>This affair has its roots, not in the last six months, but as far back as 1947 before we came into office and when the Government under the leadership of Deputy de Valera, now leader of the Opposition, was Government of this country.  On the 3rd December, 1947, an originating plenary summons was issued in the High Court of Justice by Mr. James Dillon, now Minister for Agriculture, as plaintiff, against the Minister for Health, as defendant. That summons asked the High Court to declare that the following sections of the Health Act of 1947 namely, sections 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 were repugnant to the Constitution and invalid and seeking certain further consequential reliefs.  That summons was signed by Mr. Nugent as junior counsel, by Mr. McGilligan, present Minister for Finance, as senior counsel, by Mr. Lavery, subsequently Attorney-General in this Government, now a member of the Supreme Court, and by myself.  It will be recalled that during the very stormy passage of the two Health Bills that came before the House we put up a spirited and sustained opposition to various sections, parts and provisions of those two particular Bills.  One subsequently became law and is now the law of this land with the title, Health Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> I mention these matters for the purpose of showing that we were thoroughly familiar with the implications of many of the provisions of the Health Act of 1947 and keenly alive to many of its imperfections.  One of the first things that we did when we became the Government of this country and were in a position to give effect to our views as expressed as counsel&mdash;and I may say, on the part of the Minister for Agriculture that, as plaintiff, he risked his private fortune, if he had lost that action, as an earnest of the conviction that he felt of the dangers and the infirmities inherent in the sections to which I have referred&mdash;was to decide that we would repeal those particular offending sections.  I will deal in a moment with the manner in which that was attempted to be done.</P>
    <P>Some time after we assumed office&mdash; I have not got the habit of making notes or memoranda; I have much too much to do, so I am not in a position to say on what date-I first because aware of the fact that the Hierarchy of this country had made representations to my predecessor privately.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;privately&rdquo; because I intend to refer to that aspect of the matter later on in this general connection.  They conveyed to the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, their views in connection with the then recently enacted Health Act.  I refer to that letter because I feel that I am at liberty to refer to it, although it was intended to be and was a private communication to the then Taoiseach. I do so for the reason that it is referred to in the correspondence that has taken place in reference to the mother and child health scheme advocated by Deputy Dr. Browne, and I have also the authority of the representative of the Hierarchy, Most Rev. Dr. McQuaid, to do so.</P>
    <P>On 7th October, 1947, the Hierarchy sent the then Taoiseach a letter in which they expressed disapproval of certain parts of the Health Act, 1947, especially those dealing with the mother and child service.  The letter referred to Part III of the Act, in which a public authority was empowered to provide for the health of all children, to treat their ailments, <Col N="735" /> educate them in regard to health, educate women in regard to motherhood, and provide all women with gynæcological care.  The Hierarchy pointed out that to claim such powers for a public authority without qualification was entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teachings, the rights of the family, the rights of the Church in education, the rights of the medical profession and of voluntary institutions.</P>
    <P>I have told the House what the position was on the 3rd December, 1947. Of course, we did not know at that time of the existence of this letter of the Hierarchy to the then Taoiseach. The then Taoiseach wrote in reply to that letter on the 16th February, 1948, two days before the change of Government, merely stating that he did not reply earlier because of the writ that had been issued by Mr. Dillon against the Minister for Health.  I gave a copy of that correspondence to Deputy Dr. Browne some time subsequently, some time after the letter of the 10th October, 1950, which will be referred to later on.  I pointed out to him the objections made in that letter and the objections made in the letter of 1947. In that context I hope to remember, when I am dealing with the allegations, some of the allegations made by Deputy Dr. Browne, to refer again to the fact that I gave him this document in answer to the suggestion he made that I corroborated that he had satisfied His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, on all the points of the letter of the 10th October, 1950.</P>
    <P>That letter of the 7th October, 1947, is also of very vital importance in view of the underlying and vicious suggestion in all this controversy, that I and my colleagues in the Government roped in, if I may use that vulgar expression, the Hierarchy in order to get us out of the difficulty of being ensnared in a scheme we did not like. That suggestion underlies the entire speech of the former Minister for Health to-day.  It is a suggestion which is entirely groundless, a suggestion displaying the viciousness that is behind the attack made by Deputy Dr. Browne on me and on my colleagues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> And this did not originate through anything we did; it originated before we came in here as a Government and it very largely reflected the views which James Dillon held, and held so strongly and with such conviction that he risked his own private fortune in a High Court action in which we, as counsel, put our names and guaranteed to the then Attorney-General that in our opinion there was a good cause of action, before a fiat was given.  We took a very strong view on that, and, when we became the Government, we immediately said: &ldquo;We must get rid of these offending sections and carry into effect our convictions as to the position that originated in 1947.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Dr. Browne in his statement to-day to a decision of the Government in June, 1948.  On 25th June, 1948, proposals embodying our suggestions, our directions I may say, to the Minister for Health to have prepared a Bill repealing these offending sections, came before the Government, and on that occasion he brought forward heads of a Bill which included provisions for the repeal of the offending clauses of the Act of 1947, and other proposals dealing with the mother and child scheme.  So far as I was concerned, from the 18th February, 1948, until 25th June, 1948, I had heard no suggestion of a mother and child scheme, and the way that came before us, on the part of the Minister who subsequently became so obstinately involved in the conditions precedent to any negotiations with the medical profession, and who now says he has broken with his colleagues on the scheme, was not a proposal for a free-for-all and no-means-test scheme.</P>
    <P>The suggestion he made at that time was that the medical profession were antipathetic to this scheme, hostile to it, and he proposed that the scheme should be amended by law in the proposed Bill, enabling the local authority to charge fees.  But the first intimation we got of the mother and child scheme, which subsequently emerged as a free-for-all and no-means-test scheme, the one on which he left the Government, was his own proposal to enable fees to be charged&mdash;to <Col N="737" /> put it in the text.  The medical profession were hostile to this mother and child scheme and he suggested that, if that provision were put in, it might soften their hostility.  He then said that he did not intend to commit himself at that stage to the acceptance or rejection of the point of view of the Medical Association, which was that they would not in any way work a scheme which provided for non-necessitous people.</P>
    <P>We were young as a Government at that time, and we thought we could not put the provision he suggested through the House, and, accordingly, we decided we would not go on with that particular provision but we would with other provisions with reference to the Health Act of 1947.  He said to us at that stage that he did not propose to commit himself to the acceptance or rejection of the view of the Medical Association.  Deputies will remember the statement he made to-day, that the decision of the 25th June, 1948, was a green light to him to go on with the mother and child scheme, free for all and no means test.  From that he works up the entire case he made to-day.</P>
    <P>He said in the course of his statement that, the decision of the Government&mdash;and again he puts it subtly, but he does not put it straight-was, in effect, that there should be no means test, that there should be no provision put into Part III, enabling a local authority to charge fees.  There was no question of whether or not a private practitioner or general medical practitioner could charge private fees, or have private patients of his own within the scheme.  We are left with the position, that he had not made up his mind to commit himself one way or the other but, following what he said was, in effect, the green light for him, he wrote, he says, in August, 1948, to the Irish Medical Association to inform them that the Government had considered their representations on the question of a means test for the proposed mother and child health scheme and had rejected their proposals for its imposition.</P>
    <P>I never saw that letter.  I do not know what is in it.  It was never <Col N="738" /> brought before the Government.  We never took that decision.  I am bound to say this, for the information of the public, that during the months that followed we heard rumours of a mother and child health scheme, free for all, and we were gravely uneasy.  I can say this, here and now, that this scheme for the mother and child, free for all, no means test, which has been the cause of such acute controversy in this country, never came before the Government as a Government, and even the statement that he made to-day clearly shows that.  He is accusing us now of letting him go on referring to this as a Government scheme, the fact being that this scheme never came before us at all.</P>
    <P>The first time I personally heard of it was when a copy of the scheme was given to me by a person outside the Government who had got it, I think, from a doctor to whom it had been sent by the then Minister for Health; but what he said in his statement to-day is that a copy of that scheme was sent to each of his colleagues for his information. There was never at that time, and there has never since been, any suggestion, nor is it a fact, that that scheme was ever brought before the Government, ever considered by the Government or ever approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>After the so-called scheme&mdash;if I have time, I have a few short comments to make on it&mdash;had been circulated to the medical profession and the controversy between himself and the medical profession had become acute, apparently the Hierarchy got a copy of the scheme.  From whom, I do not know, or how, I do not know.  The first I heard of it was when His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, courteously and kindly asked me to visit him in the Archbishop's House, Drumcondra, to consider a certain letter that had come, or was about to come, from the Hierarchy to me.  I attended at the Archbishop's House on 12th October of last year.  Deputies will recall that Dr. Browne was asked by His Grace of Dublin to come to him on the day before, the 11th, and he has stated here, stated in the correspondence to me, that he attended there and had an interview with His Grace the Archbishop, and His Lordship the Bishop <Col N="739" /> of Ferns, Most Rev. Secretary of the Hierarchy, and His Lordship of Galway, Dr. Browne, and that he satisfied them on all the points.</P>
    <P>I am authorised to give an account as given to me by His Grace the Archbishop and as subsequently confirmed, I believe, to Dr. Browne himself by the Most Rev. Secretary to the Irish Hierarchy, Dr. Staunton.  I do so, not for the purpose of giving any further publicity to matters to which I would very much prefer not to have given any publicity, but merely because I have been attacked, and my colleagues have been attacked, in our integrity and in our public honour, and I am entitled to defend myself and my colleagues. I intend to do so, I hope in all kindliness to my former colleague and in all charity, so far as I can in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I was told by His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, on the 12th October, that he had just had, the day before, an incredible interview with the then Minister for Health.  I do not wish to wound my former colleague in any way but I must say, in defence of myself and my colleagues, that when I am charged with telling him, a few days afterwards, that there was no trouble with the Hierarchy and that he had satisfied them, I am entitled to give the atmosphere in which I received the courteous information as to the troubles and worries of the Hierarchy about this mother and child health scheme.  Deputies will remember that Dr. Browne has stated that it was his impression that he had satisfied the Hierarchy, or rather, I should say, the Archbishop and two Bishops who were deputed on behalf of the Hierarchy to see him&mdash;that he had satisfied them on all points.</P>
    <P>May I say, in parentheses, and in the context of a wider issue on this matter, that all this matter was intended to be private and to be adjusted behind closed doors and was never intended to be the subject of public controversy, as it has been made by the former Minister for Health now, and it would have been dealt with in that way had there been any reasonable person, other than the <Col N="740" /> former Minister for Health, engaged in the negotiations at that time.  The Hierarchy were anxious that they should treat him in all courtesy and in all kindness.  Dr. Browne, in his statement to-day, when referring to that interview, first of all states that he was under the impression, &ldquo;erroneously as it now appears&rdquo;, that he had satisfied His Grace and Their Lordships in all respects on that scheme.  The correspondence which I must read will show the allegation that he made against me, that I had deluded him and tricked him by corroborating the fact, as he said, that he had satisfied His Grace and Their Lordships on all matters.</P>
    <P>It would have been utterly impossible for me to have given any such corroboration or made any such suggestion unless I was entirely and utterly dishonest, having regard to the matters that His Grace of Dublin had told me in connection with the interview on the 11th October.  He told me that, at that interview, the Minister for Health brushed aside all suggestions about the invalidity of the means test and the free-for-all scheme, and would consider nothing but the question of education, on which he said &ldquo;you have a point there&rdquo; and that he would consider it.  The Minister himself terminated the interview and walked out.  He refused to discuss anything other than the question of education, brushed the other matters aside and walked out.  I was told that by His Grace of Dublin, and I am charged now and in the correspondence with having corroborated to the Minister for Health that he had, in fact, in every respect satisfied His Grace of Dublin and Their Lordships of Ferns and Galway that there was nothing in the objections of the Hierarchy.  He now admits, in his statement to-day, that he was erroneous in that impression.</P>
    <P>As will be seen by Deputies and those who read the correspondence, he persisted in that allegation right down to Holy Thursday of this year, when he went to His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, who repeated to him. verbatim practically, all that had taken place and recalled one phrase that His Grace had used to him: &ldquo;Let <Col N="741" /> us be clear, Mr. Minister, in what we disagree,&rdquo; and it was only then, apparently, that Dr. Browne was convinced, not by the letters, or by me, or anything else.  That was subsequently, I am informed, confirmed by Most Rev. Dr. Staunton, Bishop of Ferns.</P>
    <P>He now admits he was erroneous in that impression in which he persisted right down until he insisted, practically, on submission of this matter to the Hierarchy for authoritative decision. But, does he say that he was erroneous in respect of his allegation that I had corroborated it?  He repeats it and, on the allegation here to-day, I ask Deputies and the public outside to test the honesty of this case against me and my colleagues and all the other allegations as well.  He admits in this document that he read to-day that he was erroneous in his impression about his interview with His Grace of Dublin and their Lordships of Galway and Ferns, and he goes on to repeat&mdash;I quote from what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the following day the Taoiseach spoke to me of his interview with His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, and he informed me that he had been told by His Grace that he and their Lordships were satisfied following their interview with me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He admits that he was wrong when he said that he had satisfied the Archbishop and the two Bishops, but he still persists that I told him that he had satisfied His Grace of Dublin and the two Bishops.  In other words, he accuses me of deliberate lying, and I am entitled, as I said, to recall the circumstances in which I first heard of this matter and to say that it would not be possible for me to tell him so, unless I was, as I deny, and as I think even Dr. Browne has not accused me of being, deliberately dishonest. At all events, I ask Deputies and the public to test many of the other charges that are made by that one.</P>
    <P>At that interview, the letter of the 10th October, 1950, was read, as Deputy Dr. Browne admitted, by His Grace of Dublin to Dr. Browne, and <Col N="742" /> a discussion ensued.  The following day His Grace read the letter to me and gave me an account of the astounding interview he had with Dr. Browne.  I asked His Grace would he permit me to try to adjust the matter with my colleague and said that I would do the best I could to have matters adjusted between him and the Hierarchy, to see if their point of view might be met.  There I offered myself for the sacrifice, which I am called on to make to-day.  His Grace readily gave me that assignment and that authority.</P>
    <P>The next charge against me is that I kept that letter for a month, and that charge is repeated in one of the Irish newspapers to-day.  I apologise to the Irish people for calling it an Irish newspaper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is repeated there that I kept that letter for one month, apparently for some purpose, the nature of which is not indicated, but presumably for some sinister purpose of my own.  I want to say something now that I am very reluctant to say&mdash; that I had, on a previous occasion, successfully stood between the Minister for Health and some little trouble he had got into of which nobody knew, not even my Cabinet colleagues, and I thought I would be able to render the same service on this occasion.  That was the reason impelling every action I took concerning the subject matter of the allegations which are now made against me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that that letter was read to me on the 12th October; the very same letter, was read to Dr. Browne by the Archbishop in his house in Drumcondra on the 11th October. His Grace then went to Rome and on his return from Rome he called on me in my office in Government Buildings and personally handed me this letter. He carried out the duty imposed on him by the Hierarchy and delivered that letter to me.  That was done on the 7th November.  Dr. Browne admits in his document to-day that he got that letter on the 9th, or about the 9th November.  I believe I gave it to him <Col N="743" /> next day, but whether it was the next day or the day after, not more than two days had elapsed from the time the letter was given to me.  There is then this allegation that I kept the letter for a month.  Again I ask Deputies to test the genuineness of the charges made against me in these matters by these statements.  That is the only way you can test matters, where the recollection of different parties is involved.</P>
    <P>I told Dr. Browne when I saw him that the Archbishop had assured me of one or two things.  He assured me that the deputation from the Irish Hierarchy met him in courtesy and in order that there should be no suggestion that they were dealing harshly with Dr. Browne, going beyond their functions or interfering in the political affairs of the country in any way, and so that this matter could be dealt with quietly and privately to see if an adjustment could be arrived at.  He told me himself that he had dealt as kindly and as gently as he could with Dr. Browne and had brought him into his own private room, before he met the other two members of the Hierarchy, in order to assure him of his kindliness and interest in him, and to assure him that what the Bishops were doing was in his own interest.</P>
    <P>I told Dr. Browne that His Grace of Dublin was actuated by nothing but the kindliest motives.  I then told him also that the Archbishop had told me that the Irish Hierarchy's interest in this question was, in no remotest possible way, as a matter of politics or as a matter of personal opinion, that their sole interest in this question was as a matter of faith and morals.  Nothing else was in question.  They were not interested as citizens.  They were not interested even as priests, though they as priests and bishops were charged with the duty of safeguarding the faith and morals of the Catholic people of this country.  I told Dr. Browne that he could rely on His Grace to do everything to settle the matter quietly, and I then offered him my personal help and support and told him that the Archbishop had given me authority to adjust this matter in any way that was possible.  I asked Dr. Browne would <Col N="744" /> he give me that authority and he said he would and he did give me authority. I believe I told him on that occasion&mdash; although I am obliged to rely on my recollection for this&mdash;I am convinced looking back on it now that my recollection of this matter is right&mdash;that I was not going to answer that letter for the present.  I took the letter away. I believe it was on that occasion or subsequently I gave him a copy of the letter of the Hierarchy to Deputy de Valera of the 7th October, 1947.  I also told him that I thought that some of the points to which objection had been taken could easily be set right.</P>
    <P>As an instance of what could be done, I referred him to Section 21 of the Health Act of 1947.  The final words of the first part of the section&mdash;I have not got it before me but I think I am giving a correct quotation&mdash;are &ldquo;and for their education in that respect&rdquo;. I suggested that he could put a clause into the Health Bill providing for the repeal of those offending words and that that would go some distance along the lines of meeting the objections.  I also asked him to consider whether there was any other fact or matter in the letter to Deputy de Valera which had not been covered by us in the Bill, to get advice and to see that any such matter would be attended to in the amending Bill.  Having told him that their Lordships were only interested in matters of faith and morals and not in other matters, and having asked for authority to stand between him and trouble, I am now accused of having corroborated his statement that there was nothing wrong.  That is utterly and absolutely untrue, fantastically untrue.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputies and decent people outside that at that time and until the time I was obliged to take a firm stand on the Wednesday of Holy Week, the 21st March, I was actuated by nothing but goodwill towards Dr. Browne, that I did everything, to the point of agony, to help him in his difficulties. No picture that I can present to the House, in words or otherwise, could tell what I and my colleagues the Tánaiste, Mr. Dillon and Dr. O'Higgins have gone through to settle this matter.  We are now being accused of dilatoriness, and failure to tell the <Col N="745" /> Hierarchy that Dr. Browne had an answer to their objections.  I am accused of not sending his draft letter to the Hierarchy.  The facts in connection with that are that, as I said, I gave the original letter of the Hierarchy to Dr. Browne.  He took it away and I believe, to the best of my recollection, that on the same occasion he took away also a copy of the letter to Deputy de Valera.  I understood that I then had authority from him to try to adjust this matter as I had adjusted another previous little trouble. Some time afterwards&mdash;I cannot recall the date; as I said, I have not got the habit of keeping memoranda or notes &mdash;he was in my office and he handed me a closed envelope.  It was not sent to me but handed to me personally.</P>
    <P>It was a closed envelope.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is the letter of the Hierarchy.  I am returning it to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thanked him for it and threw it on the table.  When he was gone, I looked at it.  He never said one single word to me to suggest that there was anything else in the envelope.  I assumed that there was nothing in it but the original letter.  He never said a single word that he was giving me a draft, or a suggested draft, or wanted me to do anything about it.  When I opened the envelope, I found inside the document which he now says I should have transmitted to His Lordship the Bishop of Ferns, as his reply, merely as &ldquo;a matter of record&rdquo;.  I saw this letter and glanced through it.  There was no covering letter with it, nor did he ask me to do anything about it.  I assumed, as I think I was entitled to assume, and as I am sure any fair-minded Deputy will agree, that what was done was that some person, advising him, had drafted the suggested reply to the Hierarchy's letter, setting forth various answers to the objections, and incidentally, saying&mdash;using this extraordinary phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I presume that the elimination of the means test could not be a factor which weighed with the Hierarchy in arriving at their opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was dodging the entire issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> I left the letter there.  It was one which, of course, I would not send. This was not a letter from him at all, as suggested by him in his statement to-day, when he used the words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The objections in the letter appear to be those read to me by His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin during my interview on 11th October, and in the light of the later events I concluded that it had been transmitted solely for the purpose of record and formal reply,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and went on to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, therefore, acting on this assumption prepared a draft letter for transmission by the Taoiseach to His Lordship the Bishop of Ferns in reply to the various points raised in their letter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was to be forwarded by me to the Hierarchy, a letter which started &ldquo;My Lord Bishop&rdquo; and ended up &ldquo;I remain, my Lord Bishop, yours sincerely, &mdash;Taoiseach&rdquo;.  I was to transmit this letter on his behalf, according to himself, to the Hierarchy, but it is obvious to anyone looking at it that it was a letter I could not send.  It is clear to me that he or some of his advisers had prepared this as a suggested form of reply to the Hierarchy.</P>
    <P>Now, having as I thought got authority from His Grace the Archbishop to adjust this matter, and having got authority from my colleague, the Minister for Health, to help him to have the matter adjusted and having told him that I was not going to send this letter for some time, to see if we could get an adjustment, I put it aside and locked it up as a private document.  The suggestion now is, as it has been for some time, that Dr. Browne was gravely prejudiced and injured by that letter not being sent, and that that misled him into his subsequent career of launching this controversy and campaign against the medical profession.  From then until the subsequent correspondence started in the letter of the 8th March this year, I never had a single word from him that the letter should be sent.  I believe he knew that every effort I had made from that time until the Wednesday of Holy Week was an endeavour to <Col N="747" /> have this matter adjusted in conformity with the moral law as indicated in the letter from the Hierarchy of the 10th October, 1950.</P>
    <P>Every effort I made was bent in that direction.  He makes the sorry debating point that I had been in constant touch with His Grace the Archbishop and that I had given three different reasons for not sending the letter.  I was in close touch with His Grace the Archbishop, the representative of the Hierarchy, during all that time.  I kept in constant touch with His Grace and gave him an account of the efforts we were making to try and adjust this unfortunate and very disedifying dispute between the Minister for Health and the medical profession. His Grace quite approved and agreed that it was better to try and do everything possible to have the matter adjusted.  Whatever I did say to Dr. Browne and whatever I said in the letter to the Archbishop mean one and the same thing, that I delayed answering this letter with the full knowledge of the Archbishop of Dublin, representing the Irish Hierarchy, and with his concurrence, because I and my colleagues, particularly Mr. Dillon, Dr. O'Higgins, the Tánaiste and myself, were doing everything we could to avoid a disedifying and disreputable clash ensuing between the Minister for Health, because of his obstinacy, and the medical profession.</P>
    <P>As this controversy grew we became still more anxious and more concerned. Finally, the plebiscite of the medical profession had been taken.  They had decided by an overwhelming majority not to work the scheme.  Dr. O'Higgins, who made herculean efforts in this controversy to save his colleague, the Minister for Health, persuaded the medical profession to let him intervene in the dispute, and they agreed.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Higgins then went to the Minister for Health and, with great difficulty, persuaded him to allow him to see the medical profession with a view to seeing if anything could be done to achieve a satisfactory solution of the difficulties.  Fortunately for me, I took the precaution of bringing with me my friend and colleague, the <Col N="748" /> Tánaiste, to that meeting.  His support and help in this controversy, as in every other work that we have been doing over the last three and a half years, has been a source of unending strength to me and to the Government.</P>
    <P>We met the medical profession on the 27th November, 1950.  We had a long interview with them.  May I say in passing that at this time I was under the impression that it was obligatory as a matter of law upon any Government, including my own, to have a free service for mothers and children under Part III of the Act. Before I went to this meeting I took the occasion to read the section as a lawyer, a thing I had not been doing for over three years, and I came to the conclusion that there was no binding obligation on this Government or any other Government to have a free scheme or this free-for-all and no means test under Part III of the Act. I was not my own adviser.  It is a bad thing for any lawyer to act as his own adviser.  I went in to act as an advocate on behalf of the then Minister for Health with the medical profession to see if we could get some scheme.  I put forward his view as an advocate, a view with which I did not agree.  I put it forward as strongly as ever I could and it is quoted against me now.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Health to-day read out a phrase from a letter that was subsequently circulated to the various members of the medical profession giving them an account of the interview with the Tánaiste and me. That interview lasted for three hours. It has been assumed that a free scheme meant what the former Minister for Health has been talking about, the free-for-all and no means test, and that you could not have a free scheme without a means test.  It is quite clear that you could have any number of schemes under Part III of the Act.  You can have a scheme without a means test, and one of the schemes that the Minister belatedly stated after all this hubbub he was prepared to compromise upon&mdash;a contributory scheme.  You could have a contributory scheme which would be a free scheme.  That was one of the things which we were <Col N="749" /> going on to explore.  That was not read out by the former Minister here to-day, nor did he read out what he knew perfectly well, my attitude in regard to the socialisation of medicine which I had stated to him specifically and which I stated to the College of Physicians, that I would not be a member of a Government or take part in any Government that was in favour of or tried in any way to socialise medicine.  I stated that as my firm conviction and unbending principle and the former Minister knew that.  I stated it to the doctors and it is on the face of this document.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Health in his statement to-day said that this document was submitted to me.  I do not know where he got that statement. I am taking up all these small points to test his recollection.  I did not see this document until circumstances arose which I shall explain in a moment.  He said this document was submitted to me for my approval.  I did not know of the document at all until some days after our meeting. The day after this meeting, Deputy Dr. Browne rang me up and repudiated me and the Tanáiste and said that we had acted treacherously towards him. He accused the Tanáiste and me of having sold him to the medical profession and said to me that they had gone cock-a-hoop down the country after the interview stating that the scheme was now dead, that they were satisfied it was dead.  Both the Tanáiste and I told him specifically that that was incorrect and inaccurate. It is the same sort of allegation that has been made against us now that he made then&mdash;that we had given the medical profession to understand that this scheme was at an end, that we were going to kill it and therefore it was at an end.  Naturally, the Tanáiste and I were somewhat put out by this allegation.  Then he said that we were not to continue any longer the negotiations with the medical profession. After three hours with us, these gentlemen of the medical profession had undertaken to explore every possible suggestion to see whether they could find any means or formula which would satisfy the then Minister.  He argued with them and, at the end, they <Col N="750" /> expressed a very genuine desire to end the controversy.</P>
    <P>I want to say here, and I shall repeat it before I sit down, that the medical profession have been maligned and slandered and libelled in every disreputable way throughout the entire period of this controversy and people outside have got the impression from propaganda that the medical profession have been standing between the people and this scheme.  Every time there was any suggestion of an attempt to meet the then Minister for Health, to forget the past and the controversies, the people who said they were willing to come in and consult were the medical profession, and they were turned down every time with contumely by the then Minister.  They acted the part which you would expect a noble profession to act in regard to this matter and the only thanks they have got is vilification. I feel it is my duty in this House to pay tribute to these men who have done everything they could to see that a mother-and-child scheme, a sane and legitimate scheme, to use the words used so properly in the bishop's letter, was brought about.  I stated my conviction and faith and that I would not belong to any Government for one moment that was in favour of the socialisation of medicine.  That was my conviction then and the former Minister for Health knew it, and it is my conviction now.  I stated that and it appeared in the document.  It was also stated&mdash;this was not referred to by the former Minister and I shall quote from the letter:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The deputation pointed out that the association might favour a voluntary contributory scheme to overcome the difficulty and this suggestion seemed to interest Mr. Norton, who thought that the matter should be further explored.  In this event he will be glad to provide any information at the disposal of his Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the very point made at that time in November last, the very point which the Minister stated in public he was now prepared to accept.  That was turned down and we were accused of having been guilty of treachery and our authority to deal with the medical profession <Col N="751" /> was withdrawn.  We had arranged to see them the next week. They stated that they would see us at any time, any hour, any place, but we were repudiated and told not to go on with it.</P>
    <P>Having heard this to my astonishment, I told Deputy Dr. O'Higgins to contact the medical profession.  They were more astonished than I was and produced this document&mdash;that is how I got it&mdash;to justify the action I had taken and the way I had pleaded the case for the then Minister for Health before these people.  It was never submitted to me.  I got this document from Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and on his face it justifies me in every respect.  Notwithstanding that, the then Minister for Health refused to allow the Tánaiste or me to conduct any further negotiations.  I ask any fair-minded and honest Deputies, and the people outside, to judge the allegations made against the Tánaiste and myself and my other colleagues on that.  The former Minister accused us of treachery and it was not until I was able to produce the document to him that confounded him and refuted the allegation he made against us that he rather reluctantly withdrew the allegation that he had made against me and the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>In spite of that, the Tánaiste continued to make efforts and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins made herculean efforts to settle the matter.  I pass on to the 5th March.  Perhaps I might say in passing &mdash;I think it appears in the correspondence&mdash;that the Standing Committee of the Hierarchy met in January.  I saw the Archbishop and told him what had happened to our efforts to settle the matter, our desire to try to find some way out of this and the suggestions that had been put forward again and again by the medical profession in an effort to settle the dispute.  They had put forward several suggestions, a contributory scheme, a Grant-in-Aid scheme, any number of schemes.  They were all turned down by the then Minister. The Archbishop kindly undertook to convey to the Standing Committee of the Hierarchy the reason why the letter was still unanswered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> I want to say this and it will be corroborated by one of my colleagues.  I do not think I mentioned the question of the reply to the then Minister for Health during all that period, because I was convinced that I told him I was not going to reply.  I did say to him in recent months: &ldquo;I have not yet replied to the Bishop's letter.&rdquo;  In my recollection I said it to him twice, but he never said a word to me.  He never suggested the horror that he subsequently suggested.  I said to him: &ldquo;Remember, I have not yet replied to that letter&rdquo; on at least two occasions since last January.  There is not a word about that.  I do not recollect saying it to him between November and Christmas, but I certainly know that on two occasions since Christmas I made use of the expression: &ldquo;I have not yet replied to that letter to the Archbishop.&rdquo;  I am glad to say that that and other matters are corroborated by my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs.  After this interview between the Tánaiste and myself with the medical profession, the Minister for External Affairs spoke to his colleague, the Minister for Health, on this entire matter and repeated to him the necessity for satisfying the objections of the Hierarchy.  I told my colleague, Mr. MacBride, Minister for External Affairs, what the situation was and I kept him fully informed as to how matters were progressing.</P>
    <P>He will tell the House and, through the House, the public, of the interview he had with Deputy Dr. Browne before Christmas, just a few days subsequent to the interview we had with the medical profession; in that interview he pointed out the necessity for Deputy Dr. Browne meeting the objections of the Hierarchy.  Deputy Dr. Browne never said to his colleague on that occasion: &ldquo;I have sent the Taoiseach a draft reply.&rdquo;  Neither did he say: &ldquo;I have answered all the objections;&rdquo; neither did he ask: &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;  He reminded him of the Hierarchy's objections at the interview on 11th October and pressed him to take steps to meet those objections.</P>
    <P>The next item of substance to which I must refer is one raised by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne, in his indictment to-day.  On 8th March, 1951, my private secretary <Col N="753" /> received from his private secretary two copies of a brochure relating to the mother and child scheme: &ldquo;<i>Mother and child&mdash;What the new service means to every family&rdquo;</i> is the title.  The letter is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dr. Browne, Minister for Health, has asked me to enclose for the Taoiseach's information a copy of <i>Mother and Child</i> booklet explaining the principles of the mother and child service which he is about to introduce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That brochure was never sent to us as a Cabinet.  That was the way in which we got that document&mdash;the alleged scheme, a booklet which the then Minister for Health &ldquo; is about to introduce&rdquo;.  I should add that a copy of that booklet was sent by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne, to every Archbishop and Bishop in Ireland, including His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin. Somewhere about that time&mdash;I think it was the 8th March&mdash;an advertisement of a lurid character appeared in the newspapers.  The Archbishop of Dublin then wrote a letter on the 8th March, 1951, to which reference has been made and which was published by the ex-Minister in to-day's newspapers. I received a letter from His Grace forwarding me a copy of the letter that he had sent to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne.  That letter has so far not been published.  I have refrained up to this from reading in detail or at length the correspondence which has appeared in the newspapers.  I must, however, read this letter now because it has not been published.  It is dated 8th March, 1951, from Archbishop's House, Dublin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My dear Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I have been surprised to read in the daily Press of the sudden determination of the Minister for Health to implement the mother and child health service, in the manner in which he conceives the service.</P>
    <P>To-day, I have received a letter from the Minister for Health, enclosing a pamphlet which purports &lsquo;to explain the principles of the mother and child service which the Minister is about to introduce&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> I beg to enclose a copy of the letter which I at once feel it my duty to send to the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I am happy to take this occasion of expressing again to you, on behalf of the Hierarchy and on my own behalf, my grateful appreciation of the immediate understanding and co-operation I have on every occasion received from you, as Taoiseach, in all that concerns the provision of a sane and legitimate mother and child health service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to pause here and say that, throughout this entire transaction from the 11th October, 1950, until the last letter from the Hierarchy, the Archbishop insisted, in every interview he had with Deputy Dr. Browne and in every letter that was written, that he dealt with me as head of the Government and that it was only with the head of the Government the Hierarchy would deal and it was, in fact, as a matter of courtesy and kindness that the Archbishop of Dublin saw the Minister for Health on several occasions. I think I should read the letter, of which I got a copy, which the Archbishop sent to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>I beg to thank you for your letter of the 6th instant received by me to-day, enclosing a pamphlet which purports to explain the proposed mother and child health service.</P>
    <P>I welcome any legitimate improvement of medical services for those whose basic family wage or income does not readily assure the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>And, if proof be needed of my attitude, I may be permitted to point to many actions of my Episcopate, in particular to the work of the Catholic Social Service Conference founded by me, more especially to its maternity welfare centres.</P>
    <P>I regret, however, that, as I stated on the occasion when, on behalf of the Hierarchy, I asked you to meet me with Their Lordships of Ferns and Galway, I may not approve of the mother and child health service, as it is proposed by you to implement the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> Now, as Archbishop of Dublin, I regret that I must reiterate each and every objection made by me on that occasion and unresolved, either then or later, by the Minister for Health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pause there and I ask Deputies to remember that on this occasion the former Minister for Health alleges that he had satisfied the Hierarchy and that I had corroborated that he had satisfied the Hierarchy.  That letter states on the face of it the plain fact that no such satisfaction had been given.  The letter goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Inasmuch as I was authorised to deal with the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Hierarchy, I have felt it my duty to send to the Taoiseach to-day, for his information, a copy of this letter.</P>
    <P>I shall report to the Hierarchy, at its general meeting, the receipt to-day of your letter, with enclosed pamphlet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, if the case made by the then Minister for Health, now Deputy Dr. Browne, was correct, and if his allegations against me and my colleagues had the slightest foundation and truth, would he not at once have written to His Grace and said: &ldquo;This is an astounding letter, since I was satisfied that I had satisfied Your Grace and Their Lordships at my interview with you on 11th October.  What is the meaning of your now saying that you cannot approve of the mother and child health service and that you must reiterate each and every objection made by you on the occasion of my interview and, either then or later, unresolved by me as Minister for Health?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would you not think he would sit down at once and write to me, or that he would ring me up, and ask me: &ldquo;What is the meaning of this letter? Did you not send that letter that I asked you to send?  Did you not forward that draft I asked you to forward, as a matter of record&rdquo;&mdash;as he says now&mdash;&ldquo;and what is the meaning of all this?  I have satisfied Their Lordships and did I not merely get you, as a matter of record, to send on that document?&rdquo; Would you not expect him to sit down and do that, and when <Col N="756" /> that was not done, does it not show the falsity of the case made against me and my colleagues now in this document read out to-day by Deputy Dr. Browne?</P>
    <P>That letter was not acknowledged. There was no acknowledgment from that day to this of that letter of the 8th March, 1951.  When I got it I decided to let a few days elapse, in order to see would the Minister reply to it.  He did not communicate with me in any way about that letter. From that day to this he never said a word to me about that letter, except in the subsequent correspondence that took place afterwards.  He did not ring me up.  He had not even the courtesy to acknowledge that letter to His Grace the Archbishop.  If it were merely even as a matter of courtesy, he should have done that, but it was a matter of vital import for him and of fundamental importance in the case he is making to-day, and it shows the falsity of it.  He now alleges that it was my duty to send on the draft letter that he had prepared last November, that I and my colleagues misled him into an expensive advertising campaign and into this controversy with his colleagues in the medical profession. Would he not have rushed at once to me on the telephone and accused me of failure in my duty and rushed to the Archbishop or at least sent a letter to him?  He did neither.</P>
    <P>The matter does not end there.  I let the matter lie for a few days.  I showed the letter to my colleagues and discussed it with them, and on Monday, the 12th March, I think it was, as far as my recollection goes, my colleague, the Tánaiste, approached Deputy Dr. Browne and asked what he was doing about the letter from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin.  &ldquo;I am going to do nothing about it&rdquo; was the reply. The Tánaiste asked: &ldquo;Are you not going to acknowledge its receipt?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not going to do anything about that letter; there is nothing in it; it does not require an answer; the whole thing is all nonsense; there is nothing in the Archbishop's allegation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said he was not going to answer it. The Tánaiste reported this to me.  It <Col N="757" /> gave me rather some food for thought. At all events, I wrote, as you would have expected Deputy Dr. Browne to have written, a letter acknowledging the letter I had got.  On the 9th March, the day after I received the letter, I wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My dear Lord Archbishop:</P>
    <P>I am in receipt of Your Grace's letter of yesterday's date enclosing me a copy of a letter addressed by you to the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for Your Grace's courtesy in sending me a copy of that letter and deeply appreciate your kind words in my respect.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that Your Grace's views will receive respectful and earnest consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was on Thursday, the 8th March, that the letter was addressed by the Archbishop to the Minister.  I let the matter lie for a while again after the Tánaiste spoke to the Minister, to see what he was going to do about answering the letter, but nothing happened.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, the 14th March, I went down to Connemara to the late Deputy Mongan's funeral.  I returned at 5 o'clock in the afternoon from Carna, to find the Minister for Health looking for me.  I interviewed him in my room.  He wanted £30,000.  You have seen the letter in the newspapers to-day from the Minister for Finance in reference to the application he had made to the Minister for this £30,000. The Minister for Finance had stated that this was a matter of fundamental principle and should come before the Cabinet in the ordinary way.  The Minister for Health came to me to ask for a Cabinet meeting that night to get the £30,000.  I said it was an extraordinary proceeding and asked: &ldquo;What do you want it for?&rdquo;  He replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If I get the £30,000 I will have the doctors killed on Sunday; I will finish the controversy on Sunday; it will be finished for all time, if I get the £30,000; the private medical practitioners are meeting on Sunday and I believe that if I get the £30,000 the controversy will be at an end. The doctors will be killed and beaten <Col N="758" /> but if I do not get the money now there will be trouble from the doctors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said: &ldquo;What about the Bishops, what about the Archbishop's letter?&rdquo;&ldquo;There is nothing in that,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;there is nothing in those letters; I am assured on the advice of theologians that there is nothing in that letter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I took my stand, the stand that I am now accused of having taken all the time&mdash;and of having taken surreptitiously. I said that I thought all this trouble with the doctors was coming to a disreputable head.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever about fighting the doctors, I am not going to fight the Bishops and whatever about fighting the Bishops, I am not going to fight the doctors and the Bishops.  It may come to a point where either you or I will leave the Cabinet on this, unless we can settle the matter with the Bishops.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He asked for a Cabinet meeting.  I said that it would be preferable not to take a decision on a fundamental matter of that kind in the absence of his Leader, who was then in New York or elsewhere in America, but I promised that I would consult my colleagues that night to see if I could get a meeting the next morning.  He rang at 10 o'clock that night on the telephone and spoke about the matter and I told him that before he did anything further in this controversy, he would have to clear up the matter of the Hierarchy's objections. I had not the telephone left down out of my hand when the newspaper reporters were able to report that the conversation had taken place between me and the Minister for Health and what it was about.  Behind all this correspondence and controversy, there is someone of sinister and evil influence who informed the journalists of the conversation that had taken place between me and the Minister for Health and who, apparently, had been in that room with him.  On the following day, the 15th March, I wrote the letter that has started this correspondence which has appeared in the newspapers, at the instance of the <Col N="759" /> Minister for Health.  I feel I must read that letter, which was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I indicated to you yesterday afternoon, I am gravely concerned at the contents of the letter, dated 8th March, which His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin wrote to you upon your sending His Grace a pamphlet on the proposed mother and child health service.</P>
    <P>In that letter His Grace said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;I regret, however, that, as I stated on the occasion when, on behalf of the Hierarchy, I asked you to meet me with their Lordships of Ferns and Galway, I may not approve of the mother and child health service, as it is proposed by you to implement the scheme.</P>
    <P>Now, as Archbishop of Dublin, I regret that I must reiterate each and every objection made by me on that occasion and unresolved, either then or later, by the Minister for Health.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>In reply to the letter which His Grace wrote to me when forwarding me a copy of his letter to you, I stated that His Grace's views would receive respectful and earnest consideration.</P>
    <P>I understand that you have not replied to His Grace's letter.  I am afraid you do not appear to realise the serious implications of the views expressed in that letter since you have by advertisement and otherwise continued to publicise the scheme to which objections have been taken. Such action might well seem to be defiance of the Hierarchy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At this stage I should recall a fact which I have overlooked.  I have mentioned the letter of the 8th March from the Archbishop to the Minister&mdash; the copy which the Archbishop sent me was delivered to me by hand on that date&mdash;which the Minister did not acknowledge from that day to this; instead of acknowledging that letter, instead of going to the Archbishop and asking what it was about, the Minister went on the radio that night and explained the mother and child scheme, reiterating all the various essential ingredients of that scheme to <Col N="760" /> which the Hierarchy objected and which objection had been that very day repeated by His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin in his letter.  Over the air he, in effect defied the Archbishop.</P>
    <P>My letter went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should also like to recall to you the letter, dated 10th October, 1950, which His Lordship the Bishop of Ferns addressed to me on behalf of the Hierarchy, setting forth in detail objections to the mother and child health service as proposed by you.  As you have been aware, I have so far refrained from replying to that letter.  I have postponed sending a formal reply in the hope that you would have been able to achieve a satisfactory adjustment of the matters in controversy.  Your letter forwarding a copy of your scheme to the Archbishop of Dublin and His Grace's reply thereto intimating his intention of reporting on the matter to the Hierarchy, have, however, now made it difficult for me further to postpone replying to the letter from the Bishop of Ferns.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that all my colleagues and, in particular, yourself, would not be party to any proposals affecting moral questions which would or might come into conflict with the definite teaching of the Catholic Church.  Having regard to the views expressed in the letters received from the Hierarchy, I feel that you should take steps at once to consult Their Lordships so as to remove any grounds for objection on their part to the mother and child health service and to find a mutually satisfactory solution of the difficulties which have arisen.</P>
    <P>I can assure you that immediate steps will be taken to dispose of any financial matters which may be outstanding in regard to the proposed service on the understanding that the objections raised by the Hierarchy have been resolved.  Indeed, I may say that to my mind the financial questions which may remain outstanding are altogether insignificant and susceptible of speedy solution once the larger issues raised in the correspondence from members of the Hierarchy are settled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> I need hardly add that the Government are strongly in favour of a mother and child service, and are anxious that it should be made operative as soon as possible, and trust that your further negotiations will enable this desirable object to be achieved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I received a letter from Dr. Browne dated the 19th March which started in a most extraordinary way.  The first part of the letter is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Am I correct in thinking from the terms of your letter of March 15th that you are under the impression that the Hierarchy are opposed to the mother and child health protection scheme?  May I point out that this impression, if held by you, is certainly not borne out by the following facts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Was I under the impression that the Hierarchy was opposed to the scheme?&rdquo; The letter of the 10th October, 1950, was still there and the letter of the 8th March had just arrived a few days before.  Then he goes on to make the allegations which he now admits to be false, that he had satisfied His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin and Their Lordships the Bishops of Ferns and Galway and that I had corroborated it. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the receipt of your letter I have been in communication with a member of the Hierarchy, who further assures me that, so far as he is aware, the Hierarchy as such have expressed no objection to the mother and child scheme whatsoever on the grounds of faith and morals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When a letter was written on behalf of the Archbishops and Bishops of Ireland, and the Archbishop of Dublin and the Bishops of Ferns and Galway interviewed the Minister saying that they had objections and when the letter of the 8th March, 1951, was still unanswered, anyone who could put that statement on record is, in my submission to this House and to the country, not worthy of credence.  Then he goes on to ask me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would be interested to know whether your withholding of approval to the mother and child scheme is due either to the supposed opposition <Col N="762" /> of the Hierarchy to the scheme or to the possible opposition of any individual member of the Hierarchy.  I would be glad if you would treat this matter as extremely urgent, in view of the fact that I must complete, as you yourself have suggested, my further investigations of these misapprehensions with the minimum of delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Supposed opposition of the Hierarchy,&rdquo; in the teeth of the documents and the facts that I have recited here!  Again, it is my submission that anyone who would put that on record is not worthy of credence.  There is the somewhat subtle reference to an &ldquo;individual member of the Hierarchy&rdquo;, rather suggesting, I think, that the objection to the scheme came from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin rather than from the Hierarchy as a whole.  I wrote back a letter dated the 21st March, 1951, in which I drew the Minister's attention to the letters that were there and which were written condemnations of this submission he was making.  I want to read some of the paragraphs.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I have already indicated, I am at a loss to understand how you could feel satisfied that you had, at your interview on the 11th October last, with His Grace the Archbishop and Their Lordships of Galway and Ferns, satisfactorily disposed of their objections.  I certainly never stated to you, as you suggest, that I was in a position to corroborate His Grace's and Their Lordships' satisfaction with the explanation which you gave in connection with their objections to the scheme.  In view of what I had been told by His Grace at my interview with him, I certainly could have given you no such assurance. Out of consideration for you and in an earnest desire to help you in the difficulties which the Hierarchy see in your scheme, I offered my personal help to you as intermediary with the Hierarchy to try to smooth those difficulties and resolve their objections, which I felt could be done by appropriate amendments of the scheme and amending legislation if necessary.  To illustrate how it might be possible to meet some of the objections I suggested that you <Col N="763" /> might introduce into the Health Bill, 1950, then before the Dáil, an amendment of Section 21 of the Health Act, 1947, by deleting from the section the words &lsquo;and for their education in respect thereof&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>That you are seriously in error in thinking that you had satisfied His Grace and Their Lordships at your interview is amply borne out by the letter of the 8th March last to you from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin when he specifically stated, in the passages quoted in my recent letter to you, that on the occasion of your interview he stated that he could not approve of the scheme.  In that letter His Grace, as Archbishop of Dublin, reiterated each and every objection made on the occasion of the interview with you and which he said were &lsquo;unresolved either then or later&rsquo; by you.</P>
    <P>My withholding of approval of the scheme is due to the objections set forth in the letter to me from the secretary to the Hierarchy, written on behalf of the Hierarchy, and to the reiteration of their objections by His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, as Archbishop of Dublin.</P>
    <P>My letter to you of the 15th instant was a request to you to have those objections resolved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that on that very day, that is, the 21st March, there was handed to me a copy of a letter issued on the instructions of Dr. Browne to the general secretary of the Irish Medical Association, copies of which had been sent by him to the Government Information Bureau, for release to the Press.  I stopped the publication of that letter because it referred to his scheme as Government policy It was of a kind that I entirely disapproved.  I then wrote Dr. Browne a letter and had it transmitted that very evening:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your letter addressed to-day to the Irish Medical Association has been brought to my notice by the information bureau.  I have directed them not to issue it.</P>
    <P>In the course of your letter you <Col N="764" /> stated that it was proposed to proceed with the introduction of your mother and child scheme as already outlined by you, describing it as Government policy.</P>
    <P>I have already informed you in recent correspondence, and particularly in my letter to you of to-day's date, that your scheme in the form outlined by you was not acceptable to the Government unless and until the express reservations made by the Hierarchy in their letter of the 10th October last from the secretary to the Hierarchy and by the Archbishop of Dublin in his letter of the 8th March to you are satisfactorily disposed of.  Accordingly, you are not entitled to describe your scheme as Government policy and you must not so describe it hereafter unless and until you have satisfied the Hierarchy that in respect of the matters relating to faith and morals your scheme is unobjectionable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I got a letter dated the same day from Deputy Dr. Browne and, for the first time, although there had been correspondence on this matter of the kind I have referred to, he expressed horror that I had not transmitted the draft letter that he had sent me last November.  I had been pressing him to clear up this matter with the Hierarchy.  Now, for the first time, when I stopped the publication of his letter to the Irish Medical Association, he makes the case that he was horrified to discover that I had not sent his letter to the Hierarchy.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was horrified to learn for the first time only a few days ago that you had, in fact, never sent it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I myself had already stated before to him:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Remember, I have not yet answered the letter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My colleague, Mr. MacBride, the Minister for External Affairs, will bear out that he had spoken to Deputy Dr. Browne several times.  He never referred to this fact until then, until the time I stopped the publication of his rather scandalous letter to the Medical Association.  On the following day I replied to Deputy Dr. Browne:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" />&ldquo;I have your reply of the 21st March, 1951, to my letter of the same date.  I did not, in that letter, address myself to the reasons which you had advanced in support of your suggestion that the Hierarchy are not opposed to the mother and child scheme as outlined by you.  I did not do so because it is for the Hierarchy alone to say whether or no the scheme contained anything contrary to Catholic moral teaching. It is clear from the letter which His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin addressed to you on the 8th March, 1951, that the objections put forward on the occasion of your interview with him and with Their Lordships of Ferns and Galway on the 11th October last were &lsquo;unresolved either then or later&rsquo;.  It is clear from the same letter, that His Grace sent me a copy of it inasmuch as he was authorised to deal with me &lsquo;on behalf of the Hierarchy&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>My actions in regard to this matter since I received the letter from His Lordship the Bishop of Ferns on the 10th October last have been entirely actuated by what I conceived to be a friendly desire to help a colleague and I take it somewhat amiss to find misconstrued my endeavours to have the objections to the scheme which had been advanced on behalf of the Hierarchy satisfactorily resolved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no necessity to repeat the rest of it.</P>
    <P>On 22nd March, Holy Thursday, Dr. Browne went to see the Archbishop of Dublin.  He did not make any complaint to the Archbishop of his horror at my failure to reply to the letter of 10th October and he never mentioned it at the interview.  He went there and said he wished to have an authoritative decision.  I believe he went there following a conversation he had with my colleague, Mr. Norton.  At all events, after the interview, he telephoned to me.  This, as I say, was on Holy Thursday.  The Archbishop of Dublin had been up at 4.30 a.m. that day, and, while consecrating the Holy Oils, he received a message from the Minister for Health that he wanted <Col N="766" /> to see him immediately.  In view of the underlying suggestions running through the Minister's indictments and letters about His Grace the Archbishop, I want again to put this in as further evidence of the extraordinary kindness and consideration of His Grace towards Dr. Browne.</P>
    <P>He saw him that day, which is the busiest day in the year for a Bishop, and Dr. Browne rang me and told me he had been with His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin.  He said he had agreed with His Grace that the matters arising out of the mother and child scheme should be adjudicated upon by the Hierarchy; that his case should be transmitted by me as head of the Government to Dr. Staunton; and that the question should then be decided as a matter of faith and morals by the Hierarchy.  He said he would have no alternative but to accept the decision and he gave an undertaking to His Grace to that effect.  He said he had requested His Grace to endeavour to have the matter put on the agenda for the meeting of the Hierarchy in Low Week, so as to have an early decision, in view of the importance of the matter to him, as it might mean his leaving the Cabinet.  He said that he would instruct his officials to get on with the preparation of his case as quickly as possible.  I agreed to the course suggested and stated that I would write immediately to Dr. Staunton, on receiving his document and forward it with my letter.  I took the precaution of making a note of the telephone conversation with Dr. Browne, in view of the suggestion he had made previously &mdash;and I very seldom adopt that course.</P>
    <P>His Grace the Archbishop asked me to come to see him and told me of the interview.  I am at liberty to say that now, and I am at liberty to say what took place and the account he gave me.</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne arrived at the Archbishop's residence and made the case that he had already satisfied Their Lordships.  Dr. McQuaid went through the details of the interview of 11th October, 1950, which seemed to shock the then Minister, who had no recollection, good, bad or indifferent, of those details.  He was then persuaded that <Col N="767" /> his recollection was utterly and absolutely inaccurate and unreliable. He now accepts that position.  He subsequently went to Dr. Staunton, Bishop of Ferns, who gave him the same account.  The man who made that case right up to that time asks that his recollection should be put against mine and against the documents.</P>
    <P>At all events, he prepared a case, a long document of eight typewritten pages, and I propose now to refer to an aspect of the matter that is vital in the setting in which we have to consider it, in view of the effect of the publication of this correspondence&mdash; and I take a very grave view of Dr. Browne's putting these private letters into the public Press as he did to-day &mdash;and in view of the suggestions that will be made and have been made or hinted at as to the Hierarchy trespassing upon the civil authority and going beyond their sphere.  All this up to this had been private.  There was not a word outside, and even some of my colleagues did not know the full details at this stage; I kept it from them in order that there should be as little publicity as possible, in the hope and belief that there would be a settlement of this unfortunate and disreputable affair.</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne asked for a decision. He requested an authoritative decision from the entire Hierarchy.  He first put to His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin the question: &ldquo;What is Your Grace's view?  Is this mother and child scheme contrary to Catholic social teaching?&rdquo;  And His Grace said to him: &ldquo;Most definitely, yes, in my opinion.&rdquo;  Dr. Browne then said: &ldquo;That is an end of it.  If that is so, it is a very serious matter for me, as it will involve my leaving the Cabinet.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;As it is so important, I would like and ask Your Grace to get a decision from the entire Hierarchy.&rdquo; There he asks for a decision.  Up to this, the Hierarchy had expressed their views in a private way to the Government. It should never have come out and need never have come out, but now Dr. Browne asks for a decision.</P>
    <P>At the very end of his memorandum, <Col N="768" /> which I submitted to the Hierarchy at his request, this phrase occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; ...the Minister respectfully asks whether the Hierarchy considers that the mother and child scheme is contrary to Catholic moral teaching.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the query put up to the Hierarchy at his request.  The decision is to be given authoritatively.  He asks for a decision, for an immediate decision, and he undertook to the Archbishop of Dublin to abide by the decision.  He repeated these matters to me and he asked the Archbishop that the matter should be determined, in view of its importance, at the forthcoming meeting in a few days of the Irish Hierarchy at Maynooth in Low Week.  It was quite an unprecendented thing for such a request to be made. The Archbishop of Dublin told him that it was difficult to get that done, that it would not ordinarily be possible to get it on the agenda except on a fortnight's notice, but that he would try.  Again, in view of the innuendoes and suggestions made against His Grace, I want the public to know this, that an immediate decision of the Hierarchy was pressed for at the urgent request and insistence of the then Minister for Health, who was always in a hurry, except&mdash;may I remark in passing, tying it up with a remark I made earlier&mdash; when it comes to pressing forward an amendment of the sections of the Health Act which are contrary to the Constitution and which he did not press at all.  The Archbishop went to Wexford&mdash;travelled down to Wexford himself&mdash;with these documents, in order to ensure that they would be put on the agenda, at the urgent request and insistence of the then Minister.</P>
    <P>That was done, and in the meantime Deputy Dr. Browne went around the country, as he said, interviewing Bishops and theologians.  Afterwards he rang me up and said that everything was grand and there was nothing wrong with the scheme.  So that the record may be kept right, I will read the letter I sent, with Dr. Browne's memorandum, to Dr. Staunton on 27th March:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beg to enclose a memorandum of observations of the Minister for Health on various matters relating <Col N="769" /> to the mother and child scheme referred to in a letter dated the 10th October, 1950, addressed to me by Your Lordship as secretary to the Hierarchy.</P>
    <P>May I be allowed to state that since the receipt by me from His Grace of Dublin of Their Lordships' letter my colleagues and I have given anxious consideration to the objections made by the Hierarchy to the scheme advocated by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>His Grace of Dublin has on many occasions seen me in the interval and kindly agreed to inform the Standing Committee that the Government would readily and immediately acquiesce in a decision of the Hierarchy concerning faith and morals.</P>
    <P>If I have not answered earlier and in detail the letter of the Hierarchy, I trust that it will be understood that both His Grace of Dublin and I believed it to be much more advantageous in the special circumstances of the case to await developments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I pause there in the quotation of this letter to refer to the allegation made by Deputy Dr. Browne that this is some different explanation&mdash;that I have given three different explanations &mdash;for not answering earlier the letter of the Hierarchy?  Does any fairminded person believe that?  It is plain that I was doing my best.  It is plain that the Tánaiste, Dr. O'Higgins, Mr. Dillon and&mdash;in particular&mdash; Mr. MacBride, were doing their level best to find some adjustment of the matter at issue.  Dr. Browne has had the start of a whole day to make his allegations, and no matter what I do I shall never catch up with him to the end of my public life, and certainly not in respect of that newspaper to which I have already referred.  I now continue to quote the letter which I sent to the Most Rev. Dr. Staunton on the 27th March:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Within recent weeks the publication by the Minister for Health of a brochure explaining his scheme called forth from His Grace of Dublin an immediate reply in which His Grace reiterated each and every <Col N="770" /> objection already made by him to the scheme.</P>
    <P>After an interview with His Grace in which the Minister had been again warned of His Grace's objections and had himself asked for an early decision of the Hierarchy the Minister for Health forwarded to me the enclosed memorandum.</P>
    <P>His Grace of Dublin has kept me accurately informed of these latter circumstances and has kindly agreed to request Your Lordship as the Most Reverend Secretary to include the Minister's observations on the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the Hierarchy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sent a copy of that letter to Dr. Browne on the 28th March.  Would one not think that I would have done the same thing&mdash;that is, sent him a copy of it&mdash;if I had, in fact, transmitted the letter, the draft of which he sent me in November, and by not transmitting which he now accuses me of having caused him embarrassment? I got a letter dated the 29th March from Rev. Dr. Staunton acknowledging receipt of these documents.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, and of the memorandum of the Minister for Health on various matters in relation to the mother and child scheme, which I shall bring before the Standing Committee and the general meeting of the Bishops in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Bishops will appreciate very deeply the kind and thoughtful consideration which Your Excellency has given to their views on this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice in that letter that the memorandum is to be brought before the Standing Committee and the general meeting of the Bishops&mdash; because suggestions were made verbally that the letter of the 10th October, 1950, never came before the Bishops at all; that only a few select busybody Bishops were interfering with this matter.</P>
    <P>On the 5th April the Archbishop of Dublin waited on me very formally at <Col N="771" /> Government Buildings and handed me the result of the deliberations.  He told me that he, during his period of ten years as Archbishop, had never seen such detailed and close and long consideration given to any document as was given to the submission by Dr. Browne.  I may be permitted to point out that the memorandum which Dr. Browne submitted was practically a copy, with some additions, of the memorandum which he had sent to me on the first occasion; in it he repeated again the sentence that I think I have already read as an extract from that draft which he sent to me when he returned the original letter of the 10th October, 1950, to me&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister presumes that the elimination of the means test could not be a factor which weighed with the Hierarchy in arriving at the opinion quoted above.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All I have said here now demonstrates the infinite capacity of Dr. Browne for self-deception.  In an eight-page detailed document he presumes that the fundamental objection is not an objection at all.  There is no limit to the capacity of Dr. Browne to deceive himself.</P>
    <P>The Archbishop handed me the reply conveying the Hierarchy's decision. It has already been published. I do not want to read it out now but I hope that everybody will read it and ponder on it.  Every word carries its own weight.  There is great economy of language and there is great understatement. There are a few aspects of it, however, to which I wish to direct attention.  The letter transmitting the reply of the Hierarchy, which was handed to me on the 5th April, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At our Standing Committee Meeting on the 3rd instant, and again at our General Meeting yesterday, the 4th instant, in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, long and careful consideration was given by the Hierarchy to the memorandum which you had forwarded in your letter of 27th March from the Minister for Health on his mother and child health scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> I have the honour to transmit to you the reply of the Hierarchy, representing the unanimous decision of the General Meeting of the ArchBishops and Bishops.</P>
    <P>I have been deputed to sign the enclosed reply on behalf of the Hierarchy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made verbally that the Hierarchy as a whole never saw the letter of the 10th October, 1950, at all and that only a few select Bishops were interfering.  So that there could be no shadow of a doubt about that, and that such a suggestion could not be made again, Dr. Staunton, in acknowledging my letter to him enclosing the then Minister's memorandum of submissions, said he would bring it before the Standing Committee and the General Meeting of the Bishops. This letter from the Archbishop of Dublin to me specifically states, so that that sort of nonsense to the effect that the Bishops had never seen it could not be repeated, that the matter was before the Standing Committee Meeting and also the General Meeting of the Bishops of Ireland, that the decision was unanimous, that it was not a few busybody Bishops who were interfering, but that the decision was given as a decision on a matter of Catholic social teaching.  It followed the express request of the then Minister for Health for an authoritative decision&mdash;and he got it&mdash;and he had undertaken to abide by it.  From that day to this, since the evening of the 5th April, when I handed a copy of it to him in this House shortly after I got it and as soon as I could get it typed, I got no assurance from the then Minister for Health, nor from Deputy Dr. Browne since he left the post of Minister for Health, that he proposes to carry out the undertaking given by him to the Archbishop of Dublin when he requested an immediate decision and after an unprecedented act by the Hierarchy of taking this out of its usual course, to serve his convenience, at their meeting in Low Week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne made the point that, because the Bishops, when they gave the seven reasons condemning the scheme, spoke of its being opposed <Col N="773" /> to Catholic social teaching, there was nothing in this decision of the Hierarchy at all and that it was not a decision given on a matter of faith and morals.  I took the precaution of getting an authoritative interpretation of the expression &ldquo;Catholic social teaching&rdquo; and I was informed that it had the same weight as&mdash;if not even greater weight than&mdash;the expression &ldquo;Catholic moral teaching&rdquo;.  The words used by the Archbishop to me were that it was clear-cut&mdash;that it was a clear-cut condemnation of a scheme, which the Bishops detest.  The Bishops were solely interested in principles, not in details.  As far as this particular scheme is concerned, it was clearly condemned on the grounds of the Catholic moral law, Catholic social teaching, Catholic teaching as applied to society and not restricted to sexual morality or even to the laws as applied to the individual.</P>
    <P>I want to point out another thing in this letter which is of vital importance. The reasons for the Bishops objecting to the scheme are given: &ldquo;Firstly, secondly, thirdly, fourthly, fifthly, sixthly, seventhly&rdquo; and each is prefaced by the words &ldquo;in this particular scheme&rdquo;.  We have &ldquo;Firstly: In this particular scheme;&rdquo;&ldquo;Secondly and thirdly: In this particular scheme;&rdquo;&ldquo;Fourthly: To implement this particular scheme;&rdquo;&ldquo;Fifthly: In implementing this particular scheme;&rdquo;&ldquo;Sixthly and seventhly: This particular scheme.&rdquo;  This scheme and this scheme only is condemned, and there are any number of schemes that would come, and that could come, within the general scope of Catholic social teaching.  It is only this particular scheme that has been pronounced against&mdash;this scheme which has caused so much agony and controversy, as well as the public scandal caused by the former Minister in releasing these private letters for publication in the Press this morning.</P>
    <P>From the letter written to Deputy de Valera on the 13th October 1947, to the last letter, from which I will read in a few moments to the House, the Bishops emphasise their desire, intention and wish for a sane and legitimate mother and child scheme <Col N="774" /> and that is also stated in this final letter to me.  I want to quote these paragraphs for the House and for the people outside so that they may be pondered and considered and that all those vile suggestions that will be made from various quarters against the Hierarchy will be put in their true perspective and judged for what they are worth.  The Bishops' letter reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Archbishops and Bishops desire to express once again approval of a sane and legitimate health service which will properly safeguard the health of mothers and children.</P>
    <P>The Hierarchy cannot approve of any scheme which, in its general tendency, must foster undue control by the State in a sphere so delicate and so intimately concerned with morals as that which deals with gynaecology or obstetrics and with the relation between doctor and patient.</P>
    <P>Neither can the Bishops approve of any scheme which must have for practical result the undue lessening of the proper initiative of individuals and associations and the undermining of self-reliance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the last paragraph they write:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accordingly, the Hierarchy have firm confidence that it will yet be possible, with reflection and calm consultation, for the Government to provide a scheme which, while it affords due facilities for those whom the State, as guardian of the common good, is rightly called upon to assist, will none the less respect, in its principles and implementation, the traditional life and spirit of our Christian people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In every letter written by the Hierarchy they say that they want a sane and legitimate scheme for our people.  They would welcome such a scheme and want such a scheme but not this particular scheme.  Not only would this scheme not give the people what they require but, by the obstinacy and persistence of the Minister for Health in his catchword&mdash;because behind it there is no properly-thoughtout scheme&mdash;he has put across by propaganda, on the unfortunate people of the country the idea that they will get something for nothing and that every <Col N="775" /> woman who is going to have a child can go to the finest specialist in Dublin and get first-class treatment free of charge, whereas in fact the scheme is based, if it is based on anything, on the dispensary system and making everybody go to the dispensary.  Later the former Minister considered letting in the ordinary medical practitioners but no scheme was thought out behind all this.  The Bishops say that the scheme is wrong according to the moral law. It is apparent from the Government's decision that this Government has always been, and still is, anxious to provide a scheme which is approved by the Hierarchy and that they will, in that spirit and mood&mdash;of which Deputy Dr. Browne is quite incapable&mdash;of reflection and calm consultation, provide a scheme which will give what our people require and still respect Catholic social principles.</P>
    <P>It was on Thursday that the Hierarchy's decision reached me, and on that night Deputy Dr. Browne rang me up to ask me to mention it at the Cabinet next day, but I had myself already put it on the agenda.  Deputy Dr. Browne represents here, elsewhere and in this morning's newspapers that he had given an undertaking to respect any decision of the Hierarchy on faith or morals; he gave that undertaking unasked, voluntarily and on his own. He represented himself as a man who was always ready and willing to do so. I repeat that, from the time I gave that letter to Deputy Dr. Browne on the 5th of this month, except for what appeared in the papers to-day, I never got an assurance, an undertaking  even anything in the nature of an intimation that he would abide by the decision of the Hierarchy, a decision got at his urgent request and on his giving an undertaking that he would abide by the result.  Has he said to His Grace: &ldquo; Because the Hierarchy's decision is against my scheme, either I must resign or reconsider the scheme?&rdquo;  What was the decision of the man who now says in the public Press that he was always willing to carry out his undertaking?  It was to ask for a decision of the Government as to whether we would go on with his scheme or not.  Would anybody think <Col N="776" /> that a man so anxious to carry out his undertaking, who had got the Bishops specially to consider the matter and on whose behalf His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin had travelled from here to Wexford to get the matter put on the agenda would act in this way and perform this political manoeuvre?  He asked for a formal decision:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is the Government prepared to go on with my mother and child scheme?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was Friday afternoon, the day after the letter conveying the decision of the Hierarchy had been given to me by His Grace the Archbishop.  Having got a decision from the 12 of his colleagues that they were not prepared, having regard to the views of the Hierarchy, obtained at his request, to proceed with the scheme, did he, in accordance with his responsibility, in accordance with the undertaking given on his own initiative to the Archbishop set forth in the correspondence I refer to, carry out the Government's decision or the decision of the Hierarchy?  He walked out without having told us what he was going to do, but he asked for time to consider his position.  I informed him that I would readily grant any time he wished for reflection, and I refrained, under very great provocation for several days, from taking the action I felt I should have taken, that is, to ask for his resignation.</P>
    <P>I want to insist that, up to the present, I have got no intimation of any class, kind or description that Deputy Dr. Browne is prepared to follow the decision of the Hierarchy.</P>
    <P>The next thing was that I saw in the newspapers that the then Minister's private secretary had issued, at his instance, a bulletin to the newspapers. Deputy Dr. Browne was entitled and had the right to such reasonable time as he required to consider the difficulties in which he found himself, and he readily got it from myself and from my colleagues.  As I told the House in the earlier part of the observations I had to make, as he left the room we offered him our help, and I personally offered him my help.  He apparently collected some ladies from the Trade Union Congress in the <Col N="777" /> Custom House on Sunday.  At all events, he issued a bulletin to the newspapers stating that he had postponed his decision on his present position at the request of a delegation of the Trade Union Congress.  I do not suppose that in the history of Cabinet Government any such thing has happened as that a Minister who was considering his position, whose colleagues had treated him as we had treated him, proceeded to tell the Press what he was doing at the instance of the Trade Union Congress and did not discuss matters in private with his colleagues. The Minister came out in public.  Another bulletin was issued the next day, a somewhat similar bulletin.  Then his colleague and the leader of his Party decided that it was his duty to request Deputy Dr. Browne to put his resignation in my hands.  I want to say here that if Deputy MacBride had not taken that course, I myself would, under the Constitution, have requested Deputy Dr. Browne to give me his resignation.  It is only right and it is only just to my loyal colleagues that I should make that quite clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs told me he felt that as he had been responsible for introducing Deputy Dr. Browne as a member of the Government and as he felt he had not fulfilled the trust he had reposed in him, it was his duty to ask him to resign.  That was not a matter for me and I felt I ought not either to discuss, argue, persuade or dissuade my colleague in any action he thought fit to take as Leader of his own political Party.  I had formed, in my own view, a clear conclusion&mdash;and I must say this in justice to Deputy MacBride because of the attacks that have been and that may be made upon him&mdash;I had formed in my own mind, having regard to my experience over the last six months and the history of the affairs I have given in the barest outline, the firm conviction that Deputy Dr. Browne was not competent or capable to fulfil the duties of the Department of Health.  He was incapable of negotiation; he was obstinate at times and vacillating at other times.  He was quite incapable of knowing what his decision would be to-day or, if he made <Col N="778" /> a decision to-day, it would remain until to-morrow.</P>
    <P>It has been said he is inexperienced, but I regret my view is that temperamentally he is unfitted for the post of Cabinet Minister.  I say that in public, but I say it in all charity and kindness to a former colleague whose work I appreciate.  I regret very much the circumstances which have led to his resignation.</P>
    <P>The letter Deputy MacBride sent to Deputy Dr. Browne has appeared in the newspapers.  I have no hesitation in saying in public here, pledging whatever reputation I have as a constitutional lawyer, that that action of Deputy MacBride was entirely in accordance with the Constitution and in accordance with democratic procedure. It is my function as Taoiseach to accept the resignations of my colleagues, if such arise: to ask for them if occasion requires.  It is my function to appoint&mdash;where men are nominated in accordance with the Constitution&mdash;those people who shall fulfil ministerial posts.  I see no reason why a member, even of my own Party, who thought one of his colleagues was not doing his duty, should not suggest that he ought to resign.  It would be for that man to exercise his rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have explained the reasons why Deputy MacBride sent that letter.  I did not intervene one way or the other when he sent the letter.  I told Deputy Dr. Browne that he could have all the time he wanted, notwithstanding what I thought was his very wrong action in exposing the position in public&mdash;the fact that there was any difference with his Cabinet colleagues, and issuing bulletins to the Press.  I still left him time and I did not intervene.  If Deputy MacBride decided on his own course of action as the Leader of the Party, that was a matter entirely for him.</P>
      <P>I received from Deputy Dr. Browne this letter yesterday afternoon:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Taoiseach,</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dear Dr. Browne,</P>
      <P>I have received your letter placing in my hands your resignation from office as a member of the Government, with effect from to-morrow, the 12th instant.  In pursuance of the relevant provisions of the Constitution, I have advised the President to accept your resignation, and he has accepted it accordingly.</P>
      <P>I myself and the other members of the Government who have been your colleagues during the past three years appreciate the work which you have done in the Department of Health, and regret that circumstances should have arisen that have made your resignation unavoidable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At our meeting on Friday afternoon last, we took a decision, and it is important that the public should know of that decision.  Following the consideration of a letter of the 5th April, 1951, to me as Taoiseach, from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, Primate of Ireland, on behalf of the <Col N="780" /> Catholic Hierarchy of Ireland, intimating that the particular scheme for a mother and child health service advocated by the Minister for Health was opposed to Catholic social teaching, the Government decided, at their meeting on the afternoon of the 6th instant, (1) that the scheme referred to should not be further pursued; (2) that in the light of the Government's conviction that mothers and children should not be deprived of the best available health care by reason of insufficient means, a scheme or schemes for a mother and child health service should, as soon as possible, be prepared and undertaken which would (a) provide the best modern facilities for those whose family wage or income does not permit them to obtain, of themselves, the health care that is necessary for mothers and children and (b) be in conformity with Catholic social teaching, and (3) that consideration should be given to the question whether any amendments of the Health Act, 1947, additional to those proposed in the Health Bill, 1950, are necessary or desirable and, if so, that proposals for such amendments should be submitted to the Government.</P>
    <P>I then informed His Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin, who has all this time dealt with me as Head of the Government in his capacity as representative of the Hierarchy, of the decision of the Government.  I wrote to him on the 9th April:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My Lord Archbishop,</P>
    <P>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the letter which on the 5th instant Your Grace addressed to me on behalf of the Hierarchy of Ireland and which Your Grace was good enough to hand to me on the same date at Government Buildings.  That letter conveyed the decision of the Hierarchy that the particular scheme for a mother and child health service advocated by the Minister for Health is opposed to Catholic social teaching. That decision was given in answer to a query of the Minister contained in a memorandum submitted by him in response to the letter of the 10th October, 1950, <Col N="781" /> addressed to me by the Most Reverend Secretary to the Hierarchy.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of your visit to me on the 5th instant I informed Your Grace of my own acceptance of the decision.</P>
    <P>At their meeting on the afternoon of the 6th instant, the Government considered Your Grace's letter and decided:&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I set out the decisions I have just read and my letter proceeded:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your Grace will appreciate that that decision expresses the complete willingness of the Government to defer to the judgment so given by the Hierarchy that the particular scheme in question is opposed to Catholic social teaching.</P>
    <P>The Government have been greatly encouraged to note both from the letter of the 10th October, 1950 and the letter of the 5th April, 1951, that the Hierarchy has strongly advocated a mother and child health scheme which, while affording due facilities for those whom the State, as guardian of the common good, is rightly called upon to assist, will respect the traditional life and spirit of our Christian people.</P>
    <P>Your Grace will also observe from the Government's decision that the Government intend to formulate and undertake a scheme which will secure the best modern facilities for those whose family wage or income does not permit them to obtain of themselves the necessary medical attention but which in its principles and implementation will fully respect Catholic social teaching in regard to the individual and society.</P>
    <P>While thanking the Hierarchy for the anxious and most careful attention given by the General Meeting of the Archbishops and Bishops to the submission made to them by the Minister for Health,</P>
    <P>I have the honour to remain,</P>
    <P>Your Grace,</P>
    <P>respectfully and sincerely yours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I received, on the 10th April, in reply to that, a letter from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin acknowledging receipt of that document:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" />&ldquo;Dear Taoiseach,</P>
    <P>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt to-day of your letter giving the answer of the Government to the letter which, on behalf of the Hierarchy, I handed to you on the 5th instant, when you were good enough to receive me at Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>It will be my duty to convey the decision of the Government to the Standing Committee of the Bishops without delay, and to the general meeting of the Hierarchy in mid-June.</P>
    <P>I may, however, be permitted to anticipate the formal reply of the Hierarchy by expressing to you as head of the Government my deep appreciation of the generous loyalty shown by you and by your colleagues in graciously deferring to the judgment of the Hierarchy concerning the moral aspects of the particular health scheme advocated by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>In view of the clear attitude of the Hierarchy, I may too be allowed to express my conviction that the decision of the Government to proceed to formulate another scheme consonant with Catholic principles will receive the very welcome support of the Bishops.  It is our urgent desire, evidenced in our communications with the Government, that due provision should be made by the Government for the health of those mothers and children whose insufficient means would not allow them to avail themselves of the best modern facilities.</P>
    <P>The present intention of the Government to prepare such a scheme is at once a guarantee of the blessings of God on your deliberations and a presage of practical and peaceful achievement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to say, almost in conclusion&mdash; there are just one or two further remarks I have to make &mdash; that it is the intention of the Government to carry on with their work and to formulate a scheme of the type referred to in His Grace's letters.  The action of the former Minister for Health, his <Col N="783" /> obstinate disregard of plain facts, his obstinacy in sticking to what is really nothing but a catch cry, has prevented a proper scheme from being thought out and put in the way of its implementation for those who require it.  We hope to do the best we can.  It will take time.  Time has been lost.  We hope to do it in the way the Bishops directed in their letter, with calm, clear deliberation and calm consultation and we hope to obtain the goodwill of those whose goodwill must be secured for any scheme that is to work.</P>
    <P>I regret that this discussion had to take place.  Perhaps it is as well that it should.</P>
    <P>Members of my Government have all the one faith.  Members of future Governments may have different faiths.  My colleagues and I, as a Government, and while we are a Government, have been and always will be prepared to receive representations or complaints from any religious group or organisation in the country.  The views of the Church of Ireland, Methodist, Presbyterian or Jewish communities, on any matter affecting them, would receive immediate consideration.  One of my first tasks as Taoiseach&mdash;I think it was in March, 1948,&mdash;was to receive certain complaints from representatives of the Jewish community.  I gave on behalf of the Government undertakings which have been fully honoured.  That is our attitude and I have no hesitation in saying that we, as a Government, representing a people, the overwhelming majority of whom are of the one faith, who have a special position in the Constitution, when we are given advice or warnings by the authoritative people in the Catholic Church, on matters strictly confined to faith and morals, so long as I am here&mdash;and I am sure I speak for my colleagues&mdash;will give to their directions, given within that scope&mdash;and I have no doubt that they do not desire in the slightest to go one fraction of an inch outside the sphere of faith and morals&mdash;our complete obedience and allegiance.</P>
    <P>There will be suggestions made as to the intervention of the Church authorities in State affairs.  That, I'm afraid, is now inevitable.  That is the result <Col N="784" /> of the action of Deputy Dr. Browne in putting the correspondence into the newspapers this morning.  I am not in the least bit afraid of the <i>Irish Times</i> or any other newspaper.  I, as a Catholic, obey my Church authorities and will continue to do so, in spite of the <i>Irish Times</i> or anything else, in spite of the fact that they may take votes from me or my Party, or anything else of that kind.</P>
    <P>I regret that this should be done.  I regret that it may be misrepresented in the North but I wanted to make it clear, as the last thing that I say, that there was no intention of the Hierarchy interfering in any way in politics or with the activities of my Government or the activities of the State.  They confine themselves strictly to faith and morals and their attitude in this extends back, as I said at the very start, to October, 1947, before my Government came into office, and their objections were objections to a Health Act that was placed upon the Statute Book by the previous Government and the previous Dáil, and that it was not a question of their coming in now, when Dr. Browne came with his scheme.</P>
    <P>They came in fundamentally on the same issues as those on which they had given their opinions to my predecessor when he was Head of the Government. All these matters could have been, and ought to have been, dealt with calmly, in quiet and in council, without the public becoming aware of the matter. The public never ought to have become aware of the matter.  It was because the then Minister for Health took the unusual course of saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want a special, authoritative decision from the Hierarchy in general meeting and an immediate decision,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that this matter took the form that it finally took.  The fact that it is now a matter of public controversy is entirely due to the fact that he published all these documents, for his own purposes and his own motives, in the newspapers this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take more time than is absolutely necessary, but I do feel that the matters involved are of sufficient importance to warrant a good deal of detail.  In the first place, for the purposes of the records of this House, I should like to state what I conceive to be the duty of the Leader of one of the Parties composing the Government in relation to members of his Party who may be in the Government.  I regard it as part of my responsibility, part of the responsibility of the Leader of any Party in the Government, to be in a position at all times to assure the Taoiseach that the members of his Party in the Government are worthy of the confidence of the Government, the Oireachtas and of the people, and that they are capable of discharging their duties effectively.  In pursuance of that conception of my duty, I wrote to the Taoiseach on the 10th April this letter which, though it has been published already, I shall read here so as to have it on the records of the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Taoiseach: I enclose a copy of a letter which I have sent by hand to-night to Dr. Browne, Minister for Health, requesting him to tender his resignation to you.  As the formation of the inter-Party Government is a new concept in our Parliamentary history, it is well that I should set out the considerations that have compelled me to adopt this course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the view that, as the leader of one of the parties in the Government, it is part of my responsibility to be in a position to assure the Taoiseach at all times that the members of the Party whom I have the honour to lead in the Government are trustworthy of the confidence of the Government, the Oireachtas, and the people, and are capable of discharging their duties effectively.  As I can no longer give you this assurance in regard to Dr. Browne, for the reasons stated in my letter to him, I deemed it to <Col N="787" /> be the proper course to request him to transmit his resignation to you.</P>
    <P>I am sure that you and the other members of the Government will greatly regret the circumstances which have compelled me to adopt this course.  Dr. Browne did good work in the Government, for which he deserves full credit and it is most unfortunate that he should have behaved, in recent times, in a manner which compelled me to take the action I have taken.</P>
    <P>I hope that Dr. Browne may benefit by the experience he has gained, and that, at some time in the future, he may again be in a position to render service to the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sought to deal with the situation which formed the background of the events which had been related to the House by the Taoiseach, for some months on my own, later with some colleagues of my Party and, later still, with some colleagues in the Government. I feel that I owe an apology to this House, to the Government and to the people generally for having failed to handle this situation satisfactorily on my own.  I should probably have taken the course I took on the 10th April, 1951, at a much earlier date. Deputy Dr. Browne had done good work for the country in the Department of Health during the first portion of his term of office, and it was largely because I felt that there was a debt of gratitude due to him for the work he had done that I delayed so long in taking the action which I ultimately took.  I did hope for a while that possibly a lot of the difficulties that arose were due to his lack of experience, or possibly to ill-health, and that with patience and the passage of time it would have been possible to make him realise his position.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect of the matters that have been disclosed to the House by the Taoiseach are those which relate to what appears to be a clash between the Church and the State.  One of the most difficult and important problems of government is the establishment of a proper relationship <Col N="788" /> between the spiritual and the temporal authorities.  The science of government involves the task of ensuring a harmonious relationship between Churches on one hand and the civil government on the other.  At all times, care should be taken to avoid the creation of a situation which might give the impression that there is a lack of harmony or a lack of co-operation between the Churches and the State. It is, therefore, always a very serious matter that a situation should arise in which the impression is created that a conflict exists between the Government and the Church.  From another point of view, too, I think it is also regrettable that a position should ever arise in which the action of the Government, or the action of one of its Ministers, should become the subject of review or of criticism by the Hierarchy.  From the point of view of the civil government of the country, it is never desirable that such a situation should arise.  In our case in Ireland, there are some additional considerations that make it particularly dangerous that any such situation should arise.  In many countries throughout the world, political Parties are based on religious affiliations.  That I conceive to be undesirable.</P>
    <P>We here in Ireland have avoided that division of Parties.  There are Catholics, Protestants and Jews in, I trust, all Parties in this House, and political divisions have never been built upon religious faith.  The development of any situation wherein there is a conflict between the Government, between one Party in the State and one of the Churches or more than one of the Churches, is likely to lead to a situation where Party politics will be based on religious beliefs.  That, in my view, would be disastrous.  Apart from these general considerations, it is clear that a situation such as the present one is obviously highly damaging to the cause of national unity.  This situation has already been, is being and will continue to be exploited by the enemies of this country in order to maintain the division of our national territory.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that, <Col N="789" /> in my view, the Government of this country, this Government or any other Government, has a duty to hearken to, and give weight and consideration to, the views put forward by the leaders of any religious denomination recognised by the State, be that denomination Christian or Jewish.  I think that is the duty of the Government, to give due weight and consideration to the views which may be put forward by a religious minority, just as it is its duty to give due weight and consideration to the views put forward by the religious leaders of the majority of the people.  Those of us in this House who are Catholics, and all of us in the Government who are Catholics are, as such of course, bound to give obedience to the rulings of our Church and of our Hierarchy.  But I think that, in any event, it is the duty of a Government to give weight and very careful consideration to the views of the spiritual leaders of any recognised religious group irrespective of the religious views of the particular Government in power.</P>
    <P>In this case, we are dealing with the considered views of the leaders of the Catholic Church to which the vast majority of our people belong.  These views cannot be ignored and must be given full weight.  In my considered view, having been fairly closely associated with the events that have taken place in recent months in connection with this whole matter, I am satisfied, beyond doubt, that the clash which has occurred was completely unnecessary and could have been avoided.  It is a clash which is highly damaging to the national interest.  I fear that little or no attempt was made by my late colleague to avoid the clash, and I am not even certain that he did not provoke it.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal briefly with some of the matters which were referred to by Dr. Browne in his statement to-day in order really to discharge a duty which I owe to my colleagues in the Government, and in order to ensure that the actions of a former colleague of my own Party will not react improperly and unfairly upon them.  Leaving aside the padding, the very clever padding, in the statement which Dr. Browne made to-day&mdash;padding <Col N="790" /> which was intended to damage the members of the Government&mdash;Dr. Browne's case, as I understand it to this House, is that he was left in ignorance of the views of the Hierarchy in this whole matter.  He read a long prepared statement to the House.  I take it that that statement was carefully considered and carefully prepared. I note that, on no less than seven different occasions in the statement, care is taken to emphasise that either Dr. Browne was under the impression that the document he had given to the Taoiseach in November had been transmitted and had satisfied the Hierarchy, or that they were quite satisfied as a result of his interview. In one passage he states, in relation to this document:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I concluded that it had been transmitted solely for the purpose of record and formal reply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is in relation to the letter from the Hierarchy of October, 1950.  Presumably, that is intended to convey to the House that, at that stage, the Hierarchy was satisfied with his mother and child scheme&mdash;that is, on the 11th October, 1950.  A few lines further on he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to emphasise that, as I still believed that His Grace and Their Lordships had been reassured by the case made by me on the 11th October, I merely regarded this reply also as being for purposes of record by the Hierarchy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A few lines further on he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I heard nothing further about the matter from either the Hierarchy or the Taoiseach until a couple of weeks ago I had no reason to believe that the Hierarchy were not fully satisfied....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A few paragraphs further on Deputy Dr. Browne says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was surprised for the simple reason that I had heard nothing further either from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, acting on behalf of the Hierarchy, or from the Taoiseach, acting for the Government, in the four months that had intervened since I had handed to the Taoiseach in November my reply to Their Lordship's letter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> Again, further on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I then learned to my distress and amazement that the reply to Their Lordships' letter which I had prepared and sent to the Taoiseach in the previous November had, in fact, never been sent by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, Deputy Dr. Browne refers to the objections made by the Hierarchy as being &ldquo;withheld from him&rdquo;. The one theme running through Deputy Dr. Browne's statement to-day was that he was ignorant of the fact that the Hierarchy had certain anxieties concerning these proposals. There are seven different references in a fairly short number of pages.  That cannot have been so, having regard to the facts as I know them.  I had numerous discussions with Deputy Dr. Browne concerning the fears of the Hierarchy concerning the letter from the Hierarchy of the 11th October, 1950, concerning the fact that no reply had been forwarded and advising that some steps should be taken to meet the viewpoint of the Hierarchy, or, at least, to discuss the matter with members of the Hierarchy.  I had a long conversation with him some days after the meeting which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste had with representatives of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach told the House, following upon that meeting, Deputy Dr. Browne accused the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste of having &ldquo;sold him down the drain&rdquo; to the medical profession. One or two days subsequently, Deputy Dr. Browne learned from the doctors and from the report which the doctors issued to their own members that the allegations he had made against the Taoiseach at that time were untrue and he apologised to the Taoiseach in respect to that allegation.  The Taoiseach here in Leinster Huose after that apology told me that Deputy Browne had spoken to him when he had seen the circular which the doctors had issued to their members.  The Taoiseach spoke to me in relation to the whole matter and told me that Dr. Browne had asked him to speak to members of the Hierarchy in connection with the October letter. The Taoiseach had agreed to that, but <Col N="792" /> was rather worried lest he might again be accused by Dr. Browne of selling him down the drain on this occasion with members of the Hierarchy.</P>
    <P>Following that conversation with the Taoiseach, I had a long conversation with Deputy Dr. Browne, in which I pointed out to him the necessity of dealing with the objections raised by the Hierarchy and I conveyed to him the offer made by the Taoiseach to have discussions with members of the Hierarchy in order to find a solution and urged Deputy Dr. Browne to discuss the matter with the Taoiseach and give the Taoiseach full powers to proceed with such negotiations.  In the course of that discussion, both Deputy Dr. Browne and myself were fully aware that the October letter had never been replied to.  That was one of my anxieties which I mentioned on that occasion and on numerous occasions since to Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
    <P>So anxious was I about the whole position, that I even had to mention it at a meeting of the executive of my Party in the month of February.  Later, I mentioned it again to Deputy Dr. Browne on a number of occasions in the presence of witnesses.  In the presence of from 30 to 40 members of our national Executive I referred to this and Deputy Dr. Browne admitted that on numerous occasions over a period of time I had urged him to settle these differences with the members of the Hierarchy.  On 8th March last, just the day on which I was leaving for the United States of America, I had a conversation with Deputy Dr. Browne and, to make quite certain that there would be no doubt about a number of matters, during my absence in the United States I wrote to Dr. Browne, then Minister for Health just before leaving.  In the course of that letter I dealt with this particular matter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard to the mother and child proposals, I can only repeat the views which I have already given to you, namely, that if an opportunity arises of securing at least the tacit co-operation of the doctors you should avail of it.  Likewise, as I told you, I think that the Hierarchy are by no means satisfied <Col N="793" /> as to certain provisions of the scheme and that you should seek their co-operation.  I am certain that, if properly approached, their opposition to the scheme could at least be minimised and, possibly, their approval secured for it.  The practical difficulties of implementing the scheme in any circumstances are very great.  If, in addition, you are faced with the combined opposition of the medical profession, the Hierarchy and the voluntary hospitals, the difficulties will become nearly insurmountable.  In my view it is still possible to remedy this position provided a genuine attempt is made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the light of the numerous conversations that I had with Deputy Dr. Browne, in the light of Deputy Dr. Browne's own admission in the presence of numerous witnesses and in the light of that letter, how can Deputy Dr. Browne seriously ask this House to-day to believe that he &ldquo;had no reason to believe that the Hierarchy were not fully satisfied&rdquo;?  How can he, if he has any sense of responsibility, come in here and assure the House that he had no reason to believe that the Hierarchy were not fully satisfied?  How can he make this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I then learned&rdquo;&mdash;on 15th March &mdash;&ldquo;to my distress and amazement that the reply to Their Lordships' letter which I had prepared and sent to the Taoiseach in the previous November had, in fact, never been sent by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole purport of Deputy Dr. Browne's statement to this House to-day was that he did not realise there were any objections from the Hierarchy. As I have indicated, that impression is not a true impression.  It cannot be a true impression having regard to the facts that I have just placed before the House.</P>
    <P>Now, as to the actual position in regard to the mother and child scheme itself, the Taoiseach has referred to the fact that originally when the scheme came before the Government it came in the memorandum brought forward by Deputy Dr. Browne, which <Col N="794" /> accompanied the heads of a Bill to implement the Health Act of 1947. The Taoiseach is quite correct in stating that the scheme itself never came before the Government; but a proposal to amend the Health Act of 1947 did come before the Government. In the course of that memorandum, Deputy Dr. Browne explains why it is necessary to amend the Health Act of 1947.  One of the amendments proposed is one to enable a change to be made for the mother and child health services by the local authorities.  To &ldquo;authorise the making of charges for services performed thereunder where such charges should be made payable to health authorities and/or to the persons rendering the services; providing also for the recovery of such charges as are payable to health authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne sought the approval of the Government, therefore, to introduce amending legislation so that this scheme could be charged for.</P>
    <P>I have always taken the view in connection with the mother and child services that there was only one principle involved, namely, that the services should be available to all mothers and children in such a way that lack or inadequacy of means should not debar anyone from obtaining the best medical treatment that money and science can provide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that, on the basis of that principle, it would have been possible to reach agreement without infringing any of the doctrines of the Catholic Church. The Hierarchy in their last letter set out in the last paragraph thereof the position as they see it:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Accordingly, the Hierarchy have firm confidence that it will yet be possible, after reflection and calm consultation, for the Government to provide a scheme which, while it <Col N="796" /> affords due facilities for those whom the State, as guardian of the common good, is rightly called upon to assist, will none the less respect in its principles and implementation the traditional life and spirit of our Christian people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that if Deputy Dr. Browne had desired to evolve a scheme which conformed to the views expressed by the Hierarchy, such a scheme could have been evolved and would be at least partly in operation by now.  The only time the matter came before the Government was in the month of June, 1948.  I think that little physical preparations had been made for the application of the scheme and that even if the scheme could be operated to-morrow, even if the medical profession were in complete agreement and if all the difficulties of the Hierarchy had been overcome, it would be some very considerable time before the necessary machinery and physical facilities could be made available to operate the scheme.  In the final analysis, the success or otherwise of such a scheme must depend upon the concrete facilities available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unfortunate and most tragic affair.  It is unfortunate that within this inter-Party Government which, in my opinion, has been doing magnificent work, a crisis of this kind should have arisen.  It is regrettable that personalities should <Col N="797" /> have entered into the matter in the way they have.  I am a member of this House for something over three years and have been paying as much attention as I could to my duties here.  I thought I had some idea of what was going on, but not until Friday last did I know that there was brewing within the Government this particular matter that has boiled over now.  I knew there were difficulties between Deputy Dr. Browne and the doctors.  It was inevitable, in the introduction of such a scheme, that there would be difficulties between the Minister for Health and the doctors.  They had those difficulties in Britain, very serious difficulties, between their Minister for Health and the doctors and the fight was fought as bitterly there as it was fought here. I thought that the fight would resolve itself in the way it did in England, that the doctors who had been most opposed to the scheme would find that it was as beneficial for them as for the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It struck me as a thunderbolt on Friday last to learn that a situation had arisen in which one of the most popular Ministers in the Government was on the verge of being dismissed or resigning.  I say deliberately, that Deputy Dr. Browne, if not the most popular Minister, was certainly one of the most popular.  The Party to which he belonged, Clann na Poblachta, were claiming credit all over the country for the magnificent work being done by Deputy Dr. Browne in the Department of Health.  After the things that have been said about him here this evening, it is only right that I should say that, in my view, Deputy Dr. Noël Browne has built a monument to himself in the health services of this country in a short period of three years and that no other Minister that I know of could have done as much for the people in 20 years as he has done in three.  We know that during that period he was not of robust health; we know that he was ill on a few occasions; but whatever else may be said against him &mdash;and when a person is down it is the popular think to kick him; I am not going to do that&mdash;Deputy Dr. Nöel Browne has devoted all his physical <Col N="798" /> capacity to the improvement of our health services.</P>
    <P>When I heard the opening remarks in regard to him, by a person who was his Leader, as he likes to call himself, who was his colleague; when I see the bitterness that is in that man against Deputy Dr. Noël Browne, I feel ashamed of our democratic institutions. Why has Deputy Dr. Browne, from being the Minister that was held up by Clann na Poblachta all over the country as such a wonderful man, been brought to the position that he is described as a scoundrel and a liar, as incompetent, incapable and unfit to be Minister in this or any other Government?  What has brought about that change?  Is it not clear that what has brought about the change is that Deputy Dr. Browne, because of his great work for the people, was becoming more popular than his Leader?</P>
    <P>Because he was more popular than his Leader, he must be downed and he must be damned.  You can see it there. There is a matter I would like to check up&mdash;this mysterious letter sent from America telling Dr. Browne to resolve this trouble with the doctors and not to forget the Bishops.  Why was that said to Dr. Browne?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <P>Everybody who disagrees with the Minister for External Affairs is not normal and could not be. That is the viewpoint of the Minister for External Affairs in regard to his colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
      <P>On last Friday, when I heard for the first time of this trouble, I got in touch with Deputy Dr. Browne.  He was a Minister I met in the same way as I meet any Minister, to see him about matters which affect my constituents. I rang him up and said to him:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No matter what happens, do not resign until we have an opportunity of discussing this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw the Taoiseach on the Monday and I made the point that there should be no hasty action in regard to the matter.  There was to be an inter-Party meeting on Wednesday.  It was my firm belief that if an opportunity had <Col N="800" /> been given to us at the inter-Party meeting on Wednesday, we might have resolved and cleared up this whole matter, rather than have it breaking on the country and doing damage, as it will do and must do, to the Government. On Friday, there had been a meeting of the Cabinet.  The Cabinet had taken a decision not to go ahead with a mother and child scheme free-for-all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Noël Browne was a member of a Party that was pledged to have a free-for-all scheme.  He was pledged to have a free-for-all scheme and his Party was pledged to that.  In the Government&mdash;it is public now&mdash;he stood for his free-for-all scheme.  His leader reneged the policy and the principle of his own Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

That is a new way of describing the means test and so we have references to the poor people in Dublin and Connemara and the wealthy people in Merrion Square or somewhere else.  Dr. Browne, being a member of a Party that had laid it down specifically that that there was to be a free-for-all mother and child scheme, told the Government he wanted time to consider the new decision.  That was on Friday.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, there was a meeting of his political Party which commenced, according to the Press, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and went on to 3 or 4 o'clock on the following morning.  That was some meeting!  I can visualise it. It went on to 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.  Numerous resolutions were proposed and, as the newspapers said the following day, a resolution of loyalty to the Leader was passed.</P>

But because Deputy Dr. Browne stood by the policy of his Party on that, he is thrown over and they are using the position of the Bishops to damn him politically, if they can.

      <P>The position on Monday morning was apparently that there was no change in Clann na Poblachta policy.  On Monday, efforts were being made to try to solve this difficulty and to settle it.  The inter-Party meeting was to be held on the Wednesday. The matter would be discussed there and might have been solved, might have been patched up, but the Minister for External Affairs was determined that it would not be patched up.  He knew the meeting was coming off and knew the matter would be discussed at the meeting and he made up his mind that he was going to put an end to any effort that could possibly be made to settle this matter. On Tuesday night, he wrote a letter to Dr. Browne which is on the records of this House&mdash;it was read here to-night and it is in the newspapers to-day&mdash; requiring Dr. Browne to hand his resignation to the Taoiseach.  I say that the Minister for External Affairs sent that letter deliberately to sabotage the efforts that were about to be made to resolve this whole conflict.  Why could he not hold his letter until Wednesday? Why could he not have sent it on Monday? Why send it a few moments before 9 or 10 o'clock?  On that night, when I heard that the Minister contemplated sending such a letter to Dr. Browne, I saw the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach, through his Parliamentary Secretary, and other Ministers.  I asked these Ministers to try to stop the issue of such a letter by the Minister to Dr. Browne until we had an opportunity of discussing the matter.</P>

      <P>At that time, when I was making these efforts, apparently the letter had been sent.  It may be clear, even to Deputy O'Leary, that any request I would have made to the Minister for External Affairs personally would not have been successful.  If I thought that, by discussing the matter with the Minister, I could have saved him from what we now have, this shocking washing of dirty linen in public, I would have gone to see him.</P>

      <P>And who dirtied it? It is regrettable that there should be this discussion in public about the differences that arose in the Government, when these matters might have been solved by discussion between the Deputies who form or support the inter-Party Government; but we were given no opportunity of trying to settle it, and, as I say, the efforts that were being made, and that might have been made, were deliberately sabotaged by the Minister for External Affairs who wanted Dr. Browne's scalp at all costs. I feel compelled to say these things and to make no bones about the fact that I consider the Minister for External Affairs to be one of the most dangerous characters in this country.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to deal with this aspect of the case this evening.  There is another and more important aspect of the case with which I intend to deal, but I do not intend to deal with it this evening, because it is important that it should be dealt with thoroughly and after mature consideration, and that what is said in regard to it should be said deliberately and after proper thought and consideration.  I do not intend to avoid that issue, but I will deal with it in its proper time when the debate on this motion is resumed next Tuesday.</P>
