      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has made an Order to prevent milk, other than pasteurised milk, from being offered for sale in any specified area in the State, where the making of such an Order is in opposition to the wishes of the consumers and the local public health authority and if he has not made an Order in such case whether he will give an assurance that he will not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish) (for Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>No Order of the nature referred to in the first portion of the Deputy's question has been made.</P>
      <P>The Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, provides that the Minister for Health, on the application of the sanitary authority concerned, may prohibit by Order the sale of milk within the whole or part of a sanitary district unless such milk is sold under a special designation within the meaning of Part IV of the Act.  The special designations at present are pastenrised milk, highest grade milk and standard milk.</P>
      <P>Proposals for amending legislation designed to restrict the sale of milk which is not free from the risk of infection and to encourage the extension of pasteurisation facilities are at present under consideration.  I do not anticipate that measures aimed at improving the safety of the milk supply in this respect will meet with opposition from the general body of consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state why it is considered neceseary to have an <Col N="1413" /> applicant for a blind pension who is unable, through illness, to attend at a local clinic, examined in his or her own home by an ophthalmic surgeon other than the ophthalmic surgeon appointed in the area for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the terms of appointment prescribed by the Department of Health in respect of county ophthalmic surgeons who normally carry out such examinations do not provide for domiciliary examination of claimants for blind pensions.  As the Deputy is aware, the services of an ophthalmic surgeon attached to the Department of Health are available for such examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that a lot of time would be saved if the ophthalmic surgeon for the area was allowed to examine people in their own homes?  Under existing conditions, the people who are ill and apply for blind pensions have to wait until the medical inspector comes from Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy, the terms of appointment prescribed by the Department of Health in respect of county ophthalmic surgeons who normally carry out such examinations of applicants for blind pensions do not impose on the ophthalmic surgeon the obligation to carry out domiciliary examination, that is, examination in the person's place of residence, and I have no power, since I do not control the ophthalmic surgeons, to require them to carry out the examination in the residence of the particular applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>If the person appointed in the area was willing to carry out the inspection there, would the Minister approve of that, or does it rest with the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the remuneration of the ophthalmic surgeon may arise, but if the Deputy will send me particulars of any case in which she is interested or where she thinks the existing procedure could in any way be modified in the interests of applicants, I will be glad to examine <Col N="1414" /> the matter sympathetically in order to see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>The person I have in mind lives only three miles outside the local clinic and the local officer is quite willing to examine this person in her own home, but she is informed it is not the correct procedure and that the inspector must come from Dublin. That course seems to me to be a waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will give me particulars of the case, I will have it examined and, if necessary, I will discuss it with the Deputy.  I rather imagine if the inspector has to call it is for the purpose of making an inquiry which it is not possible for the county ophthalmic suigeon to make.  If the Deputy will let me have particulars, I will have the case specially examined.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Methods of Proving Unemployment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will reconsider the methods of proving unemployment by unemployed persons in rural districts with a view to eliminating the unnecessary hardships incurred in twice and thrice-weekly attendances at Gardaí barracks and labour exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit who reside within two miles from a local office of this Department are normally required to attend at the office and sign the unemployed register daily.  Those residing over two, but not over four, miles are required to attend on alternate days only.  Those residing over four, but not over six, miles attend once a week only.  Those who reside more than six miles from the nearest local office are not required to attend, but are dealt with by post. This latter class are, however, required to go once a week to the nearest Garda station to have their forms certified that they were unemployed during that week.  These arrangements have been in operation for a considerable time and have proved satisfactory generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Depnty will give me the namss and addresses of any persons who, in his opinion, are suffering hardship in proving unemployment under the <Col N="1415" /> present regulations, I shall have their cases specially examined without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, say, having the form certified by a peace commissioner and thus avoid the necessity for applicants to go once or twice weekly to the Garda barracks or labour exchange?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a need to keep some kind of check over applicants for unemployment assistance benefit.  It is a benefit which is paid without any contribution being made by the applicant. It is necessary, therefore, that there should be reasonable vigilance in the payment of benefit of that kind. On previous occasions various experiments were devised whereby an applicant for benefit would have his form certified by some other person as proof of the fact that he was unemployed, but a subsequent examination of the results of a scheme of that kind showed that it was being abused, not only by the applicants but in some cases even the certifying people were utilising it for a purpose for which it was never intended.  Consequently, that device had to be abandoned.  I do not think the Deputy's new suggestion offers a solution any more satisfactory than those already attempted, and the existing regulations are not, in my view, very onerous on applicants for unemployment assistance benefit.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that these lands have been set year after year to substantial land owners in that locality and that there are uneconomic tenants of the Land Commission, whose valuations are as low as £5 and under, who cannot get conacre on these lands; that some of the people who have a monopoly of these lands are even subletting them?  In view of that fact and the fact that there is such congestion in the locality, would the Minister impress upon the Land Commission again to have speedy acquisition of these lands and possession taken of them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <P>It is not correct for the Deputy to say that the scheme is held up.  It is not held up.  Certain cases that do not qualify under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, naturally, cannot be dealt with and the persons concerned have been told so and, if they have made application to the Department of Local Government for the grant which is available there, that is perfectly correct procedure.  It is contemplated to amend the legislation in certain respects and I hope the Deputy and his Party will give me every assistance when that legislation comes into the House.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that there was some delay on my part in replying to this question.  There is no foundation for this allegation, as the question was given to me for reply only to-day.</P>
      <P>I might add to the reply just given to the same question by the Ministsr for Health, that there is, of course, no question of genuine opposition by the public to any measures which are necessary for the purpose of preventing the spread of disease through milk.  For example, in the case of Cork City the corporation has, in fact, passed a resolution to the effect that the milk supply should be pasteurised, but the county council has not passed a parallel resolution with respect to those relatively minor parts of the Cork sale district which are under the jurisdiction of the council.  I am satisfied that the county council's attitude is dictated by irrelevant considerations, and under the legislation already referred to by the Minister for Health, steps will be taken to ensure that the safeguarding of the Cork milk supply will not be blocked by such manoeuvres on the part of minority vested interests, who appear to attach more importance to their own convenience and profit than they do to the proteetion of Cork children from the danger of infection of bovine tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>I am further informed that the vast majority of applicants in Kerry desire to avail themselves of the arrangement whereby they themselves carry out reclamation works, mostly by hand labour, in consideration of receiving a grant.  For the benefit of the minority we have already equipped one contractor in the county with bulldozer, plough, excavator, and ancillary equipment, and I understand that we may be given the opportunity of similarly equipping a further contractor in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any great hardship to the classes mentioned by the Deputy.  The object of the special allowances is to relieve persons who had service in the national movement from want by granting them annual allowances which, when added <Col N="1431" /> to their means, will not equal or exceed a sum which varies from £78 per annum in the case of a single person to £97 10s. 0d. (plus an allowance of £10 8s. 0d. for each child) to a married person.  To implement this scheme as provided for in the relevant Act, regard must be had to the actual means of each applicant.

Is he further aware that it has been properly described as a penal enactment&mdash;that is the method of bringing an appeal against a decision given?  If an applicant is turned down he cannot appeal for 12 months, even though additional evidence could be produced the following day or week which would have the effect of nullifying the provious decision.  The position is that the appeal cannot be entertained for 12 months.  Therefore, I claim that that is a hardship and a penalty on the Old I.R.A.  They are restricted in making applications for the special allowance under the present system.  I suggest that there should be some modification of this means test.</P>

      <P>The price at the date of decontrol of each of the commodities which has been exempted from control under the Prices and Charges (Standstill) Order, 1951, was the appropriate price as determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 (2) of that Order.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware the prices of uncontrolled commodities vary in different localities and even in different shops in the same locality.  It is not feasible, therefore, to state the present price of each such commodity.</P>

      <P>The position arising out of the present vacancy in the District Court clerkship serving the District Court areas of Glenties, Ardara and Stranorlar, falls to be dealt with by the amalgamation of these areas with those of adjoining clerkships.  The matter is at present being considered as part of a general scheme for the reorganisation of the various District Court clerkships in County Donegal, which has as its ultimate object the suppression of all part-time clerkships in the county and their replacement by whole-time posts, which will, of course, be fewer in number.  The suppression of part-time clerkships will be effected only as opportunity offers, that is to say, according as vacancies occur in the normal way.</P>

      <P>The only lead sold by the Department of Justice or by any authority under the control of the Department <Col N="1440" /> of Justice during the past 12 months was two small lots of scrap lead sold at Portlaoighise and Limerick prisons.  These lots were three tons sold at Portlaoighise prison in December, 1950, at a price of £42 10s. Od. per ton, and 2 cwt. sold at Limerick prison in March, 1951 at £50 per ton.  The sales were made on tender and unfortunately the fact that the Price of lead was controlled at £40 per ton was not adverted to.  Arrangements are being made to refund the excess price obtained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The principles actuating the Deputy in amendments Nos. 71, 77 and 79 are, I take it, much the same in relation to the carrying out of certain functions by the county officer.  The Deputy has already expressed the view that he wants to preserve the right and the principle of giving the maximum amount of authority to the elected representatives.  That is the principle underlying this Bill.  I have already explained that the principle of protecting the responsibilities of the elected representatives is adequately safeguarded already in the Bill.  The carrying out of executive functions will be vested in them but there are other functions that can be more effectively performed by the individual county officer.  It is for that reason that it is suggested that he should perform these functions&mdash;that is employment functions, tenancy functions and health functions.  The argument against the Deputy's amendment in this particular instance is that the Bill is intended to give back real power into the hands of the elected representatives. If the elected representatives were to occupy their time quibbling over little jobs or examining into a dispute in relation to some employee or another, valuable time would be wasted.  That type of thing can be dealt with more effectively by an individual. It should be no part of a body such as this to deal with individuals and their complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters of that kind are better dealt with by the county officer, particularly having regard to the fact that he functions inside duly prescribed lines.  I <Col N="1445" /> do not think approval could be given to handing these functions over to the elected representatives.  In another section power is taken to ensure that there will be no undue increase, for instance, in staff without the sanction of the elected representatives.  In earlier Acts the higher positions are adequately dealt with by the Local Appointments Commission.  Power was taken in the past to have them dealt with by the Government.  I see neither reason nor justification for cluttering up the business of the elected representatives by imposing upon them the duty of dealing with minor matters of the kind suggested by the Deputy.  I suggest to the Deputy that his principle has been adequately preserved in the Bill since executive powers are being given back to the elected representatives.  Under Section 27 of this Bill they will have control over staff matters.  I think our method is the most effective way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept the decision on this in relation to amendments Nos. 77 and 79, as they cover the same principle.  I do not suppose I would be able to carry it against the Minister unless I got support from my friends across the House.  The only purpose behind this series of amendments is the principle that I stated here on a former occasion, that I wanted to give democratic powers to the local authorities.  These amendments would provide that a local authority could itself decide to carry out the employment functions, the functions under tenancy or the individual health functions; or, if they do not so decide, then in accordance with the Bill, these functions would be exercised by the county officer.  If I had any measure of support for that principle, I would press it.  If I have not the measure of support that it deserves, I am not going to delay the House on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 74:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;vacancy occurs in a permanent office under a council of a county or an elective body&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;permanent office under the council of a county or an elective body is vacant,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The purpose of this amendment is to alter the opening words of sub-section (3) from &ldquo;Where a vacancy occurs in a permanent office under a council of a county or an elected body....&rdquo; to &ldquo;where a permanent office under the council of a county or an elected body is vacant....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sub-section provides as it stands that where a vacancy occurs in a permanent office the county officer shall not take any steps to fill the vacancy permanently save with the approval either of the appropriate executive committee of such council or of the elective body.  The words &ldquo;where a vacancy occurs&rdquo; may give rise to difficulty. Suppose there was a particular statutory office which had never been filled under a local authority, then it would hardly be correct to say that a vacancy occurred.  Again, if the vacancy occurred some years previously, then the words &ldquo;where a vacancy occurs&rdquo; would hardly be appropriate.  It is considered that the expression &ldquo;where a permanent office is vacant&rdquo; is the more correct way to describe it and prevent any difficulty that might arise in filling that particular job.</P>

      <P>If we get back to amendment No. 72, No. 72 relates to the council of the county or the elected body and not executive committees. The net point at issue is whether a proposal to increase the number of permanent officers in a council of a county or an elected body shall not be submitted to the Minister save with the approval of the county council concerned. The net point there is whether the approval should be given by the county council or by an executive committee of the county council.  I agree to this extent that since the acceptance of the amendment permitting the whole body of the council to be members of an executive committee the matter does not seem to be of very great importance.  On that basis, since the Minister has accepted the proposal to permit every individual who is a member of a council to be a member of an executive committee, I suppose there is not much point in debating the proposed amendment at length.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the employment functions of the council and it is probably one of the important sections in this Bill.  I doubt whether there is much change in the powers which the section gives from the existing powers under the County Management Act except that they are carried out in full in this Bill. The thought often occurred to me that the matter of employment functions is probably one of the big weaknesses&mdash;if weakness could be said to exist&mdash;in the County Management Act.  I personally believe that the council, in some form or other, should come in for the making of appointments with the manager in the matter of getting the <Col N="1450" /> work done, so to speak.  I do not want to bring in the council in every matter dealing with employees on roads or with operatives in housing.  The council should definitely be brought in in respeet of the principal officers of a council of a county and have some function side by side with the manager.  That would strengthen and add to the local government machine as it operates.  I would like to see some amendment discussed here on Report Stage to see if it were possible to bring in the principal officers and council of a county, together with the manager not for the purpose of dealing with matters of discipline but, generally speaking, to deal with the matter of how they carry out their functions.  If that could be done it would strengthen this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Allen has raised this point, because it does certainly reveal what is a very difficult problem in this matter of county administration. Perhaps a great deal of the difficulty arose, in the first instance, from the unwarranted assumption of authority by inexperienced county managers, and, on the other hand, by a too ready acquiescence in that assumption by the members of the elected bodies.  When the Act was introduced there was a great deal of prejudice created about it and, I think, a great deal of misunderstanding in the minds of the then members of the elected bodies.  They did not grasp the full extent of their powers and the control which they could assert over the county manager. Therefore, thay assumed that they could not discuss with him the shortcomings of the heads of the various technical services administered on behalf&mdash;we are just dealing with county councils&mdash;of the county council. Of course, that was wrong.  They were quite competent to raise with the manager any act of negligence, any failure, any deficiency in zeal or efficiency of any one of the officers of the county council.  In fact, not only were they competent to do so, but it was their duty to do so and to pin on him definite reaponsibility for the act of every one of his subordinates and <Col N="1451" /> for the acts of every officer of the county council.  If the county manager was not prepared to accept that responsibility and accepting it to ensure that the heads of the various county services under him would do their duty competently and zealously, then I would say that such a person was not fit to hold the post of county manager.</P>
      <P>There is one thing, I think, that this Bill does&mdash;the County Management Act has done it also.  This Bill definitely fixes responsibility on the county officers for the full control of the staffs; it implies full responsibility for what every member of that staff does.  It is the duty of the county officer, in the first place, to see that every officer under him serves, as I have said, zealously, energetically, and efficiently, and to hold that officer accountable through himself as county officer to the elected body for everything that is done in relation to whatever particular service that officer may be head of.  It also, I think, definitely fixes on the elected body the responsibility for seeing that the county officer discharges these employment functions of the council on their behalf, naturally, and on behalf of the ratepayers zealously and fearlessly.  If that position is understood and made effective in actual practice, I think that many of the difficulties, which Deputy Allen and, I know, other members of local authorities have experienced in the past, will disappear.  It all depends upon the county officer on the one hand being fit for his job and the members of the county council being prepared to rise to the height of their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often we blame on legislative enactments the faults which arise really from our own lack of moral courage.  It does happen that members of county councils will hesitate to criticise, will hesitate to criticise the county manager because the officers under him do not do their job and will hesitate to criticise the heads of one or other of the technical services of the council because they do not want to hurt the officer or be on bad terms with him. That is where the great part of the <Col N="1452" /> difficulty to which Deputy Allen has referred is experienced.  There are, of course, in all county councils men who are fearless and who will do their duty, but it is always difficult to single one-self out as a trouble maker, as the fellow who is the carping critic, and until it is realised by the members of the elected body that they must, if necessary, if the circumstances call for it, do things which are bound to make them unpopular with the officials, I am afraid we are going to have always an imperfect system of local government.  I do not think we shall ever have a perfect system because these human factors come into play, no matter what Acts of Parliament you may pass in order to eliminate them.</P>
    <P>We can get only a reasonable amount &mdash;a modicum, I might say&mdash;of efficient administration, when you have in every county council people who are not tied to any body of servants of the county council, who are not tied by personal sentiment or association to any individual in the council, but who are tied only to the ratepayers who elected them.  If we can get that situation brought about, whether we call the officer a county officer or county manager, you will get reasonable efficiency and you will not get exceptional efficiency.  You will not get 100 per cent. efficiency, because you will have to work with human instruments as you find them, and particularly with human instruments as they are bound to be moulded and influenced by the fact that they are dealing always with neighbours and sometimes with friends.</P>
    <P>Instead of the Minister contemplating the drafting of an amendment, the real way to tackle this problem is to tackle it right from the top, for the Minister continuously to impress, first, on the members of the elected body that they are in fact the masters under this Bill, as they were under the County Management Act, and that it is only when they assert that control and superiority that either this Bill when it becomes an Act or the County Management Act could be made to work and, secondly, on the county officer, formerly the county manager, that he is responsible for every officer under him, that he cannot shelve that <Col N="1453" /> responsibility and cannot slough it off simply by saying that it is the job of the county medical officer of health or the job of the county engineer.  He is responsible to the elected body for everything these officers do and particularly for everything they neglect to do which they ought to do.  Until he is prepared to shoulder that responsibility&mdash;if he were not prepared to do so, I do not think he should be retained in his job any longer than is necessary &mdash;it will be very difficult to get this system, any more than the system which preceded it, to work without a great deal of criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse every word Deputy MacEntee has said.  That is exactly my conception of how the Bill ought to work and how we expect it will work.  I do not believe it could work otherwise.  We must have responsibility properly centred on the officer for such work as is given to him in the Bill or delegated to him by the executive committee or council as a council. There will have to be a responsible officer carrying out that work and he must stand up to his responsibility and not seek to share it with others. Deputy Allen said he thought there was a weakness in the system in that too much independence was vested in the county manager.  That has been covered by taking from the manager the executive powers and I am hoping that with the officer doing the job in relation to such work as is delegated or set out in the Bill&mdash;individual health, tenancy and employment functions&mdash;he will be responsible to the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main factor was the giving back to the council of the executive powers and that provision has taken a lot of the power from the manager, so that these functions will be carried out under the direct control of the elected representatives; but that does not take in the least from the responsibility of the officer who will carry out these functions.  Under Section 45, he is bound to give all kinds of information required by the council at any time.  I am satisfied that there is ample protection given for the democratic principle, so to speak, and, at the same <Col N="1454" /> time, for securing efficiency in working by loading the county officer with responsibility and giving no option but to stand up to it.  If he delegates it to another, he will still be responsible for the performance of these functions. I am grateful to Deputy MacEntee for his remarks because they coincide exactly with my own views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 78:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the county officer proposes to perform the function of selecting a tenant&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he shall first submit to the general executive committee or elective body (as may be appropriate) particulars of any applications received for the tenancy and the reports of the county medical officer thereon together with the name and address of the person whom he proposes to select as tenant, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such committee or body may by resolution require the county-officer to obtain and submit to them further reports from the county medical officer on the applications or on any matter connected with the selection of a tenant, and</P>
      <P>(c)  if such requirement is made, the county officer shall not proceed with the selection of a tenant until he has complied with the requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to add a new sub-section to Section 30 which provides that the tenancy functions of the council of a county or an elective body shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, be performed by the county officer.  The new sub-section provides that, where the county officer proposes to perform the function of selecting a tenant, he must first submit to the general executive committee of the county council or to the elective <Col N="1455" /> body particulars of the applications received for the tenancy and the reports of the county medical officer, together with the name and address of the person he proposes to select as tenant. If the general executive committee of a county council or an elective body are doubtful about any of the information given in the county medical officer's reports, they can query them and ask the county officer to get a further report from the county medical officer.</P>
    <P>Members of a local authority may have personal information with regard to some of the tenants and they may discover cases where the county medical officer is misled by an applicant and they can then ask the county officer to get a further report.  The county officer cannot make the letting until he has submitted the further report to them.  The point is that a medical officer might make his report on a tenant and the county officer would be guided by that report in the matter of priority, but it is possible for misleading information to be given as to the number of occupants in a house and such matters.  If any of the elected representatives are aware that false or misleading information has been given, upon which the decision of the county medical officer and county officer is based, they are entitled to have the matter reinvestigated in the light of that knowledge.</P>

      <P>In line 37, to add at the end &ldquo;on the advice of the county medical officer of health&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is that the individual health functions of the council of the county or an elective body shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be performed by the county officer on the advice of the county medical officer of health.  The individual health functions are to a large extent, and I think mainly, functions in which the advice of the county medical officer of health will be very valuable.  The county medical officer of health has substantial responsibilities in regard to this matter.  Where the health functions are performed by the county officer they should be performed by him on the advice of the county medical officer of health who is the appropriate person to advise him&mdash;and not some other person on his staff who may not understand properly the matter that is under discussion. I think the Minister will have no objection to accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are obvious reasons why I could not accept the Deputy's amendment.  The county officer would have to consult with the appropriate officer in all these particular functions, but there is no reason why it should be made a statutory obligation on him to consult with the county medical officer of health.  The county medical officer of health will not be the sole authority to advise him of health matters.  Take, for instance, the resident medical superintendent of a mental hospital.  Then, again, there is the matter of tenancy functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of the selection of tenants, the county officer will have to be guided by the county medical officer of health, but he should not be restricted to a statutory obligation to perform his functions in the way which the Deputy suggests.  As I have said, there is the matter of the resident <Col N="1457" /> medical superintendent of a mental hospital.  He is the man who would have to be dealt with in particular cases.  If this amendment were accepted it would be tantamount to making the county medical officer of health an additional county officer.  We should have only one county officer in an area, otherwise we should have chaos.  The county officer will have to consult with the county medical officer of health when it is his job.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat what has been said before in regard to the general character of this Bill, but I think it is opportune to mention once again that there is an implication in this Bill whereby county councils did not have, before the Bill was introduced, the conception in their <Col N="1458" /> minds that they could exercise executive functions.  I should like once more to take up the cudgels with the Minister in regard to the statement he has made on a number of occasions which would make it appear that he is conferring a privilege and greater democratic power on local authorities by giving them such executive functions as the planning of a housing scheme, the planning of a sewerage and water scheme, the planning of a hospital or the planning of any new amenity to be constructed or designed for the benefit of the people in a particular local area.  I do not think the Minister is being entirely honest in his mind about it&mdash;I am not accusing him of deliberate dishonesty.  However, a very great majority of county councils have, in a perfectly friendly and normal manner, consulted with the county manager in regard to the planning of their housing schemes.</P>

They have consulted with the county managers on the rate on which that work should be done and on the number and order and priority of sewerage and water schemes to be carried out.  They have been doing that constantly.  I have been assured by the chairman of at least three county councils that they have gone into the utmost detail in regard to these matters.  They have not simply moved the rate that includes the county council contribution to the construction of a housing scheme, which includes the subsidy to enable an economic rent to be paid by the new tenants.  When the Minister moves Section 32 of this Bill he is moving a section which contains, as I have said, a great many functions which were clearly already within the competence of the local authority concerned. I should like to recall to the mind of the Minister two or three directives which were sent by the <Col N="1459" /> former Minister for Local Government, making it absolutely clear to county councils that they had these executive functions and that they could exercise them.  The Minister may reply that within, perhaps, the narrow strictness of the law they were in fact functions of the county manager and that what he wants to do is to make clear in law what already was the practice.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, however, in connection with large sections of the County Management Act, as time went on and as the emergency with all its difficulties diminished, more and more county councils tended to co-operate in a friendly way with the county manager with regard to these matters. I am aware that there are some executive functions which are now to be definitely performed by county councils as a whole about which there may have been some doubt; there may be others which were definitely matters for the county manager before and are now matters for the county councils and I do think that the Minister should, at least, in the course of this very friendly debate we are having have the courtesy to admit that many functions are now being carried out by the county councils although the law may not be entirely strict and precise with regard to that matter.  I do know definitely, in the case of Wexford County Council, that not a brick was put in place for the last five years since the end of the war which the members of the county council had not an intimate part in planning, designing and arranging with the county manager.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister has tried to be honest in the matter&mdash;he has been honest; but certainly members of his Party have gone around the country as though a régime of slavery were ended and that these matters were the concern of dictatorial county managers. That is nonsense and the Minister knows it is nonsense.  As we are having a very friendly debate the Minister might admit that the application of Section 32 is now making legally watertight a condition that had grown up in regard to these principal functions.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy were to <Col N="1460" /> leave the question of honesty and dishonesty out we could discuss this matter on a much more reasonable basis.  I have never either in public or private claimed more for the Bill than it actually is, and I do not know that other Deputies on this side of the House have done that or suggested that the County Management Act was to be destroyed.  I do suggest that the conditions described by the Deputy will continue in much the same way with just one reversal.  County councils and county managers have planned together in a wise way and have discussed housing schemes, sites, the number of houses to go into a scheme and all such matters, and they will continue to do so now.  The services of the county officer will not be taken away from the county council; the council will have at their disposal the services of the county officer, the engineers and the staff with whom at present they plan those matters, but they are now an executive function and the council are the people responsible. By all means they will consult the county officer as otherwise they could not carry on.  I suggest that the county manager did not do all the work; he had to have consultants, treasurers and engineers, and they consulted with the council.  The same consultations will take place except that whereas the county manager was the boss hitherto, the county council will now be the boss.  They will have the services of those officials to help them to plan competent comprehensive housing and drainage schemes.  I do not see why Deputy Childers should dread that these conditions will be altered; I do not see any reason for thinking that.  I do not attribute dishonest motives to Deputy Childers and I hope that he does not attribute dishonest motives to me.  I hope for nothing except what is witnin the four corners of the Bill.  I have nothing against the county managers and never said that I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County managers are very efficient and they will be so under their new title.  In the old days when we had neither county mangers nor county officers but county secretaries, houses were built and schemes of work were <Col N="1461" /> carried out with perfect consultation between the elected representatives and their officers and the same thing will happen under the terms of the Bill.  It will produce not conflict or friction, I hope, but a harmonious atmosphere in which to carry out the work.  The trained officers will be at the disposal of the elected representatives who have these executive functions to carry out with the aid of the county manager and his staff.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a very satisfactory statement but I must repeat that the Minister has said something which we have been longing to hear for a considerable time.  I can assure him that other members of his Party spoke in a very different vein and tried to give the people the idea that there was a state of virtual tyranny and that the members of county councils were not able to exercise proper authority except under that section of the County Management Act by which they could direct the county manager to do a thing in a certain way.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I could speak on this section of the Bill or on Section 34, but I think I had better raise my point here because it is one of the utmost importance and I can raise it again on Section 34. Now that we have agreed that most county councils have done valuable planning and consultative work with the county managers before and will now undertake all executive functions, the Minister so far has never given us any information on the timing of this whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among a great many people who have been chairmen or members of the county councils there is the feeling that unless county councils delegate a great many executive functions to the county officers they will become civil servants rather than members of a legislative authority and that the effect of that would be that in certain areas where the tradition may not be so good as in others you will get a sort <Col N="1462" /> of professional politician, the member of the county council who will spend a very considerable number of days in the year carryiug out executive functions and doing work which really is of an administrative character.  In other words, Section 32 is extremely vague.  It may perhaps have to be vague; it would be very difficult to frame it otherwise, but you can divide Section 32 and divide the implications of Section 32 into two categories: a sort of executive function related to planning and an executive function related to everyday supervision of the work of the county officer in so far as that is related to executive functions. The Minister has never yet told us anything very much about how often he expects these various committees to meet.  The executive committee is now the council, all the members of the county council, 21 or 26 or whatever number there is.  In the case of Cork there will be 48.  He has given us no lead as to what he expects people to do. Does he intend to send some directions or suggestions as was done for example in connection with differential renting? Is he going to give directions?  Is he going to give an approximate idea of how much planning work county councils are going to do and how much administrative work which is definitely implied by Section 32?  This will arise again on Section 34, and I have put down an amendment in which I have attempted to clarify the issue.  I see beside me Deputy Allen who has had experience of county council work while I have had experience only of supervising them.  It is possible to conceive certain county councils, unless they get the right tradiiion with regard to this matter, sitting once or twice a week while some members come in every day.  The Minister has not given a lead up to now; he has simply lumped together &ldquo;executive functions&rdquo;. Unless county councils are given some idea of how they should proceed many members will become professional politicians with nothing else to do but attend meetings, claim their expenses and then go home.  The Minister should give us some clue as to how he intends this to operate, some idea of the way these executive functions are to be performed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say anything which would make this very amicable debate in any way highly controversial; but I think I must take exception to the statement made by the Minister that, under this Bill, the relative positions of the county officer &mdash;the county manager as he is now, and the county officer as, I suppose, he will be&mdash;and the elected body will be reversed.  In the course of his statement the Minister said this Bill would make the elected body the boss of the show.  He did not use that exact phrase, but that was what he implied and, whereas, under the existing condition of things, under the County Management Act, he suggested the county manager was boss of the show.  I take very strong exception to that, because there is full documentary evidence, apart altogether from the Act, in the letters which were issued from the Department of Local Government and in the various admonitions conveyed to individual county managers, that they were never bosses of the show; that the final authority always rested in the elected body.</P>
      <P>I know Deputies, like Deputy O'Leary and others, have tried to prejudice the whole position by implying that, because of their incompetence and their inability to hold their own, to maintain their own position and exercise their own responsibilities <i>vis-a-vis</i> the manager, the manager has been the boss.  That is not so, as I have said many times, and as the terms of the Act prove, and as these circular letters issued from time to time by the Department of Local Government, in order to clarify the position&mdash;not so much to clarify the position as to make the members of the county councils aware of what the real position is&mdash;indicate.  There is no truth in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the County Management Act, the elected body is the supreme authority; it is the body which provides the money, the body which passes the final plans.  There are only one or two matters in which it could not interfere, and practically every one of these matters has been carried over into this County Administration <Col N="1464" /> Bill.  They could not deal with the question of employment, with staffs, with tenancies, and they could not deal with the granting of public assistance. One of the difficulties in the Bill is that the administration of public assistance will be made subject to the control&mdash;and not merely to the control, but to the administration&mdash;of the whole of the public assistance authority.</P>
    <P>Having taken exception to that portion of the Minister's remarks, I should like to come to the section itself. Whatever may be the intention of the Minister when he brought in this Bill, quite frankly I may say that to allocate specific functions to a section of the county council is a good idea.  I know a great many of my colleagues on these benches do not agree with me, but I certainly thought that, having regard to the complexity and extent of the activities of county councils, it would be quite a good idea to have placed on a particular section of the county council responsibility for the supervision of one particular field of the county council's activities, and to leave to the special supervision of another section of the county council another particular field or range of the county council's activities.</P>
    <P>I think that is the way in which we can ultimately get these things working and, bearing in mind that we have now separate Government Departments administering what might be described as formerly the particular business of local authorities&mdash;rates, public lighting, housing and so on&mdash; that we have another Department now in control of what were formerly the public health and health functions of the local authority, and that we have still a third Department in control of the public assistance functions of the local authority, I think it will be found in actual practice, when these Departments get functioning according to their own particular line, that it would be a good thing&mdash;almost essential&mdash;to have the general body of the council divided up in the way in which the Minister first proposed.  However, that is abandoned and we are now in the position in which all the executive functions of the council are to be performed <Col N="1465" /> by the general committee of the council, which means the whole body of the council.</P>
    <P>I think two difficulties will arise there.  First of all, we have no specific definition in the Bill of what the executive functions of the council are.  They are defined by exclusion and we do not know, therefore, what residual function is left by this definition of exclusion.  I think it is beyond the power of man to state specifically what are the executive functions of the council.  Neither the angels in Heaven above nor the demons under the sea could possibly state in specific terms what are the executive functions of the council of a county under the Bill as it stands.  Of course, there is bound to be, by reason of the way in which this problem has been approached, at every meeting of the county council where this question of reserved functions arises, if it arises in any acute form, a very great difference of opinion between the county officer, on the one hand, and some members of the county council on the other, as to what, in fact, are the executive functions of the county council.  Whenever a grave issue, a big issue, arises, in which any difference emerges as between some members&mdash;it need not necessarily be all&mdash;and the county officer as to whether or not a particular act is an executive function, you will have a condition of crisis created for which the Bill offers no means of solution.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now subject to a consciousness of the fact that my memory may betray me, but I do not think there is in this Bill any provision for resolving a difference of opinion, if it should arise, between the executive committee of the council, on the one hand, and the county officer, on the other, as to whether or not a specific thing, which it is proposed to do, is an executive function.  I suggest that the Minister might, perhaps, address himself to that.  It can be solved very simply by saying that where there is a difference of opinion in this matter the Minister for Local Government may decide.  That might not be acceptable to everybody, but at least it is a precaution.  It is a precaution that, I think should be taken if the position as I visualise it should arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Let us think of it from another point of view.  I was saying that I thought the Minister was on the right lines when he decided that membership of the council should be divided, roughly, into three, that one-third of the membership should have particular responsibility for what might be described as the ordinary functions of the county council, that another one-third should be responsible for general supervision and conduct of the health functions of the county council and that the remaining one-third, which is not involved either in the immediate work of the general executive committee or the immediate work of the health committee, should stand, more or less, apart and, like the Minister for Finance in a Government, exercise a general supervision over them all, watching to make sure that they were not spending too much money and were not spending it foolishly.  The fact that the council was divided into these three committees did not in any way oust the power of the council meeting as a whote to override any decision taken by either of these committees or, indeed, compel the third, which would be composed of critics, who always perform a very useful function in any assembly, or override the expressions of criticism.</P>
    <P>However, all that is gone by the board and now we have the council in this situation, that the general executive committee of the council which, under the Minister's original proposal was to consist only of one-third of the members, is now to consist of all the members of the county council and, similarly, the health committee, which was also to consist only of one-third of the members, is again to consist of the whole body of members.</P>
    <P>Let me get back to the point that I made at the outset, that the executive functions are very ill-defined, are defined by exclusion, that, undoubtedly, differences of opinion will arise as between the county officer on the one hand, who carries a great responsibility under the Act, and the general body of the council on the other hand, as to whether or not a specific thing is <Col N="1467" /> an executive function.  How will it be resolved?  It will be resolved by a body like, say, the Cork County Council, where, if my recollection is correct, the membership is 48.  I am not sure that it may not even be 64.  These differences of opinion will be solemnly resolved by a council at an assembly which will have the proportions of public meeting.  Can anybody conceive that, with 48 members solemnly discussing, say, a point of vital difference between themselves as a whole and the county officer on the other hand, any solution will possibly be reached on a difference of opinion of that sort?</P>
    <P>Then again, leaving this perhaps rather exceptional case out of it, let us come back to the other aspect of it. Supposing there is a housing scheme, or a sanitary service scheme or important road works to be carried out, and again differences of opinion emerge, as undoubtedly they will emerge wherever these questions come before an assembly of the size, say, of the Cork County Council or an assembly even of the size of the Longford County Council, who will come to a conclusion as to what is the proper decision to be taken, what is the proper line of execution? Is not it clear that you will have prolonged debates on many of these matters and that, in fact, instead of expediting business of the council and getting something done for the people and getting value for the ratepayers, you will have delay after delay until they become interminable?</P>
    <P>That is why I think that in this Bill the grave, glaring defect is this question of making the exercise of executive functions a matter for the county council as a whole.  It was bad enough and, while I would have been in favour of having the sub-division of the council in committees, I should never have allowed the executive functions to be vested in any particular section of the county council because I do not think that, in the circumstances as they exist to-day, with the pressing demands that are made upon county councils, with the multitude of affairs that they have now to contend with, they would be ever able to become efficient and expeditious <Col N="1468" /> executive bodies.  We are on what I regard as one of the most glaring defects in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the possible difficulties that Deputy MacEntee points out and these difficulties will undoubtedly arise if the councillors generally are not reasonable persons. I am not a bit frightened about the 48 members of a council.  There are many other bodies meeting, working, discussing and doing very valuable and difficult work.  I have had quite a long experience, as a number of Deputies have had, of being a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association, being a council member on many councils of that body and there were often as many as 50 persons at council meetings where there was very serious, contentious work to be done, and, with a measure of goodwill, that work was done efficiently in all the councils. There are many other voluntary bodies, sports organisations and otherwise, that meet to carry out duties and the size of the body does not in the long run militate against efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You may find a long-winded individual anxious to make a long speech which will be reported in the local Press but, after a while, his comrade councillors will be able to reduce the length of his speech by a few acid comments.  In some councils the work will be done without discord and will be done efficiently.  In other councils there will be hold-ups.  There is no doubt about that, but there would be some measure of delay whether the county manager had the responsibilities that he had under the old Acts or not.  There are a few county councils that are notorious for not doing anything and, it does not matter what suggestion is put up, there is always somebody who has an objection to it and the matter is debated for a long period.  We have seen that in connection, say, with the erection of county hospitals here and there, and probably in connection with the erection of houses.  We have seen the great trouble there is over sites and places where hospitals and houses are to be built.  You will have these things.  There are one or two individuals <Col N="1469" /> in each council who cause trouble of this kind, but in the long run the people themselves solve the difficulty by electing better councillors.</P>
    <P>Since I came to this House I have seen many questions on the Order Paper and heard many answers about hospitals in particular places.  The ball has been thrown between the Department and the local authority in regard to these questions.  Reading the local papers of that particular area, one, will find that the hold-up has been due entirely to the local council.  If the same position arose in another area in the same county, or even in another connty, it would present no difficulty at all.  I think it would be wrong to condemn the new system visualised in this Bill simply because in some particular councils&mdash; one or two throughout the length and breadth of the country&mdash;there may be a hold-up due to councillors who have too much to say.  I said before on this Bill that the principle that is set out in it will have to be put into operation and that after three or five years of experience it may be that defects may be found in the working of it and these defects will have to be corrected by legislation.  We cannot avoid that. Local government is like anything else. It is not static; it is moving.  One of the problems is whether we are moving forward or backwards.  I think there could be a good argument on that.  Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Childers may hold that we are moving backwards instead of forwards, but we can only test that out by practical experience of the working of the machinery envisaged in this Bill. The principle is there and it will be up to the county councillors to make a success of it.</P>
    <P>From my own experience here in Dnblin, which of course is different from experience in the country, I would say that the success of the Dnblin administration is due to the fact that we have a county manager who never endeavours to exercise himself any of the functions given to him by statute against the will of the council.  Any problem that arises which may be difficult, whether it is concerned <Col N="1470" /> with the managerial functions or not, he refers to the council or to one of the committees of the council for their recommendation and for their viewpoint.  I think the Minister will agree that that probably happens in a number of councils all over the country.  I think Deputy Childers did make the point that, notwithstanding what was written into the County Management Act, there was the greatest co-operation between managers and the local councils but that in some areas there was not that co-operation. There was too much standing on ceremony or standing on rights. That is one of the reasons why it has been necessary to bring in this Bill to give back to local authorities the responsibility of which they were deprived under the County Management Act.  The question as to which system is right or whether the system proposed in this Bill will be a good system, will have to be tested in the crucible of experience and I think every Deputy is anxious that it should be so tested.  If serious defects should show themselves, the House would not be slow in making such amendments as may be necessary to correct an unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan has stated that this Bill will have to be tested in the crucible of experience.  A crucible is, I suppose, a sort of bowl for holding molten metal.  I must say that if the Minister in introducing this Bill was looking for a means of crucifying members of local authorities he certainly found a very good means by giving them these executive functions. When the County Management Act first came into operation and for some time afterwards, members of councils, especially persons who were members of local authorities prior to the coming into operation of the Act, had the feeling that much of the power they needed as county councillors had been taken from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As time went on, however, I would say that almost all members of local authorities found that they had sufficient powers and sufficient functions fully to interest them in the working of the council.  The Minister's Party before this Bill was drafted had been <Col N="1471" /> talking very loudly about the rights taken from local authorities and in drafting this Bill he drafted it with the idea in his mind that members of these councils were burning with a desire to get back something that had been filched from them and he set out to give them back these functions.  He will find, however, when this Bill comes into operation that the councillors to whom he has given these executive functions will not be a bit thankful for them.  In the average-sized county, members have to travel as much as 40 miles to attend a meeting and in counties such as Cork they may have to travel up to 100 miles.</P>
    <P>Taking it all in all, some members will have to travel distances of anything from 20 to 100 miles to come to a meeting to perform functions of a very minor character.  There is no question that many of these functions will be found to be of a minor character and I think it is hardly desirable in the year of grace, l951, that busy people who have to earn their livelihood, should be asked to travel such long distances to attend to duties of such a minor character, because of the fact that they were sufficiently public spirited to offer themselves to the electorate as members of local authorities. I think it unfair that the Minister should ask councils to perform these executive functions.  He has already taken from them and reserved to the county officer all the employment functions, all the tenancy functions and certain of the more important functions connected with finance and health matters.  What are left will have little effect on the finances of the county. The functions that are left will not affect the finances of the county to the extent of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>A local authority may consider tenders under this as an executive function, but there is already power under the County Management Act governing the taking of tenders and the making of regulations for opening them.  The fact, however, is that very few councils made such regulations.  They were quite satisfied to allow the county manager to do that.  He would take the tenders and report to the council <Col N="1472" /> as to what the tender prices might be, etc.  This proposal in the Bill will clog the whole machinery of local government. It will mean that only members of a local authority who have nothing else to do, who have no employment, or who may have retired, will have the time to spend hours dealing with these matters.  It will probably mean a weekly meeting of the council.  In fact, it may mean bi-weekly meetings, such as we used to have years ago when we had the old boards of health.  I should say that 98 per cent. of the elected representatives on local authorities are very busy people.  They have to make a living as well as being members of a local body.  I suggest it is very unfair that they should have to be called together so often to deal with these matters.  The county officer will be hamstrung and will not be able to carry out the ordinary day-to-day business of the council.</P>
    <P>I am just wondering whether the Minister gave serious consideration to this section before he inserted it in the Bill.  It is a section, if you like, which the Minister can call the key section, giving back all those wonderful democratic powers to the council about which we have heard so much nonsense talked.  It is not giving back any democratic powers to the council. The councils had full democratic powers under the County Management Act.  They will be sorry when they hear that these powers are to be given back to them.  I think the Minister should reconsider this whole matter. He has not defined the particular matters which are to be executive functions of the council.  I think there should be a provision enabling him to make regulations in that regard.</P>

I think it will be found in the future that the operation of this section will cause friction between the county officer and the council.  I think this section is going to lead to great waste of time, so far as the members of the council are concerned.  As I said earlier, nobody except a retired person can afford to give all the time required of him as a member of a local authority in the performance of these functions.</P>

      <P>When people went forward at the last local elections they were anxious that they should get some powers back.  The Minister in this section is giving back certain powers to the councils and some authority to the elected representatives to speak for the people whom they represent.  I have before me a cutting relating to a circular which was sent out by Deputy MacEntee when he was Minister in 1947.  It concerned an appointment that was to be made by the Wexford County Council.  Deputy Allen knows about it.  The circular stated that no permanent appointment was to be made, but only a temporary one.  At that particular time, a member of the county council retired.  He was appointed to the position, even though the job was never advertised.  When I raised the matter I was told that it was an executive function of the manager's.</P>

      <P>You are reading it the wrong way.  It is just like what you are saying outside.  Deputy MacEntee cannot agree, of course, with any change in the County Management Act.  We cannot expect members of the Fianna Fáil Party who put the Act through this House to agree now to a change, any more than to a change of Government.  The people who elected the representatives on the various councils want these representatives to have a say in administration. It was a shocking state of affairs to see 21 men coming to a meeting of a council of which Deputy Allen was chairman for years and when they wanted to do a certain thing, to hear the county manager saying: &ldquo;That is my executive function.&rdquo;  We are trying to change all that now by setting up committees to go into the circumstances of cases.  Deputy MacEntee said we can strike the rate.  We strike the rate, but we cannot challenge the county manager as to how he will spend the money.</P>

      <P>At present you have a county manager dictator over a council of 21 members.  He has the superior power and the councillors have no function in the matter.  This section will give us some power back again and take executive functions out of his hands.  Deputy Brennan knows that the same thing applies in Wicklow County Council and in every county council.  I certainly believe that the Minister should give us our full powers back.  I will not be satisfied while we have a county officer in <Col N="1478" /> charge.  Local administration was carried on in the old days by people who gave their time voluntarily.  They got no payment for doing the business. It is only right that members of local authorities should have some say in the matter.  One of the ten points in our programme was to give power back to the local representatives of the people. We want to see it given to them.  The committees which are to be set up will do good work.  No county manager is working for nothing.  In my county the ratepayers are paying £1,000 a year to a county manager and £100 a year expenses for attending meetings.  That work could be better done by members of the council who understand the position in different parts of Wexford. If a road worker is unjustly dismissed they will hear his case and give him a fair trial.  Under the County Management Act the members had no say in the matter.  They had no say in regard to the letting of a cottage.</P>

If he does not do that, I can tell him that he will have very few people presenting themselves at the next local elections, because people at the moment are very dissatisfied that the county managers are there still.  They say: &ldquo;We thought the Govennment were going to do away with county managers.&rdquo;  I hope this is the first step and that we will be given back some further powers. If the Minister does that, I will be with him all the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can probably express an opinion on this matter front an angle different from that of Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Allen and, to a certain extent, Deputy O'Leary, as I became a member of a local authority after the County Managemeait Act was passed.  Whatever powers members of local authorities held previous to the introduction of that Act, I did not feel the loss of them because I never had those powers.  Because of that I think I can express an honest opinion on this matter.  The point I see about this is-that, whatever these executive functions may eventually turn out to be, they are bound to increase the work of a council.  So far as the particular council of which I am a member is concerned, there is not a single council meeting at which we do not put in at least six or six-and-a-half hours dealing with the matters raised on the agenda.  Now if minor matters, such as those to which Deputy Allen has referred, which may arise under these executive functions are to be discussed &mdash;matters that can be and have been more suitably dealt with by the county manager or, in future, the county officer&mdash;I can visualise a position when the particular council to which I belong will not be able to carry out the work of administering the affairs of the council in one day.  We will require at least two days.  In fact, I might point out that often in the past we have had to finish our meeting without dealing with all the matters on the agenda for the day, and we have subsequently had to hold a special meeting to deal with the items left over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should leave the position as it is at the moment.  If a matter arises, such as that referred to by Deputy O'Leary, where a man makes a complaint about not getting work on the roads and that matter is referred to the council, the position will be quite hopeless.  As things are, if a councillor raises a particular matter at a council meeting, the matter is discussed there and things are quite amicably adjusted as often as not. Indeed, there may be no necessity to bring the particular matter before the council at all: all the councillor need do is approach the county manager, the <Col N="1480" /> county secretary or the county engineer in order to have the matter in which he is interested rectified.  The position should be left as it is and no further work should be thrown on the shoulders of the members of the council.  Extra work will inevitably entail more time on their part and eventually the day might come when representatives might be averse to putting themselves forward for election simply and solely because they are unable to devote the necessary time to carrying out the functions embodied in this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, therefore, to reconsider this matter.  I believe that the position obtaining at the moment is fairer and more equitable all sound.  If any grievances are put forward by any member of the council I represent at the moment on behalf of a particular individual that member always gets a hearing.  The matter is almost invariably rectified if the grievance is a genuine one.</P>
    <P>I do not see what Deputy O'Leary hopes to gain by having this section put through.  The minor matters that I visualise being thrown upon the shoulders of members under this are matters that could be more easily dealt with in the normal course by the county officer or the particular officer dealing with the particular department of the county council involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the case made by Deputy Captain Cowan I am very much afraid that he has an outsider's point of view.  He looks on from a distance. He criticises the work of local <Col N="1481" /> councils.  He is not alone in doing that here.  I have heard Deputies who happen to be members of the Dublin Corporation putting forward here time and time again the point of view that a wonderful democratic spirit exits in the Dublin Corporation in contrast to the autocracy of the county councils throughout the country.  That is absolutely wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Captain Cowan referred in particular to hospitalisation and housing. No matter how controversial in spirit councils may be and no matter how much they may argue, that does not hold up for one moment proper hospitalisation or proper housing.  The very fact that there are good managers in the counties of which I have personal knowledge and experience has speeded up housing and hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>In answering the point put forward by Deputy O'Leary, wherever a council puts up a good case to the manager, the manager has always yielded. Political barriers cease to exist where there is a good case.  Political barriers will never exist where managers exceed their powers or tend to do something unjust.  The giving of certain powers and functions at present in the hands of managers to county councils and the making of the whole council into a committee will, in my opinion, lead to a very unsatisfactory position.  Those of us who are familiar with county council procedure know what happens on the day of a council meeting.  The chief engineer is there; the officer dealing with health is there; the officer dealing with housing is there; the county secretary is there and another officer whose functions I cannot at the moment recall.  Their time is occupied for the whole day. They are not all the time engaged in discussion with the council, but they must be on the spot in case something arises concerning their departments. Those officers are there once a month &mdash;12 times in the year.  If this proposal is adopted they will be there every week in future.  Progress in housing and hospitalisation will be retarded as will also the other functions of the county councils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this matter on the Report Stage.  I think this would be a retrograde step on his part, even looking at it from his point of view.  He has already agreed to amandments allowing the whole council to constitute the committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on the section falls practically under two heads; one is that the powers given in the section are unnecessary, as the local authority already have all the powers they want under the old Management Act.  Deputy MacEntee pressed that he had documentary evidence that the elected people were the boss.  That would be in direct contradiction of what the elected members say throughout the country.  It is a matter of opinion.  I was a member of an elected body myself and I was aware of Deputy MacEntee, who was then Minister, having sent circulars to managers telling them that they ought to use their powers with discretion and that they should work in harmony.  That was an indication which made it perfectly clear that they had the powers. I do not know how he can suggest here that he has documentary evidence that the elected representatives were the boss.  They were not the boss and everyone knows that.  The managers had their powers and they were to use them with discretion and work in harmony and in conjunction with the elected representatives.  It is one thing to have power of that kind, formal powers and goodwill, but the managers' goodwill is distinct from the legal powers given to the elected representatives in this measure.  There is a very distinct difference.  It looks as if some people were half afraid to trust the elected representatives with those powers.  The manager was asked to take them into his confidence, but there seems to have been some fear that if the powers were given to the elected representatives they would be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary complains that there are not enough powers given to them, that people will not come up for election on that account.  Deputy Brennan was afraid they were getting overloaded and that they would not <Col N="1483" /> come up for election on the very same point but for the reverse reason.</P>
    <P>In the earlier stages of the Bill complaint was made from the opposite side and this Bill was described as a whole lot of hypocrisy.  It was said that really no powers were being given back at all, that it was just changing the label on, the bottle, changing the name. Now it seems as if we are giving too much back.</P>
    <P>The next objection was that we are not clearly defining what is being given back.  There is no definition of executive powers in this Bill, but I suggest there was no definition of managerial powers in the County Management Act, except by exclusion.  The executive powers are clearly shown.  The executive functions of the council are half the executive functions set out and after the three functions given to the officer every other function is an executive function.  How is there anything misleading in that?  The manager himself decides on tenancy, health and employment.  The scheduled functions of the council are clearly set out, which they cannot delegate to anyone except themselves.  Everything outside that is an executive function, to be dealt with by the council as an executive function.</P>
    <P>The question of travelling has been raised.  I do not think there is a terrible fear that the overlapping will be as grave as is suggested.  Deputy Allen suggested there may be travel from 20 to 100 miles dealing with minor matters.  You would not consider contracts a minor matter.  For many questions, the correspondence and preliminary investigation will still be done by the officer.  You do not bring the council together to deal with a letter. In Section 36 you will find it stated that the officer will prepare drafts for the executive committees.  I do not see why the committee could not function quite as speedily.  These bogies have been raised because those opposite wanted to put them up.  Section 36 says&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the county officer shall at meeting of an executive authority <Col N="1484" /> submit to them drafts of executive orders relating to the executive functions performable by them, and every such order shall be deemed to have been duly proposed and seconded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is one council which is a big one, Cork, about 46 members, but the other councils range from 20 to 30 and are not terribly large.  There is separate treatment in the case of Cork, as they have separate health areas.  That is the only big council in the country. As a matter of fact, I would have preferred the third, as I thought it would be better, and let them act in rotation. However, that did not meet with approval here.  The committee of 21 or 25 will be a health committee and the same people will be on the general committee.  They are clearly apart. They may deal with health on one particular day and do general purposes on another day, or do both on one day if they can.  I do not think they will be cluttered up with minor matters, as is suggested.  These will be dealt with by the officers and buought to the notice of the executive committee by the officer dealing with the point._</P>
    <P>The general charge that there is no definition of the powers is unsupported. I do not know how Deputy MacEntee contends to make that assertion.  As is clearly set out and as read by Deputy Allen, the three functions are set down for the officers, the other functions, reserved for the council as a whole, the scheduled functions and then everything else is an executive function.  That was a clearer definition than was given of the managerial powers.  I do not think there is anything in that point which is really sustainable.</P>

      <P>The Minister quite unwittingly has shown us the dangers inherent in this method of procedure. The executive functions in Section 27 are defined as the functions of the council other than scheduled functions, employment functions, tenancy functions, and individual health functions. Supposing an important letter is written to the Department of Local Government relating to a request for sanction for a proposed road work or to discuss the question of a grant or <Col N="1485" /> the amount of a grant or the conditions under which it would be given, is that an executive function or not?</P>

      <P>It is a function.  You cannot write a letter without performing a function.  Some people will say it is not a function, but what is it if it is not a function?  It is not really an individual health function; it is not really an employment function or a tenancy function.  It has relation to public works, to the construction of a road, or maybe to the conditions upon which a grant will be given for housing. You cannot say it is an act; it is a function.  What type of function is it?  That only shows the difficulties that would arise.  If it is a letter which gives rise to contention on the council which some sections contend should not have been written by the officer who wrote it, the question will immediately arise, by reason of the method of approach which is inherent in the Bill, whether that is a function or not.  If you write a letter you function, you act and you function.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was dealing with a few things concerning the office of the Minister for Agriculture. I was trying to impress upon the Minister the seriousness of the position in certain parts of the country by reason of the fact that there has been a certain degree of mortality in cattle especially in the poor areas where the farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Kissane said this in English last night and he said it in Irish at 6 o'clock this evening.  How often is he going to repeat himself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the daily paper, the Deputy did discuss the mortality of cattle in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I did refer to it last night, but, unfortunately, during the course of my remarks, there were so many interruptions from the opposite side that I found it difficult to put my point of view before the Minister.  I now seek to do that in as brief a discourse as I can.  The Minister seems to cast a doubt on what I said.  He also doubted the accuracy of Deputy Moran's statement in the House as regards this mortality in cattle.  I have seen the Press report in to-day's papers and I would like to correct what I have seen.  The report stated that I said in the House that cattle were dying by the hundreds.  I made no such statement. I said that cattle were dying here and there.  I say now that it is incumbent on the Minister to make inquiries through his departmental inspectors to find out for himself and satisfy himself as to what the position really is.  I consider that in the case of small farmers, who have only, say, six, eight or ten milch cows and have lost two or three of them or maybe more and, perhaps, some young cattle, it would be very difficult for them to replace their herds without getting some financial assistance from the <Col N="1488" /> Minister and his Department.  The way in which the Minister will come to their aid is a matter for himself and the Department to decide.</P>
      <P>I suggested to him, and other Deputies have also suggested, that some action similar to that taken by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947 might be taken and loans made available free of interest to these farmers to enable them to replace their herds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that cattle need not be allowed to die for the sake of 30/-, which is the price of 1 cwt. of maize, but where several cattle have died and where the others have to be fed over a period, it is a serious matter.  I also said last night that the farmers in my part of the country had been finding it very difficult to procure anything like sufficient hay for their cattle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was reported in the Press as saying that there had been something like a near stampede at the fairs.  I did not say &ldquo;at the fairs&rdquo;; I said at the markets, because hay is not sold at the fairs in my part of the country.</P>
      <P>I touched on the subject of the price of milk last night, but I submit I did not discuss it at any great lenath.  I suggested, as I suggest now, that the Minister, in his handling of the Milk Suppliers' Association, did not behave in the proper manner and that his branding of the Milk Suppliers' Association as political racketeers was nothing but a smokescreen&mdash;that is the word I used&mdash;behind which to hide so that he would not have to increase the price of milk to farmers who deliver milk to creameries.  I also pointed out that those Deputies who had spoken of an increase of ld. per gallon in the price of milk were in error.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy <Col N="1489" /> on his own admission not repeating what he said last night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point in connection with it which I want to mention and which I did not mention last night.  In my opinion the increase of 2d. per lb. which the Minister has put on the price of butter, plus the amount he is raking in in respect of butter sold off the ration would more than finance an increase of 2d. per gallon in the price of milk. Therefore, from this whole transaction, the Minister and the Government are actualty making a profit, and it is very hard to understand why they should have recourse to this juggling system when we consider the amount of money they are spending in other ways.  They are spending at present roughly £2,000,000 per week, and it is extraordinars that, out of that sum, they could not find money to increase the price of milk in any other way than the imposition of 2d. per lb. on the price of butter.  This impost, as I have said, will cause hardship to many people throughout the country.  Even as the position was before the price was raised, many householders with large families found it difficult to provide butter for their families, not to speak of putting an additional impost of 2d. on the price.  However, I do not intend to travel back again on that road.</P>
      <P>One matter which has been mentioned in the House before is the average yield of wheat per acre.  The Minister in his opening statement tried to impress upon us that we were getting a greater average yield per acre now from a lesser acreage than we were getting in other years from a greater acreage, but the Minister was careful to select the zero year of the Fianna Fáil régime, 1947.  That year is always chosen by Ministers of this Government when referring to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember, when the Vote on Account was under discussion, the Minister for Finance, in replying to the debate, mentioned this question of wheat yield and he, too, was very careful to select 1947 as the year for comparison. I notice also that Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the same year here last evening.  I consider that of no use whatever.  In fact, it is worse. It is, in my opinion, dishonest to select one year like that&mdash;one abnormal year. &mdash;as a basis for comparison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <P>Would it not better to get the figures for the various years? I hope to be able to satisfy Deputy Collins with the figures.  I remember that when I asked the Minister for Finance, on the occasion of his winding up the debate on the Vote on Account, to give us the figures for, say, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945&mdash;no&mdash;he said he had not the figures by him.  He did not want to have them, of course.  He did not want to get them.  But he got the figures for 1947.  It would be much better, in my opinion, to find out what the yield was over a number of years, and here are the figures.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation.  I asked that question With a view to ascertaining accurately the yield per acre over the entire period in question.  I received the reply from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  I assumed that the figures which were supplied were the correct figures of the yield per acre.  Does the Minister now contend that the figures which were supplied to me in answer to the question which I asked are incorrect?</P>

      <P>This is an easily understandable misapprehension on the part of the Deputy.  He was not accustomed to statistics.  Every year there is made, by a variety of agricultural instructors, and so forth, an estimate of the yield per acre of given crops.  But, side by side with that, we receive the actual intake of native wheat into the mills That latter figure is a figure which is mathematically precise because we know to the bushel how much native wheat is taken in.  If we divide that figure by the total acreage, we get the quantity of wheat per acre delivered to the mill.  The other figure&mdash;the estimated yield&mdash;is, as the Deputy knows, largely dependent un the optimistic outlook of a farmer who does not like to admit that the yield of his crop has been relatively poor.  I ask each farmer: &ldquo;What did your wheat thresh out at?&rdquo; but the only test is what quantity of wheat reached the mill in respect of the total acreage of wheat grown in the country .</P>

Deputy Cogan put down this question to the Taoiseach and the Parliamentary Secretary gave the reply.  Therefore, I am entitled to put these figures before the House in order to show that what this Minister and the Minister for Finance and certain other Deputies on the Government Benches have been trying to impress upon us is not altogether correct&mdash; namely, that the yield per acre from wheat now is much greater than it was during the years when the Fianna Fáil Government were in office.</P>

      <P>Once again, it is a matter of regret to me that in approaching the Estimate for this Department the same Party spirit that has always animated the discussion is manifested on this occasion.  I think it is a pity that, in considering an Estimate of this size, the matter could not be approached objectively&mdash;without the contending Parties on either side of the House endeavonring to <Col N="1494" /> score points, one against the other. This is an Estimate for, roughly, £14,000,000.  Even though there is a reduction of about £1,000,000 compared with last year for this Department, the matter certainly gives grounds for serious consideration rather than for the scoring of points against one another.  In approaching it from that angle, the first question that occurs to my mind is: why is it necessary to spoon-feed the agricultural industry to the extent of £14,000,000 per annum? We hear until it becomes disgusting from every Deputy in the House and from every spokesman outside it that agriculture is our main industry.  If it is, why is it necessary to spoonfeed it?  If it is necessary to aid it from State funds to the extent of £14,000,000, it must be a tottering industry.  If it is, what is the cause? There is an Estimate for £7,000,000 for bread and flour subsidies; can that honestly be charged as an aid to agriculture? There is a further Estimate of, I think, £3,025,000 for dairy produce subsidies although the Minister has admitted in reply to a parliamentary question that it is not a subsidy to the producer of agricultural produce but to the consumer.  Why do those two figures amounting to over £10,000,000 appear in the Estimate of the Department of Agriculture?  Is that proper accounting?  Is it not a misrepresentation of the agricultural industry to put down £14,000,000 as a subsidy to it while it includes two amounts totalling over £10,000,000 which have absolutely no relation to aid to agriculture but are aids to the consumer of agricultural produce?  Even if those two figures are deducted, there still remains a considerable amount of money and one is entitled to ask why agriculture needs it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way we can approach the problem is by endeavouring to get down to bedrock.  We cannot discuss agriculture by itself but can only discuss it in relation to other things which either weigh upon it or aid it.  To get a full picture of the position of agriculture in relation to State economy one has to go back a long way.  The State first began to interfere in the <Col N="1495" /> lives of people during and subsequent to the 1914-18 war.  The State began then to regulate the national income and the personal income of its citizens. I do not know when the cost-of-living index, the agricultural prices index and so on were adopted, but I know that the basis taken was pre-1914.  To get a correct picture of the relationships of those figures I put a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach on the 29th November, 1950 (Volume 123, No. 9, column 1376-7).  The question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach if he will state what would have been the present index figure for the cost of living, cost of clothing and agricultural prices from their original base of 1914=100, if the present basic periods had not been introduced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In mid-August, 1950, the cost-of-living index (all items) is estimated to have been 319 and the index for the clothing group to have been 488 to the original base, July, 1914 =100.  The original base in the case of agricultural prices was 1911-12 =100, and to this base the index in September, 1950, is estimated at 288.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the price of clothing represents even approximately the price of all manufactured articles at mid-August last, why is there such a difference in the increase in it and in the price of agricultural produce?  Unfortunately, I could not get figures showing the relative increase in the cost of manufacturad articles.  I put a question to the Taoiseach on the matter and was told that there were no specific figures which could be used as a basis of comparison between pre-1914 and mid-August last for manufactured articles. However, from personal experience I think that the price of clothing is a fair indication of the rise in the cost of manufactured articles from their original basis.  If that is so one can see at a glance why agriculture has to be aided from State funds at the moment.  In further proof of this the volume of agricultural output in 1949 was only about the same as pre-1939 while the volume of industrial output had increased by 43 per cent. Furthermore, <Col N="1496" /> while the numbers in the agricultural industry were dwindling in 1949, the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that 22,000 more persons were employed in industry than had been the year before.  What is the cause of that?  Why has agriculture not progressed as well as industry? Why, when submitted to the one test of the efficiency of any industry, that is its employment of human beings, does agriculture continue to employ less and less while industry employs more and more?</P>

      <P>To illustrate my point as to the inequality of the increased income of those engaged in agriculture in comparison with other groups, let me quote portion of the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as he then was, on the Estimate for his Department last year.  It is to be found in Volume 121, No. 10, columns 1450 to 1451 of the Official Report of 7th June, 1950:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...this country is to-day enjoying the greatest and widest measure of protection for its industries than was ever afforded to them in the past.  I have given protection in greater measure to some industries that already had it.  I have given new protection to other industries. <Col N="1497" /> I have reduced quotas.  In some cases I have guaranteed almost the entire market to some of our principal industries, for example, the footwear industry.  I reduced that quota from 1,250,000 pairs to 40,000 pairs.</P>
    <P>I want to assert here&mdash;and again it will be accepted by Deputies if they are going to be honest, and there is no use in beating about the bush and in trying to deceive ourselves, much less the people&mdash;that in most cases, I do not say all cases, the increasing of protection leads to some extent, to a great extent or to a small extent, to an increase in the cost of the protected article.  There is no question about it.  I am making no apology for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit there is an explanation of the need for aids to agriculture.  The industries of the country, in an effort to build them up, have over the past 25 or 28 years got protection through tariffs against imports, and even quotas, so that the native products could command the price that they would not otherwise command if they had to face international competition. I do not complain of that.  It might appear from that, that I am opposed to the development of native industries. That is not the case.  I have always been a supporter of the products of native industry, and in pursuance of that I issue a challenge to the Minister or to any other interested person to come down to my farm and see if he can find anything there that is not the output of an Irish factory. It is the same with personal apparel. In so far as I can secure it, the same applies.  I have in that way given practical evidence of my support of native industry.</P>
    <P>The point I complain about&mdash;and it is borne out by a comparison of the figures relating to the increase in manufactured articles and the increase in agricultural prices, since the original cost of living figures and agricultural index figures were introduced&mdash; is the position that has directly resulted, whereby the manufacturing industries have fleeced and have, in effect, become parasites on, the agricultural industry.  The agricultural industry, by reason of the fact that it <Col N="1498" /> produces largely for export, must go out on the export market and face international competition.  In some instances, the farmers have had to face very heavy penal tariffs, so that no matter what it costs to produce the article, there was no control of the price.  The agricultural producers could not assert that it cost them a particular amount to produce the article, because then the individual would refuse to buy unless he got the article at least at as cheap a rate as what he could buy it for in any other country, with the result that the farming community suffer in that respect.  Having to buy the manufactured articles for the home and the farm in a market that, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, never enjoyed such a measure of protection as it does at the present time, the farmer has to pay artificially high prices for his requirements, whilst at the same time he has to go out with his produce on the foreign market and sell it at a price that bears no relation to the cost of production.</P>
    <P>We will be told, of course, that there is no obligation on the farmer to produce for export and that he could cut down his production.  Unfortunately, the farmer cannot suddenly change his economy.  Furthermore, by appeals and inducements, he has been encouraged to produce for export, so as to provide funds for the nation to pay for necessary imports, even though those necessary imports might not be very much used in the agricultural industry.  He was encouraged in that direction, largely by people who had no interest in agriculture beyond the fact that, being in a sheltered position themselves, they were glad to see somebody producing for the export market in order to get the funds necessary to buy other things.</P>
    <P>There was another point, that when the farmer was encouraged to produce large quantities for export and sell that produce at a very poor price, the home consumer then benefited, because he got the farm produce at the low price at which it had to be exported.  There was no protection for the farmer.  To give a case in point, as a result of the increased production of eggs, the nonproducers, <Col N="1499" /> as I said on another occasion, with their tongue in their cheek, are eating the twopenny egg, whereas they paid 3d. for an egg two years ago.  I can well understand why they cry out for increased agricultural production.  It is a great benefit to them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the export market in any respect is a benefit to the farmer, immediately, at the request of consumers and industrialists, the clamp is put down on the export of agricultural produce.  Take the case of bacon pigs, cattle hides and sheep pelts.  If the farmer were allowed to avail of the export market for bacon pigs, he could probably get 30 or 40 per cent. more than he is allowed to get on the home market.  He is pinned down to a price because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has declared that bacon must be sold at the price fixed in the price freeze Order of December last.  The first effect of that was that the farmer who had not his pigs ready to sell in that week got 25/- a cwt. less for them in the next week.  He was not fortunate enough to sell before the Minister for Industry and Commerce made that Order.  Even at the moment if farmers were allowed to export their pigs across the Border they could probably get £14 and upwards, whereas now they are getting around £10 10s. or £11 a cwt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it was £12 10s. before the price freeze Order was re-established.  These are the matters that weigh heavily on the agricultural industry.  These are the matters that bring about the condition that we have a dwindling population and a rush into industry, professions and business, particularly business in the City of Dublin, which has now become what might be called a monster in the body politic.  The fact that Dublin now contains nearly one-fourth of the population must be regarded as an unhealthy state of affairs and that situation has been brought about by the flight from the land.  Very few people <Col N="1500" /> have come into the country from outside, so that it must be the result of poor conditions and the poor income of those on the land that there is such a rush into the city, until it has become, a monster in the body politic.  On the farm, if you had an ass that had a head a quarter of the size of the whole animal it would be regarded as a monster. A city that contains one-quarter of the population of the country must be regarded as a monster.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would allow me to proceed.  I want my suggestions to be helpful and, if I fail, it will not be for want of trying.  We are at a disadvantage in the time at which this Estimate is taken this year in relation to other years.  It is about two months earlier. Usually the Estimate is taken in June or July.  This year it is being taken in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present rate of progress, it will most probably be July before it is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at a disadvantage. In introducing his Estimate in the last two years the Minister made the point that the best test of a policy was results, the best argument facts.  In pursuance of that idea, he quoted figures showing the increased production of live stock&mdash;cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, and so on, and byproducts, not only for the preceding year but for the early months of the year then under review.  Speaking from memory, I think last year he gave figures showing the increased milk and butter production up to the end of May and the increased export of eggs up to the beginning of June, and increases in other commodities.  It is significant that <Col N="1501" /> there is no mention of production in the early months of the present year. That is not possible, as we have not yet reached the month of May.  If the Estimate were taken at the same time as it was taken in other years, we could have had comparative figures.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to put over in other years that increased exports, increased production, and so on, tended to show that the farmer was very prosperous.  Why should the farmer increase production if it was not paying him well?  He said it was difficult to argue against that.  If we accept that as a criterion, how can we explain the present serious drop in production, particularly during the months from November up to the present?  Even at the risk of being called a pessimist, as I have been often called in this House, I say the worst is not yet.  The months of May and early June will be a still greater testing time.</P>
      <P>By way of parliamentary question, I have elicited the fact that butter production, since 1st November, has declined by roughly 28 per cent. compared with production in the same months last year.  When April and May come along I fear the position will be very much worse.  As a matter of fact, I understand that milk supplies to the creameries at the moment are only about 60 per cent. of what they were at this date last year, and probably the month of May will show an even greater discrepancy.</P>
      <P>The number of pigs reaching the factories, also, is down by about one-third, although the number of bacon pigs exported during 1950 was not very considerable.  According to a reply I got to a parliamentary question, I think it was only about 850, which would not materially affect the number of pigs going into the factories. I am quite prepared to admit that there was a considerable export of store pigs.  I have not the figures, of course.  Nevertheless, even taking into account the export of live pigs, it would not cover or nearly cover the reduction in the number of pigs reaching the bacon factories since 1st January compared with the figures for last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of eggs, the Minister has <Col N="1502" /> told us that exports are down by 60 per cent. in the first three months of this year, in comparison with the first three months of last year.  To continue still further on the export of eggs and their value, from a reply to a parliamentary question which I received yesterday, I find that the number of great hundreds of eggs exported in the months of January and February of the present year was 121,764 to a total value of £186,668; in 1950, for the same two months, the number of great hundreds exported was 300,292 to the value of £460,451; in 1949, the export in the same two months amounted to 431,150 great hundreds valued at £711,405, while the same months in 1948 were little better than the present year, the exports being 161,103 great hundreds valued at £275,397.  Taking even these two months in 1948, we received almost double as much money for the eggs we exported as we did in the same two months of the present year, while in 1949 we received, roughly, about four times as much money for our exports. Are these drops in production and exports evidence that agriculture is going backwards?  If they are not, were the increased figures in the years gone by evidence of the very prosperous times the farming community was enjoying? I submit, Sir, that neither conclusion is correct.  The position is that agriculture has been, is now and ever shall be, influenced largely by conditions outside its own control.</P>
    <P>If we make comparisons showing the increased production from the year 1947, when the land of Ireland was exhausted to such an extent that the Minister described it in 1948 as being able only to grow <i>féar gorta</i> grass, if we take that as the standard year to point to the great prosperity of the farming community and come back so soon, only four years later, to find a very serious drop in production and exports, I suggest it is no indication at all of conditions in the industry.  To my mind the human element is the acid test of the prosperity in any industry. If agriculture is as prosperous and has been as prosperous as we were led to believe, if we are told that the farmers were never so well off as they are at present, why are not more people employed <Col N="1503" /> on the land, rather than flying away from it?  Why in some instances is it difficult for the farmer to get even the heir-apparent to remain on the farm?  I can bring the Minister, or anyone else, to a farmer who last summer told me he had reared a family of seven.  He was then getting on in the sixties and he could not get one of the family to remain on the farm.  He offered to assign the farm to one son in particular and the son said: &ldquo;No. I can earn at least £6 a week, although I have never served my time to a trade, building houses for the urban council in Cavan.  How Could your farm provide me with an income like that?&rdquo; There is much less relative prosperity in agriculture in comparison with the protected industries.  There I submit is the acid test.  The child obviously is wiser than its father or mother. Youth cannot be induced to remain on the land while they have such a good income in sheltered positions, covered by all sorts of insurances and protection in the protected industries.  So that in considering agriculture we must consider it only in relation to its position in the national economy.</P>
    <P>I overlooked, in dealing with the question of exports of eggs, to mention a reply I got to another parliamentary question yesterday.  The question was addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, and it was to this effect: &ldquo;If he will state the total number of day-old chicks supplied by hatcheries to poultry keepers for the hatching seasons 1948-49, 1949-50, and for the 1950-51 season up to the latest date for which figures are available.&rdquo;  Here, again, I suffer from a disadvantage because of the taking of the Estimate for Agriculture in the month of April instead of in the months of June and July as in years gone by, as we cannot get figures for the complete turn-out of day-old chicks from hatcheries until the end of the season, which in other years was 31st May.  We had them every other year in time for the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in the reply I got the particulars requested were as follows: &ldquo;1948-49 season&mdash;1st December, 1948, to 31st May, 1949, the total number of day-old chicks supplied by hatcheries was 3,830,000; 1949-50 season&mdash;1st November, 1949, to 31st May, 1950, 3,590,000; 1950-51 season (part)&mdash;1st November, 1950, to 31st March, 1951, 1,570,000.&rdquo;  In spite of the fact that there are more attractive prices offered for cockerels and even pullets&mdash;for table purposes&mdash; pullets that would not be allowed to be exported in other years can be exported this year&mdash;there is a drop in the number of chicks turned out. What would appear to be the quite attractive price of 3/6 per lb. for cockerels is not sufficient to induce the farming community to take anything like the same number of chicks from hatcheries as they have been doing.  Unfortunately, I have not got the figures as to the number of chicks turned out up to the 31st March last year or the year before, but the difference between 1,570,000 turned out this year up to the 31st March and the 3,590,000 turned out last year for the complete season to the end of May can hardly be made up, even with this attractive price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that here again we suffer from the disadvantage that we have to go out on the export market.  During the years from 1948 on the farmers' wives went wholeheartedly into the increased production of poultry and eggs.  They availed of every assistance offered for better housing, the provision of incubators, hoovers, chicken-houses, poultry-houses and so on.  They made marvellous progress. I understand that the target of the Minister for Agriculture in 1948 was that, when the scheme would be going at top speed, 8,000,000 day-old chicks per annum would be turned out from the hatcheries.  Yet, if present indications are anything to go on, it is doubtful if there will be very much more than 2,000,000 turned out.  What is the cause of that?  Is it not the ruinous price of eggs at the present day?  I am not blaming the Minister entirely for this price because he had to sell the eggs to a customer who <Col N="1505" /> could snap his fingers at him, but I do think that the Minister was foolish in the years gone by when he made such statements as he did: when he said that he would drown the English people in eggs in one year, and last year when he said that 2d. an egg was not a bad price for eggs while still endeavouring to encourage the farming community to increase production.</P>
    <P>I think that either statement was not a help to him in making a bargain for our produce with the British or in planning for greatly increased production in the years ahead.  The making of these statements would appear to suggest that the farming community was well satisfied with these prices.  We then reached the point when the 2/- a dozen became effective.  I would ask Deputies to bear in mind that 90 per cent. of the farming community never expected, even when the bargain was made early last summer&mdash;they could hardly imagine it&mdash;that such a ruinous price would ever have to be accepted for the eggs.  When they did, was it on any advice from the Minister that they began to curtail production?  No. The Minister has told us that the exports of eggs during the first three months of this year are down by 60 per cent. as compared with the same months in last year.  Obviously, the farmers' wives did not wait for a lead from the Minister to reduce production. I suggest to the Minister that, when he was making that bargain whereby our eggs were to be sold at 2/- a dozen for seven months of the year, and at 3/6 a dozen for the other five months, if he had then said that he was going to advise the farmers' wives not to produce eggs at these prices, he probably would be in a much better position to make a bargain than by saying that 2d. an egg was not a bad price.</P>
    <P>When we come to milk prices we have the same story.  We have seen the struggle made by the farming community over the years to get a better price for milk supplied to the creamery. In the course of that struggle the producers have been met with several excuses.  One that is nearly always trotted out is that any increase in the <Col N="1506" /> price of milk supplied by farmers to the creameries was going to still further increase the sum set aside in the Estimates for agricultural produce subsidies which at present is something over £3,000,000.  We have been told that any increase in milk prices was going to still further increase that sum and have been asked why should the taxpayer be called upon to put up an increased amount of taxation in order to subsidise the producers of milk.  I think that theory was pretty well exploded when the Minister admitted some time ago that this was a subsidy to the consumer and not to the producer.  But, should not the cost of the production of any article be the first consideration rather than what the consumer had to pay or what the State has to contribute in order to give it to the consumer at less than the cost of production?  In the case of any other industry, if the cost of production of some article goes up, a case is immediately made for an increase in the price of that article, such as margarine.  As a general rule it is conceded even though such increase goes on to the consumer, and even though in that case the consumer was largely the farming community because, ultimately, in these cases the increases pass along the line until in the end they are dumped on the farmer.</P>
    <P>But, whether from good nature or yielding to pressure, the Minister has announced an increase of 1d. per gallon in the price of milk during the summer months from May to November, and no increase for the expensive months which are the winter months. The point has been made by other Deputies and by myself by way of supplementary question that this imaginary ld. per gallon of an increase is in reality only ¾d. by reason of the fact that 80 per cent. of the milk is produced during the summer months and the balance of 20 per cent. during the winter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will not forget that figure later on, and that the Minister will again remind me of it.  I suggest that increase of ld. per gallon works out at ¾d. a gallon for <Col N="1507" /> milk produced over the year.  I have made inquiries and I am satisfied that at least half of the ¾d. will go to meet the increased cost of running the creameries in the present year, so that the producer will get three half-farthings of an increase to meet his increased costs of production.  There will be a still further inroad on his three half-farthings of an increase by reason of the fact that, when the unrationed butter was arranged to be sold at 3/6 a lb., while the rationed butter of eight ounces per week continued to be sold at 2/8 per lb., there was a concession made to the members of the farming community.  The concession was that, on the average, they got, I think, about ten ounces of butter weekly over the year at the rationed price, but that concession has now been withdrawn.  In the first instance, the concession was given to the milk producers in the hope of encouraging them in the same way as a concession was given to the beet growers to encourage them.  The concession in their case was that they were given the beet pulp at a reduced price, a concession not enjoyed by the farmers in the non-beet growing counties.  However, as I say, the concession in regard to butter given to the suppliers to the creameries on the two ounces above the ration has been withdrawn, so that now, if farmers want to buy anything beyond the eight ounces on the ration, they have to pay 3/6 a lb. for it.  That is a further inroad into this three half-farthings increase.  The Minister has given us a guarantee of this price for a five-year period and thinks we should be well satisfied with getting that.  But, might I ask the Minister, what is the prospect of increased coats of production in the coming five years?  Is there anything to indicate a decrease in the cost of production of anything, any manufactured article, for instance?  Is there any hope that costs will be reduced in any way?</P>

      <P>Even though the Minister may consider the price a good one, it may be absolutely useless in a year or two or three years from now. There is one thing which has increased very considerably since the present price of milk was fixed in April, 1947 and that is labour costs.  Everyone will admit that labour costs in any industry are a very heavy item in the cost of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>They will go up, and more power to them, if they do.  But I hope we will get the assistance of the Deputy in recouping the farming community through the prices for produce for any increase in labour costs.  The minimum wage as fixed the Agricultural Wages Board up to the period when the present price of milk was fixed, was 44/- a week.  The minimum for a considerable time past has been 60/-.  The Minister assured us that not 10 per cent. of the workers were confined to the minimum wage.  I agree with him and I am glad of it. Farmers were never advocates of low wages.  All they ask is that there will be available, through the prices of produce, to the farmer and his family at least a labourer's wage.</P>
      <P>Other increases have taken place as well as the increase in wages.  By reason of legislation passed in this House in the past two years to provide increased national health benefits, the increase that the employer had to pay was 13/- per year.  By reason of the increased liability of the employer, the insurance companies have put up, the premium that he had to pay for his workers by 27½ per cent., or £1 5s. a year.  Since then, legislation passed in this House has made it obligatory on the farmer to give his worker an annual holiday of one week, an increased charge at the minimum rate of wages of £3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation nearly completed now, and I do not doubt it will go through, provides for a weekly half-holiday for agricultural workers, and that will mean an increase of another £13 a year at the minimum rate of wages, making <Col N="1509" /> in all £17 18s. 0d. per annum for each worker employed on the farm.  That, I submit, is a very considerable increase. Coupled with the increase in wages of 16/- a week since the present price of milk was fixed amounting to £41 12s. 0d. a year, it makes the increase in labour charges £59 10s. 0d. a year, or almost 23/- on the 44/- a week which brings the increased labour costs to about 50 per cent.  To meet this we get an increase of three half-farthings a gallon in the price for milk which will work out at something like 3½ per cent.  We get a 3½ per cent. increase in the price for milk to meet a 50 per cent. increase in labour costs.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that in normal times in the present year and the past year calves were more valuable than they have been, though at the moment they are not so good. On my way up here I passed through the fair of Virginia.  I spoke to some farmers there and asked them how they were doing and they said: &ldquo;You could not give away a suck calf.&rdquo;  That is due to the fact that nobody has milk to spare at the present time.</P>

      <P>The Minister always endeavours to draw wrong conclusions. I said that in the fair of Virginia farmers could not sell calves. Not alone that, but the tanglers who bring calves from other areas could not sell the calves in a place where they usually could sell quite a number of calves.  I am not saying that that was the case last year, nor that it is likely to be the case later on this year.  But even allowing for the increased value of a calf in comparison with 1947, due of course to the splendid prices that <Col N="1510" /> are obtainable for beef cattle, which the calf is ultimately intended for, as a result of the good stand made by the Argentine Government in refusing to give cheap beef to Britain and getting an increase of 50 per cent. on the price they refused to sell at last year&mdash; even allowing for an increase of £3 in the value of a calf in comparison with 1947, I do not think it would bring the income of the dairy farmer up by more than 15 per cent. to meet increased labour costs of over 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that half of this increase would go to the increased upkeep of the creameries and to the other matter I mentioned. Even taking £1,000,000, amongst how many people is the £1,000,000 to be distributed?  Probably 1,500,000 people, Or at least 1,000,000. Therefore, we should put our hands up and cheer because we are going to give them £1 a year increase each.  I should like to see the workers in any other industry who would cheer if they got an increase of £1 a year.  Quite a number of them are demanding an increase of £1 a week and are using very effective methods to secure it and succeeding to a great extent, even to the extent of holding the country up to ransom.  I made the point at the outset that agriculture might appear to some to be a pet because of having all these millions made available for it.  I pointed out the fact that all other sections of the community are parasites on the agricultural industry.  I pointed out that the aids that are given are simply easements in compensation for the depredations of these parasites on the agricultural community.  Even those easements are not sufficient to maintain the people who are actually engaged in agriculture.  They are still moving away as fast as they did in the <Col N="1511" /> past despite the assurances of others that the farmers were never so well off.</P>
      <P>There is one suggestion I will make to the Minister now.  If the farmers are so well off, why not put it to the test?  There was a motion down in the last year or two challenging the Department of Agriculture to take an average-sized farm in each county and run it entirely on hired labour, under the direction of the county agricultural instructor, an officer who should be proficient at his job and in a position to direct the working of the farm along the most economic and, at the same time, profitable lines, and see what the result would be; see will it pay the labourers even the minimum wage and still show a profit.  That challenge was laid down to the Minister's predecessors.  Yet neither he nor they have accepted it.  Why not do it now when the farming community is, as we are told, so prosperous.  We are quite prepared to make the challenge again if there is any prospect that it will be taken up.  We are quite confident of the results.  We are quite confident that the results will not show a profit.</P>
      <P>We had a classic example last year when, in reply to a parliamentary question, the then Minister for Health gave figures showing that where milk production was carried out entirely with the help of trade union labour on the farm attached to Grangegorman Mental Hospital in the year 1949&mdash;a very, very good year for milk production&mdash;the cost was 2/10½ per gallon; the year before that it was 3/1.  We had another instance of it on a farm owned by the urban council of Kells, a farm of something between 300 and 400 acres of good land-much better land than we have in County Cavan.  That farm, run entirely by trade union labour, showed a loss of £1,371 on the year's working.  These are no mysteries; they appeared in the local papers at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder then that successive Ministers for Agriculture have been afraid to take up the challenge and face the results of the test?  Will the Minister tor Agriculture now put the matter to the test?  The sops given to the agricultural industry in an endeavour to <Col N="1512" /> maintain it are useful.  Agriculture might be described as the &ldquo;ass&rdquo; in our national economy; the ass, of course, is not too well treated anywhere. Because the agricultural industry is useful to those who have escaped from it they like to see it maintained and, therefore, some State funds are made available to it to keep it alive in order that it will be in a position to provide them with what they cannot get from outside in times of scarcity.  When we take out the £10,000,000 which covers the flour and agricultural produce subsidy from a total estimate of £14,000,000 we have not very much left.  Even so, it is useful.  There is a sum of £2,500,000 for land rehabilitation.  I said last year that I considered that to be a very good investment; anything that will increase the productivity of the land is certainly of benefit to the nation.  I made the point&mdash;I make it again now&mdash; that most State aid is to some extent a premium on laziness inasmuch as the farmer who over the years has dug his drains, with the aid of the shovel, the pick and the crowbar, gathered the stones and has his land well drained, cannot benefit because land rehabilitation is primarily for drainage and reclamation.</P>
    <P>I made the point, too, that a large proportion of that sum should be spent on fertilisers for the land which was brought to such a state of degradation as that described by the Minister in 1948 as being capable only of producing féar gorta grass.  The land was reduced to that condition because fertilisers were not available during the war years and because of the increased tillage to produce food for our people. I hold, therefore, that there is a moral obligation on the State to restore the fertility of that land.  It was that land that had been drained by the farmer without any State aid over the early years of the century that produced the necessary food during the emergency. It was not the land that has been drained during the past two years since the introduction of the land rehabilitation scheme.</P>
    <P>No money was made available for fertilisers except for land that had been drained and rehabilitated.  I claim that that is a very short-sighted <Col N="1513" /> policy.  Fertilisers may become scarce again in the future.  Ample supplies were available in the last two years and if these supplies had been purchased they would have been very useful should another scarcity come, apart altogether from the question of doing some measure of justice to the men who produced the food during a period of scarcity.  We hope, of course, that fertilisers will not become scarce again.  God is good.</P>

I am glad to see that the Minister has decided to utilise some of the Marshall Aid grant to make ground limestone available at 16/- per ton no matter what the distance is from the works.  Unless a sufficient quantity of lime is made available the land will never be properly fertilised. I got an estimate for ground limestone showing it would be 27/- a ton delivered last year.  Now it is 16/-.  I am glad to say I have got it now at 16/- and I intend to apply a considerable amount of it.</P>

If there was such a stipulation &mdash;I cannot say with authority&mdash;we need not thank the Government for it. If it was a free act, we must thank them.  If there was no stipulation and the Government found that they had millions accumulated in the Counterpart Fund, on which they would have to pay interest next year and in 1956 begin the repayments, that that sum lying there in the fund was not bearing much interest, if any, it was a good idea then to give it for the land, and if it continues to produce cheap food the State will benefit.

      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question last week, the Minister suggested that bran would continue to be made available to farmers at the old price.  I have tried to get it and cannot, and I would be glad if the Minister would tell me why. We were assured that it would be available at the old price.  I could buy bran at 15/6 a cwt. and am now paying 30/6 a cwt.  As far as the naked eye can see, there is no improvement in the quality.  I would like to know if there is any addition, in the same way as pollard.  I have not been able to get bran at 15/6 now.  When I questioned the merchant, he got his invoice to show he was paying £29 a ton at the railway station, and had to pay <Col N="1515" /> carriage from the station to his shop and then he charged me 31/6 a cwt.</P>
      <P>A point made by the Minister yesterday caused me some surprise.  It was that the interest free loans would be available for the re-stocking of farms where cattle had died, were dying at present or were likely to die, from malnutrition.  When I warned the Minister of the danger of this last November, he did not take very kindly to it.  He talked of gloom and pessimism and tried to keep up our hearts by saying that no animal need die in Ireland on account of the bad hay.  To supplement the bad hay he was making available ample supplies of maize on credit terms, through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the co-operative societies and local agencies.  He also said that the complete output of bran and pollard would be available to the farmer for the feeding of live stock. Bran and pollard was available at 15/6 but we are now paying 30/6.  That will require some explanation.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the maize was made available, but as I pointed out then the people who had suffered serious losses, some losing considerably more than half their year's income, through flooded meadows, flooded crops and so on, found that credit was not sufficient, and their financial resources were such that they did not like to stick themselves deeper in debt.  Farmers realise that if they once get into debt it is a millstone round their necks that is very difficult to get off.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, in the White Paper issued to us with the Minister's Estimate, the figures were given of the average weekly purchases of maize in 1950.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It shows the average sales in 1950 were 6,600 tons per week and in 1951, 5,049.  It is significant that during the months in which maize is very necessary&mdash; January, February and March&mdash;the purchases have fallen away to such an extent.  Is that not clear evidence that the people were unable to purchase? <Col N="1516" /> If they were able to purchase, would they allow their stock to die?</P>

      <P>Again, even at the risk of being called a pessimist, and while I am not aware my self of any cattle dying I would like to quote this paragraph from the <i>Anglo Celt</i> dated the 14th April, 1951:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Many of our cows have calved down this year in very low condition. Many of them have little milk and in some cases retained their cleanings. It is within the bounds of possibility that we will not have enough milk produced within the country in 1951 to provide sufficient butter to meet our present ration.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which gets its news from correspondents in every <Col N="1517" /> area.  I do not suppose that is a pessimist report.  The fact of the matter is that we are in a worse position than even I feared.  At the risk of being called a pessimist, I say that the worst has not been reached.  I would be very glad to get the figures in respect of milk supplied to creameries for the months of April and May of this year and to compare them with the figures for the same period last year.  There was a very considerable drop from the 1st November up to the present but the worst has not yet come.</P>
      <P>The instructions which I received from my organisation were to ask the Minister to take back his Estimate to his colleagues in the Cabinet and tell them that the farmers are not terribly prosperous but that they are surviving and that other sections of the community are well provided for and get their demands regardless of whether the industry in which they are engaged is paying or not&mdash;sections such as Córas Iompair Éireann, which after getting loans come along for £1,000,000 a year that will make up funds that will pay wages.  These sections are cushioned against competition.  The cost of haulage of agricultural produce from the farm to the port of export and the necessary imports of fertilisers are an increased charge on the agricultural community.  Since all sections insist on their costs of production and conditions of employment, my instructions are to ask the Minister to tell his colleagues plainly that the farming community is entitled to at least the same protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what the cost of production may be, when we set those results, we will then be able to tell Deputy Davin how many millions it will take.  I hope at least that it will not take as many hundreds as it took to run a farm at Kells or to produce the milk on the farm attached to Grangegorman.  My instructions are to ask the Minister to take back his Estimate to his colleagues and stand up to them.  The farming community want him to stand up to them.  They want <Col N="1518" /> him to insist on a measure of justice for the farmers sufficient to enable them to provide at least a labourer's wage for their families.</P>
      <P>There is danger of a still greater burden being imposed on the agricultural community.  I refer to the charges of the Social Welfare Insurance Bill, which, having passed its vital Second Reading, is as good as a certainty excepting a miracle.  This is going to be a very heavy charge on the agricultural community and will crush still lower those who remain on the land.  It used to be said of Daniel O'Connell that whenever he was praised by the London <i>Times</i> he examined his conscience.  But when the Minister is praised by Deputy Cowan, himself a deserter from the land, and other city Deputies and representatives of industrial workers, I do not know if the Minister will examine his conscience.  I can assure the Minister that the agricultural community are examining their consciences.  I appeal to the Minister, from a sense of justice, from a sense even of national survival, to stand up for agricultural interests and insist on a more equal distribution of the national wealth. If, as we are told, the share which the agricultural community secure of the national income is £1 out of every £3 10s. 0d., that surely should be evidence that there is an unequal distribution of that wealth.  If the demands of my organisation are not acceded to, I am directed to vote in favour of the motion to refer back the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some comment on the participation of city Deputies in this debate.  My purpose in intervening is twofold. There are two problems, one of which specifically affects city constituencies and the other the community as a whole.  The specific one to which I refer is a problem which is perhaps unavoidable, but that fact should not be an excuse for evading it and simply allowing things to drift.  It is the problem of catering for the consumer, or adjusting the problems of the consumer, when prices and costs are rising for the agricultural producer. It would be unfair not to realise that <Col N="1519" /> there is a problem there, but, in order to secure a balance, there are some facts in relation to it which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  I am sorry that the Minister has left.</P>
      <P>The first of these is the matter on which we have already had some discussion here, the matter of butter and fats.  It would appear that now there is not only the supply problem involved but the consumer is going to be faced with an increase in the price of butter, if I understand the announcements which have been made.  I should like the Minister to realise that that increase must be taken from the consumer's point of view, in conjunction with increases which have already taken place in regard to margarine and jam, and, if certain forecasts or rumours current only this day are correct, there may be a question of an increase in the price of bread.  Anybody who knows conditions in the city will realise that bread and spread, as it is called, is an important item in the diet of families in certain strata in the city and, if my recollection serves me, the nutritional survey would indicate that it was a fairly important item in the case of large families.</P>
      <P>What the consumer is, therefore, faced with, if the promised increase in the price of butter and the rumoured increase in the price of bread are to take place, is an increase in bread and what is spread on it&mdash;every alternative item of spread, whether jam, butter or margarine, goes up in price.  I can understand the difficulties of that problem and it would be quite unfair simply to look at that aspect of it without relation to the agricultural and other aspects; but what I say is that that problem should be considered in conjunction with these other problems, that an effort to strike a reasonable balance should be made and that it is not sufficient to let things drift and work themselves out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My fear of drift in that regard can be given some substance by figures obtained by Deputy Smith in answer to a question yesterday, when we relate it to the problem of meat supply. Again, I am sorry the Minister is not <Col N="1520" /> present.  We are in Committee and these are problems which I should like to give him an opportunity of answering directly as I make the point.  In the case of meat, we have all been aware of the problem created by the fact that the prices payable for the cattle we raise had their repercussions on the price at which meat was available to the consumer in the cities.  The price payable for our cattle rose, an advantageous thing, no doubt, both from the point of view of the producer and the community, but, alongside that rise, there was the problem that it reached a point at which butchers found it uneconomic to buy cattle as the price was then controlled.</P>
    <P>I need not refresh the memories of Deputies with the story of this problem which has existed in an unsolved condition for three years, but the fact is that the net result for the consumer in the towns was an inferior supply of meat in many cases; in other words, the meat available was very often not up to the prime standard that it would have been, had there been no difficulties of that nature there, and, secondly, a constant difficulty about price, and one has only to read the newspapers over that period and the attitude expressed by various interests to see what the picture was. The Minister&mdash;I think the relevant Minister is the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;did allow a certain increase. He has always been careful to blame his predecessors for it, but nevertheless one authorised increase did occur in 1948.  Thereafter, nothing was done about the problem.  It was evaded, avoided and there was drift.</P>
    <P>What is the result?  These figures are very interesting in relation to that overall picture.  We find from the Minister's reply yesterday that the estimated number of cattle consumed at home in the years 1948, 1949 and 1950 were 279,000, 219,000 and 189,000 respectively.  That series of figures seems to indicate that the net result of the drift in this matter has been that our people are eating less meat.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have a point there and it is very fair, but, if these figures are an indication at all, they show that such problems must be taken into account and that it is not sufficient merely to let the matter drift.  Everybody knows the problem of the meat in the city. Neither the butcher who sells it nor the consumer who buys it has been satisfied with the position.  Any housewife will tell you that definitely it has resulted in the effective prices being, in many cases, greater than the national controlled prices.</P>

      <P>I am not.  Here is the Minister for Justice trying to bring me into just the very thing which I was careful to avoid, namely, a one-sided approach.  If the Minister cares to recollect what I have said or to inspect it in the Official Report he will see that I was meticulously careful to avoid a one-sided approach.  If, however, he wants me to use my ammunition to the greatest effect, from the point of view of attacking the Minister for Agriculture, I can do so but I am trying to deal objectively with this rather difficult problem.  Whatever way the Minister looks at it, 93,000 head of cattle less were consumed by our own people in 1950, as against 1948.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get back, however, to the way I prefer to face this problem.  I have used that question <Col N="1522" /> in regard to cattle and the amount of meat consumed to show how drift, in face of such a problem, and how the ignoring of such facets in a problem will ultimately lead to undesirable results&mdash;and results, in the case of meat, as Deputy MacEntee has said, which can be interpreted as a lowering of the cost of living.</P>
      <P>What I am anxious to help the Minister for Agriculture to avoid is a similar type of picture appearing in the case of butter.  Apparently, there is going to be an increase in the price of bread, if rumour is correct.  Already there has been an increase in the price of jam and in the price of margarine. With bread and spread, as it is called, occupying the important place which it occupies in the family diet of certain sections of the community, then, if there is now going to be an increase in the price of butter, as well, to the consumer, there is a problem there.  I admit that when one takes the whole problem and looks at it, it is not a problem capable of very easy solution.</P>
      <P>What I want to do on this occasion is to commend that facet of the problem to the Minister for Agriculture, to ask him to bear it strongly in mind and to see that in this particular adjustment the load does not altogether fall on sections of the community which are least able to bear it.  I think I could not be fairer than that.  In saying so, I realise the problems in regard to milk production. I realise the danger, even to the consumer, if milk production were to fall for the want of an adequate price. Nevertheless, I want to take this opportunity of putting forward that side of the problem which, in any balanced and considered approach to the over-all problem, should be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter about butter which I should like to mention to the Minister for agriculture.  He has already&mdash;earlier in this debate&mdash; shall I say, used some representations made by me as an excuse for certain action taken or not taken.  The fact of the matter is that he was asked whether it would not be possible to make a proportion of Irish butter available in the city, where, for a time, only foreign butter was available. <Col N="1523" /> If he did make the butter that was available for a while, available on our representations, we are glad of that and we can appreciate his effort.  Nevertheless, the fact now is that apparently he did not find it possible to work out the problem as he attacked it.  It is hardly fair to blame other people for that.  After all, he is in control and it is up to him to make his decisions and to carry them through.</P>
    <P>The next aspect of the problem with which I should like to deal is the over-all problem from the point of view of the community.  It is impossible to deal with it without having some regard to the over-all picture of the day, to the over-all situation, even to the over-all situation in the world during the past three years and at the present time.  We hear very frequently, almost as a catch-cry, phrases about the importance and the fundamental nature of our agricultural industry in our economy and our national life.  That is all very true, but because of its very fundamental nature and because of its very importance, the policy directing our agriculture, the policy of the Minister for Agriculture at the time, must have regard and must be adjusted to the general situation ruling at the time and the likely situation&mdash;in the immediate future, at any rate.  Now, what was that situation over the past three years?  It is important to ask that question in order to judge whether the approach of the Minister for Agriculture and the approach of the Government was sound or whether it was not&mdash;and the over-all picture was this, if I can summarise it.</P>
    <P>After the world war there followed a certain period of very uneasy peace during 1945, 1946 and 1947.  During that time the world had hopes of moving towards what it called normality&mdash; something approximating to the pre-1939 position.  It was a period during which incidents were occurring which gave cause for misgivings.  It was admittedly a period of uncertainty&mdash;a period when the wise thing would probably have been to be careful, to guard against the possibilities of deterioration but principally to look <Col N="1524" /> forward and, as far as one could, to base oneself on a policy of returning more or less to normal, in time.  However, that situation changed and deteriorated more rapidly than people might have suspected at that time.  If my memory serves me rightly, it was in or around this time in 1948 that the Scandinavian countries sounded the alarm, so to speak.  It was in or around that time that Sweden, Norway and Denmark, and their staffs, started to pay attention to the possibility of a deterioration in the situation and the danger of another war.  Now that is undoubtedly a historical fact and even at that time some staff officers in Sweden actually presented a memorandum to their King on the subject. That was the first warning.</P>
    <P>People on this side of the world might be forgiven for not paying the attention to that which subsequent events would warrant.  I would not be too hard an anyone for misjudging the situation in the summer of 1948 but in the following autumn some very significant events in the British House of Commons were an indicator of what was happening.  A debate on defence took place and I gave the reference in this House within six months of its occurrence.  It pointed out the deterioration in the situation and it was clear from that time onwards that the possibility of a deterioration in the economic situation was greater than people would wish and that there was only one sensible approach to our economic policy: one of self-reliance and one of guarded preparation.  Following that you later had devaluation and then a progressive deterioration in a situation which at its worst promised war within a certain time and at its best promised times of difficulty of supply and economic disturbance and trouble for any country that did not look after its own house and rely on itself as far as it could. Devaluation only accentuated that picture and then there was Korea and a complete deterioration to the situation we have at the present time and the problems we have to face.  That was the over-all picture, the actual factual specific situation to which any wide-awake Government would have had regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> What in fact happened, however? This Government and this Minister for Agriculture took a line which I will not at the moment criticise on general economic grounds but which I will say in that specific set of circumstances existing then was not wise and was in fact dangerous.  Their outlook was to discourage the production of food at home, in other words to discourage mixed farming and go back completely to live stock.  It was very similar indeed to the old pre-1932 Cumann na nGaedheal approach but there was less to be said for it in that situation than there was to be said for Cumann na nGaedheal.  Remember when the late Mr. Hogan, Minister for Agriculture in the Cumann na nGaedheal Cabinet, was conducting affairs from the seat now occupied by Deputy Dillon the situation was different.  In those day's you had a strong, relatively powerful England and a situation of normality. A case could be advanced&mdash;although we did not subscribe to it&mdash;for basing our economy completely on the English economy by supplying cattle and hoping to get a return.  A case could be made for that grazing or ranching policy but no such strong case could he made in 1948 in the post-war period when you had a totally different England and a totally different world situation.</P>
    <P>The weakness of that approach was accentuated by two other things.  It was accentuated by the fact that irresponsible promises were made about feeding stuffs and it was usual for the Minister to make statements which had obviously not been completely thought out.  The result of these statements in many cases was to cause farmers to adopt a certain approach to problems and then to find later that they were faced with difficulties which they had no reason to anticipate from the assurances which they had been given.  Oats, potatoes, poultry&mdash;everybody knows the list.</P>
    <P>It was accentuated also by the fact that the farmers knew that they had an administration which would not support them in any effort towards self-reliance. Then, of course, there was the famous occasion at the time of devaluation when assurances were given that <Col N="1526" /> prices&mdash;I think that fertilisers and maize were mentioned&mdash;would not rise. That approach had its result in a tendency to unbalance between the production of live stock and the production of crops.  As we took the view that there was a need for ensuring for the future, that appeared to me and to us on this side of the House to be an unwise approach.</P>
    <P>The situation this year is such that at the last moment the Minister has had to reverse his policy.  He is up against the difficulty that after what happened to poultry and oats, after the declarations about the price and availability of foreign feeding stuffs, after all these things which have misfired, he is not likely to be the best person to get the best response from the farmers to any exhortations he might give at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I was looking at the debate on this subject last year.  Some of these points were brought to the Minister's notice and his policy was criticised from the point of view that it was based in the past two years on a live-stock trade with Britain.  The Minister frankly admitted that he was still basing his policy on live stock.  I feel that the fundamental difference between the Minister and us is there; while we should like to see our live-stock industry exploited and built up by all means to give the maximum benefit to the community, we want it balanced on the production as far as we possibly can of the foodstuffs required for man and beast and to have as self-reliant an agricultural industry as we can.  The Minister, on the other hand, even this year, seems to take the merely commercial view that if he can exploit the live-stock industry he is prepared even to rely on imports to maintain that industry.</P>
    <P>Lest I should be accused of misquoting the Minister I think it would be well to give verbatim what he said on that subject.  A year ago, in volume 122, column 216, he said, in effeet&mdash; there I can be checked in that reference, if necessary&mdash;that his policy was based on live stock.  This year, in the current Official Report, Volume 125, column 847, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We should never consent to the <Col N="1527" /> folly of assuming that our live-stock production must be limited by the capacity of our own lands to produce fodder.  When our domestic produce is extended to the full we should supplement it by the importation of raw material for conversion, just as the manufacturer imports cotton for spinning and the brewer imports hops to brew into beer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that should mean&mdash;and I do not want to press it any further than what the Minister does mean&mdash;an agricultural policy aiming at a maximum export of live stock to be maintained by the importation of foreign feeding stuffs, then I would say that that is not a safe approach for us under the present circumstances; that the experience of this year alone shows that it is not a safe approach.  There are difficulties to be anticipated in the future.  Even on the assumption, and with the hope, that ultimately a conflict will be avoided, there will, nevertheless, be difficulties ahead and, with these difficulties there, I suggest that approach is dangerous for us and that the approach should rather be to try to balance our agricultural industry so that we will be as independent as possible of foreign food supplies.</P>
    <P>That is as much, I think, as a person who is not familiar with the details of agriculture or the actual working out of farming problems can go, but I think, nevertheless, it is a fairy rational approach, available to any citizen who cares to study the drift of the times and think out what the problems before us are, and how they should be placed.  The importance of these problems is not only economic; it is fundamental to any approach to our future.  Whether we will have trouble or not, as I have said so many times, there are difficulties of supply ahead.  There is no more effective way of dictating to a people than by starving them, than by attacking their food supplies, and the greatest demoralisation, the greatest dislocation of life in this country, whether under war conditions or not, that could be conceived, would arrive most likely from shortages of that nature.  If you find that you are in difficulties about providing your own foods, you are much more <Col N="1528" /> susceptible to pressure from outside and disorganisation at home and disruptions of all sorts, so that it is of primary importance to ensure that at all times we can count on sufficient food for our human population and also for our animals, in order to avoid that threat.  So far as my limited knowledge goes, it would seem to be well within our power so to do.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another aspect of this where a good deal of figures have been given and I would like to get them presented clearly.  It is largely a question of acreages and yields.  Perhaps, if one deals with wheat, the problem can be put more clearly.  The Minister for Agriculture, in opening this debate, said that there was sufficient wheat up to 30th September, and he gave a figure of 2,100,000 barrels, which would work out to about 263,000 tons.  In column 837 of the current Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is comforting to know that on 31st March, 1951, the wheat in stock, floated, loading and waiting to be loaded was 2,100,000 odd barrels and in respect of maize coming within the same categories we have 121,000 tons. This satisfactory situation would not be a source of equanimity unless we were satisfied as to the available storage waiting to keep it.  In that connection, a careful survey of the storage has been proceeding and, in round figures, we count on having available in September, 1951, in silos at ports and mills and in storage at mills, merchants' and malsters' emergency storage up and down the country approximately 421,000 tons of storage which represents approximately one year's wheat supply, were it all employed to that end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have certain difficulties in reconciling these figures with figures already given but, as the Minister is not here at the moment, and perhaps he may return before I have dealt with some of the other points, on second thoughts I will leave this particular aspect over for the moment.</P>
    <P>I will turn to deal with another problem.  This other problem is also related to the possibility of emergency and again, even at the risk of repetition, I want to make quite clear that when I talk of an emergency in that <Col N="1529" /> sense, I am not saying that certainly we should bank everything on the probability of another war.  What I am saying is that there is danger, but that whether it comes or not, the time ahead will be difficult.  We will have difficulties with regard to supplies and the prices to be paid for supplies.  We cannot see an easing of the situation with which we are confronted, for some time at least.  In that type of situation the obvious, the sensible, the safe thing for us to do is to try to rely on ourselves to the greatest extent possible. That means, in relation to our agricultural policy, growing as much food as we can here and aiming as far as we can&mdash;and I would be surprised if it is not completely possible with proper driving direction&mdash;to ensure that, even if we were completely isolated, we could produce all the food we needed for our human population and for our animals, if we were put to it.</P>
    <P>To that consideration of mine, I would like to add two others.  One is, on the ordinary economic point of view, taking prices as they are, taking, for instance, the price are have to pay for maize at the moment, the price of fertilisers, and all that kind of thing, even on an ordinary costing basis, there seems to be a reasonable hope that the approach that I have indicated is the best in the long term and the safest in the long term and might also be the most economic for us, if a drive were made in the right direction.  Certainly, as far as the layman can judge from what we have heard about oats, poultry and all these other things in the last two years, the approach heretofore has not been conspicuously more advantageous than the other.  If that is so then the growing of food, that is, tillage, should take and assume an important and permanent place in our agricultural economy.  That in turn, when translated into practical language, means acreage under crops. It means more.  If it is to be maintained, it means the maintenance of the fertility of the soil and that in turn means fertilisers.</P>
    <P>One of the weaknesses in our position at the moment as I see it, anyway, is our almost total dependence on foreign resources for fertilisers.  It was a lesson that we earned during <Col N="1530" /> the war.  It was a lesson that, at any rate, should have been self-evident. There were difficulties in meeting that problem.  It seems to me, however, that during the past few years there were relatively favourable circumstances for meeting the problem if we had been prepared to avail ourselves of those circumstances.  Before the war, in times of open supply and open competition and large established firms seeking markets and selling where they could, there were problems indeed for any country who wanted to produce fertilisers or other chemicals, starting late in the day from scratch, such as we would have proposed to do. Almost a century of possible development of that nature was lost in this country and always, in facing such a problem, that handicap will be there. It was particularly there in those days pre-war but, even then, considerable progress had been made towards meeting it and proposals had reached a fairly advanced stage.  Of course, the circumstances leading to the war and the war itself nullified all these good intentions but, during the war, we learned one thing, and that was the scarcity that can take place in regard to such essential commodities, the need for such essential commodities as fertilisers and the high price that has to be paid for them.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recollect that, notwithstanding the substantial tonnages of, say, phosphate that were imported pre-war up to 1939, at a competitive price, by 1942 our imports had fallen to zero and the price had risen to nearly £30 per ton, and that happened in spite of efforts to get rock from America and to develop at a late hour the reserves of rock available, such as they were, in this country.  With all that lesson there, surely the sensible thing at the end of the war was to see that such a problem could not arise again and to establish in this country an industry to supply these essential materials for our basic industry.  It there was a case for the establishment of any industry as next to agriculture, it was a case for establishing a fertiliser industry in the primary sense, that is, an industry which would actually produce the materials that go to make <Col N="1531" /> the fertilisers as we know them.  What we have existing are fertiliser factories, if you like, but they are secondary; they make the fertilisers out of imported material.  What was needed here, if it were possible to be achieved, was a basic industry which would supply these materials.</P>
    <P>The question was, was it feasible? What materials did you want?  Primarily you wanted phosphatic fertilisers and you wanted nitrogenous fertilisers. Broadly speaking, that would be the group.  In the case of the phosphatic fertilisers you were justified in setting up your industry in developing your existing industry, in fact; it would have needed little else&mdash;to produce what you had to produce.  You had phosphate rock and sulphuric acid and you had alternative processes available, if you had to fall back on electric power.  That was justified, for this reason, that you had sufficient reserves of rock in the country which would warrant you, first of all, stockpiling against an emergency when you could get imports knowing that, even after your stockpile was absorbed, you then had a reserve of rock.  So you had a feasible approach to that.</P>
    <P>As regards the nitrogenous fertilisers, the raw material was fresh air. As regards the sulphuric acid that you wanted, the raw materials were here, if a proper drive were made to develop them, and so forth.  In other words, to cut it short&mdash;this is not the time to go into it in any detail&mdash;the elements were there to make it practicable to build such an industry.  The opportunity was there and, what is more, the very difficulties of current times would have afforded in themselves opportunities. Where, before the war, the difficulties of free and open competition to which I have referred existed, now, the restricted circumstances, the circumstances of ruling high prices, and all that, would have created a very favourable environment in which to develop such an industry.</P>
    <P>Lastly, on top of that&mdash;although I am going outside the bounds of this debate, but the Ceann Comhairle may allow me to make this remark&mdash;such an industry would have been the most <Col N="1532" /> natural nucleus for a chemical industry in this country, based, as it would be, on our primary industry, agriculture, its side-lines could be branched off.</P>
    <P>There was a project fundamental to almost our whole economy with possibilities, not only for agriculture, but in our industrial life as well.  It was a project that should have had attention and so far nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the land reclamation scheme and many people have said that it would have been better to have concentrated on the fertility of the land that is there rather than to go on reclaiming land of the type that has been reclaimed.  I will not enter into that controversy.  It is one for people who have more specific knowledge than I have.  Having perused the acreages under crops which we had during the emergency and, therefore, the acreages presumably available, and the yields corresponding thereto, having looked at these statistics and having come to the conclusion that the possibility was there to achieve the self-reliance of which I spoke, then I would say unhesitatingly that it would have been a wiser and a better approach for the Minister for Agriculture to have spent such money as he had available in building up the present fertility and providing for the future fertility of the land that was available in priority to the reclamation of other land, although I shall not condemn him for the idea of that either.</P>
    <P>I say that as objectively as I can This is the stigma that must attach to this Government here, that there were two easy years in which this Coalition was in power, two years of opportunity and that, at the end of these two years of opportunity, all that they can do now is, haphazardly, furtively and rather lately, reverse into a policy that they should have adopted earlier but which they decried and undermined, and that these years of opportunity have been lost.</P>
    <P>Supposing these years had been utilised, surely the sensible thing to have done would have been to go all out on a scheme of fertilising such land as was available.  I can remember <Col N="1533" /> that Deputy Aiken made one move in that direction when as Minister for Finance, in spite of all the enemies by which he was encompassed at the time of the emergency Budget, he had the courage, the foresight and the vision to provide under these straitened circumstances a subsidy for fertilisers.  It was his hope and the hope of his colleagues that, if they were in power in the subsequent years, the farmer would be encouraged by every means available to the State to secure fertilisers to fertilise his land but that in itself would not have been enough.  It would have been necessary, in addition to that approach for the present, to provide a long term approach by establishing the industry about which I have been speaking.  If that had been done a very sound investment would have been made for the country's future and perhaps our strongest bulwark would have been erected against any difficulties in the future and a degree of independence and of self-reliance would have been achieved that would have put our people into a very favourable situation indeed.</P>
    <P>It is rather sad to note, too, that while Deputy Aiken as Minister for Finance was talking in these terms, his colleague Deputy Lemass had already taken active steps in his Department to get this fertiliser industry, this basic chemical industry to which I have referred, going.  Three years have passed, three years of promises unfulfilled and of prognostications that have been proved to be, in fact, untrue about fertiliser supplies and their prices, but the industry of which I have spoken was not developed.  On the other hand, the other scheme went on.  I cannot help feeling that it would have been wiser and better to devote these efforts generally in the way I have outlined.  I say &ldquo;generally&rdquo;.  In every problem its specific aspects must be considered and adjustments must be made but I do feel, generally speaking, that the programme, aimed at raising and maintaining the fertility of such arable land as was already available, should have taken priority over speculative schemes designed to reclaim land which would need constant further effort for its maintenance.</P>
    <P>Quite candidly, I have looked at this <Col N="1534" /> in a rather general sense.  I have looked at it in this sense because I had hoped and I know that other Deputies will deal with the specific pressing individual problems of agriculture.  I should like to say that even yet it should not be too late, if energy is put into it, to get back on the right lines, and that would be my exhortation to. the Minister.</P>
    <P>I left the question of yields, but the Minister has not returned so I suppose I had better deal with them.  There is an interesting sequence of figures here from which certain conclusions can be drawn.  In view of all the talk that goes on about figures and statistics and the taking of partial statistics at certain times, perhaps it would be no harm to put the complete lists on record.  Between the years 1931 and 1939, taking wheat, the acreage under wheat was increased more than ten-fold. It rose from nearly 21,000 acres in 1931 to 255,000 acres in 1939.  During the war years, the acreage rose as high in one year, 1945, as 662,000 acres. The conclusion that one draws from the sequence seems to me to be that it was a fortunate thing, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the emergency, that the habit of wheat growing had been fostered and that the expansion of tillage noticeable in the pre-war period had taken place, because it was, so to speak, the base on which the emergency production of the war years was built.</P>
    <P>We can be glad to say that we are still, on our previous experience, at a level from which we can get back. In other words, the deterioration has not been sufficient to bring us down below the starting level, but I have doubts about the time it would take. It was 1942 before the acreage under wheat was sufficient to meet our requirements, according to the estimates the Minister has given.  In fact, we know that, from the point of view of deliveries to the mill, we always went on importing, but from the point of view of getting our acreage up, it took until 1942 to get the acreage over 500,000 acres.  It, therefore, seems to me that our present position is such that there is a good deal of leeway to be made up if there is any question of isolation.  The Minister said there was a year's supply.  He was answered <Col N="1535" /> by Deputy Walsh, who pointed out that there would not be enough flour to carry on and that, to my mind, is an unsatisfactory position.  Our present position is that, if foreign supplies were completely cut off, there would be a serious shortage before our production could be got up to the stage of meeting our estimated annual requirements. That is a statement, I suppose, that I should be asked to prove, but it seems to me that it is apparent from the figures.  We must, first of all, go back to what the Minister's own estimate is.  In reply to a question here, he said that 520,000 tons were required annually, of which 480,000 tons is applicable to millable wheat and 40,000 tons applicable to seed wheat.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the figure of 480,000 tons must be taken as meaning wheat delivered to the mills.  If that is so then, as far as I can see, the allowance of 40,000 tons as seed wheat, if you want to have a year's supply, is quite inadequate.</P>
    <P>If we take the reply which was given by the Minister to Deputy T. Walsh on the 22nd February, he had about 190,000 tons held, when you take flour and wheat, and there was coming 99,465 tons.  That was the position then. The figure which the Minister referred to in this debate was 2,100,000 barrels which works out at about 263,000 tons.  Therefore, on his own showing he had, approximately, sufficient up to the 30th September.  That is our position.  Where are we with that?  Supposing you had an acreage last year of 366,000 even at the high yield of 20 cwt. an acre, and that would be a very high yield, you would, as Deputy Walsh pointed out, have run out of wheat before the year was out. That figure does not seem to allow for seeding.  In other words, our position at the moment is one of a certain degree of peril, and one which should be mended as quickly as possible. What should we aim at?  The aim, of course, should be to have sufficient wheat in stock to carry you over until such time as you will have a yield from a harvest that will give you a year's supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> I think Deputies will allow that this year is now practically gone.  The Minister has delayed.  Admittedly, there have been difficulties about the weather, but finally, he has been half-hearted in his efforts, and so there is little likelihood, so far as I can see, that the next harvest will produce a complete year's supply of wheat.  We are, therefore, for the year 1951-52 going to be still dependent on outside wheat resources&mdash;in other words on the importation of wheat.  That is a situation which should not be allowed to continue because it is one which is inherently dangerous.</P>
    <P>There is another factor.  What acreage is required, even at the high average yield of a ton per acre? According to the Minister's own figures, you would need to have 520,000 acres under wheat.  But of course, we know from our war experience that you would want something more because all that wheat is not going to be delivered.  I take it that the Minister's answer on the 15th March referred to the estimated requirement delivered to the mills, so that you cannot even say that the 366,000 acres which you had in 1950-51 is to be related to the 520,000 acres.  It is to be related to something greater.  Our emergency figures are there to show us that, from 1942 to 1945, with the exception of 1943-44 when it was very slightly lower, the average acreage of wheat during those years of the emergency was very much greater indeed than this figure.</P>
    <P>This series of figures shows one thing, and it is that, on the experience of the last emergency, the 366,000 acres that were under wheat during 1950-51 will not be a lot more than half of the acreage that would be necessary if anything of the kind experienced on the last occasion were to arise.  I do not know if there is any method by which one can put a table on record when discussing an Estimate like this.  The Minister was good enough to pass over a sheet giving some figures.  When one adds to that some other information which he gave in reply to a question one gets a very instructive table indeed.  Before going into that, I should like to refer to explanations that were given by the Minister, and that were given by way of an interjection <Col N="1537" /> to Deputy Cogan in regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that he can only get the table on record by reading it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. The Minister gave a table which I will read in a moment.  I would like to say that having checked it&mdash;it is only a question of simple division by two&mdash;the table is consistent both with the answer that was given by the Parliamentary Secretary on the 7th March, and with the reply to Deputy Lemass, and that it is not inconsistent with the answer which was given to Deputy Cogan on the 14th March to which reference has been made.  It is a question of which yield you take.  You can compile a table showing the year, then the acreage, then the tonnage delivered to the mills, and then the yields.</P>
      <P>Now, we have two types of yield to deal with.  One is the estimated yield per acre which is what, I think, every one in the House would mean by yield. But the Minister has chosen to divide the tonnage delivered to the mills by the acreage under wheat, and to call that the yield.  I suppose in a sense it is the yield to the mills per acre. But here are the figures in tabular form.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> As the Minister is here, I should like to go into this matter with him.  He says that our annual requirement is 520,000 tons, of which he would require 40,000 tons for seed wheat.  That is the answer he gave to a question, and I am taking that as a basis for calculation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>400,000 tons for consumption, plus the seed wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual answer which the Minister gave on the occasion to which I refer was given to Deputy Walsh and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The storage capacity required to store 12 months' requirements of millable and seed wheat amounts to approximately 520,000 tons, of which 480,000 tons is applicable to millable wheat and 40,000 tons is applicable to seed wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am taking that as our annual requirement for the purpose of examining the figures.  We can take it for granted also that the Minister's figures in the answer he gave on the 22nd February, generally speaking, tally with the figures he gave in this debate.  It all boils down to the fact then that the wheat at his hand, whether here or from outside, will just take him to the next harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy appreciate that the wheat requirement depends on the extraction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the traditional calculation has been one sack of flour per head of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear that in mind.  Meantime, I want to continue this sequence.  I shall be glad if the Minister will assist me should I appear to ignore any factor.  On the present basis of calculation, if I understand him correctly, he will go to next September. That means that, should there be any cutting off of supplies within the next six months, saving the elasticity that the Minister himself has mentioned, we would be dependent on the next harvest for all our requirements during the ensuing year.  If the acreage is not increased above the <Col N="1539" /> acreage last year, as Deputy Walsh has pointed out, we will run out of wheat somewhere about May or June, perhaps a little later, of 1952, again subject to the elasticity available by restricting consumption and increasing extraction.  I grant the Minister all that.</P>
      <P>I think I have made a fair statement of the position.  If that is a fair statement of the position we would want now to aim at an immediate production of somewhere in the region of 550,000 acres on that calculation but on examination that will be found not to be safe for two reasons.  First of all, the calculation is based on an assumption of an average yield of one ton per acre; I mean now yield on the ground, not yield to the mill.  On the figures supplied in the last column of this table that I have already read out that is too high an average yield to expect. I know that it was reached and exceeded in a few years, notably before the war.  The last year in which it was exceeded or reached was 1940-41, but it seems to be too high an expectation altogether.  Secondly, there must be an allowance for seed for the following harvest.  That must be taken into the calculations.  I can only talk about statistics and I must leave it to the farmers to calculate what will be required there.  I suppose 10 per cent. might be a fair calculation in as far as such a calculation can be useful at all. It can only be a rough indication.  But allowances must be made for seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In perusing these statistics there is another factor that must be taken into account; that factor is the tillage available during the war.  As the Minister very well appreciates, on that calculation and assuming that our requirements have not changed very much over the years, as I do not think they have, we should have had ample wheat for all our requirements on the acreage under cultivation during the emergency and we should not have had to import anything.  We know very well that we had in fact to import wheat.  We know that our requirements were not met at home.  The discrepancy will be found between the two last columns, what the Minister <Col N="1540" /> calls his working yield per acre and what the farmer might call his yield per acre, that is the estimated yield; in other words, all the wheat grown does not find its way into the millers granaries.  It is significant to note that in the column on yield as given by the Minister, with the solitary exception of the year 1949-50, nowhere have the deliveries in the whole period from 1932 to the present time exceeded 15 cwt. per acre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And rarely come near that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And, as the Minister has said, rarely come near that. In fact in 1949 where it does exceed it there was a corresponding collapse in oats prices.  Possibly that has something to do with it.  These figures mean, then, that our wheat requirement for practical purposes is apparently substantially in excess of the mill requirement; consequently, the acreage under wheat last year was wholly deficient from the security point of view.  In the net, what I want to urge upon the Minister on foot of that argument is: supposing I concede to the Minister&mdash;and I must concede this since it is a cogent point&mdash; that there is elasticity and leeway to make up the deficiency by (a) possibly restricting consumption within certain limits, and (b) increasing extraction, then the Minister has that to make up on that side: but on the other side there is still a big void to fill and there is this discrepancy between yield per acre and yield to the mill, which I interpret as representative of wheat consumed by the farmer himself.  If that is not what it means, what does it mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>An excessively optimistic estimate by the farmers of the yield which they believe themselves to be getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Who estimates these yields?  I am dealing with official figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The county agricultural instructors, the Civic Guards and the farmers themselves in answering queries put to them at the time of census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1541" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we then to disregard the answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy Cogan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are bound to discount substantially the estimated yield per acre of any cereal crop owing to the well-known tendency of farmers who are cross-questioned for the purpose of census returns not to admit that the yield of their crop has been lower than or inferior to that of a neighbour; and every neighbour is anxious to name a level yield which will not make him appear inferior to the next man who grows the same crop in his parish. The only reliable test we have are the deliveries to the mills; but, of course, to that you must add one percentage for retained grain either for human consumption or animal feeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not competent, as the Minister will appreciate, to comment on that.  I just do not know enough.  I am merely working on the statistics.  I must leave it to the people with first-hand knowledge to join issue with the Minister on that matter, if necessary. For my part, I accept his explanation. The point is, there must be a certain amount used up by the farmers for their own purposes.  I understand the flour regulations were tightened up, and I take it all these things have a bearing on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to make one point?  The figures of delivery to the mills per year are not altogether comparable as the proportion that may be retained each year may vary.  When there is a shortage of bread and flour, a greater percentage is likely to be retained than when there is a plentiful supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to corroborate Deputy Cogan to some extent.  It is somewhat significant that in the years when oats were cheap there were bigger deliveries of wheat to the mill.  That seems to suggest itself from the sequence of figures here.  However, I am dealing with a set of statistics, and I will not pretend that I can deal <Col N="1542" /> with the matter from first-hand knowledge. Supposing, for the sake of argument, I take the Minister's yields, that only strengthens the argument I am advancing to him.  I think he will appreciate that, because, if the yields are of the low order he talks about, and even conceding his point about extraction, it does seem to point then to a real urgency in increasing our wheat acreage to a self-sustaining figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What would that figure be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair question, but if the Minister's figures are right, as given to me, first, in taking the war yield, I was prepared to base myself on a minimum of round about what we had during the war.  Now it is quite clear that it must be greater. This is something to which the Minister must give his attention.  I am not concerned with what the Minister's view has been in the past.  We have a specific situation to face in a specific set of circumstances.  In regard to this most important item of human food, I urge that we should get as quickly as possible to the stage where we can say that, at a pinch, we are able to get by on such wheat as we can produce here.  I think that from these figures it is not impossible.  Even 660,000 acres under wheat during the war was not sufficient at the then rate of consumption on the then standards.  On the other hand, we were never rationed for bread or flour during the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We ate 100 per cent. extraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite true, and we could have afforded to tighten our belts a bit.  These figures warrant us in saying that the target which I have asked the Minister to put before himself is feasible and attainable and within the practical regions of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would require between 800,000 and 900,000 acres of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present rate of consumption?  Is that the Minister's estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the figures during the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1543" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if it would be as high as that.  We used to estimate at that time about two-thirds and the average for the war was not as high as 600,000.  These are niceties of arithmetic, very intriguing at times, but when one goes into such details one can overemphasise their importance. I want to point out that we are not in that position, that on all the evidence available, if supplies were cut off during the period before next harvest we would be in a very serious position for a year.  Thereafter, having regard to the likely acreages for next year, unless some very energetic action is taken by the Minister, that precarious position will not only last for the year ensuing but will go into the next year as well.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the over all situation, I think that is dangerous and I commend to the Minister to pay as urgent and energetic attention to that problem as he possibly can.  If the worst were to come&mdash;and I do not want to be a Jeremiah about it&mdash;we could face a very serious and unmanageable situation indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not wishing to give the Deputy a short answer, what would he suggest should be done, except to pack the storage with wheat and plough as much land as we are able to plough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This year there has been the question of weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not sow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This year has been difficult, but I think a lot of the difficulty has been due to a lack of foresight in the past two years&mdash;as I said before the Minister came in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers were not asked to grow wheat until the 1st of April&mdash;that is the whole secret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Next year the same thing might happen.  These very same points were made by myself more generally last year and the Minister would not see what was before him.  I know that the Taoiseach and the leaders of the Government formerly took one view and I suppose the Minister took line with them; but they have thrown over that one and with all <Col N="1544" /> their talk about difficult situations and difficult times ahead, coupled with the existing situation which the Minister has to face, it is time to cut out the talk and do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy realise that 50 per cent. more wheat was grown in this country this year than there was in 1939?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the figures.  In 1939 there were 255,000 acres under wheat and in 1950-51 366,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at the yield.  The yield was 189,000 tons in 1939 and 251,000 tons now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to the mills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so, that does not answer my point.  I am always ready, and so is everyone on this side, to concede that we were fortunate in many respects the last time and were not put to the pinch that a real emergency would require.  We are all willing to admit that, but the fact that a kind Providence gave us the possibility of learning a lesson so painlessly is all the more reason why we should buckle down and see that such a weak position does not recur.  The position was weak enough, in spite of the fact that the tillage under wheat in 1939 was something over ten times the tillage for 1932, when the Fianna Fáil Government took over.  However, that is the past and what I am concerned about is the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning from the question of wheat, which is a staple food for the human, we had better look at potatoes.  In the acreage there, there has not been any very spectacular change.  Nevertheless, the acreage last year at 336,000 is down over the emergency years and is only very slightly greater than that of 1939.  I am not going into the yields and acres there, but there is one thing I would mention, as a result of a question yesterday.  I asked his colleague for some information in regard to chemicals likely to be essential and likely to be in short supply; and amongst those chemicals was copper sulphate, bluestone.  When I turned up the statistics, I found that we imported <Col N="1545" /> in 1949, 2,730 tons and in 1950, 2,369 tons.  I imagine that the bulk of that was used for agricultural purposes. I may be wrong and am open to correction, or even to be laughed at, if the point is a silly one.  If it is not a silly one, it is high time we considered the question of adequate supplies of bluestone in case of a cut-off.  The famine of '48 was, I understand, the result of blight.  Will the Minister for Agriculture depend on such supplies? I wonder if the Minister is giving any attention to that problem.  It is one that should receive attention under the present situation.  The Minister appreciates why I raise the matter now.  I was told that there was no other chemical beyond two already mentioned under active consideration. That and the other matters which I mentioned earlier really merit attention now.</P>
    <P>It gets me back to what I was saying earlier&mdash;perhaps I should not repeat myself&mdash;when I was pressing upon the Minister, in his absence, the need for a basic fertiliser industry here.  I was criticising him on the ground that it would have been better to aim at fertilising and maintaining the fertilisation of the land which we already had available, in priority to reclaiming other land.  If there were funds available and while the chance was there, we should have been building up this basic industry for the provision of fertilisers.  The raw materials can all be provided for, not only in current times but also for a considerable period of absolute isolation.  That industry would be not only important to our agricultural economy, but it could be the nucleus about which a chemical industry would expand.</P>

      <P>Let us deal with all that.  What do we need?  Phosphates in some form or another.  In regard to phosphates, with a proper <Col N="1546" /> drive surely we could have been able to stockpile.  I agree that that by itself is weak, but in this case it is justified: there is an emergency reserve in Clare.  With regard to potash, you can get a certain amount of potash locally if you go about it.  You could organise to get it.  There are certain sources from which it could be got&mdash; kelp, say.</P>

      <P>I would be very glad to have all the considerations put before us, as we have had no statement from any Minister and no indication over the past year.  I have personally asked a number of questions and all I can elicit from the Minister for Industry and Commerce is that the matter is under consideration.  If the Minister will be good enough to furnish us with information upon which we can join issue more specifically, I will be grateful.</P>
      <P>We talked about storage.  I confess I am not quite clear as to what the position is.  It was a big problem the last time and it will be interesting to find out where we stand in regard to that problem now.  Again, there is the problem of mechanisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>There are a number of things mentioned.  Perhaps the deficiency may be in me.  Nevertheless, it is a very important matter.  The next thing is the question of the mechanisation of agriculture.  I think we were agreed last year that a certain tendency in that direction is inevitable under modern conditions.  It is very hard to go against the tide, but it does in itself pose a problem, a problem in regard to parts, in regard to equipment, in regard to fuel for tractors and so forth.  The Minister was sympathetic when the matter was mentioned last year.  If he has anything further to add to that, it would be of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> I have talked on this Estimate exclusively from two points of view, as I said in the beginning.  I talked from the point of view of the consumer in the city on certain problems and thereafter dealt with the general situation. I was concerned with the possibility of facing an emergency in the future. That was my approach.  I think it is a justifiable approach now and I think the Minister is not now going to say I am an alarmist.</P>
    <P>If that is to be our approach, it finally gets me back on general policy to the Minister's statement which I quoted.  The Minister will recollect that in opening the debate he said that he did not want to limit our live stock to the capacity of our own lands to produce and he visualised the taking in of raw materials for processing and then exporting the live stock.  I indicated that I joined issue with him in that respect, even on the basis of normal economics, and said I thought it was dangerous to take that point of view at present, if the result is going to be excessive dependence on outside and if it is to be achieved at the expense of that self-reliance about which I am pressing him now.  In making this case, I am trying to do so as objectively as I can.  It is not a matter of saying: &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;; or of scoring a point for the moment.  There is a big national problem there, a problem which in the interest of the country, must be solved as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest in connection with this question of the balance of food supplies that, when the increase in butter prices and the rumoured increase in bread prices takes place, that the Minister bear in mind the increases in jam and margarine which have already taken place.  In saying that, I wish to put before him for consideration in a nut shell the problem of the consumer in the town in relation to that over-all and admittedly difficult problem which he has.  I can appreciate his problem in regard to milk and the danger to the consumer of failing supplies, and the argument even from the consumer's point of view for increasing the price of milk so as to ensure the consumer's supplies. Nevertheless, there is this specific problem for the town consumer, <Col N="1549" /> and if bread is likely to go up as jam and margarine have gone up, and if butter is to go up, I should like the Minister to take it into account and do what he can.</P>
    <P>While talking about butter, he made some reference to me and to my representations in that matter.  He may not recollect it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that it was on my representations that he tried to meet the city situation by making more available.  I should like to be courteous and to say that that is appreciated.  I am sorry that it cannot be continued, but in relation to that problem also where the whole country is involved, again I should like him to take the town aspect into consideration as well as the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped next year that, if the necessity to import butter arises, the imported butter will be distributed exclusively off the ration and the Irish butter entirely on the ration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That even is something. In any event, I can leave it at this, if the Minister will look on me as still urging my point of view as strongly as I can but, I hope, as reasonably as I can.</P>
      <P>There is another conclusion which might be one for the Minister to reply to.  His colleague, the Minister for Industry, mentioned mutton when I spoke about beef, but it is rather interesting to find a rather big decline in the quantity of cattle consumed at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>On the fat and protein end of diet, there is certainly a problem.  We have margarine, butter and meat problems but again I can leave it by asking that the townsman's point of view will not be overlooked, particularly because in this debate all the problems which confront the Minister in his very difficult task naturally tend to be looked at from the point of view of the farmer.</P>
      <P>I can leave the rest of the debate to people more competent to deal with its details than I am.  I purposely tried to deal with it in the over-all sense.  There is no use in our talking about preparing for the future; there is no use in talking about defence; and there is no use in trying to build up our people or to provide for them in the difficult time that is coming&mdash;it may be that there may be no calamity and let us hope there will not be; I should like to believe that there will not, but whatever is in front of us there is going to be difficulty and the Minister will agree that there is a period of difficulty ahead of us-without the self-reliant approach which I urge.  I think it is best for our people in any event, and, in spite of the Minister's former views we can point to the facts in regard to one emergency as justifying those who took that view in the past.  No matter what our predilections might be, the hard facts of the present situation dictate one approach, and I think we should be all agreed upon that now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. P.D. Lehane Mr. P.D. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pay certain tributes to the Minister and to make certain criticisms and appeals to him.  During the past few days we have heard people&mdash;shopkeepers, solicitors, barristers and publicans&mdash; telling us how prosperous the agricultural community are, and I think we were told that some of them even have motor-cars.  There are certain aspects of this matter which we should consider carefully and seriously on this Estimate.  Some of these people probably spoke sincerely and honestly and others may have spoken with ulterior motives.  I will go into the details in the near future, but there is one person who gave expression to certain views yesterday, a <Col N="1551" /> person who is qualified in many ways to give such an expression of views so far as the agricultural community is concerned whom I should like to quote.  I refer to the co-adjutor Bishop of Cork, Dr. Lucey, who is a very brilliant man.  He is a bishop and has special knowledge of rural conditions by reason of the fact that he is a member of the Emigration Commission and has heard all the evidence placed before that commission. He said yesterday as reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of to-day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;How often do we not hear expressions like: &lsquo;Oh, he is only an &ldquo;ould&rdquo; farmer&rsquo;: &lsquo;the farmer does nothing but grumble&rsquo;: &lsquo;what is the world coming to with farmers buying motor-cars, if you please.&rsquo; Until we get over the notion that farming is less respectable than trading, working in a Government office, being a civil servant, etc., we are not valuing the farmer at his true worth to God and the community.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I don't want any levelling down of the townsman's wage to the country rate&mdash;God forbid.  The townsman's wages are low enough God knows.  But I do want a levelling up of the country labourer's wages to the urban standard.  And that can come only by way of a just price for milk, eggs, pigs, poultry&mdash;the produce of mixed or genuine farming.  At the moment the prices for these commodities are too low to give the farmer himself or his man the standard of living others in the community have.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that that is an answer to the gentlemen who prate here about the tremendous prosperity which the farmers are enjoying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a great deal about subsidies. We were told that the farmers are being subsidised to the extent of something like £10,000,000 a year.  Let us analyse that statement.  Where do the subsidies come from?  They come from the general community&mdash;from the taxpayers and from the consumers.  It will be seen, therefore, that the farmers themselves are contributing a <Col N="1552" /> large portion towards those subsidies. In addition, the agricultural community are paying a heavy land tax.  That tax is called &ldquo;annuities&rdquo; but at the moment it is a land tax.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister for Agriculture, the farming industry is subsidising the leather industry or the bootmakers industry, I do not know which, to the extent of approximately £2,000,000 a year.  I believe that that is correct because the price of hides is artifically depressed in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a subsidy on butter.  The Minister himself and every reasonable man must admit that that subsidy is a consumer's subsidy because there is a general price for butter in this country which is higher than the subsidised price for butter.</P>
    <P>There are many other respects in which the agricultural community are paying&mdash;and they are paying colossally more for subsidies to somebody else than the subsidies which are being paid to them.</P>
    <P>Under the present Party Government we have a lovely idea&mdash;it was very successfully worked by the previous Government and now it is being successfully worked by the present Government&mdash;and that is to bribe the people with their own money, after deducting a considerable percentage for administrative expenses, something on the scale of the sweepstakes.  Once upon a time it was illegal to bribe a voter with the candidate's money. However, a much better system has been found and that is to bribe the voter with his own money and to pocket the rest of it for the Exchequer. I am afraid that in the case of the present Government, as in the case of the previous Government, we have had an indication on several occasions of this urban or Dublin mentality which has affected any piece of legislation affecting agriculture in this country.  Recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce put himself on record as saying that if we were to adopt the collective farming scheme, advocated by Deputy Cowan, the farmers would be a much lesser draw on the Exchequer&mdash;in spite of the fact that this is an agricultural country and that the only real wealth <Col N="1553" /> we have in this country is the wealth produced by the agricultural community. The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that if we adopt Deputy Cowan's system of collective farming the farmers will then be a lesser draw on the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister, as a Minister of a democratic Government, was wrong in refusing to meet a group of people who claim to represent the dairying industry.  The Minister&mdash; rather bad-manneredly, I think&mdash;told the people that he would not meet the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association but that he would treat with the I.A.O.S.  Last year the Minister said that unless his lovely scheme of 2d. a gallon less for milk over a period of five years was accepted, some very terrible results would fall upon the dairy farmers of the country.  When the Minister wanted the I.A.O.S. to impose that proposal and that scheme on the country, what did the I.A.O.S. do?  They held a meeting in Plunkett House and they said: &ldquo;We are an organisation to set up co-operative societies.  It is none of our function to deal with the matter of price.  Our function is to give advise in respect of the formation of co-operative societies and to give what technical advice we can give afterwards&mdash;but we have nothing to do with the matter of price.&rdquo;  Nevertheless, the Minister refused to meet the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, and said that he would deal with the I.A.O.S., who made that decision less than 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also said that the costs of milk production have not increased since 1947.  It is possible that the Minister may seriously believe that statement but if the Minister believes it I may say that nobody else does. The Minister has claimed in this House that he has increased agricultural wages by 33 per cent., that he has given an annual holiday to the farm workers and also that a weekly half-holiday is being given to them.  The Minister must realise that these three steps in themselves must of necessity increase the costs of production.  In reply to two questions which I put to <Col N="1554" /> the Minister he said: &ldquo;There will be no increase in the price of milk this year.&rdquo;  Yet, a couple of days after giving me that reply the Minister announced that the price of milk was going to be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that on two occasions in this House the Minister told me that he would not agree to any increase this year in the price of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact. However, the Minister then came and offered an increase.  After meeting the people who told us last year that they had nothing to do with the matter of price, the Minister came and increased the price by 1d. a gallon.</P>
      <P>Since this debate stasted the Minister has, on a number of occasions, said: &ldquo;£1,000,000 a year is a great deal for the farmers.&rdquo;  Everybody knows that the farmers are not getting £1,000,000 a year.  The Minister knows that since 1947 the costs of manufacturing milk in creameries have increased. The Minister knows that they are increasing again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministier must be aware that the managers have applications to the Labour Court in respect of increased wages for creamery employees.  The Minister must be aware that the price of packing and the price of packets and of everything else in the creamery is going up.  Surely, in these circumstances, the Minister must realise that the increase of ¾d. or 1d. a gallon will be swamped in the extra charges that have occurred already, and that will continue to occur, before the end of the year, and that the extra money will not go into the pockets of the farmers at all.  It is part of the propaganda <Col N="1555" /> however of the urban-minded people in this House to increase the price of butter by 2d. a lb. and say: &ldquo;That is more of the stuff the farmers are sucking out of us&rdquo; while at the same time the increase is only enough to pay some of the increased costs of manufacture, some of which were imposed by the Government and some by circumstances completely outside the control of the committees running the creameries.</P>
    <P>A very famous quotation was mentioned to-day and I would like to add to it: there are lies, damn lies, statistics and the Minister quoting Professor Murphy's costings.  The Minister has on several occasions misquoted in a most dishonest way a scientific document prepared by a professor in University College, Cork.  The Minister is a man of ability and must know that he was misinterpreting him and every officer of his Department must know that too.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond speaking on this Estimate said that he had found a solution for the farmers' difficulties. His solution was not 1d., 2d. or 3d. per gallon but that everybody should get cows like those Mr. Quill had in Blarney.  I am afraid that Deputy Desmond will find it difficult to get the Minister to agree to that because the cows Mr. Quill had in Blarney happened to be Friesians and the Minister said that it was only cranks and old maids that keep these Pekinese breeds.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a very simple question to-day.  It was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture whether he has made an Order to prevent milk, other than pasteurised milk, from being offered for sale in any specified area in the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any sane man would think that the answer to that was yes or no.  The second part of the question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If he has not made an Order in such case, whether he will give an assurance that he will not do so?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any sane man would think that the answer to that was yes or no, too, but instead of that the Minister gave me a big rigmarole and started by making this statement:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" />&ldquo;It has been suggested that there was some delay on my part in replying to this question.  There is no foundation for this allegation.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You put down the question wrong and they could not find you for ten days to correct it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. P.D. Lehane Mr. P.D. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made that statement; I asked the Minister who made the allegation and the Minister said that I had.  I told the Minister that I had not, that I had made no such allegations at all. I put down the question more than ten days ago in a different form and the Ceann Comhairle disallowed it. The clerk in the Ceann Comhairle's office came to me yesterday and told me that the Ceann Comhairle had disallowed the question.  I should like the Minister to explain why he said that I made the allegation that there was a delay on his part in replying; I never made any such allegation. However, yes or no is what I am looking for and this is the rigmarole:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I might add to the reply just given to the same question by the Minister for Health that there is, of course, no question of genuine opposition by the public....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think I should bore the House with that, but the final paragraph states&mdash;because the Minister must have a crack at somebody:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I cannot believe that the Deputy is prepared to characterise himself as an advocate of the sale of tubercular milk.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the answer to my question asking whether he had made an Order &mdash;that I am an advocate for the sale of tubercular milk.  However, we will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>On the question of pigs there is one matter for which I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister, that is for the courageous action he took in opening the Border for the export of pigs at the time when the bacon curers were trying to hold the producers up to ransom. They wanted cheap pigs and dear bacon.  I know that it was a difficult and courageous thing for the Minister to do and I want to say that we thank him and that we appreciate the courageous action he took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> The price of pigs was controlled on the 2nd December by the Prices Advisory Body but shortly afterwards the control on the price of pig feeding-stuffs was removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was. The price of bacon was controlled and that pegs down at a certain level the price of pigs.  It depressed the price of pigs while at the same time the Advisory Body took the control off the raw material for the feeding of pigs and there is something wrong about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

The price of bacon was controlled on the 2nd December and that pegs the price of pigs down to their 2nd December price but the price of the raw materials which were being put into the pigs was decontrolled. The price of the raw materials can soar as high as it likes but the price of pigs is kept down.</P>

      <P>With regard to eggs, I hope that the Minister will be successful in making a satisfactory agreement in England.  I can tell him that there is very grave dissatisfaction throughout the country at the existing price of eggs and I think that the Minister is quite well aware of that himself.  I hope that he will succeed in making a decent agreement which will give some sort of reasonable remuneration to the people who are trying to produce eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing I have against the Minister in that regard is the fact that he publicly said that 2d. was a good price for an egg.  I thought he was terribly indiscreet on that occasion.  It was also very unfortunate that the price of eggs should fall and that the price of meal should increase at the <Col N="1558" /> same time, particularly when the Minister had given an assurance that devaluation would not affect the price of meal and that the price of meal would not increase in the foreseeable future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, having admitted that because of our climatic conditions it was very difficult to grow any sort of decent wheat in this country, has made a definite statement.  A number of <Col N="1559" /> people, both on this side and on the other side of the House, have made a very great error in talking about an increase in the price of wheat.  There is no increase in the price of wheat bushelling a standard weight.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell me when to stop?  Here is the quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The second lesson that we may learn, with advantage, from our trying experience is the folly of pretending that, in a climate such as ours, we can with any degree of certainty depend on our domestic production of wheat for our essential bread supplies.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Ah!</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. P.D. Lehane Mr. P.D. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am coming to is that the price of wheat bushelling 57 lb. is still the same this year as it was last year.  The Minister <Col N="1560" /> has admitted that our climate is not conducive to good wheat growing, or the growing of good quality wheat, so actually there is no increase in the price of wheat of standard weight, but we may anticipate there will be a reduction in the price of wheat below 57 lb., because the regulations will probably be enforced more stringently than in the past.  But, apart from that, wheat bushelling 57 lb. this year as last year can be purchased, or will be purchased, for £25 a ton&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. P.D. Lehane Mr. P.D. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and at the same time producers of live-stock products and poultry products are expected to pay £32 or £33 a ton for maize.  I am afraid it is very difficult to get people to market wheat at £25 a ton or even, if it bushels 62 lb., at £27 a ton, and buy a mixture of one part maize and three parts sorghums for £32.  I do not think the Minister is doing what he says he is doing, that is, getting wheat grown by price inducement, because there is no price inducement in growing wheat to produce flour and bran at £30 a ton when it is out of proportion with the price of the animal feeding stuffs on the market.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to certain problems in the West, particularly problems where cattle got certain diseases that it took the veterinary officers a long time to discover.  They found that by shifting them from the island to the mainland, and <i>vice versa</i>, they were able to get over some of the difficulties.  The Minister said he had great regard for some of the views of the old people in the area, because they had learned in the old and tried school of experience.  Since the Minister is in that frame of mind, I may tell him that the people in West Cork have a similar idea about sea sand and, so far the Cork County Committee of Agriculture cannot learn much from the Department.  At least, what they have learned is that the scheme had to be dropped this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be consoled to know that I agree with the <Col N="1561" /> old people of West Cork in respect of sea sand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you agree with the old people to whom I have referred?  Thanks.  There is one matter I should like to mention, and it has reference to ground limestone.  I am afraid the Minister has not found the solution for this.  The Minister has passed over transport of the ground limestone completely to Córas Iompair Éireann.  Córas Iompair Éireann come along and dump the ground limestone on the side of the road.  I suppose it is the Minister's idea that some local lad should buy a lime spreader and shovel six tons of lime into the spreader and take it out to the field, perhaps one or two miles away.  I think the Minister is not handling that situation in the way it should be handled.  The Minister should give the benefit of the subsidy to anybody with a lime spreader who is prepared to take the lime from the depot.  It rather looks as if the present system is wasteful and as if the Minister is subsidising Córas Iompair Éireann rather than the farmer, because in many cases the Córas Iompair Éireann lorries may not go within a mile or two miles of the farmer's field, as they will not leave the public road; they will not go on any small byroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to have particulars, so that I can deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to give them.  The Minister referred to water supplies on the farmers' holdings. I wonder is there any use in appealing to the Minister about cases of farmers who carried out work after the Minister announced he was introducing this scheme?  The farmers got the work done and because they did not wait for sanction from the Department they were cut out of the grant. Will their cases be considered?  It can be proved conclusively that the work was done within certain dates and there was a period of only a few months between the Minister's announcement that the scheme was going ahead and the time when they put it into operation.  Will the Minister give sympathetic consideration to the cases of those people so that they can be brought within the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In general principle, no, but every individual case where an element of doubt exists is always considered sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point and that is in connection with some of the creameries or milk producing areas in West Cork.  The Minister was down there for the by-election and he promised them creamery facilities.  There are certain districts in that area where facilities should be provided.  There are numbers of people who had not creamery facilities and who were making farmers' butter at the particular time when the subsidy was removed.  There is a grave need for a separating station, at least, on Whiddy Island.  That is one thing that might be done.  There will be plenty of milk on the Island if they get facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in Bantry Bay.  I do not know how far out in the Bay the Drinagh Co-operative Society extends, but the island is in Bantry Bay, and it is quite close to the Dairy Disposals Board.  I appeal <Col N="1563" /> to the Minister to give due consideration to these people.  They are in a bad way and they desire a creamery.</P>
