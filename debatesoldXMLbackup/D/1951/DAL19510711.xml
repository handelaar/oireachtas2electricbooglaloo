      <P>The question of the co-ordination of drainage in its various aspects is a complicated one, with many difficulties.  There is already a certain degree of co-ordination of the drainage activities of the various Departments, but I am having the whole matter examined with a view to seeing whether anything further can be done in the direction indicated by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that during the term of office of the previous Government, the then Taoiseach accepted on behalf of the Government the principle of workers' representation on the boards of all State-sponsored bodies; and, if so, if he will state whether or not the present Government also accepts this principle, and whether he has any comment to make on the recent reappointment of the directors of Bord na Móna as announced in the Press on the 27th June, 1951.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have had, recently, correspondence on this subject with the Irish Trade Union Congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government does not consider it desirable that a representative of the workers employed in a State-sponsored commercial undertaking should be appointed to the board of directors.  It would be difficult if not impossible for any person nominated on this basis to combine his obligations as a director with his obligations as a <Col N="1269" /> representative of the workers.  Occasions, however, may arise where it might be both desirable and beneficial that persons with experience of trade union organisation and labour matters generally should be appointed to the boards of State-sponsored companies. Such persons would combine their experience in this field with the other qualities necessary in any director of a public undertaking and should, of course, be willing to participate in the management of the concern, sharing all the responsibilities incumbent on their fellow directors.  I do not feel called upon to relate this principle to any statement of policy which may have been made by the former Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>As regards Bord na Móna, the outgoing directors were recently reappointed, but no decision has been taken on the question of the desirability of appointing any additional members to the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the constitution of the directors of Bord na Móna has been one of the great difficulties in recent years with regard to the recruitment of labour; that the constitution of that board has no confidence as far as the workers are concerned and that that has given rise to tremendous difficulties with regard to turf production?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the constant shortage of electricity output, he will request the Electricity Supply Board to revise their development programme so as to ensure that the output of electricity will be adequate to meet the continually increasing demand for current and whether he will inform the Dáil of the steps it is proposed to take to overtake the continually mounting demand for current.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>On the 26th June, 1951, I discussed with the Electricity Supply Board the urgent need for the preparation of plans in consultation with Bord na Móna for the construction of additional turf-fired generating stations and the necessity to push forward with all possible speed, the completion of the schemes at Allenwood and Ferbane which have already been approved.  I have also asked the board to prepare immediately for submission to me a programme for increased generating capacity based on water power.  The general programme of the board for increasing the generating capacity to meet the rapidly growing demand has been examined and I am in communication with the board on the subject.  I will take an early opportunity to make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The position now is that a period of from ten months to 16 months would probably be required to finish the necessary surveys on the site and a further 12 months to prepare final drawings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have inquired from Córas Iompair Éireann and have been informed that it has accepted the award of the Labour Court in this <Col N="1273" /> matter.  The board states that it has been unable to pay the increase in wages recommended due to the failure of a number of the unions concerned to indicate their acceptance of the award.  Where, in respect of any grade of employee, the unions concerned have indicated their acceptance of the award, the board informs me that it proposes to pay the increases at an early date. Where there has been acceptance in respect of a section only of the workers in any grade, the board states it could not undertake to pay the increases on the basis of union affiliation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister impress upon Córas Iompair Éireann the importance of paying these increases as soon as possible&mdash;certainly in the case of the grades where the increases have been accepted by the unions involved?

      <P>I have received from the Trade Union Congress proposals for the amendment of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, including the change suggested in the Deputy's question. These proposals are under examination, but it is unlikely that a decision will be reached at an early date.  It will be appreciated that the benefits secured to workers under this Act are minimum benefits and that it does not preclude the securing of additional benefits by the ordinary processes of negotiation.</P>

      <P>No doubt the Minister is aware that the existing practice in regard to Good Friday creates widespread confusion not only in respect of the employers, but also in respect of the workers and the unions.  Will the Minister not agree that at least consideration might be expedited?  Each year the position becomes more difficult and each year the unions face the possibility of industrial conflict because of the widespread divergence of practice in this connection.</P>

Altogether some 1,150 proposals have been before the authority.  Of these 304 were initiated before the authority was set up.  By the 30th June, 1951, the number that had reached the production stage was 105, of which 56 related to proposals received prior to the establishment of the authority.  The question of approval only arose in the comparatively few cases where some special facilities were required by the promoters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide authority to make ex-gratia payments for settlement of claims for compensation in respect of loss arising from the abolition of freshwater netting which could not be dealt with under the compensation clauses of Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939.  That section was brought into operation so as to prohibit netting in fresh water as from the 1st January, 1948, and legal advice obtained on test cases showed that quite a number of persons who had formerly earned their livelihood, or, at any rate, derived certain income by the taking of salmon in freshwater nets, were not in a position to show title to fishing rights in the precise manner necessary to fulfil the requirements of the Act.  The late Government had introduced a Bill to deal with the subject in May, 1950, and I understand that they had under consideration a revision of the original Bill when the late Dáil was dissolved.  The present Bill deals with all the matters which the late Government had in mind and to that extent may be described as an agreed measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is one of six sections and detailed comment may be confined to Sections 2 and 3.  Section 2 provides for the making of ex-gratia payments <Col N="1317" /> and the classes of persons concerned may be divided into three groups to correspond with sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of the section.</P>
    <P>Group 1 consists of persons who owned fisheries in which freshwater netting was carried on not by themselves but by persons who fished under lease or in some cases by seasonal permit.  Such fishery owners were in-advertently excluded from compensation under the Act of 1939.  Not all freshwater fishery owners have in fact suffered any loss through the prohibition of freshwater netting&mdash;on the contrary many fisheries have appreciated in their value for angling purposes as a result of the nets being taken off to an extent far in excess of the rents formerly received from tenants who fished by means of nets.  It is, however, intended under this sub-section to deal with any case where an actual loss can be proved.</P>
    <P>The second group consists of persons who actually fished by means of nets in a freshwater fishery before the 1st January, 1948, but who for one reason or another were not in a position to prove that they had any legal right to use a net in that fishery on the critical date, for example, snap net fishermen of the Rivers Suir and Nore, some of whom operated under seasonal permit only while others fished merely by the tacit consent of some owner of a several fishery.  Such persons are admitted to have a moral claim to compensation but as they have no prospect of establishing a claim on the basis of strict legal right we can only deal with them by making ex-gratia grants.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) is intended to cover the various employees who have suffered a genuine loss through the termination of their employment at freshwater netting and whose claims have failed on technical grounds.  In some cases, the employees' claim has failed simply because the employer had not the necessary legal right to use a net and in other cases because the terms of employment did not fulfil the conditions laid down as to duration of employment, whether his remuneration formed the whole or a substantial part of his livelihood and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> We now come to Section 3 of the Bill, which contains provisions as to payment of interest and legal costs which did not appear in the Bill introduced last year.  Provisions of this nature had been urged on our predecessors and the Government has decided to adopt their proposals in the matter.  The section follows the conventional lines of provisions in existing legislation providing for payment of interest on purchase moneys of land compulsorily acquired, lodging of compensation money in court and contributing towards the costs of proving title.  These provisions will apply to compensation payable under the principal enactment, namely, Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) of Section 3, in providing for contributions by the Minister towards the cost of proving title does not go quite so far as the corresponding provisions in legislation relating to compulsory acquisition of land.  The difference is due to the fact that whereas in land cases the authority is acquiring something to which it must have good title and the cost of showing title is usually commensurate with the value of the occupier's interest in the land.  In these netting compensation cases, however, the Minister is not acquiring anything, he is simply making good the loss sustained through the extinction of the right of netting while the fishery remains in the occupation of the claimant.  Thus, part of the cost of proving title accrues to the ultimate benefit of the claimant should he ever engage in other transactions concerning his several fishery.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that both Section 2 and Section 3 require that application for compensation shall be made before the 1st January, 1952.</P>
    <P>The total sum to be paid by way of ex-gratia grants is limited by sub-section (5) of Section 2 to £60,000.  The further expenses arising under the Bill in respect of interest and costs are estimated at £13,500 for interest up to the 31st March, 1952, and £3,000 by way of contributions to legal costs, making a total of £76,500 up to the end of the present financial year.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate will be required to enable payments to be <Col N="1319" /> made under the Bill when enacted.  It is proposed that this should be introduced later in the year when the extent of savings on the present compensation sub-head and on the Fisheries Vote generally can be more closely estimated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary says in regard to this being substantially an agreed measure is perfectly correct.  The origin of this measure, as I know it, is that when the original Prohibition of Netting Act was passed, it was foreseen by the then Minister for Fisheries, my predecessor, that in a new procedure of this kind it was inevitable that certain categories of persons who had a moral claim to compensation would be overlooked.  He then forecast that when the original Act had been in operation for a certain time, and these categories of persons had emerged, a Bill of this character would be brought in.  This is the redemption of that undertaking given by my predecessor, implemented up to a point by myself and now carried to completion by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I appreciate the spirit underlying the proviso in Section 3 which provides that compensation shall not be payable unless an application therefor is made before the 1st day of January, 1952.  I think that, for the Parliamentary Secretary's own peace of mind, he ought to consider acquiring power to extend that period for a certain time.  Otherwise, as sure as there is an eye in a goat, he will be asked to bring in an amending Bill to give him discretion to extend the period so as to cover some real cases of hardship which arise where a simple person who clearly had a claim, for some reason for which we would all have sympathy, failed to comply with the formalities before the 1st January, 1952.  It is not a point of great substance.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to get all stages of the Bill before the recess, it is a matter which he could consider later on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to ask the <Col N="1320" /> House for discretion to extend the period himself.  While it is quite true that the bulk of the applications may now be in the Department of Fisheries, if in next February, some simple person or some group of simple people in Tipperary, or Kerry or Meath, or anywhere else, approach the Parliamentary Secretary and, having reviewed their case, he says to himself: &ldquo;If these people had come to me before the 1st January I should certainly have recommended a grant,&rdquo; he will feel it incumbent on him to take some steps to put the matter right and he will find himself with the obligation of introducing amending legislation.  I do not think I could press the Parliamentary Secretary to take a snap decision on this matter now.  I should like, however, to assure him that should he require facilities to acquire for himself some wider discretion than is envisaged in sub-section (2) of Section 3 I certainly will do anything in my power to facilitate him in getting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure on behalf of the people in my county whom it concerns.  I have been agitating for the past 12 months on behalf of men whose applications, for technical reasons or otherwise, were, so to speak, ruled out of court, and who were unable to obtain the necessary compensation.  We had cases of men who were employed in the Lord Kenmare estate and in the Bourne Vincent estate, Killarney.  Because these men were not employed at a specified date in a particular year, or because they had not the required number of weeks, their applications were ruled out as being eligible for compensation.  We have also the case where men employed on the Laune fishing are ruled out simply because they were not employed in certain months in the period specified in the Bill.  I pointed out both to the Minister at the time and to the Department that that fishery was not actually in operation on that date.  Fishing operations could not commence because of floods and for other reasons until later in the season.  But these technicalities had the effect of ruling the men out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this measure as a step in <Col N="1321" /> the right direction but I think that in some respects the awards are not adequate.  We have cases where men qualified for a miserable pittance.  I think it is an insult to these men to offer them such meagre compensation and I would make an appeal to have the position in that respect reviewed in order to give them some additional compensation.  If it is acceptable and if I am in order in doing so, I will put down a motion on the matter at a later date.</P>

      <P>I do not think there would be any insuperable difficulty about extending the time.  I understand the reason why it was made so short was in order to keep the amount of interest payable as low as possible. However, it seems to me that possibly a greater evil might be created and we would have to come along later on, as suggested by Deputy Dillon, with an amending Bill.  After consultation with the Department's advisers I think it may be possible to meet the suggested amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" /> I think the cases referred to by Deputy J. Flynn are provided for and the basis of compensation for employees is in or about two years' employment.  With regard to compensation for loss of other rights, in the last analysis that rests with the official arbitrator.  This measure, as we know, is an agreed measure and even on the point raised by Deputy Dillon I think we are all apparently agreed that it should be met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the very serious lack of accommodation in our mental hospitals, particularly in Grangegorman Mental Hospital which is world famous from the point of view of its medical services and which is, I think, the biggest in the country.  Yet, the accommodation there is inadequate. I would like the Minister to consider the possibility of improving conditions there and improving the amount of accommodation both in Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the hospital programme.  As far as I remember, the figure in connection with that programme was £7,500,000.  A certain number of hospitals were included in that general plan.  Other hospitals, even though they were in need of a certain amount of financial assistance, were excluded.  I want to refer in particular to the hospital at Baldoyle which is more or less an adjunct of Cappagh.  We all know the wonderful work that is done in Cappagh for children.  When children have received the necessary treatment at Cappagh they have then to be brought back by easy stages to normal life.  They cannot just be pushed up into possibly overcrowded homes where the work done in Cappagh will be undone due to environment.  They must be given a chance to rehabilitate themselves after treatment.</P>
      <P>Cappagh Hospital cannot afford to keep the children after they have completed the course of treatment, since that institution must have accommodation available to take others needing treatment at the earliest possible moment.  Those requiring rehabilitation are transferred to Baldoyle.  A child who has received treatment for a deformed leg cannot just get up and walk as soon as the treatment is completed. The child must be brought back to normality in easy stages.  That part of the work is done at Baldoyle Hospital, but the accommodation at Baldoyle is absolutely inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> If we regard this hospital as one working in conjunction with Cappagh &mdash;that is the way we should regard it because Cappagh has not the accommodation which will enable it to carry out the type of rehabilitation done at Baldoyle&mdash;we find the children in Baldoyle not having any kind of adequate accommodation.  Finances should be made available so that some proper housing accommodation could be provided for these children.  At the present time the children are accommodated in some kind of old wooden structure, very nicely kept inside by the staff but absolutely inadequate for the purpose. I hope that the Minister for Health will carry out some alterations in the general hospital programme so that certain hospitals which were not included in the general plan can now be included and the necessary financial assistance made available to them.  I feel that if this is done, it will be a very great service to the many young children going into Cappagh.  It will put the finishing touches to the worldfamous treatment made available at Cappagh Hospital.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night that I thought we should begin by improving our dispensaries because the dispensary is really the health centre for the majority of our people.  Recourse can be had to the hospitals when a case becomes more serious, but the dispensary in the first instance is the health centre.  I hope, now that the city boundaries are being extended, the Minister for Health will ensure that a clinic will be provided in or near Finglas within the shortest possible time.  There has been an agitation for a long time to have such a clinic provided at Finglas.  Those behind the project were the Jubilee Nurses' Association.  We are all aware of the great work done by that voluntary organisation in various localities and they are very anxious that a clinic should be provided at Finglas, having regard to the growing population of that area.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I know that there is a convalescent home for nurses at Howth.  Some kind of grant was made available by the Department of Health which enabled that building to be <Col N="1325" /> renovated.  There are certain extensions still needed and it is only right that we should have a proper convalescent home for nurses who fall ill while rendering service to the sick in various hospitals.  I believe myself that this Howth convalescent home should be brought to a stage which would enable us to provide suitable treatment for nurses who fall ill in the discharge of their duties.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that it is proposed to implement the Health Act, 1947, about which there was so much controversy.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether he intends to clean up that Bill.  There are certain clauses in it which were considered objectionable.  They were believed to be a violation of the Constitution and it was considered that certain provisions of the Bill offended the propriety of the individual.  These matters were pointed out to the present Minister when he was Minister for Health in 1947 but no action was taken.  I think the medical profession in particular pointed out these clauses. At a later stage, a letter was directed by the Irish Hierarchy to the Fianna Fáil Taoiseach of that time.  Apart from a formal acknowledgement, that letter was not replied to.  I feel that ordinary courtesy demands that some action should be taken and certainly consideration should be given to the representations made.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister whether it is intended to amend the 1947 Health Act in any way.  The argument was put forward by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne, that if it were proposed to implement another mother and child welfare scheme, apart from the one which he was anxious to implement himself, it would be necessary to amend the 1947 Act.  I want to know from the Minister whether it will be necessary to amend the 1947 Act if it is not intended to put through the scheme which Deputy Dr. Browne had in mind or whether it is his intention to put through the type of scheme which Deputy Dr. Browne was anxious to implement some months ago.  I think it is only right that we should hear from the Minister about the 1947 <Col N="1326" /> Health Act in regard to which there was so much controversy and, possibly, misunderstanding.  He should clear the air for the House and the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate on this Estimate, various aspects of the entire health services have been adverted to.  Some Deputies have, of course, concentrated on particular aspects, but anybody who surveys our health services to-day must realise that these services fall far short of the standard necessary to provide adequate treatment for our people and to improve the standard of the nation's health.  It is quite true, of course, that during the past 30 years considerable improvements have been effected in our health services.  It is quite true that the standard is better to-day than it was 30 years ago but, having said that, one cannot feel satisfied that our services have yet reached a standard with which we can be content or that they are as good as they are in many other countries with resources not very much greater than we have here.  Let it be said, because I think it is too often ignored, that for a good deal of the improvements which have been secured in our hospitals and sanatoria we have to thank the Hospital Sweepstakes Fund.  Were it not for the very substantial sums made available from the sweepstakes for the past 20 years, one wonders what our hospitals and sanatoria services would be like to-day. If you subtract from what has been injected into the provision of hospitals and sanatoria the amount of money received from the Hospital Sweepstakes Fund, you will find that the State itself was a relatively small contributor to the funds provided for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear to anybody who has given the matter any thought that what the country needs to-day is not just a mother and child scheme but a comprehensive health service covering not merely the mother and child but also citizens who are not mothers or children.  Concentration on one aspect of our health service can only lead to neglect of other aspects of that service which are no less urgent and the provision of which will make no less contribution <Col N="1327" /> to the nation's welfare than the provision of a particular health scheme.  To-day we have no comprehensive health service.  Our present health services are disjointed; they are unco-ordinated and deficient and there is still, unfortunately, painful evidence that it is the depth of the purse and not the need of the citizen which determines the standard of medical service provided for some of our citizens.  We have got to abandon that mentality entirely.  The test of medical treatment ought not to be the depth, width or length of the purse.  We ought to organise, not one aspect of our health services, but all aspects of our health services on the basis of giving to each and every citizen the best possible medical service and the best skilled attention that can be made available for the provision of curative treatment for our citizens.</P>
    <P>We can see before our eyes to-day the deficiencies which loom up before us in the matter of our health services. Take the position, for instance, of the mentally defective child.  Will anybody who has taken the trouble to study the problem of the mentally defective child attempt to say that our present facilities for dealing with that problem are anything like adequate?</P>
    <P>If any Deputy tries to get a mentally defective child into an institution he will realise how woefully inadequate is the institutional treatment provided. There is no other form of treatment available for the child; it is impossible to treat mentally defective children at all.  Mothers beset with the problem of looking after other children cannot possibly concentrate on the one mentally deficient child, particularly if that child has got habits which are known clinically as the habits of smashing.  The only treatment available for that type of child is in an institution, but there are literally thousands of children waiting to get into those institutions.  These children are not cured when they go into these institutions; they are merely housed there.  There are no discharges from the institutions and no vacancies except those created by death or the extension of the buildings.  The result is that there is <Col N="1328" /> a complete clutter up in these institutions. They want to do more work, to accommodate more children and to discharge the high mission which the religious orders conducting these institutions undertake, but they are frustrated in doing so by insufficient funds, insufficient accommodation, with the result that the unfortunate mother has to deal with the mentally deficient child at home and is unable to get for that child the proper institutional treatment which we ought to provide if we have any pretence to be a civilised community.</P>
    <P>One has only got to visit the St. John of God's institution at Blackrock, the other institution at Drumcar, or the Stewart institution at Palmerstown to see the magnificent work which is being done for the mentally deficient child.  One has only got to ask the medical superintendents in these institutions if they are in a position to offer accommodation to all those seeking admission in order to be speedily awakened to the fact that they have applications from all over the country and are compelled to refuse them. Not only that, but these institutions find themselves in such a financially embarrassed position that they are unable to undertake the provision of extended accommodation to provide the means of housing mentally deficient children.</P>
    <P>It is true that some money has been given to these institutions, but it is a mere drop in the ocean compared with what is needed to provide adequate institutions for the accommodation of these mentally afflicted children.  Until we face up to that problem, do it speedily, do it in a big and comprehensive way, we cannot claim to have tackled wholeheartedly, or with a view to arriving at a satisfactory solution of the problem, our medical services.</P>
    <P>Take the treatment of the blind. There are three or four institutions which cater for blind persons.  One is the St. Mary's institution run by the Sisters of Charity at Merrion which does excellent work there under the most difficult conditions.  It is a pleasure to anybody to visit that institution, to see the loving care bestowed by the nuns of that community on the <Col N="1329" /> blind entrusted to their care and their zeal and enthusiasm to do the best they can to equip the blind child for the battle of life.  Nobody who has seen that institution can have anything but the highest admiration for the magnificent work which goes on there in order to give the handicapped blind child an opportunity of fighting the battle of life and taking his or her place in the community of which he or she in better circumstances might be a normal member.</P>
    <P>Then when one goes to St. Joseph's institution at Drumcondra one finds about eight Carmelite Brothers, the only members of the Order in Ireland, with no recruitment into the Order I think for the past 15 years, struggling against a constantly mounting bank overdraft to try to provide accommodation for the blind persons in that institution. They have no money to buy the barest necessities of the institution, no money to repaint it, no money to provide proper bedding and clothing.</P>
    <P>I paid a visit to that institution three years ago and I felt it needed money so urgently for painting, renovation, decoration, structural alterations, improved toilet accommodation and the provision of better beds and better bed clothes that I resolved to try to get them some money.  After about three years' hard work we managed finally to get them a sum of over £20,000 for the purpose of carrying out certain reconstruction and renovation work which was absolutely necessary.  That money was got from the Hospitals Trust Fund and then I believe only on a rather strained interpretation of the relevant Act which threw some doubt on whether money, in fact, could be made available for an institution of that kind which was not a hospital or a sanatorium.  That institution has to be run on what it can collect from door to door and with the relatively small assistance which it has received from the State and the local authorities in respect of patients who reside within the institutions.  As I say, when one sees the accommodation provided for blind persons and goes and sees similar accommodation provided in Belgium, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark <Col N="1330" /> and Switzerland, one realises how far behind, at times, is the accommodation and the amenities which we provide here in comparison with those provided in other countries where the same problem has to be faced and where it has only been successfully faced on the basis of State intervention, that is the State making the funds available to do this necessary work.</P>
    <P>The question of dispensaries has been raised here.  While many things have changed in this country over the past 30 years, while the face of the world has changed and the face of the frontiers of Europe has changed, the one thing that has not changed in Ireland has been the dispensary.  It has withstood the downfall of empires; it has withstood changes of frontier; it has seen gigantic armies march across the frontiers of Europe, gigantic nations tumble and a world cataclysm. Still it has survived all that.  There it still is&mdash;an immovable relic of the detestable poor law system of other days.  I do not blame any particular Government for this.  I think it is a reflection on and a shame for every Government, and contrary to our whole concepts of human and spiritual values.</P>
    <P>I recall that in my own constituency in 1938 and in 1939 we tried to get four dispensaries built at a cost of about £2,000 each.  However, the wiseacres in the Department of Local Government said: &ldquo;That is far too dear.&rdquo; Nothing was done during the emergency, and afterwards the county council advertised for the building of the four same dispensaries and got tenders in at nearly £8,000 apiece. Again, the wiseacres in the Department of Local Government said: &ldquo;That is far too dear.&rdquo;  This state of affairs will go on for another two years, and by then the cost will have further increased. If somebody had taken time by the forelock and had showed some little imagination, the dispensaries would have been built in 1938 at a cost of £8,000 for the four, but they would now cost £30,000 or £32,000.  One cannot get a properly organised dispensary service by this crab-like approach to the whole problem.</P>
    <P>In the main, our dispensaries, as to <Col N="1331" /> 90 per cent. of them, are bleak buildings, unrelieved in drabness, cold, usually dirty, and rarely painted.  Anybody who goes into a dispensary for the purpose of having a disease treated comes out again with the disease coupled with a good cold or a good does of influenza.  Children who have got to be brought there for treatment, must stay outside in a queue in their prams until their turn comes.  I am not blaming the doctor for this, because he cannot build a new dispensary and, if a nurse is in attendance, I am not blaming her.  All this is the function of the local authority, and the work should be spurred on by the Department of Health.  A new crusade to provide decent dispensaries should be launched &mdash; comfortable places where people will find conditions tolerable when they have occasion to visit them, where they will be encouraged to come and get the best medical advice that is available&mdash;so that the dispensaries themselves will not have the forbidding appearance and the grim outlook that they have to-day.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give attention to the problem of dispensaries. I do not blame any particular Minister or any particular Government in a matter of this kind.  It is a festering sore that we have never got down to eliminate.  We ought to do something in the way of providing decent dispensaries for our people.  There is no reason why we cannot do so.  The money is there, the material is there, the labour force to build the dispensaries is there and both the materials and the labour force are likely to become available in increasing quantities in the future as the housing problem moves on speedily towards a solution.</P>
    <P>All schemes of health services throw up at once the question as to the method of financing those schemes. That arose particularly in the case of the mother and child scheme.  A considerable amount of time and attention was given to the question of providing a mother and child scheme as part of a scheme of general medical services. As I said at the outset, what we need <Col N="1332" /> is a comprehensive medical services scheme covering the entire country and open and available to every member of the community.</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne has referred to what he described as his mother and child scheme.  It is not necessary now either to go into the details of that scheme or to refer to the circumstances in which it was abandoned, except to say this: since Deputy Dr. Browne has pontificated on that matter so much and so often, and so frequently indulged in serious misrepresentations of the facts and of the views of others, if that scheme had been handled by any Minister with ordinary care, with ordinary prudence and by a Minister who did not believe in bull-in-the-china-shop tactics, that scheme might well have been brought to maturity by this stage. But Deputy Dr. Browne, as he now is, was heedless of advice from his own colleagues, was heedless of the efforts of the Hierarchy to help him&mdash;and they tried to help him and not to thwart him; I know that from my own personal experience as one who tried to help him.  If Deputy Dr. Browne had heeded the advice of his own colleagues, had taken from the Hierarchy the assistance which they were willing graciously and generously, to give, he need never have found himself in the difficulties which subsequently arose in connection with that scheme.  In short, if Deputy Dr. Browne had behaved in this matter as Deputy Dr. Browne and not tried to emulate Dr. Goebbels in the ukases which he was issuing in the matter, we might have had a satisfactory mother and child scheme in operation to-day, in operation with the goodwill of all Parties, a scheme which would, in no sense, offend against Catholic teaching from any particular angle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne, in the matter of his handling of that scheme, has now thrown up for solution very serious problems which must be solved by any Minister dealing with the question of health services in this country.  I believe there is no question among our people in this House, with, perhaps, a few exceptions, that we want to respect the Catholic teaching of the Hierarchy of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> I see no future for a nation, especially a nation religiously constituted as we are, which does not, nor, if I were to deal with the matter on a materialistic basis, do I see anything better offering for the poor and the weak by the adoption of practices and methods which run counter to Catholic social teaching.  Here we have the opportunity of building a health service in accordance with Catholic teaching and Catholic dogma.  No serious difficulties can arise in providing a scheme which will conform to the requirements of the Catholic Church in this matter and that scheme could easily have been provided in respect of mothers and children if it had not been for the incompetent and stubborn way in which the whole problem was handled by a Minister who regarded prudence as his enemy and care as something which he was not prepared to regard as equipment in the armoury necessary if he were to guide a scheme of that kind to maturity.</P>
    <P>I think we can get a scheme which does no violence whatever to Catholic teaching and which will be found to be in accord with such teaching.  We can adopt various methods to finance any comprehensive health scheme.  We can impose taxation and at the beginning of the financial year set aside a certain amount of that taxation to finance a defined comprehensive health scheme; we can impose taxation on certain specific commodities and hypothecate that the produce of that taxation will go to finance our comprehensive health scheme; finally we can go over to the insurance basis whereby a health service will be put on a contributory insurance basis, the citizen paying a certain contribution, the employer paying a certain contribution, and the State which must concern itself with the health and the well-being of the nation paying a very substantial contribution.  In that way and by the adoption of that scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Time does not permit me.  I am trying to bring my remarks to a close, but the answer to the Deputy's question is that the decent employer, the Christian employer and certainly the Catholic employer should accept moral responsibility for the welfare of his workers.  That is the least he should do and that should be done all the more readily when you remember that many workers do not work under ideal conditions or in ideal buildings.  Many workers, to the Deputy's knowledge, have gone home after work in the evening having been exposed to draughts from the broken or faulty windows, defective doors or bad walls and ceilings of many factories. It is the employer's job to take some interest in his workers.  After all, if his horse got sick he would pay a vet.</P>

If he can do these things, why should he not pay a contribution to keep his workers in good health or improve their standard of health?  I hope that that is sufficient answer.  I am sorry that I must rebuke the Deputy for this decline from the high line of social teaching which has been his guiding star up to recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of dependence.  It would be done in the same way as national health insurance, employment insurance or widows' and orphans' pensions.  Quite frankly, I think that a scheme on an insurance basis is the best in the long run.  It puts every citizen on the same basis and every citizen has the feeling that he is paying for what he gets.  It forms a satisfactory pool of money from which to provide a decent scheme.  As well, the State pays the bulk of contribution because it must all the time concern itself with the promotion of the public health and the public good and with contributions from workers which are easily within their competence to pay I see no difficulty in financing a scheme of that kind.</P>
      <P>In practically every country where the best health services in the world are to be found, the schemes are financed on that basis and if the Minister were to look to the New Zealand and Australian schemes he would find examples well worthy of emulation.  If it be pleaded that people who are unemployed could not pay, there would be no difficulty in the world because every one of these cases can automatically be covered by the State undertaking to pay their contributions when men are not able to work through unemployment or through physical incapacity.</P>
      <P>These are the pure mechanics of the scheme.  The principle should be the provision of the best possible health service we can give, making need and not wealth the passport to the best medical skill we can provide.  If the scheme is put on a contributory basis, it will, I think, at once overcome any possible objection from the point of view of Catholic teaching and give a health service substantially better than anything we know now.  I believe, having given the matter some attention, that it is only through methods such as these that we are ever within a measurable period of time likely to give the nation the standard of health and medical services which our citizens urgently need.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Norton in his plea on behalf of mentally deficient children. I had experience of trying to get a child into one of the institutions which look after them and it is practically an impossibility, especially for girls.  I know of one case which the South Cork Board of Assistance was trying to get into an institution for three years.  I would appeal to the Minister to do something about it.  I believe that there are about 8,000 cases in the country and accommodation for only about 1,500, and the Minister can visualise what it is to have such a child, as Deputy Norton pointed out, in a small house with other children while the mother tries to look after it.</P>
      <P>When the present Minister left office in 1947 he had brought in an Act which greatly benefited the local authorities and helped them to improve their health services.  By that Act they were recouped everything above what they spent in the standard year 1947-48 to the extent of 100 per cent. until the amount spent in 1947-48 was doubled. That was of great advantage to the local authority and kept extra expenditure off the rates which was borne by the Central Fund.  One group of bodies, however, was neglected&mdash;the voluntary hospitals.  When the present Minister was in office before, they were guaranteed and their deficits were paid every year, so that they need not depend on the interest from their investments in order to carry on their work.  During the last régime that was changed; three years were picked out, 1947-8-9, and the average deficit over those years was taken as the amount that would be recouped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can imagine, with the rising cost of everything now, what a hindrance and impediment that is to those voluntary hospitals to carry on.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to what he was doing before he left office and to <Col N="1337" /> pay the deficits of those voluntary hospitals which are doing such great work for the sick of this country.  These hospitals are carried on by voluntary bodies.  They are there for accidents and for anything else that may arise. They have a strong claim to have their deficits guaranteed, as formerly.  We all know well that they are run as economically as possible.  It was entirely unfair to make the change which was made during the last régime.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to investigate the position as regards the new hospital which is being built in Gurranebraher, Cork.  That hospital was to have been a fever hospital but, at the request of the previous Minister, the corporation agreed to hand it over as an orthopædic hospital and plans were drawn up for such a hospital. Tenders were invited and the building contract was handed to the general building contractor who started work in December, 1949.  In that contract there was an agreement that for every week the contractor would be behind time there would be a fine of £150 and that for every week the contractor would be delayed the corporation would have to pay £150 to him.  Because of a delay in appointing sub-contractors for the electrical and mechanical installations in that institution, the contractor was held up and where he had 90 men employed the number was reduced to nine or ten men.  Some months ago the architect agreed that he was delayed to the extent of nine months.  The contractor contended that he was delayed a good deal longer. However, about £6,000 of public money was wasted as a result of the delay in appointing sub-contractors.  In addition, there was an increase of about 10 per cent. in wages in the building industry.  All that added considerably to the cost of the building.  Then there was also a very large increase in the costs of the materials for the building. Quite recently I was inquiring about this matter and I was informed that it was almost impossible to get the equipment originally intended for the mechanical installations of this institution.  The plans for that institution have been changed several times.  Within the past four or five <Col N="1338" /> months a big chimney shaft which was erected in one portion of the building had to be taken down.  All the steel specifications were changed although the steel for the institution was on the grounds there and ready to be used.</P>
    <P>My experience of the Department of Health is that they are continually changing everything.  A question was asked in the House to-day about the erection of a regional hospital at Wilton, Cork.  I saw Deputy Hickey laughing and I laughed myself.  I should like to know what the changing of plans, since that site was first purchased 18 years ago, has meant in architect's fees.  After 18 years, a suggestion was made a couple of months ago that there was a cottage in the way of the avenue and that it ought to be shifted.  The Minister should come to a decision and when plans are decided on for these institutions there should be no changing and twisting and giving of money to architects, as has been the case the whole time from my experience under the Department of Health.  I think that the case of the Gurranebraher Hospital is a disgrace, where so much public money was wasted.</P>

      <P>The tuberculosis benefits which the Minister introduced, and which were of such great benefit, contain some few defects.  There is a housekeeper's allowance for looking after the dependents of the patient, but there is no allowance for a sister or anybody else who has to stay at home and look after the patient when he comes out of a sanatorium.  I know of cases in Cork where sisters had to give up their work and come home and look after the patient because the father and mother were dead.  These girls, who had to give up their jobs, got no allowance whatsoever.  I think that that is wrong and I hope that <Col N="1339" /> now that I have brought it to the attention of the Minister the matter will be remedied.  It is a pity that time is so restricted because there are many other matters with which I should like to deal.</P>
      <P>We have orthopædic surgeons who should be encouraged and we have a thoracic surgeon who is anxious to do more work&mdash;and all the time we have patients waiting in the district hospital for beds in Mallow.  There are about five non-tuberculosis beds in Mallow. The thoracic surgeon states that he is quite able and willing to carry out these operations in the district hospital.  He says he has the same facilities there as he had in St. Kevin's Hospital in Dublin.  No obstacle should be put in the way of that surgeon's performing these operations in the district hospital in Cork rather than waiting to have them done in Mallow.  I think that that would make more beds available.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong for any Cork Deputy not to pay tribute to the energy which Deputy Dr. Browne put into his work for tuberculosis patients in Cork. We disagreed with him on many matters.  I came in when he was criticising his predecessors for not building the hospitals which I have mentioned quicker but I would say that that was for want of experience. The relatives of tuberculosis patients appreciate the great work he has done and the relatives of children who had defective limbs, and so forth, appreciate the fact that he brought orthopædic surgeons to Cork to look after them.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to dwell on the mother and child scheme.  I believe that the people who were responsible for that bungling should answer for themselves, but the people who did not know what was going on should have cleared out long before they did.</P>

      <P>I am afraid it would be impossible to reply to all the points which were raised in this debate.  I have taken a note of all of them and I know that many of the points raised by Deputies will be remedied to their satisfaction. <Col N="1340" /> I wish to deal with a few general points.  I must say that I resented the implication of the ex-Taoiseach, which amounted really to accusing me of not making an act of faith when I was introducing my Estimate that I was going to live up to Christian principles. I do not think it is necessary for anybody here to make that act of faith, whether he be a Minister or a Deputy, or to state that he will base his proposals on Christian and Catholic principles.  I think it would be more Christian if we were not accused of doing otherwise, and I am quite sure that if I should depart from that there will be numbers of Deputies prepare I to cast the first stone.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello also asked me whether the dissolution of this committee composed of members of the medical association and members of the medical staff of my Department indicated that I was following a line hostile to the medical association.  It indicates no such thing.  I think it was wrong of my predecessor to set up this committee.  He put the principal medical officers of the Department on this committee with the members of the medical association and, whatever scheme they might draw up, I would still be depending in the ordinary way on these principal medical officers to advise me on such a scheme.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious they could not give an objective criticism or objective advice since they would be part of the scheme themselves.  I therefore withdrew the principal medical officers of my Department from the committee. At the same time I asked the members of the medical association if they would continue and let me have a scheme formulated by them.  I hope they will do that.  As far as I am concerned I am only too willing to co-operate with the members of the medical profession, the nursing profession, the dental profession and so on.  Their help would be invaluable to any Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to some of the questions put by Deputy Costello, I personally am not in favour of a complete scheme of State medicine.  Deputy Dr. Browne says that will come inevitably.  He may <Col N="1341" /> be right; perhaps it will.  But in present circumstances, at any rate, I am not in favour of it.  I do not want any Deputy to infer from that that I am not in favour of a very full extension of local authority medical services. Some people may regard that as a step in the direction of State medicine. Whether they are right or wrong, I do not know.  I believe that local authority institutions need improvement structurally in their dispensaries and hospitals. They also want more highly trained personnel.  To that extent I may perhaps be open to the accusation of favouring State medicine.  I am not in favour of going further than is necessary to provide the specialised services necessary to give our people the best possible service both in protection and treatment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the treatment of mental deficients, when I was in office on a previous occasion I was very interested in that.  I visited the existing institutions.  I made some progress during the brief period in which I was in office on that occasion towards enabling some of these institutions to extend their accommodation and also some progress towards introducing new people into the field.  At the present moment there are plans in progress under which about £1,000,000 will be spent on mental deficients.  That will not solve the problem but it is as much as can be done in present circumstances. It is not a matter of finance. It is connected with the problem of building contractors, nursing staffs and so on.  These are not available in sufficient numbers.  As soon as the present plans are complete I have no doubt but that we can proceed with a further programme.  There are between 6,000 and 8,000 mental deficients and they have to be divided into special categories according to sex, age to some extent, the degree of deficiency and so on.  It would take a tremendous variety of institutions to deal with the problems properly.  It will be some years before we can reach anything approaching the ideal situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to a comprehensive scheme catering not only for mothers and children but for other sections as well.  I do not think that <Col N="1342" /> the need for that was ever lost sight of.  The mother and child scheme came in for a good deal of publicity as Deputies are aware, but work was being done all the time for the benefit of other members of society in the building of general hospitals, regional hospitals, the recruiting of specialised staff and for public authority institutions in general.  I do not think that the idea of a comprehensive scheme was altogether ignored.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to our county homes.  I am very interested in them and I have read the report drawn up by the inter-departmental committee to which Deputy Dr. Browne referred.  The various Departments of State interested in the matter were represented on that committee.  A report was submitted.  It was a very good report.  I have made a particular addition to it and the report will be submitted to the Government and the Minister for Finance for approval.  I am sure that approval will be forthcoming. Local authorities will then be notified as to what is expected of them and they will be encouraged to modernise and bring these homes up to a certain standard of ordinary comfort for the older and poorer people who have to take refuge in them.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £895,900 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 &amp; 45 Vict., c. 49, sec. 46, and c.71, sec. 4; 48 &amp; 49 Vict., c.73, secs. 17, 18 and 20; 54 &amp; 55 Vict., c.48; 3 Edw. 7, c.37; 7 Edw. 7, c.38 and c.56; 9 Edw. 7, c.42; Nos. 27 &amp; 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; No. 26 of 1939; No. 12 of 1946; No. 25 of 1949; and No. 16 of 1950).</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for Lands for the present year (1951-52) represents an increase of £64,370 over the amount voted last year.  The increase is mainly accounted for under four sub-heads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head I (Improvement of Estates, etc.) at £390,000 represents an additional £35,200 over last year's grant.  Expenditure last year was £339,000.  The increased provision for improvements is due largely to the necessity for the <Col N="1344" /> erection of buildings for the accommodation of a larger number of migrants from the congested areas and also to the recent increase in the rate of wages for Land Commission labourers.  These labourers are now paid at the same rate as county council road workers.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (Salaries, Wages and Allowances) accounts for an extra £20,074.  This increase does not represent extra staff but is due to the usual increments in salary, etc.  Sub-head N (Advances to Provide Funds for the Maintenance of Embankments or other works) shows an increase of £5,585.  Sub-head H (3) makes additional provision amounting to £4,000 to meet deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the revision of annuities under the Land Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>Almost half the entire Estimate for Lands is allocated to sub-heads H (1), H (2), and H (3) for making good the deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund. These deficiencies arise from the halving of annuities and other State aids to land purchase, for example, costs fund and statutory bonus to vendors of estates over and above the prices repayable by the tenant purchasers.</P>
    <P>The last four sub-heads, that is, Q, R, S and T are the direct outcome of the Land Act, 1950, and of these R and S are the most significant in that they provide the funds for the purchase of land for cash and the award of gratuities to ex-employees.</P>
    <P>Any review of the Land Commission's activities falls naturally into two main heads, namely, (1) the completion of land purchase by the transfer of ownership to tenants and allottees by vesting and (2) the acquisition and allotment of untenanted land.</P>
    <P>Under the first heading more than 70,000 cases still remain to be vested. This is a sector of the Department's activities in which work should be pressed forward as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The other main branch of the work is the acquisition and allotment of land.  Progress under this head was dislocated to some extent while awaiting the enactment of the Land Act, 1950.  The provision for the payment of market value for land meant that, <Col N="1345" /> pending acquisition, proceedings could not be concluded until the Bill was passed into law.  In addition, on the passing of the Act many cases had to be revalued with resultant duplication of work.  Thus the acquisition machinery was thrown out of gear for a time.  The result of the year's working was that some 20,000 acres were ultimately taken over.  Of lands receiving attention for possible acquisition 41,000 acres on 350 estates were inspected and valued during the year while proceedings were instituted for 24,500 acres on 288 estates.</P>
    <P>As regards land division, 28,700 acres were allotted to 1,300 allottees during the past year and of this area 23,000 acres are in the scheduled congested districts.  In this work relief was afforded to about 1,000 congests through enlargement or rearrangement of holdings and 27 tenants were migrated from congested areas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, as this is a new Dáil, I should refer briefly to the various legal and other requirements which have to be complied with before lands can be taken over and made ready for division.  The legal process of acquiring land is still a lengthy one, notwithstanding the many provisions embodied in the more recent Land Acts which aimed at speeding up procedure.  When particular cases are brought to notice, initial inquiries are necessary for the proper identification of the lands and arrangements are then made for preliminary report.  The next step is a detailed inspection and valuation.  This involves visits to the lands by the inspectors and a survey of local conditions in order to ascertain the extent of congestion in the neighbourhood and generally the desirability of instituting acquisition proceedings.</P>
    <P>When, following consideration of the inspectors' reports, the commissioners decide to institute proceedings, statutory notice have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> after which the owner has one month in which to lodge objection to the proposed acquisition.  If, as usually happens, an objection is lodged, arrangements are made to have the objection listed for hearing before the Land Commission Court.  If the <Col N="1346" /> lay commissioners, having heard the objection, disallow it, the owner has an appeal on a question of law only to the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
    <P>If there is no appeal, or if the appeal is turned down by the Appeal Tribunal, the next step is to fix the price.  An offer of price is first made and failing agreement, recourse is had to the price-fixing machinery provided by the Acts. A statutory notice of the fixation of price is published and again at this stage the owner has a right of appeal to the Appeal Tribunal.  The price fixed, preparation of a scheme of division is put in hands and when the scheme is received and approved by the commissioners, possession is taken and the scheme put into operation.</P>
    <P>The work involved in the preparation of the actual division scheme is the most difficult and troublesome of all.  Even on comparatively small schemes a great deal of time has to be given by the inspectors concerned in the investigation of individual applications, interviewing applicants and examining their circumstances for the purpose of the detailed reports which must be furnished to the commissioners. Where, as happens in the majority of cases, a scheme is intended to provide for migrants, lengthy negotiations are usually necessary before it can be settled in final detail.</P>
    <P>Another feature which calls for very careful and expert consideration in all schemes is the provision to be made for works of general development and improvement of the estate including the laying down of roads, building of houses and out-offices and the making of drains and fences.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of Land Commission activity on which Deputies may wish to have information, that is the purchase, under the 1950 Act, of land for cash at auctions or by private treaty.  I have not yet had an opportunity of examining the position fully or of estimating the extent of the contribution to the solution of the congestion problem which future proceedings under this head may afford. Activity to date under these headings has been very limited.  One auction was attended without success.  In <Col N="1347" /> private treaty cases agreement on price has been reached in four instances and negotiations are in progress in five others.  An additional 15 cases are with inspectors for report at the moment.</P>
    <P>The position as to payment of annuities continues to be satisfactory.  Total arrears at 31st March, 1951, amounted to £204,490, which represents less than .5 per cent. (point 5) of the total sum collectable, viz., £43,073,940 since 1933.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I do not think that I need make a general statement.  There has not been any very great change in the policy which was in operation under the former Fianna Fáil Administration, except that under the 1950 Act, as I pointed out, there have been certain amendments made.  These amendments are law and I have not had an opportunity, as I have just stated, of seeing how exactly they are going to work.  We really have not had any experience of them.  With regard to the policy in general, of course the main aim, as in the past, will be the relief of congestion. I can assure the House that while I am Minister I shall concentrate attention on that particular aspect of Land Commission policy.  In view of the limited time which has been given for these Estimates, I do not think that I need go into details.  If Deputies want to get more definite answers about specific aspects of the land policy, I will be glad to try and answer them if I am afforded the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I do so because when Deputy Blowick was Minister, in view of the grave dissatisfaction which existed with regard to the working of the Land Commission, I decided that it was one Department that needed some very serious talk from this House. The fact of the matter is that as the Land Commission is at present constituted very grave difficulties will be experienced by the Minister in the discharge of his ministerial duties.  We have arrived at the stage now when the Land Commission, which was only a temporary institution, has become a permanent institution.  The Land Commission was passed over to us by the British Government as only a temporary institution.  It is quite evident that when it was established by the British Government it was given all the red tape regulations which prevent congestion from being relieved to-day. The reason that such red tape exists in the Land Commission above any other Department of State is because the landlord element in this country had their friends and cronies in the British House of Commons and it was the influence of the landlord type in this country at the time which was responsible for the establishment by the British Government of the very troublesome and tedious machinery for dealing with congestion.  Although we have reached the stage that we have shaken off everything British, I am satisfied that so far as the Land Commission is concerned we are now working the troublesome machinery set up by the British and that every Minister for Lands will meet with serious difficulties. The former Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, realised the very serious difficulties in trying to work that machinery.  The previous Minister, Deputy Moylan, experienced the same difficulties and I venture to say that the present Minister will have very great difficulties to face up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister realises that there are 377,861 agricultural holdings in this country, of which 165,495 are in congested areas, 51,000 of them with valuations under £4.  The Minister must realise and every Deputy must realise <Col N="1349" /> that no one can be expected to exist on a holding with a valuation of £4. Then, 53,000 holdings in the congested districts have valuations ranging from £4 to under £10.  These people are eking out a miserable existence on these holdings.  In other counties outside the congested areas there are 35,000 holdings with valuations over £4 and under £10 and 59,000 with valuations less than £4.  After 30 years of native government it is a reflection on us that people are expected to live on these miserable holdings while we have ranchers with large ranches who are given every protection owing to the red tape which prevents land from being taken over by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would give us an idea of what he considers an economic holding.  He has told Deputy Blowick that he expects to carry on the Fianna Fáil policy which was carried on for 16 years.  Does that mean that an economic holding is a holding of 15 or 20 acres?  If the Minister stands over the policy of dividing land in allotments of 15, 16, 20 or 25 acres, he is only putting allottees into hardship and making them far worse than they are at present.  In my constituency we have huge tracts of land, on the one hand, and we have very great congestion on the other hand. The Minister, with his years of experience in the Land Commission prior to his appointment on this occasion, must know that 20 or 25 acres of land are not sufficient to live on and the allottee has either to work on the roads or secure some other employment in order to obtain a living.  I think it is wrong that a man who is given a portion of land by the Land Commission should have to spend any profit he makes out of that land in taking conacre land in order to have hay or root crops.</P>
    <P>For that reason I think it is time the Land Commission gave serious consideration to the question of what is an economic holding.  I believe that no allottee should be given less than 40 acres and a house because no man could live on the small holdings allocated during the 16 years that Fianna Fáil were in office or during the past three years under the inter-Party <Col N="1350" /> Government.  I hope that the Minister will consult with the officers of the Land Commission in working out what is an economic holding and see that no less than 40 acres will be given.  By giving less the Land Commission are only putting a man in a very awkward position, because he will be unable to make a living out of his holding.  He has the name of being a farmer, but in reality he is only a gardener.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty acres of arable land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, mixed land. I would not give any less than 40 acres.  That was the policy of Deputy Blowick when he was Minister for Lands, and I wonder whether that policy is going to be carried on.  That was the inter-Party policy.  It is the policy for which I stand and the policy for which Deputies on this side of the House stand.  We would like very much to know whether the Minister is prepared to consider allotting not less than 40 acres as an economic holding.</P>
      <P>There is one point which I want to impress on the Minister, and it is this: In areas where large estates are being divided, there is a rule that the relatives of evicted tenants should get consideration. That is quite right.  Old I.R.A. men should be given special consideration as far as apportionment of land is concerned, as should small holders and local cottage tenants.  I would especially like to draw the Minister's attention to the question of cottage tenants.  Is there any regulation in the Minister's Department whereby a cottage tenant will not be given an apportionment of land?  If there is such a regulation, I want to hear the Minister explain its terms and conditions.  Land was being divided in my constituency, but the cottage tenants who were living on the estate did not get the consideration to which they were entitled.  Deputy Davern knows this quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any future scheme, I would like, after considering the evicted tenants or their relatives, or the Old I.R.A., or local smallholders in the area, that <Col N="1351" /> consideration should be given to the tenants who are living either on the estate or convenient to the estate.  I hope that the Minister will sympathetically consider that point.  I can sympathise with him when he says that there is great delay in taking over these holdings for division.  That is quite true, there is great delay but, as a result of legislation passed by the inter-Party Government, it has been cut down considerably.  I hope that in future the period. that elapses between the time that the inspectors come in to carry out their preliminary inspection and the time the lands are taken over will be short.  As a result of the inter-Party's term of office, compensation is to be given to the owners of a very large estate which the Land Commission would be taking over for the relief of congestion.  Such relief means that they are given the full market value for their land.  That, in itself, should be an encouragement to owners of large tracts of land who cannot, or who will not, dispose of them through public auction and who are anxious that the Land Commission should have them for division amongst the local people.  I believe that that provision was a very helpful and a very fine provision.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister what machinery he has at his disposal in the Land Commission to ascertain what the full market value is.  I am quite satisfied that a certain farmer in my own constituency who gave over his farm to the Land Commission for the relief of local congestion would have got far more for it had he put it up for public auction.  If the farmers are told that the market value is a certain amount and if afterwards they do not get that specified value, a certain amount of uneasiness, unrest and distress is caused.  We are all anxious to co-operate in schemes for the relief of congestion and to encourage the setting up of people in land.  I hope and trust that the Minister will give us some idea of the machinery he has at his disposal for arriving at a full market value.</P>
    <P>A very serious situation has arisen in this country as a result of the purchase <Col N="1352" /> of land by aliens.  Time and time again I have made representations to the Minister's predecessor and to Deputy Moylan when he was in charge of the Department of Lands.  I put it now to the present Minister that it is very wrong that the people of this country should be forced to exist on small holdings of £4 valuation while foreigners come over here and buy up land.  I want to protest against the number of Englishmen who have bought land here in the course of the past few years and even during the past 12 months.  If aliens consider that it is worth investing their money in Irish land, surely the Irish Government should consider it worth purchasing this land for the Irish people.  I hope and trust then, in all sincerity, that the present Government will take some steps to stop the purchase of land by aliens.  In the County of Westmeath and in my own constituency strange names appear in connection with the purchase of land, names such as Professor Grenville Gascoigne, who purchased a large tract of land in my constituency, in a congested area on the slopes of the Slieve Bloom Mountains, Colonel Beerecroft, and so on. I am very glad to see that, as a result of the activities of Deputy Blowick, proceedings are well on the way for the division of this land.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the seriousness of the purchase of land by aliens in this country.  The Swiss Ambassador to Bulgaria is the owner of 1,600 acres in my electoral area only a few miles from the town of Mountmellick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir, but when it reaches the stage that we have people living on land with a valuation of less than £4 and when the Swiss Ambassador to Bulgaria, de Jennar, can come down to my constituency and avail himself of 1,600 acres of land there, it is time that someone spoke in the only place we can speak, in our own House of Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir, and I appreciate such a regulation in the House.  Since the estate is listed for the attention of the Minister, it is only right that an opportunity should be given to deal seriously with the question of aliens purchasing land in this country.  I am sure there are people on the Fianna Fáil Benches who have the same difficulties in their areas and who are equally anxious to see that the land of this country should be for the people of this country.  If foreigners can make a happy hunting ground out of it, why should we not see that it is made a happy hunting ground for our own people?  James Fintan Lalor once said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The soil of Ireland for the people of Ireland, to have and to hold from God who gave it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is only right that the Government in office should take the necessary steps.  If they are sincere, if they are, as they preach to be, all Irish and solely Irish, they should see that, as far as the land of this country is concerned, no aliens should be permitted to purchase this land and that very serious difficulties are placed in the way of aliens purchasing land by the Minister for Finance.  He should see not alone that the present tax imposed on them is maintained but that they are taxed so severely that it will be made impossible for them to purchase land in this country.  Smallholders are put to the pin of their collar to eke out a miserable existence, whilst we have foreigners enjoying the best of the land.</P>
      <P>In the whole county of Kildare, instead of growing wheat, oats and barley to comply with the wishes of either Mr. T. Walsh or even to comply with the wishes of the former Minister for Agriculture, we have greyhounds being chased around the land and racehorses being reared on it, while people in labourers' cottages, who cannot get the grass of a cow, have to graze them on the high roads.  I am sure the Minister for Lands is not going to stand over that type of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> This same problem applies to the Midlands.  I say that if the lands in the Midlands were taken up by the Land Commission and divided among the local smallholders it would be a means of providing a very fine and decent livelihood for the people.  I would prefer to have oats, beet and barley grown on the land of this country than to see jumps for racehorses.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust some steps will be taken by the Minister to see that the state of affairs that has prevailed in the past will be remedied.  Since the time is very limited for this debate, I do not propose to trespass on the time of the House but to give other Deputies who are anxious to speak on this very important subject an opportunity of doing so.  I want, however, to express my dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Land Commission have handled the whole situation.  They are slow and I believe that they are so slow that the Minister for Lands now in charge will get no more speed from them than his predecessor.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that if the question is to be tackled in the right spirit the Land Commission must be scrapped completely and a new institution founded with a more national, a more Irish outlook than that prevalent at the present time.  No matter who is Minister for Lands he will meet with those difficulties because the whole system with regard to the relief of congestion and the division of land is a British system which is unworkable in this country and which must be changed.  The only way to do that is for Deputies on all sides of the House to express the fiercest possible criticism of it and to expose the dissatisfaction which prevails.</P>
    <P>I would congratulate the outgoing Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, on having reopened the division of land which was closed down by Fianna Fáil. They closed down completely on the division of land during the war years and even after the war was over before they left office they were not anxious to reopen it.  The Minister has submitted a report in which he says that a number of holding have been divided <Col N="1355" /> and that new allottees have been successful in getting portion of those lands.</P>
    <P>I want to call the Minister's attention to delays in the Land Commission. In 1949-50 there were 85,000 cases to be vested and I would like to know how many have been vested during the last 12 months.  The vesting of lands is very important and I would like to hear that some steps have been taken in this connection.</P>
    <P>With regard to my own constituency I will take this opportunity to criticise as I have always done in this House, as Deputies know.  I have offered criticism to the Minister for Lands and I want to call the Minister's serious attention to the fact that in Laois-Offaly more lands are listed for division than in any other constituency; more chancers and funny people purchase lands there, not for the good of the country or for what they can produce but just as a gamble and these people are prepared to take conacre at £16 or £17 an acre; more food is produced there than in any other part of the country according to the statistics of agricultural holdings.</P>
    <P>I would warn the Minister that when he is presenting his Estimate this time 12 months it would be very wise if some of the large holdings listed for acquisition and division in Laois-Offaly had been attended to with the least possible delay.  Unrest exists in those areas and throughout the whole country; protest meetings have been called and there has been Garda activity.  A great deal of unnecessary trouble is caused where land agitation exists.  I hope that the Government will do something about it and they will have my co-operation in that respect.  The Land Commission could help and the Minister could do valuable and helpful work by getting the Land Commission to attend to the relief of congestion.  The Minister and his predecessor have said that no real congestion exists in the Midlands.  It is not as bad as it is on the western seaboard, in Galway, Mayo, Clare, Kerry and parts of Donegal, but in the Midlands congestion exists to a very great extent and there are huge tracts of land there which should be divided.  I <Col N="1356" /> was never afraid to advocate the division of those lands.  In the Midlands we have resorted to all sorts of methods and we will be prepared to resort to them again to see that no foreigner, no rancher, will get the lands for which local people are equipped and financed to get.  We want to see that they get them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a big job to do and will have the same trouble as his predecessor unless he introduces legislation to make it handier and easier for the Land Commission to acquire land as they think fit for the relief of congestion in any area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a case for landless men.  I should like the Minister to consider the case of landless men who apply to him for allotments on estates divided by the Land Commission.  I know that the Department's aim is the relief of congestion in the counties along the western seaboard.  That is good, but a bad point is connected with it inasmuch as it rules out landless men in many parts of Ireland.  I have in mind the Lagan valley in Donegal where there are comparatively large farms which have been let over a period of years.  They are being and have been let to landless men.  These men have been in the habit of taking land by conacre and these conacre farmers are as good as any farmers you will find in Ireland, either in the congested districts or on the big ranches of the central plain.  They have a farming tradition and it is to their credit that they can, in the present year, go out to the auctions and pay up to £16 or £17 per acre for land for oats, potatoes and even for first season's hay.  I think that that rule in the Department or in the Land Commission should be more elastic.  It should not be a hard and fast rule.  It is a great penalty on these people when an estate is taken over, an estate on which they have had the benefit of conacre for a number of years.  They are penalised when that land is divided and migrants are taken in from the congested areas.  That farm or estate notwithstanding the high price of conacre was available to them but when the migrants are taken <Col N="1357" /> in it is no longer available to them and they must seek pastures new.  It is only right that these men should be considered equally with people from the congested areas.</P>
      <P>It is a mistake to have allotments of 15 or 20 acres.  You are creating the same type of congestion that you are trying to relieve and because of present methods of agriculture by machinery small farms are more a handicap than an asset and the allottees find that they must eke out what the farm is able to produce.  They must find alternative employment in order to support a family.  I know of one particular estate that was taken over six years ago.  Part of that estate remains undivided yet.  The Land Commission itself is, in that particular case and perhaps in others, letting the land at very enhanced prices.  The return from that land in cash through lettings over these six years must now be very near the figure which the Department paid for the farm.  I know the Land Commission is slow and that it has the name of being slower still, but there is no excuse at all for profiteering on estates that have been taken over.  Therefore, I recommend a speeding up of the time between the taking over of estates and the allotting of them.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission should tackle the question of absentee landlords.  I think they are the curse of this country.  They have valuable farms here which can produce food for the nation but these farms are serving no purpose at all.  The absentee landlord takes no interest in the farm except that he knows that he is making a good penny by letting the land.  He knows that it is a safe investment and he is prepared to leave his money there and take the rake-off every year.  No employment is given.  In many cases not even a caretaker or land steward is employed to look after the land.</P>

    <P>When buying farms for allotment, these are the first farms which should come under the hammer.  I recommend to the Minister the case of the landless men.  The conacre farmer must be a very good farmer in order to make a profit on the land which he has taken <Col N="1358" /> and at the same time pay the high conacre prices.  You may think that there is no congestion among the agricultural workers who are in the habit of taking land by conacre.  In any district where you have large farms, with a large number of agricultural workers, there is congestion because these workers who are pretty numerous will have to emigrate if land is divided and migrants brought in.</P>
    <P>These few points may be helpful to the Minister.  They apply, I think, to other areas as well as to the area which I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked the Minister, when he had concluded his opening speech, to give the House some idea of the policy which he was going to pursue, I must confess that I was disappointed with what he said.  I would make allowance for a new Minister going into the Department for the first time, even if he had had some previous ministerial experience in some other Department, but the fact is that the present Minister was Minister for Lands for some time before.  He must, therefore, know something about the Department and he must be fully aware of the somersaults that took place during the 16 years when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
      <P>In 1932 Fianna Fáil went out with a flourish of trumpets and I believe with the good intention of acquiring a lot of land, even though they made a complete mess of allotting it.  In April, 1941, the Land Commission virtually closed down.  Nevertheless, the Minister tells us that the policy is not changed.  It will be the strangest policy imaginable if the Minister's words are to be taken literally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My purpose this afternoon is to tell the Minister that any assistance he needs or asks for from me or from those of us on this side of the House will be readily given if his policy is to relieve congestion.  If his policy is not for the relief of congestion, we shall have to do our duty by our constituents and by the country.  Policy governs the Land Commission to a great extent.  Since the Land Act of 1950 came into operation, the Minister has greater scope now to manage the <Col N="1359" /> Department than heretofore.  During the passage of that Act through this House I said that the duties and powers of the commissioners and of the Minister were not hitherto clearly defined.  I want to tell the Minister now that that is not so any longer since about this time last year.  The Minister's powers are very clearly defined and they are wider and greater under the 1950 Land Act than they were previous to the passage of that Act.  I want the Minister to make full use of these powers, as I should have done myself had I remained in office.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I want him to tell us definitely whether it is his policy and the policy of the present Government in relation to the Land Commission that the full energy of the Land Commission will be devoted to the relief of congestion or whether it will not.  The Minister gave a rather brief reply to a question which Deputy Giles asked last week and I think that the Minister must know what exactly was meant by that reply.  On that reply can hinge the whole future of the work of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not tell us how many holdings and allotments were vested last year.  The Land Act of 1923 abolished the three bodies that were in operation at that time to deal with the land question of this country and it established the Land Commission as successor to these three bodies and gave it all their powers, properties and moneys.  I want the Minister to tell us his exact aim as regards the vesting of holdings.  That is the primary function of the Land Commission no matter what anybody says.  It was established in the first instance to make each farmer, the small farmer, the middlesized farmer or the big farmer the owner of his land.  I hope that the shelving of the vesting question, which was definitely shelved in 1932 after the passage of the 1931 Act until about 1943 or 1944, will never occur again.</P>
    <P>I want to give the Minister the benefit of a bit of experience I had in that Department.  An enormous pile of vesting has to be done and some of the <Col N="1360" /> best officers in the Department are engaged in clearing that up.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to wiping out that side of the work.  It should have been cleared up 15 or 20 years ago and would have been if the Department had not been prevented from doing so.</P>
    <P>The next work of importance is the relief of congestion.  That entails the acquisition of land.  There are ample powers under the Acts to acquire land. Some Deputies may be discontented at the slow rate of progress made by the Land Commission.  The very fact that we have a system of giving title to land owners is a stumbling block to the quick acquisition of land but I believe it would endanger the security of tenure enjoyed by every farmer if work proceeded too rapidly in the acquisition of land or if legislation was introduced to speed up acquisition beyond a certain point.  By recruiting more staff into certain sections of the Department the present method of acquisition could be speeded up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I might perhaps give the Minister the benefit of my experience and knowledge of what the farmer likes.  If farmers are to be secure in the ownership of their holdings, any attempt to ride roughshod over that security may have disastrous results. Deputies would be well advised to inquire fully into that matter before they commit themselves irretrievably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should concentrate on the relief of congestion.  That is a legacy handed down to us over the last 200 years.  No native Government has been responsible for it, but native Government is responsible for relieving it.  Governments cannot be blamed for the existence of the problem any more than the Minister for Health can be blamed for the existence of tuberculosis. Will the Minister tell us if it is the intention of the present Government to revert to the policy pursued from 1932 to the passage of the Act of 1939, as otherwise the hands of the clock will be put back and congests <Col N="1361" /> will be left in poverty as they were left under the landlord system?  The Minister would be well advised to devote all his energy and attention towards solving the problem of congestion.</P>
    <P>On one occasion the present Taoiseach said that while big farms remained congestion could be solved. I hope he and his Government have not changed their minds in that respect.  I stated clearly when I was Minister that the big farms should be taken over for the relief of congestion and that, when that problem was solved, it might be wise from the national point of view or from the point of view of our agricultural economy to split up the remaining farms; but that would be a matter for the Government of the day to decide on.  We should not cross bridges before we come to them.  The relief of congestion is a bridge that has been in front of us for a long time but we have always either ignored it or by-passed it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Land Act of 1950 was responsible for the delay in the acquisition of land over the past 12 months.  That is perfectly true.  A good deal of land that was in progress of acquisition had to be left on one side until that Act was passed.  The Minister is not responsible for that.  Neither was I.  In order to make improvements we had to bring in that Bill and certain farms in progress of acquisition were held up and work had to start on them all over again when that Act was passed in order to comply with the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that 28,000 acres of land were allotted between 1,300 migrants last year.  I do not like the expression &ldquo;allottee&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to tell us how many of the 1,300 were uneconomic holders. That is the only yardstick by which we can measure the work of the Land Commission.  We can go on giving an acre or two year after year to uneconomic holders and it may be 20 years before they become economic. How many of these allottees were brought up to an economic level? During the year before the year under review 1,253 were raised to an economic level.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take full advantage of Section 22 of the Act of <Col N="1362" /> 1950, which gives the Minister power to purchase land in the open market. While I agree there is need for caution because many evils can arise from it, I do not think there is any need to be afraid.  I say that as a result of my own experience.  I do not think the implementation of that section will give rise to any serious evils.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2,000 is included in the Estimate this year for the purchase of holdings suitable for migrants, in addition to holdings created through land acquired and divided by the Land Commission.  Building materials are scarce and tradesmen are scarcer still. It is not as easy for the Land Commission to build houses now as it was some years ago.  It was my intention at one stage to purchase as many economic holdings, fully equipped, as I could.  I believe they could be purchased cheaper than the Land Commission could provide them.  The cost of a standard holding of 33 statute acres of good land, which in most cases would be nearer 40 acres, is in the region of £2,640.  I think it would be cheaper to purchase such holdings already equipped since the cost of equipping a completely new holding to give it that snug, homely appearance these holdings should have would be much greater.  The power to purchase land in the open market is a very useful one.  If it is not abused, it should go a long way towards helping the Minister to solve congestion.</P>

How many holdings does the Minister hope to create this year for migrants?  What is his policy in relation to the migration of the larger farmers out of the congested areas?  The Minister should pay particular attention to that provided he can get the larger farmers to agree to migrate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to induce them to shift.  One large farmer who would be prepared to give <Col N="1363" /> up 100, 150, or 200 acres&mdash;I am sorry to say there are not many such farmers to be found in the congested areas&mdash;would confer much more benefit on congests at a much lesser cost to the State, than a large number of small farmers who would have to be moved from a number of small scattered holdings in the same area.  If the Minister wants to proceed with a policy intended to give the maximum amount of benefit, I would, first of all, ask him to concentrate on relieving congestion; secondly, to make full use of Section 22 of the Land Act of 1950, and, thirdly, to concentrate on the migration of the larger farmers out of the congested areas.  The reason that the larger farmers were reluctant to move in the past was that we were not giving them offers which were at all attractive or which would mean an improvement in their position.  They look about them and see a man with seven, eight or perhaps 15 acres, very little of it arable land and some of it reclaimed land, and they see that he gets a holding six or seven times his former acreage and is given a new house.  On the other hand, the larger farmers were never treated justly in my opinion.  The Minister will find documentary evidence of my views on the matter in the Department if he carries out a search.  The migration of the larger farmers out of the congested areas would do much more to solve this question, and do it more speedily, than any other approach to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter to which I want to draw the attention of the Minister is that during the earlier years of the Fianna Fáil Administration the policy seemed to be whenever a farm was acquired to divide it into small allotments of anything from half an acre up to two or three acres, and to give these allotments to people living two, three or four miles away.  I am afraid that, whitewash it how you will, savours very strongly of vote buying or vote catching.  The Land Commission during my period in office were undoing a lot of that work; it was not work, it was damage, irreparable damage in some cases, which they <Col N="1364" /> were ordered to do in the earlier years of the Fianna Fáil Administration. They are trying to undo that slowly but it will be slow work because in most cases these allotments were vested in the farmers' sons and the owners had got into a rut.  The amount of loss and destruction caused by that policy can never be fully calculated and I hope the Minister will never order the Department to go back to it.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that I am fully aware of the fact that the officials of the Department were ordered to carry out that policy against their own wishes.  They were ordered to do it against their own wishes and advice.  I do not take the attitude of some Deputies of blaming the Department for what they did. They had to do it because these were the Minister's directions and orders.  I hope there will be no reversion to that system because it was one of the causes of rural depopulation, even in cases where holdings were actually increased. I know that has been the case in the part of County Mayo where I live.  I know that youngsters are clearing out and leaving the land because they find their fathers or mothers, as the case may be, are about to hand them over holdings of £10, £11 or £15 valuation but the holdings are scattered into allotments in different places three or four miles apart.  There is no surer way of depopulating a rural area than to divide land in that way.  While the fathers of the young people who are now growing up may have been glad to get an addition of a few acres to their holding 15 or 20 years ago, the younger generation have no intention whatever of wasting their lives riding a bicycle or travelling on horseback along country roads to look after bullocks in one place, then speeding off to save hay in another place and travelling to a third place to look after tillage or to save turf on the home holding.  The result is that they are leaving their fathers' farms or they are waiting their chance to put them up for sale.  That policy pursued 15 or 20 years ago is definitely one to be condemned because it has contributed more to the depopulation of the congested areas than any other single factor of which I am aware.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> During my period in office, one of the first things I did was to give a direction to the commissioners to increase the size of holdings.  I think the direction was worded in some such form as this: &ldquo;Any holding to be created in future is to contain at least 33 statute acres of arable land or its equivalent.  If the holding includes any portion that is not arable land, then sufficient land is to be given as will be equivalent in value to a total holding of 33 acres of arable land.&rdquo;  I regarded that as a very important aspect of policy.  The Minister has, however, power to-morrow morning to give a direction to create holdings of 12, 15 or 20 acres.  He is perfectly free to revoke my direction but I think it is due to the House to know what is Government policy in this regard.  While there was great play made by Deputy de Valera, as he then was, when I was over there about a certain passage in the Constitution which aims at settling the greatest number of people in economic comfort on the land&mdash;a very laudable object I must say&mdash;you will not settle people on the land by giving them uneconomic holdings or by moving them from one kind of congestion into another.  Young people of the present day have very advanced ideas and while their parents may have been glad to get some improvement in the congested condition which prevailed 20 or 30 years ago, the youngsters of to-day, with all the attractions of industrial life in the cities and the amenities offered to them in the town, will not tolerate conditions with which their fathers were satisfied.  If we are to attract young people to the land we must give them reasonably-sized holdings, so far as it is in our power to do so.  Secondly, every single holding must be in one block, if at all possible, or should be divided only by the main road where it runs through the middle of the farm.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that the Minister is not taking over a Department of the same kind as I took over. When I took over the Department, it had been idle and rusting for a period of seven or eight years.  The staff had been loaned to other Departments and out of 53 men who had been loaned, 11 only had returned when activities were <Col N="1366" /> resumed in the Department.  Some 53 or 56 men had been loaned to the Department of Agriculture to assist in the enforcement of the compulsory tillage regulations and some had been lent to other Departments.  Eleven of the older staff was all I had to take over.  I had to recruit a new staff and that new staff had necessarily to be trained.  Not alone were they a drag on the older inspectors but a considerable amount of time had to be devoted to training them.  The Minister has also something like 20,000 acres of land in his hands at the moment.</P>
    <P>That is more than I had to start with.  There was only a small holding of 18 or 19 acres in County Kildare on hands when I took over and that land was of such poor quality that when it was shown to seven or eight intended migrants, they refused to accept it. That was the legacy I got.  The Minister is getting a Department working in full swing, fully equipped with the necessary raw material to work on.  I ask him to aim at the creation of the largest possible number of standard holdings and, particularly, at the migration of the larger farmers from the congested areas, and to make full use of Section 27 of the 1950 Land Act as soon as the Department feel that they can go ahead on a big scale.  I am not urging him to do this until he feels satisfied that no evils will arise from purchases under that section on a big scale.  I do not want the market value of land to be upset.</P>
    <P>Another huge obstacle removed out of the way of the Land Commissioners was the fierce bitterness throughout the country against the very name of the Land Commission for no other reason than that the Land Commission was compelled by law to take vested land from the owners for less than market value and which they were doing in many cases.  Not alone that, but they were compelled to redeem the purchase money out of it.  In other words, a man who owned a farm of land had to pay his annuity each half year.  When the Land Commission took his land against his will he was compelled out of his own pocket to hand that land over free of rent to the Land Commission, an amenity which <Col N="1367" /> he never enjoyed.  All these things have been removed by the 1950 Act.</P>
    <P>When he was on this side of the House the Minister made many bitter attacks on certain parts of that Act.  I challenge him now to bring in amending legislation to remove the parts of that Act which he thought were damnable at the time.  I throw down the same challenge to Deputy Moran, his colleague from South Mayo.  If he thinks that I took extreme powers under that Act he is welcome to sift it to the bottom and to make good what he said from this side of the House against it and against me when I was Minister, and to repeal what he called the damnable sections which he alleged were concealed in the Act, the hidden powers under Section 12, the powers of rearrangement, etc.  Will the Minister introduce legislation to repeal these powers?  I do not think he will, because I do not think that he believed what he was saying when on this side of the House.  He knew it was something which should have been done years ago, and he was just a bit sore that he had not the courage to bring in such a Bill as that when he was Minister for Lands formerly.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that I got from the staff of the Department during my period of office great loyalty and a terrific output of work. I know that the staff will do the same for the Minister or any other Minister. I want to take this opportunity to thank every single one of the staff from top to bottom of the Irish Land Commission and also the staff of the Forestry Department and the Gaeltacht Services, who did their very best, not for me, but for the country, in the way that any civil servant should.  It would be churlish of me if I did not take the opportunity of expressing my thanks for the immense amount of work they did.  I know that in many cases they worked overtime without getting any monetary compensation.  I also want to tell the Minister that any help or assistance in the relief of congestion which he wants he will get from me. He will get every co-operation, but he is in for a very stormy time or a rough passage if he tries to evade his responsibility <Col N="1368" /> in wiping out the worst of our national evils, namely, congestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I voted for the final passage of the Land Act of 1923&mdash; I was young at the time&mdash;I concluded that that Act put us on the straight road for the relief of congestion for the first time.  To-day, 28 years afterwards, although innumerable amending Acts were passed to try to remove the obstacles which were not foreseen at that time and which were subsequently discovered, as far as my constituency is concerned, there is a very acute problem for the Minister if he has the desire, as I am sure he has, to complete the job begun by the late Mr. Patrick Hogan when he introduced his Land Act in 1923.  Deputy Flanagan has not exaggerated so far as it affects Laois and Offaly, because we have still in that constituency owners of large ranches, some of them aliens, some of them descendants of Cromwellian soldiers who got these large estates for the services they rendered at the time. These people are in possession of these lands while thousands of young men, fit to work land if they got it, cannot get it&mdash;sons of small farmers, cottage tenants and others paying high rents ranging from £12 to £16 an acre for conacre in order to eke out an existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had experience of the Land Commission before and I assume that he is anxious to complete the job which is waiting to be done. As was pointed out by Deputy Blowick, he took up office under much more favourable conditions than Deputy Blowick took up the position of Minister in February, 1948.  Deputy Blowick, with no land to divide when he came into office and with a depleted staff, had to face up to a very difficult job.  The Minister cannot deny that he has the pleasure of coming into office when the machinery of the Land Commission is fairly well oiled, if it is possible to say that about the Land Commission.  It is correct, as Deputy Flanagan said, that the Land Commission was originally established by an Act of the British House of Commons and that every possible precaution was taken by the friends of the Irish landlords of the day in the House of Commons <Col N="1369" /> to see that the untenanted lands then in the possession of Irish landlords would not be taken from them too quickly and that if these lands were taken for the relief of congestion the landlords would be well paid for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan has also pointed out that there is a new form of activity not confined to Laois and Offaly; that the Minister is faced with a new problem to-day, the problem of continental people as well as British citizens buying land here with the surplus money they have.  I am sure that that land will eventually have to be acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.  These fortunate British citizens and continental people, Jews in some cases, come over here with surplus funds at their disposal and are able to bid for untenanted land when it is put up for sale at a considerable advantage over any possible purchaser who is an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>With other Deputies from my constituency, I brought all the pressure possible to bear upon Deputy Blowick, when he was Minister, to acquire a certain estate in the Offaly portion of my constituency.  The owner was supposed to be a titled British gentleman and when he came into possession of the land some years ago there were 36 people employed there as labourers in different capacities.  Before that gentleman was bought out last year by the Land Commission under Deputy Blowick, the number of persons employed was reduced to five.  He dismissed the others for various reasons, some of them not very sound reasons. I discovered, however, when the place was about to be taken over that that titled gentleman in whose name these lands were supposed to be held legally was only the managing director for a body of American and British Jews. They came into the possession of this land many years ago and drove many decent local people, not alone out of employment there but up to the passport office to get a passport to go over to Britain to work for English farmers. That type of gentleman is a good riddance out of this land.  I saw that his furniture and other saleable assets are up for sale.  I am not the person <Col N="1370" /> who will shake hands with him when he leaves this country.  I think this type of gentleman was the real, legal owner of the lands until shortly before they were acquired by the Land Commission inside the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is that we have a number of natives&mdash; not foreigners&mdash;auctioneers and financiers of a doubtful type but with some backing who are going around and bidding for untenanted lands in portion of my constituency for some time past and who are buying these lands for the purpose of cutting down the timber that is on the land and making a fairly good thing out of it.  I am advising the Minister that, deliberately or otherwise, they are cutting across the policy of the Land Commission by their activities and I hope the Minister will take a serious view of that and do whatever he possibly can to stop their activities.</P>
    <P>In the Luggacurrane area of County Laois we have a large number of holdings that were bought out by these auctioneers and financiers. They have proceeded to divide the land, splitting it up themselves into what they consider to be suitable allocations&mdash;suitable for the purpose of getting the most they possibly can out of it.  They are cutting across the whole idea of providing economic holdings for local, deserving, landless men and other deserving applicants for land.  In one of these cases the Land Commission eventually came in and found it extremely difficult to carry out their own policy so far as the division of land was concerned.  I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this Luggacurrane turbary area in the Counties of Laois and Offaly, because these activities have been going on for some considerable time and there is a feeling amongst local people&mdash;decent local people at any rate&mdash;that the Minister, if he has powers, should use them as quickly as possible to stop that form of activity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan asked the Minister to state in his reply what his attitude was to the applications of cottage tenants for apportionments of <Col N="1371" /> land whenever estates were being divided in the area where those cottage tenants resided.  I have, on previous occasions, when Mr. Blowick was the Minister and when Mr. Moylan was Minister, drawn attention to the unfair treatment meted out to those cottage tenants.  These cottage tenants, in almost every case that I know of and with which I am concerned, are people who worked principally for local authorities or with the local farmer.  In addition to that they take conacre lettings on the local estates and they pay for the conacre lettings anything ranging from £12 to £16 per acre.  The very fact that these people risk taking conacre lettings at such a very high figure of between £12 and £16 proves that they should be regarded as fit and suitable persons to receive portion of these lands when they are being acquired and divided by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the present Minister that persons of that type should be high up on the priority list when any local estates are being divided.  In addition to that the Minister for Local Government in the last Government, as our present Minister for Lands knows, issued an order empowering the local authority to sell cottages and plots to the existing occupants.  I hope when the cottage tenants become the legal owners of their plots and cottages, as it is hoped they will before the end of the present year, that they will be regarded as equivalent to uneconomic holders in the area where they have been in possession of conacre lettings.  If they cannot be regarded as uneconomic, with the rights of the uneconomic holder, they should be put high up on the priority list because if they are not provided with holdings, the alternative to them and the grownup members of their families is emigration&mdash;to leave the areas in which they reside and look for a living elsewhere. I have also drawn attention, during discussions here in the past, to the attitude of the Land Commission and to the slow progress made by them. Indeed, they will never be charged under any Government or under any Minister with speeding.  I, here and <Col N="1372" /> now, wish to draw particular attention to the slow progress of the Land Commission over a long period of years in acquiring or dividing large tracts of bogs in my own constituency and I am not referring to its administration under any particular Government or under any particular Minister.  I do not recall how many years have passed since I first drew the attention of the Minister of the day to the necessity for the acquisition, say, of the Coote Bogs in Laois for division amongst the local people.  I also drew attention to a case in Offaly County.  Indeed, I could cite a number of such cases, but I am confining my remarks to the worst ones. There has been considerable delay in acquiring and dividing the bogs owned by Lord Ross in County Offaly.  These bogs are situated close to a number of towns where people find it very difficult to get turbary rights at a reasonable figure.  I cannot understand the long delay, now extending over a period of 15 to 20 years, on the part of the Land Commission in acquiring and dividing those bog tracts.  I would encourage the Minister for Lands to ask the responsible officials to get him the files in connection with these particular cases because they are two outstandingly bad ones in so far as they affect my own constituency.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has been in office only for a very short time, but he has been in the Land Commission, I think, before, so that the administration of that Department would not be new to him.  He may have taken over in more pleasant circumstances than existed when he enjoyed the office before.  I know that it is not fair on this occasion to ask him to give a detailed reply to particular cases I have mentioned.  I would ask him, however, to state, when replying, what his attitude is in regard to the necessity for speeding-up the relief of congestion and what his attitude is in regard to the rights of people who are looking for lands and the rights, and justifiable claims, of cottage tenants in areas where land is going to be divided in the future.</P>
    <P>I came across a very peculiar case recently in my constituency.  I am not going to deal with all the peculiar cases, but this is a really extraordinary <Col N="1373" /> one.  It appears to me to be a departure from what was the previous procedure since 1923.  This is the case of the Fisher estate situated near Stradbally in Laois.  There has been agitation going on over a long period of years for the division of that estate.  It is not a very large one. Eventually, an &ldquo;invader&rdquo; came along when he and his friends knew that the Land Commission were taking steps to have it acquired and divided amongst the local people.  After a good deal of pressure from all the Deputies representing this constituency and supported by very active and justifiable agitation locally the Land Commission decided not to acquire the whole of the estate but only a portion of it.</P>
    <P>I know of no case in my time in which the Land Commission intervened and did not acquire the whole estate.  If they thought the person in possession of the house was a suitable person for re-allocation of the land they re-allotted whatever portion of the land would with the valuation of building make an economic proposition.  I would like the Minister when he has time to spare to call for the files in connection with the acquisition of the Fisher estate and see why the usual procedure of acquiring and dividing estates was departed from in that case.  In my opinion it was for the purpose of giving preferential treatment to an invader whom I would have kept out if I could possibly have done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to raise some matters connected with my own constituency in this debate, but in view of the shortness of the time I will deal with a few matters of general interest instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the ex-Minister, Deputy Blowick, say that more power lay in the hands of the Minister since the 1950 Act was passed.  I am glad that the powers are there but as far as we can see for ourselves very little use has been made so far of those powers. With regard to the purchase of land or holdings, I understood the Minister to say that only one public auction had been attended by members of the Land Commission and that this venture was unsuccessful as no purchase was made. <Col N="1374" /> If that is the sum total of the activities in connection with the purchase of holdings since the 1950 Act was passed it is very slow indeed.  As Deputy Davin says, nobody can accuse the Land Commission of speed.  Their rate is slow all the time.  I fail to understand how the Minister can suggest that work of a certain Department was thrown out of gear due to time having been devoted to the Land Act of 1950.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham mentioned a point in which I am very interested, landless men.  It may be a very popular thing in this House to say that landless men should get high preference in connection with the division of land.  I, for one, do not believe that that is right.  First and foremost, the Land Commission should devote itself to the relief of congestion and the making of as many economic holdings as possible in this country. If after that land is available, by all means let the landless man have his chance.  There is always great difficulty when you speak about landless men and it is very hard for trained men, such as the inspectors of the Department of Lands, to decide who should get land as a landless man.  The first thing we should remember is that if we start giving land to landless men we may have no hope of finally, solving the problem of congestion because the more landless men you give land to the less chance there is of placing uneconomic holders on economic holdings.  It is quite clear that there are good landless men, but if the problem of land division is to be properly tackled and concluded first and foremost must come the uneconomic and congested holder.</P>
    <P>The more I listen to speakers on both sides of the House who speak about the Land Commission and the Minister's powers the more I am puzzled as to what powers the Minister has.  I am open to contradiction, but my reading of the Land Acts is that powers in the acquisition of land lie solely in the hands of the commissioners and the Minister has no function whatever.  If that is the case, how is it that people on both sides of the House claim that this Minister or that Minister got such and such a farm divided?  The sooner Deputies <Col N="1375" /> on both sides stop playing politics about the division of land the better for all concerned.  I believe that the power to acquire land lies solely in the hands of the commissioners and some people say that that is wise.  The reason these powers were handed over to an independent body like the Land Commission was to save whatever Government might be in power from innuendoes that they themselves divided land in order to give it to their political supporters.  That was a very laudable idea, but it left the big problem of land division in the hands of individuals who, I believe, have not at all times the best interests of the country at heart.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a question was raised in this House by myself and other Deputies in connection with the purchase of lands by aliens and the huge amount of land in the Midlands which is not being properly utilised and some of which is let under the conacre system.  We were told by the Minister then in power that everything possible was being done by the Land Commission to acquire these big farms in the Midlands for the relief of congestion and that the purchase of land by aliens was negligible as only a very small proportion of the land was being acquired by foreigners.  I have here a copy of the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of the 6th May, 1950, and in the lines which I propose to quote are expressed the views of a prominent land commissioner on congestion and the relief of congestion at a case in Galway.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was his opinion that the fertile lands of Meath which were not being run productively should be made available for the relief of congestion in the West, said Mr. Commissioner Mansfield at a sitting of the Irish Land Commission Court in Galway. It was a shame, he said, that 100,000 acres of the best land in the country should have recently passed over into the hands of aliens.  Over 70 per cent. of the holdings in the country, said Mr. Commissioner Mansfield, were under £20 valuation, with the average holding under £3 valuation and the position was even much <Col N="1376" /> worse in the congested districts of Galway.</P>
    <P>The 100,000 acres which had recently passed into the hands of aliens should have been retained for agricultural production by those who were compelled to live in agricultural slums.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement by a land commissioner, a responsible man at the head of the Department, a man with whom, in connection with land division, the Minister may not interfere. Is there not something wrong with the Land Commission and its functions if a senior man in that Department makes what I believe to be a responsible statement about the land problem in this country, and if at the same time people in this House say that the Land Commission are going full steam ahead for the relief of congestion? Statements like that leave the public puzzled, and I think it is only right that the present Minister should make a statement in connection with that report, and let us hear whether the views expressed by that commissioner are similar to the views held by other commissioners at the present moment.  I should like to get an answer to that question when the Minister is replying.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Blowick in bringing to the Minister's attention a point in connection with the giving of extra allotments whenever a farm of land is being divided.  It has been the practice of the Land Commission in localities where a farm is divided to give perhaps six or seven acres, or less, to a man who lives maybe two or three miles away.  Naturally, when that man gets the six or seven acres he is delighted and he will grab at the chance.  I believe that the system is completely wrong.  As soon as the man begins to utilise that land he finds that he will have to journey two or three miles&mdash;maybe more and maybe less&mdash;to look after cattle or to attend to tillage, and he discovers that it is not such a hot proposition.  Deputy Blowick is right in saying that that may have suited the farmer, but that it does not suit his son who is growing up.  I would ask the Minister to see that that system of allotting land some distance from the original holding is <Col N="1377" /> not continued.  It would be much better to carry out a complete rearrangement in the locality.  I think that that could be done, and that it would be much more satisfactory in the long run.</P>
    <P>Whenever a large farm or estate is aken over, the system in the West is that a number of people get holdings on that farm or estate.  The Land Commission either give them an advance to build a house for themselves or else they build the houses for the tenants. Each of these houses is completely separate with the result that in rural Ireland we are setting up a system whereby a man lives practically in exile just as if he were out on the prairie.  One of the things which is inducive to emigration from rural Ireland at the moment is lack of community life.  Most young people growing up at present seem to favour living in towns.  I think that whenever land is being divided the houses should, if possible, be built in a community centre&mdash;in other words, on the line of a village&mdash;so that in the not too distant future electricity and sewerage and water supply schemes can be carried out more easily than if the houses were all a mile or maybe two miles apart.  That system should be tried out as soon as possible by the Land Commission when they are taking over large farms.  You will then have created a small community there. A parish hall can be erected where pictures can be shown and a library, and so forth, can be provided.  You will have a little unit there where people can be happy together and then they will not want to wander to the towns as much as is the case at present, only then to find out that things in the towns are not as hot as they expected them to be.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the Land Acts themselves.  I do not think any Minister or ex-Minister or Deputy in this House&mdash;and that is not casting a reflection on anyone&mdash;knows or understands all the various Land Acts that have been passed all down through the years.  It is torture to go to the Library and try to trace one's way through the maze of all the various Land Acts that have been passed <Col N="1378" /> over a number of years.  The present Minister could do no greater turn than to start from the very beginning of his term of office and codify the Land Acts.  If he does so he will probably go down in history as one of the best Ministers for Lands we have had in this country.</P>
    <P>The present Minister was Minister for Lands some years ago and he is not, therefore, without some knowledge and experience of the working of the Land Commission.  He has an idea of the problems that have to be faced.  I think he should now be in a position to turn his attention to the very necessary work of codifying the Land Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear Deputy McQuillan calling for a codification of the Land Acts and to hear him say that he finds it an impossible task to understand the Land Acts in full.  I believe thousands of people in this country and many Deputies in this House are in sympathy with him in regard to that matter.  At the same time, the task of codifying the Land Acts would surely be a gargantuan task for the Minister.</P>
      <P>There were anomalies under the Land Acts and Deputy Blowick states that, in regard to the fixing of the price of land, the 1950 Land Act has at least remedied one of them.  I wonder how far the 1950 Land Act really went.  As an example of what I mean I want to refer to a statement made before the last general election to the effect that certain large estates had been purchased for afforestation.  I should prefer not to give the name of a particular place because some of the questions which I shall have to ask may be hypothetical and, in the circumstances, it might not be fair to do so&mdash; although I am quite prepared to advise the Minister of the name of the estate in respect of which I am making the submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask if the purchase of a certain estate, comprising lands and a big house, was carried out under the provisions of the Land Act of 1950, or by the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands, if they were required for afforestation purposes.  If so, was the estate originally sold to the <Col N="1379" /> Land Commission at the market value of the lands under the Land Acts 1903-20? Then, did the owner repurchase these lands at the selling or market value, on an advance made to him as a tenant under the Land Acts&mdash;and were these lands subsequently acquired by the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands?  If so, is that not a case in which a man was paid twice over for the same holding?  If the holding was purchased under Section 5 of the Land Act of 1950, the redemption value of the annuity on sale could not have been deducted from the purchase price of the land.  But, if the same lands were purchased directly by the Forestry Division, is it not a fact that the redemption of the annuity could have been deducted in the customary manner from the purchase price?  If that did happen, is it fair?  Of course I realise that that is a legacy left to the Minister as a result of the 1950 Land Act and in respect of which he has no direct responsibility.</P>
    <P>As regards the actual policy of the Land Commission, here again if we accept what we are told as true the Minister has no direct responsibility. Even before I was elected to the Dáil I came across some extraordinary cases in my professional capacity.  I can only describe these cases as anomalies. Whatever about Córas Iompair Eireann having a public relations officer, I believe the Land Commission is in urgent need of such an officer in order to convince the public that they are really doing their best, have a policy and that that policy is consistent with justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he would. Let me give you a concrete example of the situation that exists at present. In May, 1950, two gentlemen came into my office.  They stated that they had a 40-acre farm which had been untenanted for upwards of ten years.  These men were brothers. One died six months later and the other brother became the sole owner of the holding.  He was living at the <Col N="1380" /> other side of the country.  He was a professional man and he had no intention of going back to this holding. Now I live in a congested area and this holding was actually offered for sale by public auction.  I advised the Land Commission of the situation and asked them to acquire the lands.  I got no reply except &ldquo;Tá orm&rdquo;, etc. The land was not sold.  Nobody wanted it.  The land was situated in the middle of a congested district.</P>
      <P>What happened?  One of my first duties when I was elected was to go to the Land Commission to find out what had happened about this 40-acre farm.  I was told the Land Commission were taking no steps.  I was not told when that decision was arrived at. I can assure you I was not told why. At the same time, and on the very same day, I had occasion to make representations on behalf of a woman with nine children from whom the Land Commission were taking away 20 acres of land.  She had trained her eldest boy who was 17 or 18 years of age to run the holding and she promised him that it would be his eventually. The Land Commission took 20 acres of land from her but they would not take 40 acres of untenanted land where the neighbours were breaking down the fences and letting their cattle in without leave or licence.  I cannot understand what the Land Commission means when it does that sort of thing.  That is why I say a public relations officer should be given a few hundred pounds a year to reply to letters explaining the reason why the Land Commission arrive at certain decisions, decisions which to all appearances are unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the policy of the Land Commission with regard to the division of land concerns the question of division on the basis of poor law valuation.  It is fair enough to take a valuation of £10 or under and say that people with less than that should get relief, but there are other considerations which should be taken into account.  In one particular case I have already approached the Minister, and he has given me little hope that my representations will meet with success, although a grave injustice would appear to be done to a man with four <Col N="1381" /> children and whose eldest son is now about 20 years of age.  The man is rather a patriot in his way.  He has tried to keep his family together in this country.  He has 14 acres consisting of 12 acres of rocks and two of arable land.  On the two acres he can rear a goat or two, a donkey and one cow.  His eldest son helps on the land.  None of his children is earning.  He will not be given any additional land merely because he happens to be an auxiliary postman with a wage in the region of £3 per week.  Land was allocated to him provisionally, but was taken away again when it was discovered that he was an auxiliary postman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That happens every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs admitted here that the State has never been kind to auxiliary postmen.  He referred to the modest wage and the increases that have been given over the last 15 or 16 years.  Even with those increases an auxiliary postman is still in receipt of only £3 per week.  That man was provisionally allocated two acres and three roods, but the Land Commission subsequently decided in their omniscience that that should be taken away again because he was an auxiliary postman. He has a wife and four children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission, in their omniscience, because the State refused to give him enough on which to make a decent living for 40 years, decided that they would use the fact that he had been given anything as a stick to beat him with.  People cannot see the justice of it.  There was a meeting held of all political Parties.  I attended the meeting.  A petition was signed by the residents in the area.  Only one man refused to sign it, because he thought he was as much entitled to the land as the other man.  I suppose the Land Commission think they are too great a body to change their minds a second time.  They are not too great a body, apparently, to change their minds to someone's disadvantage.  One can only raise one small voice in protest against these things.  One can only say they are unjust.  One can only say there is a genuine grievance and a genuine <Col N="1382" /> feeling of helplessness.  It is part and parcel of a solicitor's business in the West of Ireland, irrespective of whether he is or is not a Deputy, to deal with people who are looking for land and with people who do not want land to be taken away from them.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the problem of the resettlement of land in regard to which I have quite an amount of sympathy with the Land Commission and a deep appreciation of the difficulties under which they are working. I think Deputy Blowick has already referred to it&mdash;that is, in the matter of giving an allotment of two or three acres to a farmer which is miles removed from his holding, thereby making it almost impossible to farm the entire holding.  Three acres of it are here, three acres are five miles further on, and the remainder ten miles in the other direction.</P>
    <P>The fact is, and I regret it, that when a scheme is put up in one area which I know to be very badly accommodated in that respect, the old people refuse to have anything to do with that resettlement scheme because they had that particular piece of land and their father and their grandfather had it before them, and they are not going to move out of it till doomsday.  The attitude is: &ldquo;If my father went to school on an ass and cart I shall go to school on an ass and cart also.&rdquo;  I am afraid there is a lot of that mentality amongst the older people in the country.  The trouble is that their mentality is not the mentality of the younger generation and, in the meantime, these younger people are departing for England, America or any other country in which they can find a refuge and a living wage and, once they go, they seldom return.</P>
    <P>There is a different case, that of a person who is driven out of the country, not permanently but for a period of years, because he finds it impossible to live on an uneconomic holding. That person by going to England can earn good money&mdash;he can certainly earn up to £15 or £20 a week&mdash;and he can save a lot which will enable him to come back, settle down on the uneconomic holding and, by the use of grants and the various other forms of <Col N="1383" /> assistance available, can make that holding a more or less economic unit, always with the hope that by getting an additional acre or two from the Land Commission he will be able to live on that farm for the rest of his life.  The trouble is that, as soon as that man goes away, the Land Commission comes along and grabs the holding.  I say that if a man gives an undertaking that he will come back after a certain period and work that holding the Land Commission should not seek to acquire it.  There, again, when you appeal and go before the Land Commission and say: &ldquo;This man is prepared to come back next year and work the holding,&rdquo; the reply generally is: &ldquo;Sorry, we want to take this holding; it is needed for a division amongst other congests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to keep the House any longer because the Minister must get time to reply.  In addition, there may be other Deputies who desire to speak on this Estimate, but there is one final point I want to raise with regard to the policy of the Land Commission in reference to giving an exchange of holdings.  From time to time the Land Commission, quite properly, acquire portions of land from fairly large landowners. One of these landowners approached me some time ago and asked me to investigate the possibility of the Land Commission giving him an alternative farm in another part of the country.</P>
    <P>He was quite prepared to give up his farm in County Mayo and he recognised that he could live quite comfortably on what he still had.  The Land Commission's reply was that they were not willing to give any such exchange but they gave no reasons for that decision. I am wondering if I could find out what is the policy of the Land Commission in that regard and on what basis they decide whether they are going to give a person who wants an exchange the accommodation he requires.  The big trouble, as I said at the outset, is that while the Land Commission may be actually just in their decisions, justice must not only be done but it must also appear to be done.  The trouble about the Land Commission is that while they <Col N="1384" /> may be satisfied in their office that justice is being done, in perhaps four cases out of five outside the office it does not appear to be done.  I think that some effort should be made in the future to get that vast, omniscient and omnipotent body, the Land Commission, into some closer touch with the people whom it is designed to serve.</P>

      <P>I shall not detain the House very long but this is a very irritating Estimate so far as the people in my constituency are concerned.  We feel very sore in my county with the policy which has been pursued for some years past.  We are satisfied that so far as the Land Commission is concerned, their whole idea is to move the people from the West up to the Midlands. There has been a certain amount of political play-acting connected with this policy of migration from the West because Ministers of all Governments in the past took up all types of people and gave them land in Meath and in the Midlands.  There was a certain amount of vote-catching in connection with that policy.  There is only one way by which the evils attendant on congestion in the West can be relieved and that is by establishing industries there, not by bringing the people up to the Midlands, County Meath or County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that there is congestion in the West, that there are thousands of people almost living on top of one another there, but there is no use in bringing them up to Meath, Westmeath and Dublin in an effort to relieve that congestion.  There is only one way in which you can relieve congestion, and that is by developing the natural resources of these areas and cut out this nonsense about migration.  If you were to take over all the land in Meath, it would not relieve one-fifth of the congestion in <Col N="1385" /> the West.  I am satisfied that the people of the Midlands are not getting justice under the present system of dividing land.  We are told by one Minister that, under the Land Acts, landless men cannot get land.  I asked a question of the present Minister and he said landless men can get land. Which of these Ministers is right, I should like to know?</P>
    <P>So far as my county is concerned, the blind policy of Fianna Fáil some years ago caused endless trouble because they gave land to every Tom, Dick and Harry so long as they belonged to a Fianna Fáil club.  It made no difference what a man's character was or what type he was; all that was required was that he should shout loud enough for the policy of Fianna Fáil. In many cases good men got land under Fianna Fáil, men who are now making money and rearing good families.  But many men of a rotten type got land and their holdings were vested in them by the Land Commission.  The result was that men who got a good house and 22 acres of good land about 20 years ago can sell it for £1,600 or £1,700 and drink that money until it is all gone.  I do not care whether a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael or a Labour Party supporter gets land if he is the right type of man.</P>
    <P>Then we had the Land Commission paying dozens of what I may call inspector touts to look after people who got land ten or 20 years ago to see how they were working it.  The land was taken from some of them, but if any &ldquo;buck&rdquo; has some pull they will pass him by, although his land may adjoin that of some unfortunate widow of a man who got a bit of land, and who is in dire poverty, and who is told: &ldquo;Out you go if you dare to sell it&rdquo;, although she has some cattle on the land.  Some neighbour who may want to get the land will tell the inspector that the cattle are not hers at all, and these touts listen to these stories.  That is most irritating.  Why not do the thing in a manly way, take the type of man who is suitable, and give him land and let him make good, and he will if he is the right type?</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything against migrants.  I believe that there should <Col N="1386" /> be a reasonable amount of migration. The majority of the migrants in my county are good, honest, hard-working men, but if they had to live on the 22 acres which they get they would not stay for three years in the county.  Most of their money comes from sons and daughters who went to Great Britain or America, and they are having a fine living and, in a few years, some of them are able to buy large holdings out of the remittances they receive.  All I want to see is fair play.  In County Meath over a number of years no local man could get a holding except a herd on the land which was being divided, and he only got a scraggy holding.  It was a case of take it or leave it.  But every attention is given to the migrants.  I am not against that if there is fair play.  There are many uneconomic holders in Meath living within two or three miles of estates which were divided.  We were told that these men would be considered, and that if they had uneconomic holdings these would be made up to 20 acres or 30 acres.  I have seen very few uneconomic holders getting land; perhaps one out of 20 got a holding.  That was only to keep us quiet, while the invasion was taking place under the former Minister and the Minister before him.</P>
    <P>There is as much congestion in north Meath and Cavan as there is in Mayo. The Land Commission will say that they have combed out north Meath and cannot find any congestion there.  I say they are blind or vindictive when they talk like that.  There is a lot of congestion in north Meath, with men living on five or six acres of bad land. These men are overlooked.  I know men in north Meath who are prepared to give up 60 acres of land and go into the Dublin area or the south Meath area so as to make room for their neighbours in the congested areas, but the Land Commission will not consider their cases.  There are plenty of men on the Cavan borders who are prepared to give up land in that way.  The border of Meath and Cavan is a congested area.  There are hard-working men living there in misery on rocks and poor soil.  They were overlooked or would not be considered because the Minister came from the West.  All the <Col N="1387" /> boys who want to get easy posts come from the west.</P>
    <P>I hope that the present Minister will take land in the Midlands so that he can at least give fair play to the people amongst whom I live.  The former Minister for Lands broke his word to a very decent landholder in County Meath.  A deputation consisting of Deputy O'Reilly, Deputy Hilliard, Deputy Fagan and myself and the man who owned the land which was being taken by the Land Commission in a mean, unfair way, Mr. Fottrell from outside Athboy, waited on the Minister. That man may have a fair amount of land but he is a good worker and gives plenty of employment and is a good Irishman.  He had six sons to work his holding, but notwithstanding that the Land Commission stepped in and said they would take the land. That man was prepared to give the land if he got fair play and if they would meet him on a fair basis.  The deputation asked the Minister to stay the hand of the Land Commission for a short time so that we could see if anything could be done and the Minister said that he would stay the hand of the Land Commission so as to get word sent to that man as to how the case was going.</P>
    <P>That man never got a letter from the Minister.  An inspector came down and divided the land amongst other people and never as much as recognised the owner or the deputation. That is mean, low and shabby.  It is un-Irish and unnatural if the Land Commission, which is spending public money, can hurl insults at deputations. I do not stand for it and Deputy O'Reilly does not stand for it.  If Mr. Fottrell was approached in a manly way, not alone would he give that land, but he might have given more in the national interest if it were needed. When men of that type are treated in a despicable way what can you expect? But that is not the only case.  There are scores of men in County Meath who had land taken from them by the Land Commission and divided up, and in many cases rottenly divided up, without any consideration being given to them.  Spivs from India, Great <Col N="1388" /> Britain and everywhere else are buying up hundreds of acres of land and there is no one to say a word to them &mdash;spivs with plenty of money to burn and with a pagan outlook.  The decent Irish farmer who attends an auction to buy land has not money enough to compete with them.  But a spiv can buy land by telephoning from Dublin; in fact in one case it was done by telephoning from India.  Of course they gave a little employment and built a few houses.  I do not care if they employed 10,000 people.  I say they should be kept out and let the Irish people get the Irish land.  Because taxation has gone up in their countries, Ireland has become a paradise for all sorts of people from all over the world.  Jews and Gentiles come in and set up stud farms and have their big cars and can attend races at the Curragh and Leopardstown and Naas, while Irish farmers' sons and daughters are emigrating to Great Britain to slave and sweat for a few pounds to send home to help their fathers and mothers.</P>
    <P>The spivs and the Jews come in here and buy up land and this Government close their eyes to such happenings, as, indeed, did the previous Government. I live in the midst of such happenings &mdash;in the ranches of Meath.  I desire to see a middle-class peasantry planted in this country.  I do not want to see spivs under any circumstances, even if they bring in the money and give employment. They are not the right type of people to form the backbone of a country.  All they want is a royal time at everybody else's expense.  They are not the decent type of Englishman, whom I admire.  The type I have in mind would not fight for their country during the last war.  Instead they ran over to Ireland, but the Government at the time closed their eyes to all this.</P>
    <P>We demanded of the then Minister, in the national interest, to stop the buying-up of these large holdings.  The Land Act, 1950, was brought in, and we were told we were going to buy land for division on the open market.  I knew of large tracts of land that could have been bought up by the Land Commission. However, this did not happen because the Minister was a small boy, but the Land Commission is composed <Col N="1389" /> of big boys and rotten boys, at that. To look at the Minister one would think that he would be big enough to frighten half the members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a grievance in Meath.  We desire our farmers' sons who have money, position and a proper family background to get a share of the land that is going.  Why should the spivs have it?  I have no objection to the migrants from the West of Ireland. In fact, I live amongst them, and I must say that one could not find better neighbours.  They are good and honest men, but even they are surprised that the men of Meath are not being provided with land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give us fair play and justice.  If there is an estate for division I entreat him not to forget the decent Meath men.  I ask him to see that the poor cottier who has five or six children to provide for will be given justice.  While the Fianna Fáil Government were in office not one cottier in County Meath got an acre of land.  These unfortunate people have to graze their one cow on the side of the roads.  If this is national policy or Irish policy, then I say, &ldquo;To hell with freedom.  It is all a cod.&rdquo;  I want to see a Government, and I do not care what Party it incorporates, with a manly, national outlook, who will allot to the Irish people the land available.  I do not give two straws about politics.  All I want to see is fair play.  There are scores of big holdings in County Meath, in County Westmeath and in County Dublin.  Many of these are worked by good and honest men who give full employment. I do not want to see these people disturbed.  On the other hand, there are men who own three or four hundred acres who indulge in nothing but idleness.  Nothing is being done, and the land is left in a disgraceful condition, waterlogged, unkempt <Col N="1390" /> hedges, and so on.  I want to see these estates pared down.  If a man has an estate of 400 acres and refuses to work it in the national interest, cut him down to 100 or 200 acres or let him get out of the holding.  I say these things openly and in a manly fashion, because I do not care if I lose votes by it or not.  Having worked in the national interest over the past 30 years, I believe the nation and the people want justice.  There is no justice in waiting for 35 years of native government and seeing land division not half-completed.  I saw these spivs and those who are living in royal comfort and royal idleness, getting a grand living out of this country while our own people are in misery, working the land for others while they cannot get an acre for themselves.</P>
    <P>These men could have spent thousands of pounds on the draining of their land but they would not spend a penny.  Nevertheless, they will avail of the Government schemes such as the land reclamation scheme.  Many of them got the land, not through open competition, but due to the shedding of the blood of our ancestors.  The bones of our ancestors are lying there in the graves in many of those holdings in the Midlands and these men, their successors, are living in regal comfort ever since.</P>
    <P>I am not against any of those people if they do their job well, if they are giving good employment and working the land in the national interest.  I do not care what their past was, what their present is or what their future will be if they are doing their duty.  It is the responsibility of the Government to pare down those holdings and at least give us a middle-class peasantry of which we can be proud.  That is what I want to see.  That is what I stand for. I will say outside what I am saying here, and I believe I am speaking the sentiments of the present Minister and of the previous Minister, but they were too cowardly to face up to the job because it was a tough job.  But I think that even the Minister knows he can be tough when he likes.  When he was dealing with the teachers he was tough and I want him to be tough with the &ldquo;bucks&rdquo; he should be tough with.  As <Col N="1391" /> far as vesting is concerned, it is a public disgrace.  I, myself, had my holding vested only last year after 21 years.  Some of my neighbours who are on the same estate have their holdings 25 years and there are at least eight of them not vested yet.  Why is it that there is no incentive given to these men to work and make good?  They cannot get a loan from the bank because they have no title to their holdings.  They had the land for 25 years and worked it and reared their families but if they require a loan to improve their land they cannot get it.  Why cannot these holdings be vested after five or seven years so that these men will have a title to their land, thereby securing the right to a loan from a bank?  We are told they are on the 11-month system.</P>
    <P>Why would not they be if they have no money and only 20 acres of scraggy land to which they have no title?  It is time the Land Commission woke up. If a man has land for eight or ten years, let him have a title to it and he will work the land in the interest of the country.</P>
    <P>I will now stop.  I am sick and fed-up with the whole business&mdash;emigration, landless men being driven out of the country, spivs coming in and buying up estates and the Government having to go into the open market to purchase estates.  I say to the Government: Do your job and you will have my blessing and the blessing of the people who work for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention to a couple of matters here.  I think they are of great importance.  One is the condition of the roads to estates. The Land Commission come in and they divide up an estate.  They run a grand road through it and then they throw it there.  I have one example of that.  When we sent down a county surveyor to endeavour to get that road taken over by the county council his estimate for putting that road in such a condition of repair that it could be taken over was £860,000.  The unfortunate tenants settled on it have to come with their horses and butts to take their milk to the main road because <Col N="1392" /> the lorry that comes for the milk will not go into it.  The Land Commission have surely some responsibility to see that the road is put into such a condition that the local authority can take it over and keep it for the tenants concerned. I think that an outrage.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the position about the subdivision of land taken over by a local authority for houses.  For the past three years we have land which was taken from people for the building of houses by the local authority and those people have not yet been paid for it.  The houses are built, families are living in them and the local sites committee are now in the unfortunate position of having to go to those people for more land while they have not yet been paid for the land taken three or four years ago.  I gave a list of those people to the Minister yesterday and I hope that we will have results within a week or a fortnight.  I know that we will be adjourning for the holidays and will not have the opportunity of taking it up here, so I trust that the Minister will see it through.</P>
      <P>I wonder what is the position about State lands?  We have people tearing round and snapping in on lands to take them over while in Kilworth we have land lying bare and used only for grazing. Why is it not divided up?  Is there any obligation still towards Britain which prevents its being taken over and divided?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The first duty in regard to an estate which has been taken over is to make economic holdings out of the uneconomic holdings surrounding it. That was not done on the Trabolgan estate in my constituency.  A relic of uneconomic holdings was left there by the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government. When the estate was divided, holdings of nine or ten acres were left and when those people claimed portion of the Trabolgan estate they did not get anything and they are still there as a legacy.</P>
      <P>I want to know what is the position regarding the estate.  That estate was taken over during the emergency.  The land had to be taken and set out for tillage.  Three or four crops were taken off it and then it was thrown aside.  I understand that within the past six months that estate was offered to a man from whom the Land Commission are taking land compulsorily because he has too much already.  That statement was made in open court by that man recently, Mr. Buckley.  The same thing happened about the O'Neill estate.  That land was also offered to Mr. Buckley from whom the Land Commission are at present engaged in compulsorily acquiring land.</P>

I want to know the position regarding those two estates, and I want to know&mdash;now if we can get time and if not we will get the information later on by way of question&mdash;the reason why the Land Commission, instead of dividing those holding which they have held for five, six and in one case seven years, offers them to a man from whom they are acquiring land compulsorily because they say he has too much land already.  I can produce a Press report of the Land Commission proceedings and the statements made by that man.</P>
      <P>I would also like to know the position regarding the Finnure estate which was a scandal.  It was a holding of 500 acres and appeals were made to the late Minister to take it over. There were 500 acres from which the unfortunate tenants were evicted.  The grabber was allowed to sell those 500 acres to an Englishman.  He was let in though we hear about the rocks and the 12-acre holdings in Mayo.  We have ten and 20-acre holdings and the unfortunate fellows who were evicted out of that estate are now up on the side of the mountain.  Questions have been asked of the late Minister by every Deputy of my constituency about that estate, but it is still there, purchased by the Englishman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for what Deputy Giles said.  If on the one hand the Land Commission step in and take 50-, 100- or 200-acre farms from the <Col N="1395" /> Irishman and at the same time they stand by quietly and let big estates of 500, 600 and 700 acres be acquired by foreigners something is wrong with the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick referred to somersaults in connection with the policy of Fianna Fáil regarding land resettlement.  As is characteristic of the Deputy's statements, they remain, I think I may say, intentionally vague. <Col N="1396" /> I should like him to explain when he gets a further opportunity, where the somersault is.  I have before me the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government as laid down in 1939:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the aim and object of this policy of land division to secure the establishment on the land available the maximum number of economic holders.  That is the big factor which should govern inspectors in their work in promoting their schemes.  Further, the whole programme of land resettlement operated by the Land Commission must for the future have as its primary object the relief of congestion in the scheduled congested districts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know what advantage it is to the relief of congestion that Deputy Blowick should constantly try to misrepresent the Party to which I belong as not having always placed that policy in the forefront of their programme.  I cannot see any benefit to be obtained from suggesting that our Party is not just as anxious as Deputy Blowick's Party or any other Party to relieve congestion.</P>
      <P>The disagreement which I had with the Deputy when, as Minister for Lands, he was bringing his Land Bill through this House was that I believed that by fixing the market value as a statutory requirement in the acquisition of land we may reach the position where land acquisition will become impossible because to the cost of acquiring land you must add the cost of putting up buildings on the land, the cost of making roads and the cost of all the other improvements. When you add to all that the fact that the incoming allottee is going to have his annuity halved, the annuity that would have been placed on him in normal circumstances, and that under all these headings the State is subsidising land purchase&mdash;when the costs of all these respective headings are increasing&mdash;it stands to reason that either the State will have to spend a vast ocean of money in addition to what it is spending already to accomplish the same results or, if the amount of money is not available, even though there are substantial increases, you will not get the same results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> There is no use in Deputy Davin trying to pretend to the House or anybody who is not acquainted with this problem that I have gone back to the Land Commission under favourable conditions.  Where are they?  The staff in the Land Commission, although a great many of them have come back, is not back to the normal footing on which it was in 1939.  The costs of operations have gone up to an enormous extent.  The area of land&mdash;as anybody knows who tries to assess this problem in a reasonable way and who is honest and truthful about it&mdash;to be acquired is decreasing every year.  The obstacles, both legal and financial, and other, are increasing.</P>
    <P>One unfortunate thing about this debate year after year is that Deputies refuse to face the realities of the position. I have a crow to pluck with my predecessor.  He went to Ballina, in the same county to which we both belong, and he stated&mdash;he has given me an opportunity of replying to him now because he has repeated it here again&mdash; that there was no land available when he went into the Land Commission in 1948.  He went down to the most land-hungry county in Ireland and he preached the doctrine everywhere up and down the county that when he took over in the Department of Lands there was no land available, that he could not do anything and that Fianna Fáil had seen to it that his task was made absolutely impossible by putting him into that position.  My predecessor had not the reputation of reading very closely some of the reports that were issued from the Department.  I wonder if he read the report which was published on the operations of the Irish Land Commissioners for the year from 1st April, 1947, to 31st March, 1948. This report is signed by Judge Maguire and it is signed by all the commissioners. It is dated the 6th December, 1948.  Paragraph 5, page 7 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards future operations, it is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the area of land likely to be found suitable and capable of being acquired for the relief of congestion and the subject can only be usefully discussed in terms of work immediately in sight.  Leaving out of consideration <Col N="1398" /> the undivided residues just referred to, the position at 31st March, 1948, was that prices were agreed upon or fixed for 11,535 acres and offers made of provisional lists published in respect of a further 35,639 acres.  Thus the total area actually in process of acquisition was 47,174 acres.  Proceedings for a acquisition were decided upon but not yet instituted in respect of a further area of approximately 17,000 acres while reports following inspection and valuation were available on an additional area of about 90,000 acres.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for the statements that no land was available, that it was impossible to work, that the cupboard was bare.</P>

      <P>What is the present position with regard to acquisition? There were 47,000 acres in the machine for acquisition, according to the commissioners. The House need not take my word for it.  Let them read what is said in the Official Report&mdash;47,000 acres.  The information that has been supplied to me by the Irish Land Commission officers with regard to present prospects is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The area to be acquired must, to all intents and purposes, come from the area in the machine, that is, 53,000 acres at the 31st March, 1951.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 47,000 acres in the machine on the 31st March, 1948, and there were 53,000 acres in it on the 31st of March of this year.  With regard to the question as to what is expected this year, the indications are that some 23,000 acres are likely to be taken over.  The only change I see in the Land Commission policy as far as concentration on the relief of congestion is concerned, apart from the changes in the 1950 Act, are that it is definitely stated <Col N="1399" /> that a holding of 33 acres of good land, or its equivalent in land of varied quality, should be a standard holding. But in the congested areas in which we are primarily interested the policy is the same as it was all the time under the Fianna Fáil Administration: that is that it would be absolutely impossible to get anything like a reasonably economic standard in terms of what we are accustomed to outside these areas and the most one can aim at is the £10 valuation.  When one considers that a vast number of holdings are under £4 one realises that even the £10 is unattainable.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to open market transactions.  I gave some figures in reference to these transactions.  I cannot say what the possibilities of progress are when one considers that there was only one auction attended, as I said, without success, because the bidding went too high.</P>
    <P>With regard to negotiations for the purchase of holdings, there are a small number of holdings, three at least, in which negotiations were opened.  Nine other cases were noted for investigation. Therefore, very little was done, though there were other cases that had apparently been investigated and some of them were noted for acquisition. The total number is so small that, if it is taken as an indication of what would normally occur, very little will, in fact, be obtainable in that way and future progress is not very hopeful. If the fact is that only a small number of holdings were available either for negotiation or by public auction, that is a circumstance outside our control. That is likely to be the position in future, and I cannot see that very much will result from these open market operations.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that when there is a change of Government we should, if there are experiments or efforts being made to improve matters by our predecessors, change over without very grave consideration and without being satisfied that the results that were expected have not been secured.  This question of going out and buying in the open market affects the whole question of the solution of this problem.  Before the passing of the <Col N="1400" /> 1950 Land Act the price of all tenanted land acquired compulsorily or by agreement with the Land Commission averaged £9 per acre.  The price of untenanted land acquired compulsorily averaged about £7 10s. 0d. per acre. The price paid for land resumed over the period averaged £15 per acre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that during the last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is from 1923 to 1950.  That is, of course, an average figure.  The price of land then, subject to annuity, acquired by the Land Commission was placed on the same basis in relation to price as land which was resumed.  The position with regard to offers which were accepted and the price fixed by the Appeal Tribunal since the passing of the Land Act, 1950, up to March, 1951, is that the offers of 28,930 acres came to a price of £517,575.  The average price per acre was £17.9.  The acceptances of 6,286 acres at a price of £132,617 came to £21.1 per acre, whereas the price fixed by the Appeal Tribunal in three cases of 351 acres averaged £19.8 per acre.  These figures, of course, show a tremendous increase as compared with the price of land acquired between 1923 and 1950.  The conditions may have been somewhat different in that the estates now being acquired are smaller than those that were acquired previously and are, therefore, less likely to contain high percentages of poor land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the point that the Land Commission has been trying to secure really good-class land to attract migrants but nevertheless, having regard to the figures I have quoted, the averages before the passing of the Act over the whole period range from £7 10s. to £9 per acre.  That would seem to indicate, allowing for the fact that it is a very long period and bearing in mind that an average has its disadvantages for comparison purposes, that the figures go from practically £18 per acre to £21 per acre.  When you add on the costs after the land has been taken over and when you take into consideration the arrangements that have to be made for migrants, it seems to me that land acquisition <Col N="1401" /> and land resettlement are very, very costly processes.</P>
    <P>I quite appreciate that the rearrangement of rundale holdings is useful but my Government and I have always believed that in order to make an effective contribution to the relief of congestion in the West it is essential to build up as large a reservoir of land as one can in areas outside to which one can transfer the larger migrants and thus leave their holdings available for the congests in the West.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need go into all the matters that were raised, beyond saying that where Deputies have called attention to particular cases I shall make it my business to see how these cases stand and communicate with them where necessary.  Neither will I enter into the question of aliens.  That question is a matter of Government policy generally.  There is a pretence the Land Commission has some special function in regard to that matter.  As far as the nationality of owners of land is concerned, or their citizenship, the Land Commission has precisely the same rights and can acquire their lands if they are necessary for the relief of congestion and provided the other conditions are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>There were 15,000 holdings and allotments vested last year.  With regard to allottees, of the 1,300 allottees last year about 1,000 were congests or uneconomic holders whose holdings were improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to know was the number of holdings that were raised to an economic level and will not need further attention from the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is possible to give that figure.  If we were to take a certain economic level it could obviously be said that all the operations in the West of Ireland were fruitless. We must assume there is some return for this vast expenditure. Surely the Deputy does not suggest when there is a resettlement or a rearrangement scheme that there is a rough and ready way by which we can say what the actual benefit is.  There may be an enormous benefit in convenience and otherwise to the tenant.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £764,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1952, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> The net total Estimate for Forestry in the current year shows a net increase of £523,570 over last year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £103,595; and sub-head B &mdash;Travelling Expenses, £12,250.  The increases here are due principally to increases in the number of the technical staff.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (1)&mdash;Acquisition of Land Grant-in-Aid, £85,000.  This is an increase of £20,000 over the amount provided last year.  As this is a Grant-in-Aid any unspent balance at the end of the year is carried over to the next year.  The balance from last year was approximately £32,000, making a total of £111,000 available for the present year, the remaining £6,000 being required for the payment of annuities to the Land Commission, and of rents of leased lands.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to be given some account of last year's operations.  During 1950-51, eight new forestry centres were opened, bringing the total to 143.</P>
    <P>The total area of land acquired during 1950-51 was 21,594 acres, costing approximately £51,200.  This compares with 9,122 acres acquired in 1949-50. Since the 1st April a further 5,914 acres have been acquired at a cost of over £20,000.  Agreement has been reached with private owners for the purchase of 19,533 acres to cost approximately £100,000.  In addition offers to private owners have been made for 20,690 acres, the total cost being £120,000. Negotiations are proceeding with the Land Commission for the transfer of some 1,222 acres to the Forestry Division at a cost of £8,776 and a further 6,830 acres are due to be inspected jointly with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The figures show that, with the aid of additional staff, acquisition proceedings have been expedited and good progress has been made.  Further and more intensive effort will still be necessary if we are to make certain that a three years' reserve of plantable land will be available and, of course, such effort is still more imperative assuming that the rate of planting continues to increase. The total acreage of plantable land in hands amounts to 30,000 acres.</P>
    <P>The F.A.O. expert whose report is being printed and which will, I hope, <Col N="1404" /> be circulated to Deputies in due course, recommended 3,000 acres as the minimum for an economic forest unit, as compared with the modest 300 acres which the Department insists upon as necessary for a start in a new district. Blocks of 3,000 acres of plantable land can very seldom be secured anywhere in Ireland nowadays in one transaction, and they must be built up patiently by a series of smaller purchases.  Provided there are good prospects of expansion in a district, the Department is still prepared to commence with 300 acres or thereabouts, but the practice of declining to acquire small and detached areas except in the immediate neighbourhood of existing forests, or where there are very definite prospects of expansion in the immediate future, must be adhered to so long as other areas for the time being afford a better prospect of economic development.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (2)&mdash;Forest Development and Maintenance, £925,500.&mdash; There is additional provision this year amounting to £493,920, or almost 90 per cent. of the overall net increase in the total estimate.  The very substantial increase asked for is necessary to meet an anticipated increase in planting operations; increased rates of wages now being paid to forestry labourers; the stock-piling of fencing materials; the purchase of the greater part of the heavy machinery, and the building or purchase of a number of houses for occupation by foresters.  It is hoped to erect 12 houses, and to purchase two or three existing houses if suitable buildings become available for sale adjacent to any of the forests where there is at present no dwelling-house for the forester in charge.</P>
    <P>Practically two-thirds of the money provided under this sub-head is spent on labour, and that is an encouraging indication of the social value of afforestation.  During the past year the number of men employed varied from about 2,300 to 3,000.  This number will be increased during the present year.  To meet future needs, the number of State nurseries has been increased to 50, comprising approximately 600 acres.</P>
    <P>Planting operations last winter were much impeded by weather conditions. <Col N="1405" /> The total for the year was 9,100 acres, and while this is the highest figure yet reached, I am advised that it is less than would have been achieved in more favourable or even normal circumstances. This programme involved the erection of about 150 miles of standard wire fencing.</P>
    <P>The situation as regards the supply of fencing materials is uncertain, and in view of rising prices and possible interruption of supplies, efforts are being made to make forward purchases of wire netting, etc.  It is not yet possible to say whether, or how quickly, the orders placed will be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>During the past year delivery has been taken of seven heavy tractors and 13 special type drainage ploughs. More of these machines are on order. These machines will be utilised, in the first instance, for the drainage of peat areas already in hands.  The forestry branch is very hopeful that the planting of certain limited areas in the Western counties offers distinct possibilities for future development.  Operations have begun on an area north of Newport in County Mayo, and at Bally-bofey, County Donegal, and development work will be put in hands elsewhere as soon as the additional tractors come to hand.  Similar areas of peat land may be acquired as soon as the planting of those already in hands is nearing completion.  In addition, with the aid of another type of plough which is being ordered, subsoiling operations will be commenced upon areas already in hands where the presence of an underlying mineral pan has proved inimical to tree growth.  The use of subsoiling machinery will, it is hoped, enable planting to be carried out profitably in considerable areas in the south-west, which would otherwise be unsuitable for planting.  I regard these operations as being very largely of an experimental nature for the present.</P>
    <P>Under part (1) of sub-head C (3)&mdash; Timber Conversion, £106,190&mdash;provision is made for thinning and felling operations and for the working of portable saw-mills.  Under part (2) provision is made for the running of the Department's fixed saw-mills.  The two principal mills are at Dundrum in County Tipperary. and Cong, County <Col N="1406" /> Mayo.  During the past year the mill at Dundrum has been entirely rebuild and re-equipped with modern machinery. The results of the installation of drying kilns at Dundrum are encouraging, and represent a highly significant achievement in expanding the field for the utilisation of native timber.  It is the intention to erect further drying kilns with the saw-mill at Cong.</P>
    <P>An increase of £500 is required under sub-head D&mdash;Grants for Afforestation Purposes, £2,500&mdash;for the payment of grants to private persons or public bodies undertaking planting operations on their own land.  I should like to see a great deal more planting undertaken by farmers and landowners.  I am convinced that they could make a substantial contribution to the planting programme.</P>
    <P>As to sub-head E&mdash;Forestry Education, £1,290&mdash;with the expansion of the planting programme the intake of forestry trainees, which has never exceeded 12 per annum, has become too small, and it will be necessary to increase the number to double that figure.</P>
    <P>It was originally intended to build an extension to Avondale school and a sum of £15,000 included in the provision under sub-head C (2) was earmarked for this purpose.  The recent acquisition of the Shelton Abbey estate near Arklow for forestry purposes has, fortunately, solved this problem.  The Shelton Abbey buildings can with comparatively little cost be put to use as a new forestry school to replace Avondale House.  With Shelton Abbey the Department acquired 920 acres and an appreciable quantity of valuable standing timber.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid. £116,240&mdash;The receipts from the State forests continue to increase annually and it is estimated that an additional £20,000 will be realised this year.  Heretofore, there has been some difficulty in disposing of small thinnings, but I am glad to be able to state that a market has now been found for the entire output. Increased revenue is also anticipated from sawn timber.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Forestry Act, the number of felling notices received during the past year shows a marked increase <Col N="1407" /> upon the previous year and this is probably due in part to the increasing cost of imported timber and in part to the fuel situation.  The period for replanting allowed under licences granted under the Forestry Act of 1928 will expire at the end of this year, and, as there are now ample stocks of transplants of most varieties to be had from the commercial nurseries, the Department will insist on the fulfilment of these replanting obligations without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister when he expects to get the remainder of the heavy machines on order for some months.  There was a danger at one time of their never reaching us because of the disturbed world conditions.  There were 18 tractors and 20 or 22 ploughs of various types on order and I should like to know if they are coming or if there is a reasonable prospect of the last of the orders being delivered.  As to acquisition proceedings, the Minister has a good staff in the acquisition section at the moment.  I would advise him, if a further increase in staff is necessary to keep up the inflow of plantable land into the pool not to hesitate to recruit additional staff, because the whole work of the Department depends upon keeping up the proper inflow of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to remind the Minister that the Forestry Department cannot be run properly unless it has a full three years' supply of land in hands in advance.  There were only 9½ tons of seed sown this year, about 7 tons last year and about 7 tons during the first year of the expansion of the forestry programme.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that the planting of seeds without having sufficient land on hands is groping in the dark to a great extent.  One year there may be land available for hard wood and another year there may be an intake of land for soft wood.  Before the Department can do things with security and in the knowledge that what they are doing is right and that they are not making any mistake, it is necessary to have approximately 70,000 acres of land in hands.  That is what I was working up to.  Without that, <Col N="1408" /> the programme cannot possibly be a success.  This year we had something like 1,000,000 soft wood larches for which there was not land available. Until the inflow of land builds up to a pool of at least three years' supply, which would be in the neighbourhood of 70,000 or 80,000 acres, it is impossible for those in charge of the nursery section and the director of forestry properly to judge the right type of seeds to sow.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask if the Minister has definitely decided to change the forestry school from Avondale to Shelton Abbey.  That is the purpose for which it was bought.  A temporary structure was contemplated and certain steps had been taken when Shelton Abbey came on the market.  It was my intention to transfer the forestry school to Shelton Abbey and also to establish a research institute there to deal with forest pests and diseases and the soil testing which is absolutely necessary.  Without that research institute we are like a man working a horse without shoes.  A great deal of damage might be done by some pest descending on us out of the blue if we have not the research institute to deal with pests.  When Mr. Cameron was here some two years ago he mentioned that in one district in Canada with which he was familiar a very large area of virgin forest was wiped out in four or five years by some insect which suddenly appeared and multiplied as fast as bacteria are supposed to multiply.</P>
    <P>The next point is that in Mr. Cameron's report he mentioned 3,000 acres as a forest unit.  That would be the ideal thing if we could reach it. During my time I chose to be guided by the officials of the Department.  As they have acquired a vast amount of experience for which I have the greatest respect, I recommend the Minister to take their advice in this matter. While they have set their goal at 3,000 acres, a 3,000 acre block in my opinion is definitely too large.  It would be the ideal if we could reach it, but the peculiar system of land tenure here and the land hunger which exists in certain places preclude us from setting our goal so high.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> I should like to know what planting programme the Minister is undertaking in the present year.  I know there were arrangements made in the Department for a planting programme of very close on 20,000 acres.  It may not be wise to plant 20,000 acres this year, as the director and the officials will have to use their judgment as to how the fencing material and other materials which are not available in the country are coming in.  It may not be wise to use all the fencing material this year and have a crop of young transplants in the nursery coming on for planting with no place to plant them or the necessary material to protect them.  I ask the Minister to be guided entirely by the staff of the Department in that regard.  It is too big a question for any one man to decide, particularly a non-expert.  I was anxious to reach the 20,000 acres goal myself.  If the officials of the Department advised me that it would not be good management taking the long-term view into account, I would not have done it, much as I would have liked to achieve that goal.  I ask the Minister not to go to the full 20,000 acres even though I suspect that the Department are in a position to plant 20,000 acres this year. I believe the correct figure is 19,700 acres for this year.  It may not be wise to use all the plantable land and the fencing materials if there is not a reasonable certainty that the supply of fencing material will come in.  If the present conflict in the East comes to an end, perhaps the position may ease off to a large extent.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to let us know what he intends to do about Kinnitty Castle.  Foresters' houses are very necessary.  The Department has been hamstrung ever since its birth, I might say, by reason of the fact that there was not suitable accommodation for foresters.  Until sufficient accommodation at forestry centres is provided, staff cannot be moved around from place to place or the good men used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>Dundrum sawmill has been completely reorganised and is turning out the very best dried timber, and the most modern wood-working machinery has been installed there.  I say to the Minister: Go ahead and do not limit <Col N="1410" /> yourself to 12 houses per year, because there is something in the neighbourhood of 90 or 100 houses needed in all the forestry centres of the Department. Until that target has been reached neither the Department nor the foresters will be able to go ahead to the best advantage with their work.  I do not know how the new sawmill in Cong has progressed, but I am aware that the machinery is already installed.  I hope that the Minister will not close his eyes or throw any obstacle in the way of that project because, from the financial point of view, there is a very valuable and a very jealously watched item at the end of the Estimate called Appropriations-in-Aid.  I do not want the Minister to stop at the erection of Cong sawmill; I would like him to erect many more like it.</P>
    <P>A valuable amount of commercial timber stands in our forests all over the country and wherever there is a suitable block of such timber it should be cut down and replanting done.  Replanting has grown in the course of the past few years from something like 40,000 or 50,000 acres to round about 110,000 acres this year.  The acreage should be double that amount, because we will not have any proper regard for forestry until we can see it as a paying proposition.  The only way to prove it as such is to make full use of the timber growing.  Our country has one of the most suitable climates in the world for growing timber, apart from tropical countries.</P>
    <P>The policy of afforestation and the policy of relieving congestion are very closely interlocked.  As I have said dozens of times, the Land Commission could do very useful work in areas where the quality of the land is poor. We do not look for large blocks of forest land in those areas.  They cannot grow as excellent timber as the fertile plains.  However, from a national point of view, it would not be good management if we were to use for timber production fertile land which is so suitable for agricultural purposes, food production and so on.  No matter what the Land Commission does in the mountainous areas, it can never improve the quality of the land, thereby bringing it the necessary prosperity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> Planned employment of a productive nature is what these areas require.  I do not want to harp on the point too much, as I believe the Minister knows as much about it as I do.  Let afforestation be developed in the mountainous areas and wherever there is congestion. Depopulation should not be allowed to occur there, and it can be stopped to a large extent by bringing in foresters. These forestry officials know their job, and they have been working in close harmony with the Land Commission in that regard.  The Forestry Department can do much more than the Land Commission to stem depopulation of rural areas from which emigration is heaviest.  The few localities where forestry centres have been opened in the West of Ireland have proved that fact already.  Young men have relinquished good wages in England and come home, just for the sake of being at home, even though they receive here only half what they earned in England.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell any further on that point.  I would like to say much more if I had sufficient time.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is this.  The Minister made reference to a market for thinnings.  Shortly before I left office, I think Wallboards were very interested in thinnings, and I would be more than delighted to hear that they are prepared to purchase.</P>

I do not want to make it difficult for the Chair and the House.  I believed that when there was a so-called gentlemen's agreement in the House, that agreement would be kept.  I listened to members speaking here breaking the time limit on discussion. Apparently forestry in this country is not a national problem.  To many members it is of no importance.  Even the ex-Minister showed lack of co-operation, in so far as the Minister took ten minutes and the ex-Minister took 17 minutes.  It is useless for us to speak on forestry, and I say now to those present and to the members who are not in the chamber it shows their lack of sincerity in discussing this vitally important matter when, through lack of co-operation and through personal ideas of their own, this Estimate is being treated in a disgraceful and dishonest manner.  It is being left to the officials again in the future, as in the past, to continue something that some of us do not believe in and on which, though we do not believe in it, we have been denied the right to speak.</P>

      <P>We have not yet decided on this matter.  The intention was to send the second year forestry trainees <Col N="1413" /> to Kinnitty Castle.  At the moment we are dealing with Shelton Abbey, trying to get the place in order for the transfer from Avondale.  We have not got the tractors.  I am informed that we have got all the ploughs but that there has been some difficulty.  However, I will try to let Deputy Blowick have further information about this matter in which he is interested.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> I propose, if the House agrees, to follow the same procedure as in previous years and deal generally with the group of Estimates Nos. 29 to 37 for which I am responsible as Minister.</P>
    <P>These Estimates show little change as compared with previous years and I am sure that the House will not expect me to go into detailed explanations of them.  The aggregate amount of the nine Estimates is £3,683,110, an increase of £106,340 on the Estimates and Supplementary Estimate for 1950-51.</P>
    <P>The only Estimates which show relatively substantial increases are those for the Garda Síochána (No. 30) and the Prisons (No. 31) which show increases of £139,100 and £9,010 respectively.  In the case of the Garda Estimate, the actual increase is £90,550, the figure given in the printed Volume of the Estimates not taking account of the Supplementary Estimate of £48,550 passed last March.  In the case of both Estimates the increases are due primarily to the provision which is being made for the purchase of reserve stocks of yarns, cloth, furniture, bedding, etc.</P>
    <P>In the case of none of the Estimates has any provision been made for the increases in pay that were recently approved by the Government for the Civil Service generally.  It has been decided to treat the Garda Síochána in precisely the same way as the Civil Service but, in the case of the Garda, it was necessary to make a formal Pay Order before the increases could become effective.  This Pay Order has now been made.  The cost of the increase for the Guards will be approximately £330,000 in a full year.  This is in the Estimate, but I thought it appropriate to mention it.</P>
    <P>A competition has been held by the Civil Service Commissioners for the purpose of enabling clerks and typists who have been employed in an unestablished capacity in Circuit Court offices to qualify for appointment to established posts in those offices.  In all 76 unestablished officers competed, of whom 72 qualified, and it is hoped to be able to offer establishment to all who qualified, subject to their satisfying the Civil Service Commissioners as to health, character, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> The House will recall that legislation was enacted earlier this year, the main purpose of which was to enable unestablished District Court clerks to be granted pensionable status as established officers.  Details of the scheme to implement this legislation have not yet been settled between my Department and the Department of Finance, but I am glad to have this opportunity of assuring Deputies that I will use every endeavour to see that the matter is brought to a speedy conclusion.</P>
    <P>The work of the Land Registry is still in arrear and it has been necessary to make increased provision this year for additional assistance and overtime which, it is hoped, will bring about an appreciable improvement in the near future.  Moreover, photostat machines for the photographic reproduction of copies of documents, records, etc., have now been provided for use in the offices of the Supreme and High Courts, Land Registry and the Public Record Office.</P>
    <P>The interim report on crime furnished by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána reveals that the downward tendency in indictable crime from 1944 to 1949 did not continue in 1950 in which year there was a small increase (295), mainly larcenies, as compared with 1949.  The total number of indictable offences was 12,466 for 1950 of which 7,687 (62 per cent.) were reported in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  Of the 12,466 crimes, 8,637 were larcenies and 2,034 burglaries or housebreakings.</P>
    <P>The number of prosecutions (147,635) for summary offences showed a decrease of 17,411 as compared with 1949.  Road Traffic Act prosecutions fell by 10,100 as compared with 1949, and of the 87,807 prosecutions 50,740 were for offences against the lighting regulations, 38,684 being against pedal cyclists and 12,056 against motorists. Prosecutions under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts numbered 15,648 in 1950 as against 16,724 in 1949.</P>
    <P>The number of mechanically propelled vehicles registered increased from 122,536 in 1949 to 138,134 in 1950, while the number of persons fatally injured, 213, was the same for both years.  We were asked to be brief, so I was as brief as I could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to emulate the Minister's good example in that respect as I have very little to say.  I was glad to hear from the Minister that he is going to continue the pressure on the Department of Finance regarding the position of District Court clerks under the recent legislation. I hope he will take off the gloves when he is dealing with that Department in that connection.  I found that I had some difficulty in making any impression on them and I have no hesitation in saying that the attitude of the Finance Department regarding this matter has been, to say the least of it, not very reasonable.  I was also glad to hear about the Circuit Court clerks.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the strength of the Garda force.  I was satisfied in my very short period in the Department of Justice that the force is very much under strength, and I think there is a need for recruitment.  I do not think that there is a sufficient number of guards particularly in the big centres like Dublin to give that protection and control which is necessary in the public interest.</P>
      <P>I need hardly say that I was pleased to hear from the Minister that the Government have decided to implement in full the previous Government's decision regarding the arbitration award.  I was very glad indeed to hear that it was their intention to give the force the full benefit of that award, particularly with regard to its retrospective aspect, because on a former occasion I think that the Guards were not treated as well as they should have been.</P>
      <P>May I say, while I am talking about the Guards, that one of the matters to which the Minister might give attention is their uniforms.  I do not know whether it is that the material is poorer than it used to be in the old days, but certainly the uniforms of the Guards do not look as well and as smart as they used to in the early years after the formation of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to cut this as short as I can, as I do not want to take too much time.  There is, however, one matter which I think I will have to deal with without any further delay, and that is the question of traffic and <Col N="1417" /> traffic offences&mdash;and traffic particularly in the City of Dublin.  I think it will be admitted that the position in Dublin City and in some of the suburban roads is a menace.  The whole traffic of this city can only be described in the words of the Abbey as being &ldquo;in a state of chassis&rdquo;.  It is chaotic and it is almost impossible even for people who are living in the city and who are trying to follow the regulations from day to day to know when they can go along a particular thoroughfare or how far they can go along it, but it is utterly impossible for people coming up from the country to do business here.  I do not think we have enough Gardaí on traffic duty in the city.  There are many points in the city that are really dangerous and there is no traffic policeman on duty at them.  I fully understand that that is due very largely if not entirely to what I have already said, that is, the fact that we have not an adequate number of Gardaí.</P>
    <P>The other matter in connection with traffic to which I want to refer is dangerous driving and driving while under the influence of drink.  I think we have dangerous driving, or driving to the danger of the public, to a greater extent in this country than perhaps in any other country.  There are, from my own observation, people driving motor vehicles in this country who, in my opinion, should not be given charge of a perambulator.  It is not altogether the drunks who are driving in that irresponsible and dangerous manner. You will find it early in the morning and in the middle of the day as well as late at night.  May I say with all respect to the fair sex that they are the principal offenders when they get behind the wheel of a car.</P>
    <P>I think all of us are glad to notice that within the past year or two the courts have been taking a more serious view of cases of driving while under the influence of drink which are brought before them and that they have been imposing fairly substantial penalties and particularly in regard to the suspension of driving licences.  So far as I know, in no case up to the present has the suspension of a licence been remitted either in whole or in <Col N="1418" /> part by the Minister for Justice.  I hope that the Minister will not be tempted to interfere with that practice. As one who perhaps was not always as far removed from a drink as I am now, I say that a drunken motorist is an absolute menace on the road, and that a man who is drunk in charge of and driving a motor vehicle in this country, and particularly on the thoroughfares in and around the City of Dublin, should for his own sake and for the sake of the community be heavily penalised.</P>
    <P>I should like further if the Minister would consider the question of appointing some sort of a mobile force.  I know there are Gardaí driving around in police motor cars, but I should like to see, say, on the Bray Road, some police on motor cycles who could, there and then, deal with the people who are an absolute menace.  There are, perhaps, more accidents on the Bray Road than there are, perhaps, on any similar stretch of thoroughfare in this country or in any other country.  I realise that the road itself is rather dangerous.  It is narrow and winding: there are dangerous bends on it and very many dangerous cross-roads. Nevertheless, you see as much if not more irresponsible driving on that particular road as perhaps on any other road leading into the City of Dublin. I feel that the system they have in operation in other countries might be worth examination if not a trial whereby the Garda would in certain cases and for certain offences have power to inflict the punishment himself or collect the fine himself on the spot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is done in places other than Paris.  That system might be worth examination and a trial in this country.  I make no apology for stressing this matter because, literally, it is a matter of life and death.  If one looks at the number of traffic accidents in this country&mdash;the number of accidents in which people are crippled or maimed for life, and the number of people who are actually killed on the roads of this country in any one year&mdash;the figure is rather staggering. I know that no matter how careful drivers may be, no matter how <Col N="1419" /> efficient the Gardaí may be in regard to the enforcement of traffic regulations, you will have accidents, but I am equally satisfied that the accidents could be reduced, and very substantially reduced.</P>
      <P>There are many other matters of detail which one would like to raise but I do not think I should go into too many matters of detail at the moment. I think that, from what the Minister has said in regard to the matters in which I was principally interested, he is following the right line.  I shall be glad if he will be good enough to look into the few points which I have sketched very briefly indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Under ordinary circumstances it is unusual for me in my present position to speak in this debate but I speak only on one subject, and that is the question of the establishment of a High Court of First Instance in Cork.  Last week, in answer to a question by a Cork Deputy, the Minister said he would examine the feasibility of establishing a High Court in Cork.  I feel that I am in a position to put a fairly good cross-section viewpoint before the Minister&mdash;a cross-section viewpoint as between the litigants and the legal profession in Cork. I take this opportunity to present these views because I believe that the question will be examined by the Minister's officials before it comes to the Minister himself.  I suggest that the first point of view from which this question should be examined is that of public convenience. From that point of view I believe there is no answer to the claim of Cork and of the South generally to the establishment of a permanent High Court of First Instance in the South. The experience is that when somebody brings a High Court action in Cork or Limerick or Waterford, he has no alternative but to bring the action in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His first job will be to provide for his advisers a certain amount of money in order to finance the trip for himself, his solicitor, his ordinary witnesses and his expert witnesses.  In many cases litigants who are about to bring proceedings in the High Court are asked to put <Col N="1420" /> down at least £100.  Many of the cases that come before the High Court are running down actions, and it is a case of determining where negligence lay in a collision between two cars, or between a car and a cyclist or a pedestrian. As anybody knows, no matter how strong your case may be, nobody can determine beforehand whether or not he will succeed.  It is, therefore, a risk in the first instance to bring a case before a judge and jury in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court limit at the present time is £300.  If in the opinion of a litigant a case is worth £500 the litigant is often very reluctant to take a chance of incurring heavy expenses in bringing his witnesses to Dublin and if the insurance company, which is usually the real opponent, puts up a sufficiently tempting offer and one that cannot be ignored, but which is possibly really too low to satisfy the litigant, nevertheless the litigant, rather than take the risk of being defeated and having to undergo heavy expenses will accept that lower offer in settlement of his claim.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the chance that having brought an action for £500, if he succeeds in getting £300, or less, the costs allowed by the High Court will be computed on the Circuit Court scale, a scale which will in no circumstances pay for the cost of his action and the cost of bringing his witnesses to Dublin.  The result is that out of the £300, or less, that he succeeds in getting as damages, he may eventually find himself owing money rather than find himself in pocket as a result of injuries sustained in an accident.</P>
    <P>Another uncontrollable difficulty arises in relation to the listing of cases in the High Court.  There is first of all a warning list and that is followed by a day to day list.  There is no guarantee that any case will be reached on the particular day in which it appears in the list.  On the contrary, experience has proved that the case is much more likely not to be reached until the following day and often not until the following week. Nevertheless, the litigant, his solicitor and his counsel must be in attendance accompanied by all the professional and medical witnesses.  It frequently <Col N="1421" /> happens that a whole retinue of witnesses come to Dublin from the south and spend from Monday to Friday here without the particular case in which they are interested being reached. They return to their homes for the week-end and duly appear again the next week.  The next week the possibility is that the case may be settled out of court and there is, therefore, a consequent waste of time and money. Heavy expenses are incurred which need not have been incurred in the first instance had a suitable offer been made or had there been a convenient court in which the action could be heard.</P>
    <P>From the litigant's point of view there is always the difficulty, particularly in running-down actions, that if the case is one for the High Court it means that serious injury has been sustained.  A serious injury usually requires highly-skilled medical or surgical attention.  A highly-skilled surgeon or doctor is a very valuable asset in his own particular area.  That is particularly true of Cork where we have men of outstanding medical and surgical skill.  Surgeons will do anything from five to ten operations per day.  If they have to go to Dublin for the purposes of a High Court action it means the people in Cork are deprived of their services and suffer unnecessary hardship thereby.  These men, because of the inconvenience caused to their patients do not want to come to Dublin and for that reason solicitors are very often reluctant to serve subpoenas on them.</P>
    <P>In most cases the solicitors are continuously on the phone trying to tell these doctors as nearly as they can when the case will come on for hearing in an effort to obviate the necessity of a doctor or a surgeon wasting his time in Dublin.  These highly skilled men can command very high fees.  Very often they demand quite justifiably a very high fee for their attendance in Dublin.  If an unfortunate litigant loses an action that fee falls upon him.</P>
    <P>There is another point of view which affects the solicitors' profession more than any other.  The big insurance companies which are usually involved on one or other, or both, sides in these <Col N="1422" /> actions prefer to do their business in and through Dublin.  As soon as a man goes to a solicitor in Cork and High Court proceedings are launched the big executive insurance companies tell the Cork firms to transfer the papers forthwith to their Dublin representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, Dublin is Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Or, as I have heard it said, Ireland is the capital of Dublin. The papers are promptly delivered from the Cork solicitor's office to the Dublin solicitor's office and there and then the Cork solicitor's interest ceases. It often happens, too, that a junior barrister who must attend to his ordinary business in Cork cannot afford the time to come to Dublin.  The action in Dublin may clash with a fixture in which he is already committed in Cork and it is to the detriment of the litigant and to the barrister that the man who was in the initial stages of the case cannot pursue it to its conclusion when it comes before the Court in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There may be questions of technical difficulty.  The question of accommodation may be possibly one of them.  But may I point out that in Cork there is a Court house sufficiently large to accommodate a permanent sitting of the High Court.  There are two very fine rooms there in which the District Court and the Circuit Court sit.  There is also a court which is very little used, the Bankruptcy Court.  Usually when the High Court comes on circuit the District Justice sits in the Bankruptcy Court and finds it reasonably adequate for his work.  I do not think the question of accommodation would provide a difficulty if we had a permanent sitting of the High Court in Cork. There is ample accommodation for judges' chambers.</P>
      <P>There is another point which merits consideration.  Dublin jurors have to devote their time to trying cases from all over the country.  At least 95 per cent. of the civil actions in the High Court are tried by jury.  Dublin jurors have also to attend in the Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court.  They have to give up their business or their everyday occupations with consequent personal loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> I have heard Dublin men complain that it is hardly fair to ask them to thrash out the differences arising between litigants from other parts of the country.  I know there will be opposition from the insurance companies in Dublin because they feel that when an action is tried away from the local venue they are more likely to get a fair decision on the merits of the case particularly in relation to the amount of damages.  I do not think there is any danger that insurance companies or litigants will not get a fair crack of the whip if a case is tried by a local jury, because the area of call for a jury can be made as large as anyone likes.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that such a court could serve not only Cork, Kerry and Waterford but possibly South Tipperary as well.  The area of call for the jury could be extended to most if not all of that area.  One should also remember that Cork is the biggest county in the country, comprising approximately one-sixth of the total area of the country so it is hardly likely that a jury called from that wide area would in respect to either the venue or the parties concerned, occasion any dispute.  I think on that score there could be no real opposition from any of the interested parties.  As I have said this court could be made to serve places like Waterford, Kerry and South Tipperary.  In each of these counties, you have big towns which are a two hours' or less than a two hours' journey from Cork.  Witnesses and litigants could travel from their homes to and from Cork in one day.  They need not remain in Cork overnight waiting for their cases to be taken.</P>
    <P>It may be that opposition will come from the judges, but I believe myself that the first point of view to be considered is the public convenience point of view.  Secondly, I doubt if any judge would object to having to spend two or three weeks in term, four times a year, outside Dublin.  Many of them are not Dublin-born men and are still used to living in the country, and when they come to Cork I can assure them, as they very well know, they are not going to the wilds or anything <Col N="1424" /> like it.  Opposition might come from members of the Senior Bar, but even members of the Senior Bar are sometimes glad of opportunities to get away from home and enjoy themselves for a week in more congenial surroundings.</P>

      <P>We have in Cork the only resident Bar outside Dublin. Like most professions, the Bar profession in Cork is becoming overcrowded. We have men there who normally would be ripe to be called to the Senior Bar, but for one reason or another&mdash;perhaps because of attachment to the banks of their own lovely Lee&mdash;are reluctant to make the plunge and take silk.  If this court were established there, it would provide them with an opportunity to take silk and to live in their own town.</P>
      <P>There are several other points of view that I should like to put up for the consideration of the Minister, but I do not want to detain the House any longer, as I have already spoken for a quarter of an hour, far beyond the time I intended to occupy.  I feel that whatever technical or practical difficulties might arise in the carrying out of this suggestion could easily be adjusted.  I do not believe that legislation would be necessary and I think there is no moral answer to the claim of Cork and the South for a permanent sitting of the High Court of First Instance.  Without wishing to make a pun, I do not think there is any answer in justice to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to a reform in the administration of justice in this country which I think is desirable and long overdue, and to which I should like the Minister to direct his attention during the months in which the Dáil will be in recess.  I refer to the necessity for legal aid for poor prisoners in our criminal courts.  I should like to see introduced here, when the Dáil again sits in the autumn, a Bill which I think would get support from every side of the House to enable prisoners who are unable to provide legal aid out of their own resources, to obtain such <Col N="1425" /> legal aid by means of local funds, if necessary subsidised out of the Exchequer. Such a system of legal aid has been in existence in England since 1903, when the first comprehensive Act, the Poor Prisoners Defence Act, 1903, came into operation.  That Act was not, for some reason, extended to this country, and we have had no similar Act.  The result has been that the only system by which people who are unable to provide legal aid out of their own resources can obtain such aid in this country, has been the system of the dock brief, which is obsolete and which is rarely used in this country. There is also a system whereby in capital charges poor prisoners who are unable to provide counsel and solicitors out of their own resources have counsel and solicitors assigned to them.  Apart from that instance, where in cases of murder the prisoner can have counsel and solicitor assigned to him, there is no system by which poor persons can obtain legal aid if their own resources do not permit of it.</P>
      <P>The 1903 Act, which was a short Act of five sections, was substantially repealed in 1930, by an Act which merely extended its provisions in order to ensure that whenever what is referred to in the Act as a legal aid certificate was given to prisoners in courts of summary jurisdiction, such aid would be forthcoming.  A system obtains in England by which a prisoner who is unable to provide legal aid out of his own resources can have a solicitor and counsel assigned to him if, in the opinion of the justice who is trying the case, it is in the interests of justice that legal aid should be obtained for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system works by means of a panel of solicitors and counsel who voluntarily put themselves on such a panel and who are assigned by a system of rota when their turn arrives. It should also be remarked that in England the fees paid to counsel and solicitors in these types of case are extremely small.  The system has worked in England and it has been extended by the recent Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949.  That Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, introduced for the first time in England a very comprehensive <Col N="1426" /> system of legal aid and advice for litigants, not only in criminal cases but in civil actions also.  Regulations have been drawn under it and have been in force for about a year.  I do not know whether that wider system of legal advice for litigants has been a success but I understand that, by and large, apart from a few cases, it has been a successful measure.  Such a measure would entail, and does entail, the expenditure of a very large amount of money from the Exchequer in aiding the societies which administer this aid. Perhaps, at present, in view of the large commitments on the Exchequer, such a system of legal aid in civil cases would not be practicable.  However, I am convinced that a system of legal aid in criminal matters would be practicable and would not require any large State funds.  In fact, the charges of counsel and solicitors are very small and under the English Act, I understand, are borne by the local funds. The principle is a good one and it is the local funds which bear the cost of the proceedings.  I think also that in criminal cases where a person is charged the cost of defending him, where a defence certificate has been issued by the justice or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, should be borne also out of the local funds.</P>
    <P>The whole question of legal aid was gone into in fairly large detail by two commissions&mdash;the Finlay Commission in 1927. and the Rushcliffe Commission in 1945.  The evidence before these commissions appeared to establish that no great injustice can be said to be done as a result of failure to provide legal aid to prisoners, and that in point of fact justice is, in the vast majority of cases, done whether or not the prisoner is defended by counsel and solicitors. However, it is quite clear and it must be the experience of most lawyers that there are cases where, because a person has not been advised properly in the conduct of his defence, a conviction is entered against him which would otherwise never have been entered if he had been properly represented.  I do not think these cases are many, but they exist and the fact that they do exist is sufficient argument for the necessity for such legislation.</P>
    <P>There is also of course the case of <Col N="1427" /> people who are guilty of the offences, or one or two of the offences, with which they are charged in which, if properly defended and if proper aid is given to them at the right time, the sentences which they would be subjected to could be reduced as a result of the manner in which the case is handled either in the District Court or the Circuit Court, as the case may be. These are the arguments for such a system of legal aid.  I understand that such a system not only obtains in England but in many American States, including States in South America. Many of the old systems of law going back to the days of Roman law and to the Middle Ages provided for such legal aid to persons unable to help themselves in the defence or prosecution of their case.  It is overdue in this country. We have no system of free legal aid and the Minister should be in a position to draft a very short comprehensive Bill, which would get the support, I think, of all Deputies, giving the right to the district justice or to the trial judge, as the case may be, to certify that in the interests of justice a prisoner should be entitled to the aid of counsel and solicitor in the defence of his case.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two other matters to which I should like to refer. The first is the question of law reform and revision.  The last Government had brought in, I understand, a Bill for the reform of certain aspects of our law.  Most lawyers will agree that there are many branches of law which require revision and reform, and the Minister should establish a law revision committee to investigate the revision and reform of the law.  I understand that there is a commission at present constituted to consider the reform of the company law.  I should like to see a general committee set up to consider the reform of other aspects of the law as it stands at present.</P>
    <P>Then there is a matter of small detail in the administration of the Department, but one which affects every prisoner tried in the courts, and that is the question of the payment for copies of depositions taken in the District Court.  It appears wrong that a prisoner who is sent for trial from the <Col N="1428" /> District Court to the Circuit Court and who is presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty has to pay for copies of the depositions, the cost of which sometimes runs into several pounds, and which are given freely to the State.  I do not think that legislation is necessary for that and I should like to see the Minister introduce some regulations by which depositions in criminal cases in District Court proceedings will be given free to the defendant's solicitor and counsel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to an incident which occurred some months ago in County Mayo with which I am very conversant.  An attempt was made to have two members of the Garda Síochána committed to a lunatic asylum.  I am a member of the Mayo County Council to which I have been elected for a number of years.  Having heard of this extraordinary happening, I felt it my duty as a public man and a member of the county council to have the matter investigated.  I proposed that a public sworn inquiry should be held to have that matter thoroughly investigated.  I felt that I was within my right in doing so.  From the information which I received from the county manager and the county secretary, I understand that £4 4s. of the ratepayers' money was paid to a medical man or medical men in the town of Castlebar to have these two members of the Garda Síochána examined to ascertain if they were lunatics.  It is my conviction that rarely has it been heard, thank God, that two members of the Garda Síochána went mad simultaneously. In any case, the truth of the matter is that this extraordinary attempt was made to have a sergeant and an ordinary member of the Garda committed to a lunatic asylum.  If the particular individual who for some strange reason, tried to do that, had his way, these two members of the Garda would now be in the asylum. Thanks to the intervention of a medical man, or medical men, they were not committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I brought this matter by way of resolution to the notice of the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy <Col N="1429" /> MacEoin, as far as I am aware, there was nothing done about it.  I feel that it is the duty of the present Minister for Justice to have this matter investigated at the earliest possible moment, and to let this House know at a later date who is responsible for this incident, and who is responsible for the spending of £4 4s. 0d. of ratepayers' money on such a matter.  As I have said previously in the Mayo County Council, £4 4s. 0d. is a rather small sum.  At the same time, if an old age pensioner in the country or in the city for that matter, received £4 4s. 0d. by way of old age pension, which the investigation officer considered was wrongfully received, I am sure he would be taken into the courts of law and brought to justice.  If we have law for the ordinary poor people, we should have law for the rich and those who have power in this country.</P>
    <P>I want also to inform the Minister for Justice that I have in my possession numerous copies of Press reports of the happenings at meetings of the Mayo County Council at the time, which I am prepared to make available to him.  I also want to tell the Minister that I have in my possession a letter which I received from the Secretary of the Mayo County Council at the time, which was sent to the particular secretary by the chief officer of the Garda Síochána in County Mayo.  I consider that that letter contained a lot of abuse against myself as a public man, and contained certain insulting language.  That is another matter that in my opinion should be investigated thoroughly by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I felt that so long as there was £4 4s. 0d. of ratepayers' money involved it was my duty to expose this whole affair.  I am a newlyelected Deputy and I am availing of the first opportunity to bring this matter to the present Minister's notice. I am sure that, having had it brought to his notice he will be in a position, perhaps at a later date, to tell us what action he proposes to take in the matter. It was a very peculiar incident. Those who were responsible for attempting to have two sane men committed to a lunatic asylum should not get away with it.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to have the whole <Col N="1430" /> matter investigated and to let us know at a later date what he proposes to do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind there are few Votes that come for discussion in this House that are more important than the Vote for the Department of Justice.  It might well be said that the democracy which we enjoy is maintained and fortified by the administration and conduct of this Department. In this regard I would say the people of this country are acutely conscious of the debt owed to the Garda Síochána and I need hardly impress on the Minister that any steps which he may take during his period of office that will improve conditions within the force will be warmly welcomed both in the House and by the people generally.</P>
      <P>I intend to follow the line adopted by the Minister, Deputy Morrissey and others and to be as brief as possible. Therefore I do not intend to dwell on the points where improvements can be effected within the force.  I take it that these matters have already been put before the Minister by the representative body and by the commission set up by his predecessor.  I would stress that we owe a debt to the Guards to put into effect any changes which are due to improve the conditions. By doing that we will attract the very best type into the force.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned during the debate on the Estimate for Defence that a young man and his parents when deciding on the career that he would follow would take into account the possibilities in the Army of an Army officer compared with his chances in commercial life.  The same could be said with reference to the Guards.  A young man and his parents discussing the chances he would have in the Guards would compare it with commercial life.  It is up to the Minister, therefore, to do everything he possibly can to improve the conditions in the Garda Síochána and make it attractive so as to bring in the best type possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be remembered by Deputies that much was done by the present Minister before he left office in 1947 to improve conditions in the prisons.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will continue that policy.  In particular, I <Col N="1431" /> would earnestly appeal to him to introduce more widely the element of occupational therapy, particularly in the case of the long-term prisoner.  My information is that the only trades open to long-term prisoners at the moment are farming, boot-making and tailoring.  It should be possible to embrace other trades most likely to assist the long-term prisoner.  It may be that the Minister has received opposition from the trade union groups.  Deputy Davin may be able to help us there.  If that is the position, it should be resolved as soon as possible and attempts should be made to provide proper training for prisoners serving sentence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In this way prisoners would be better equipped to face the period of readjustment which follows long sentences.  It may seem strange for a new Deputy like myself to speak on such a subject but, as a social worker in the City of Dublin, I have come across this matter a great deal over a period of years.  In doing social work I have met many long-term prisoners and I know their difficulties. I took it that Deputy Davin thought that I was a long-term prisoner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I feel that something should be done to help a long-term prisoner to meet the readjustment which follows a long sentence.  I take it Deputy Davin will smile, but I am sure he will appreciate that it is a pity and a great shame that people generally fail to realise that the suffering and punishment involved by a prison sentence extend far beyond the limit of the actual sentence. That will be agreed.  A man on release carries with him the stigma of the prison.  It is difficult to get over that. It often happens that such a man has no option but to resort to crime.  I am not telling Deputies anything they do not know already but, as a social worker, I personally feel and submit to the Minister that our concern for the after-care of prisoners is completely <Col N="1432" /> inadequate.  In many cases prisoners on release are punished in a way never envisaged by the court. I am satisfied that the prejudice on the part of the citizens induces bitterness in the released person and often defeats the aim of reformative justice and makes him a hardened criminal.  I hope, therefore, that during the life of this Dáil we shall see this matter tackled in a more enlightened manner and made the direct responsibility of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I had intended to say something on the question of legal aid for poor prisoners.  I was glad to see Deputy Declan Costello raise it.  I agree with everything he said, and I hope that the Minister during his term of office will be able to do something about the matter.  If a man had legal aid at the right time when appearing in court it might mean a great deal for him.  As it is, the accused has no one to present his case to the justice who, in that situation, has to decide on the evidence before him.  A prisoner, on his first appearance in court, may suffer from shock and cannot give his evidence properly, whereas if he were properly advised and were represented by counsel or solicitor, it might mean all the difference in the world to him.  I have known of a case where a fellow got three months in jail in the District Court.  On appeal to the Circuit Court, where he was represented by counsel, the conviction was reversed simply because the evidence was properly put before the circuit judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was looking over the debate on last year's Estimate.  I saw there was some question raised about housing for Gardaí in rural districts.  I hope that the Minister will get after the local authorities and see whether anything can be done to overcome that difficulty. In Dublin the position is not so bad, but when a married Guard is transferred to a rural district he finds great difficulty in getting a house for his family.  I think it is only right that the local authorities should make some effort to provide facilities in that direction.  That is the contribution which I have to make to the debate on this Estimate.  I hope the Minister will not think it strange of me making <Col N="1433" /> a case for the long-term prisoner.  I ask him to bear in mind what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endorse all that Deputy Lynch has said about having a High Court established in Cork. He made an admirable case for it.  I can assure the Minister that there are many complaints that it has not been done before now.  Unlike Deputy Lynch, I do not think there is any need for an inquiry into the matter.  I suggest that the Minister should take this question into his own hands, and see that such a court is established in Cork.  No inconvenience can be caused to the judges.  The people require this service and, as Deputy Lynch has pointed out, there is an urgent need for the establishment of such a court in Cork.</P>
      <P>I also want to endorse the statements of Deputy Gallagher about the treatment of prisoners, especially those who have completed a sentence.  I think that the best way to bring home to the House the importance of that matter is to give an experience which I had myself within the last fortnight.  A young man accosted me and asked for assistance.  Having regard to the demand for labour I was somewhat reluctant to believe that he was in need of assistance.  On putting some pertinent questions to him he told me that he was out of jail for the past two months.  I inquired why he had been in jail.  He was frank enough about it and told me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then asked him was he not getting assistance from the labour exchange. He said he was signing on there but that he could not get anything because he was after serving a sentence in jail. That, I understand, is the position under the law, that a man who has served a term of imprisonment will not get any assistance from the labour exchange for at least three months.  If he goes to the home assistance officer he is told that he is not a case for relief and that he cannot be helped.  Treatment of that kind is, I suggest, calculated to make a man a hardened criminal.  He comes out of jail and is regarded as an outcast of society.  I think some arrangement should be made to help people in that position <Col N="1434" /> and encourage them to be good, honest citizens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey, I think, referred to the ease with which people can get licences to drive motor vehicles.  It is alarming to find that any young boy or girl of 18 years of age can, by paying 10/-, get a licence to drive a motor vehicle.  It is issued on their word that they are capable of driving.  There is no test of any kind.  One has to compare that with the regulations which govern the employment of motor drivers in Córas Iompair Éireann.  If a man applies there for a job as a bus driver, even though he can produce references from previous employers showing that he is a competent man to drive a lorry or a motor car over, maybe, a period of six or seven years, he will not get employment until he is put through a very severe test as to his ability to drive a bus in public.  On the other hand, we have the position that boys and girls can get licences simply by saying that they are able to drive a car.  The Minister should do something about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the different Departments concerned should consult about matters of this kind.  Suppose a young person gets a licence, takes a motor car out on the street and knocks down two or three people, the State then comes in through the Department of the Minister for Justice.  These are matters on which there should be consultation between all the Departments concerned.  I do hope that the matter raised by Deputy Gallagher about longterms prisoners being treated as outcasts of society on their discharge will be taken up and considered by the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate is just that of the ordinary man in the street.  In speaking on this Estimate, I am not fortified with any legal knowledge, but there are a few points to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  Some of them have been referred to by previous speakers.  I realise, as I think most of <Col N="1435" /> us do, that the world in which we live to-day is a world of speed: speed in every respect, speed in business and at the moment speed in dealing with the business which is before this House. As one who lives in a town in rural Ireland, I suggest to the Minister that some law should be passed to control the speed of motor cars passing through our towns and villages.  I have been a member of public bodies for very many years.  We have discussed this question on numerous occasions but we never seem to have got anywhere with it.  I live in the town of Youghal, a fairly large town with narrow streets in the greater portion of it.  It horrifies me at times to see high powered cars and, very often ten horse power cars too, flying through the streets.  Only yesterday I saw motor cars passing through at 40, 50 and 60 miles an hour.  I think it is just murderous that cars should be allowed to travel at that speed through the streets of our rural towns.</P>
      <P>This may be a matter for the Department of Local Government, but my suggestion to the Minister is that a speed limit should be fixed and enforced against people driving motor vehicles. No car should be allowed to go through any town or village at a greater speed than 20 or 25 miles an hour.</P>
      <P>I drive a car and I know that 20 or 25 miles per hour in a car is rather slow, but there is one thing about it: when you drive at that speed, you have your car under perfect control, and, if a child rushes across the street from a byway or alley-way you can pull up the car within its own length.  It often amazes me that people can call themselves decent drivers and still travel through a town at such excessive speed.  I have seen people from Cork City driving through various seaside resorts in my area, Youghal, Ballycotton and Trabolgan, going through Midleton, where there are wide streets, at speeds up to 70 miles per hour.  That is an appalling thing and the driver who does that is tempting Providence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is now sitting before me, I should like to urge on him that a speed limit should be fixed for every town and village in Ireland.  A man <Col N="1436" /> driving on the wide open road from Cork to Dublin, where there is not much danger, can drive at 50, 60 and 70 miles per hour, but not through towns and villages.  On several occasions this year and last year, people living on the Esplanade in Youghal implored me to try to get something done in this matter.  Every house there is occupied in the summer and you have children running across the road to the beach and the Atlantic.  The roads are crowded, but you find some of these road-hogs, who have no consideration for ordinary pedestrians, driving along the road and keeping up a continuous blowing of their horns, as if to say: &ldquo;Keep out of the way.  I own this road.&rdquo;  I suggest that, in the case of towns and villages, a mean speed should be insisted upon, and, as one who drives a car, I think that 20 or 25 miles an hour through a town or village is quite fast enough.</P>
    <P>We read of tragic occurrences taking place on our roads by reason of persons driving cars after imbibing an excessive amount of drink.  I am fortified with no legal knowledge of these matters, as I say, but, if I had my way, if I were a judge or justice, and a man were brought before me for being drunk in charge of a car, I would disqualify him from driving for ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>You would have to wait until he had been convicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that he is convicted.  That is where Deputy O'Donnell's legal mind comes in, and it would cost you 10/- if you went into his office.  In the world in which we live, it is a matter of speed in every phase of life.  Men who have imbibed a considerable quantity of alcohol have not got proper control over their driving faculties.  Their brain becomes befogged, and in fact they do not know what they are doing.  I would disqualify such people for ever.  Men or women walk along the road on a Sunday evening or Sunday night, and a man who has consumed too much liquor comes along in his car, fails to see them, and hurls them into eternity. Such a man will have something to remember for the rest of his days, but <Col N="1437" /> that is very poor satisfaction for the children or parents of the people who have been hurled to death.</P>
      <P>There is also the matter of the incessant sounding of motor horns which one notices in many towns.  When people retire at night, as the ordinary man does about midnight, it is unfair that people in cars should continue to sound their horns to attract the attention of somebody who may be missing, and disturb their slumbers.  In prewar days in London, any policeman could pull up such a motorist, and have him brought before the court for blowing his motor horn at night.  It is a matter which should be looked into by the Minister.  Being a Corkman, or at least a County Cork man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is there a difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>A slight difference. They are the city boys and we are only the small boys from the country.  I know cases where litigants find it very hard to raise the cash necessary to attend the High Court in Dublin and that fact places them at a very unfair disadvantage.  I know of people who would prefer to sacrifice a case&mdash;it would be cheaper for them to do so&mdash; than go to the expense of bringing it to Dublin, in view of the expense of bringing solicitors and witnesses to the Four Courts.  We are very proud of our courthouse in Cork.  As Deputy Lynch said, it is one of the finest in Ireland, and as the ordinary people of the country, through their votes or otherwise, have placed the judges in the high positions in which they are, these judges might think of their small days, the days when they were ordinary barristers looking for work and think of the people who made them by sending the High Court on circuit down to Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher and other speakers mentioned the matter of Garda pay.  I know of no body of men&mdash;I have been very closely associated with them since 1922&mdash;who got, shall I say, a rawer deal from two Governments than the Garda. They came into existence in 1922 at a rather turbulent period in Irish history and they gave very good service to this land of ours.  After 29 or 30 years, they <Col N="1438" /> are deserving of somewhat better treatment than they have got.  I know men with families of five and six, boys and girls who have been well educated at the Christian Brothers or Presentation Colleges and who, if their parents could afford it, would go on to one of the universities for higher education.  I know that at present there is a move towards an improvement in their position and I appeal to the Minister to expedite the granting of the extra payment which I know is coming for them. Nobody deserves it more, and the Minister being a humane man he will, I feel sure, treat them in a humane fashion.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should like to have drawn to the attention of the Garda authorities.  It is the practice of cyclists of cycling three and four abreast.  I notice that this practice is growing, although for a short time it seemed to have died away.  As the law stands, cyclists must not cycle more than two abreast, but even this morning coming to Dublin, at several points, I passed cyclists riding three and four abreast. One sounds the horn, but they merely beckon you on and keep on in the four abreast formation, and, if anything happens, it is always the unfortunate motorist who is blamed.  I believe that pedestrians walking haphazardly across the streets and cyclists cycling in spiral curves cause a lot of the trouble.  It is the unfortunate motorist, however, who is always blamed because he is a fairly good target or at least belongs to a good insurance company from which one could look for £5,000 or £6,000.</P>
    <P>Those are a few points from an ordinary country Deputy and I hope that you will bring them to the notice of your Department and of the responsible authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheorais Breanndán Mac Fheorais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheorais</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here to hear what has been described to me as the excellent case made by Deputy Lynch for the establishment of the High Court in Cork.  I have the utmost sympathy with the people in Cork.  One cannot help having sympathy with the Cork people when one listens to the army of Deputies from Cork that we have here.  However, I <Col N="1439" /> should like to remind the Minister that there are such places as Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and even Wexford without the facilities about which the Cork Deputies are complaining at the present time.</P>
      <P>I want to make a plea to the Minister at the risk of being told by members of the Fianna Fáil Party that we could have done it during the past three and a half years.  None the less, sincerely I would make a plea on behalf of the Guards, not in connection with their pay&mdash;many Deputies have made a case in that respect&mdash;but in connection with their uniforms.  I do not see what difficulty there could be in providing summer uniforms for the members of the Garda Sióchána.  I think it is a scandalous thing to see any man on point duty, more especially some of the hefty men we have on point duty in the City of Dublin, on a warm day in June or July buttoned up to the neck in a stiff collared tunic. If the present uniform which is issued is meant to last for two years or one year, or whatever it is, I do not see why, if two uniforms, one for winter and one for summer, were issued, they could not be made to last twice as long as the single uniform.</P>
      <P>American policemen look smart not alone in winter, but in summer, and in other countries I think the police have summer uniforms.  It allows them to move more freely, and a different type of tunic allows them to do their duty rather more comfortably and maybe more quickly.  I think that a coatjacket, such as the one I have on at the moment, with a blue shirt, would look very smart on members of the Garda and would be appreciated by them.  I do not know whether the Garda representative body has made any case to the Minister or his predecessor in that respect, but I think that is the general opinion amongst the Garda.  I think that the ordinary civilian, as well as the Guards, would like to see a different uniform&mdash;not a free and easy one, perhaps, but something that would not choke them and swelter them in summer.  Deputy Hickey reminds me that a change has been made in soldiers' uniforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> The second thing to which I wish to refer is traffic congestion in the City of Dublin.  I know that to some extent it is the responsibility of the Department of Local Government but the Department of Justice could do quite a lot to help.  I asked a particular gentleman on one occasion if it would not be possible to have a certain number of the Guards specially trained in traffic control.  The indignant reply I got was to the effect that every guard was trained in traffic control.  I thought it rather a stupid reply at the time because it would not be possible to give to all the Guards that intensive training required to control the traffic in the City of Dublin.  We have excellent men and anybody who travels around the city knows who these excellent men are.  I can travel down Dawson Street and be stopped at the bottom of it for ten minutes; 20 yards further on I am stopped for another ten minutes, and then I can lay ten to one that the usual man is not at the top of Grafton Street but some stand-in or some unfortunate fellow from the country who is doing traffic duty for the first time.  I suggest that there should be a special squad and special training for those picked men.</P>
    <P>For one example, the streets of Dublin were recently being repaired and it was necessary to discontinue the use of traffic lights.  We had the usual good regular men at the different points like Butt Bridge, Pearse Street, College Green and the top of Grafton Street and these men kept the traffic going far more quickly than it moved when the lights were in operation.  If we had more men of that calibre trained as they are at the present time, traffic congestion in the City of Dublin would be very much eased.</P>
    <P>I appreciate all the difficulties in the city, not alone of the actual layout but because of the presence of so many thousands of bicycles.  Deputy O'Gorman complains of the bicycles; of course, the cyclists complain of the motorists; the two complain of the pedestrians and the pedestrians complain both of the motorists and the cyclists.  We have a somewhat chaotic position in Dublin which is not so much the fault of the Guards or of the Department of Justice as of the fact, in <Col N="1441" /> my humble opinion, that our motorists, cyclists and pedestrians have not the fundamentals of road manners.  Deputy O'Gorman blames the cyclist but the cyclist would blame him.</P>
    <P>The cyclists are anxious to get home to their lunch and the motorists are the same.  The cyclists ride three or four abreast and will almost ride up on the wing of your car.  Until we have some voluntary body of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians in the City of Dublin which will try to instil into the minds of their fellows some sense of road manners we always will have that chaotic congestion in the city.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice have helped a great deal in recent years.  I refer to the mobile units which have been of tremendous value.  Many a cyclist or bunch of cyclists are affected when they hear a roar from a hefty member of the Guards from Kerry or Cork: &ldquo;Push in.  You are three abreast.  I mean you with the ginger hair.&rdquo;  In many parts of the city I know that is a great help.</P>

      <P>Question No. 39 on to-day's Order Paper asked the Minister for Finance if the former personal <Col N="1443" /> secretary to the Taoiseach has secured an appointment from the Government in the Civil Service and, if so, whether he will state the salary and expenses attached to the post and other conditions of employment, whether it is temporary or otherwise, the pension it carries, and the date of the appointment.

      <P>Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it down because, under the Fianna Fáil Administration three years ago, the post of personal secretary to the Taoiseach was abolished.  In Volume 110, column 170, we see that Captain Cowan asked a question on the 9th March, 1948, of the Minister for Finance if the post of personal secretary to the Taoiseach had been abolished and, if so, whether he would state the date on which the Order was made abolishing the post....  The then Minister for Finance, now Deputy McGilligan, replied that this post was abolished by the Taoiseach with the consent of the Minister for Finance on the 17th February, 1948&mdash;namely, the day before the taking of office by the inter-Party Government.  I desire that that should be placed on record.</P>
      <P>I am given to understand that one of the reasons why the post was abolished, and that was one of the reasons why the civil servant&mdash;I may call her that now because she has been reinstated&mdash;was resigning or relinquishing the post was that she submitted medical certificates to the Department of Finance on the grounds of ill-health.  I want a verification or denial in regard to that matter from the Minister to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lady to whom I refer is Miss Kathleen O'Connell.  I am interested in this matter from a scientific and from a medical point of view.  I should like to know under what extraordinary conditions or circumstances does a person become seriously ill just as Fianna Fáil is going out of office and is restored to perfect health and be able to resume duties the moment Fianna Fáil resumes office.  Will the Minister for Finance give us the recipe or the <Col N="1444" /> prescription which will bring about such a happy state of affairs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reply which I received from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The person referred to in the Deputy's question has been appointed to the established post of Personal Secretary to the Taoiseach with effect as from 19th June, 1951.  The scale of salary for the post, as calculated in accordance with the recent revision of Civil Service pay, is £709 by increments of £28 to £890, to which is added the customary allowance of £96 per annum paid for private secretarial duties.  The other conditions of employment are the normal conditions of Civil Service tenure and the post is pensionable under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1947.</P>
      <P>In effect, the person referred to in the Deputy's question has been reinstated in her former post on the same terms and conditions as she would have enjoyed had there been no interruption in her service in that post, except that the period of her absence will not count for pension purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past three years, this person, Miss Kathleen O'Connell, since her post as Personal Secretary to the Taoiseach was abolished, has been in receipt of a pension and has drawn something like £1,200 from the taxpayers <Col N="1445" /> of this country&mdash;despite the fact that at the same time she was employed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I want all that to go on the records of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past three years she has drawn over £1,200. She has now been restored to this position of Personal Secretary to the Taoiseach&mdash;despite the fact that the Taoiseach himself abolished the post. That position has now been restored in order to provide a job for another of his loyal members&mdash;thus bringing us back again to the days of Fianna Fáil jobbery in this country.  The salary attached to the post is a salary amounting to £986&mdash;which is £14 less than £1,000.  The reason why that salary was laid out in that way was so that it would look modest in the eyes of the taxpayers of the country&mdash; that once it did not go into four figures it was all right.</P>

There are young men to-day who know nothing about the Black and Tan war and about the troubled times, and I wish that the Minister and everybody in this House would forget the days of the Black and Tan war.

That is what she put in 16 years at and now she has been reappointed to spy on the civil servants as she did for 16 years in Merrion Street.

      <P>Surely the Chair will permit me to ask the Minister if <Col N="1450" /> other civil servants will get the same treatment as Miss O'Connell?  That is all I ask.  I trust the Minister will lose no time in making the position clear. This appointment is the chief topic of conversation in Civil Service offices to-day and even ex-civil servants, those who have given good and loyal service and who have no interest in politics, are anxious to know if they will get the same measure of favourable and sympathetic consideration from the Government as has been given to a political worker for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think the time has gone when we should ask the taxpayers to pay through the nose for political appointments. It is wrong.  It was done by no Government here until Fianna Fáil came into power.  They are starting it again now but they will do it in the teeth of the fiercest opposition that can be put up on this side of the House. We will not tolerate it.  I want the Minister to understand now that he will not get away with political appointments.  We will not stand for political appointments.  I hope and trust we have heard the last of them.</P>

      <P>The Minister will, however, explain what the true position is in regard to this appointment.  It has been the universal custom, not only of this State but of other States, to permit Ministers and, in particular, the head of a Government to select as their personal assistants those with whom they have been accustomed to work, those whose merits they know and those who are able to facilitate them in the discharge of their duties because of the personal knowledge which they may have of the greater bulk of the correspondence from private individuals which comes to Ministers and particularly to the head of a Government.  That custom was recognised and acted upon from the day on which this State was founded.  Not only did we when necessary, select as our personal assistants people who worked in our private offices but that practice was recognised and acted upon by our predecessors and our successors. I do not want to specify Ministers who brought into the Civil Service in the year 1948 persons to act as their personal assistants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a unique way, should ask that he should be permitted <Col N="1452" /> to appoint as his personal secretary an individual who is familiar with the vast mass of personal and private correspondence with which he has to deal&mdash;while I call it private and personal correspondence, it is personal only in the sense that it is addressed to him, but invariably it relates to national affairs&mdash;and who can, therefore, relieve him of the obligation of attending to this correspondence on his individual initiative and thereby leave him free to discharge the official duties which devolve upon him.  Therefore, as I have said, there is nothing in the nature of a &ldquo;job&rdquo; in this appointment.  Somebody had to do this work; somebody would have to be appointed to do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is the difference between allowing your personal secretary, who served you when you were in opposition to continue to serve you when you are in office, and finding a snug berth for your personal aide-de-camp when you come to retire?  As I say, I do not object to that at all.  There were predecessors of the aide-de-camp of the former Taoiseach for whom that had been done.  In the year 1932, when Mr. William Cosgrave ceased to be President of the Executive Council, a somewhat similar appointment took place. It is recognised that such appointments may be made in order that persons who are called upon to act in an onerous capacity such as that of Taoiseach, may be free to devote themselves to what is properly the public business of the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan, in what I think was a disgraceful speech, an unmanly speech, a speech unworthy of any Irishman, alleged that the lady referred to in this question had resigned on grounds of ill-health in the year 1948.  I told him that was not so.  I told him that the post had been abolished and he said that if I had given him that information at first, he would not have raised this question on the Adjournment.  We can judge of Deputy Flanagan's sincerity in making that statement and of his truthfulness, when we realise that he had not asked whether the lady to whom this question refers had resigned on grounds of ill-health.</P>

      <P>We can rate Deputy Flanagan by his interruptions here.  I do not want to judge him because judgment has been passed upon him elsewhere.  It is not my function to try to adjudicate upon him here.  This lady has not only a very honourable record of national service but she is also very competent.  Every person who has had dealings with her, every person who has ever had occasion to <Col N="1455" /> employ her or to avail of her services as secretary, knows that she is very highly competent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the position to which she has been appointed.  On this issue of her competence for the post to which she has been appointed, there can be no question of doubt. As to her salary, she is being paid the ordinary normal Civil Service scale.  She is receiving no concession whatever in respect of that.  She has been reinstated at the appropriate point on her normal salary scale.  So far as her pension is concerned, during her period of service that pension will be suspended.  Therefore, from the point of view of the State, it is an economy that she should be reemployed because if she were not reemployed, <Col N="1456" /> another person, equally competent, would have to be employed at the same salary and in addition she herself would be drawing her pension. From the point of view of the public purse, it is a decided economy that the Taoiseach should again ask that she be reappointed as his personal secretary.  From that point of view, I, as Minister for Finance, had no difficulty whatever in sanctioning her appointment.  I think, Sir, there is nothing more for me to say as the time has elapsed.  I do hope I shall have the opportunity of meeting Deputy Flanagan on this particular question on another occasion and I do hope that he will repeat outside the House, and beyond the protection of the House, some of the slanderous statements he made here to-night.</P>
