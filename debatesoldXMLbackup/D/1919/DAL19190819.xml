<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT referred to the proceedings of the last Session of 17-19 June, 1919, when a number of Decrees was made and Committees of the House set up in connection with them.  Members of the Sinn Fein Executive were invited to assist by acting on these Committees.  As a result of these activities certain definite schemes had been formulated, and reports on these schemes would be laid before the House.  Certain other schemes had been under consideration, but the work in connection with them had not yet been completed.</P>

    <Title>ACTING-PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT. - FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</Title>
<P>A week after the last Session, the American Consul requested a statement for his Government on the conditions in Ireland&mdash;as a result of the report of the American Commission.  A statement was supplied him in which they undertook to prove conclusively all allegations made by the American Commission. The Consul thereupon requested to be supplied with affidavits by the persons upon whom the English authorities had been accused of inflicting the outrages reported.  On 27th June, eighteen persons from different parts of the country attended before the Consul, and the affidavits made by them, together with statements as to the treatment they were subjected to, were forwarded to the American Government.</P>

    <Title>ACTING-PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT. - FIRST NATIONAL ARBITRATION COURT.</Title>
<P>Following on a dispute between two sections of the Labour Party, in which certain personal charges had been made, Dáil Eireann was invited to set up a Court to investigate the matter. The Executive appointed Messrs. P.J. Ward, Liam de Roiste, and Dr. Cusack to constitute a Court for the trial of the charges.</P><P>At the first meeting of the Court the parties failed to agree as to the specific charges to be tried.  A week later for mal charges agreed on by the parties as being the issues to be tried were submitted, and the Court after hearing evidence, delivered judgment by which the parties had previously pledged themselves to abide.</P>

<P>A Consul had been appointed to Genoa, and two other Consuls had been appointed, but they had not yet left Ireland.</P><P>An American Shipping Company&mdash; the Moore-MacCormack Line&mdash;had arranged to make regular calls to Ireland, as a result of the activities of the Deputy for South Fermanagh (Mr. J. O'Mahony).  Information received that morning disclosed the fact that three American vessels are on their way to Ireland&mdash;they would call at Dublin and Cork.  The Baltic Line, which is under the same direction, also intended making calls to Belfast.</P><P>The important matter for Ireland in this connection was to secure that return cargoes for these vessels would be made available.  If this were done then they would have established direct trading with North America.  If they were not able to secure the return cargoes there was danger of their reverting to the old situation.  Proposals were also on foot to secure direct trading between Bordeaux and Dublin.  The question of providing return cargoes would likewise arise in that case.</P>

<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved and CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) seconded the adoption of this Report.</P>
<P>J. O'DOHERTY (Donegal, North) moved: &ldquo;That Clause 3 (a), making clergymen <i>ex-officio</i> justices, be deleted.&rdquo; This was seconded by EARNAN DE BLAGHP (Monaghan, North).</P><P>On a division the amendment was negatived by 30 votes to 5.</P>

  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES. -" RHead="FISHERIES">
    <Title>DEBATES. - FISHERIES.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved and JOSEPH MACGUINNESS (Longford Co.) seconded the adoption of the Report on Fisheries.</P>
<P>Mr. J. MACBRIDE (Mayo. West) thought that the price set down in Mr. Fahy's Report for a second-hand engine was not sufficient.</P>
<P>Mr. J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh, South) stated that the establishment of curing stations was one of the most essential factors in the success of the fishing industry.  An enormous quantity of herrings was consumed annually in Ireland.  Waterford City alone consumed 5,000 or 6,000 barrels per annum.  The major portion of the fish consumed in the South was really shipped from Ireland to Milford Haven, transhipped there and send back again and sold to the Irish buyers.  At Buncrana and Waterford there were at one time busy curing stations.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow, East) attributed the decline in the consumption of home-cured fish in Ireland in part to the fact that the sale of fish was not regarded by the people as a respectable occupation.  He suggested the establishment of fish shops in the towns as a remedial measure.  He stated that the opinion of the fishermen is that until there is an Irish Board in control similar to that existing in Scotland, the fishing industry cannot be made a profitable one to the fishermen.  The cost of salt, barrels, and freight had increased enormously.  The lack of transit facilities was one of the greatest difficulties. At present Liverpool and Manchester were actually getting supplies from Fleetwood by aeroplane.</P>
<P>Mr. D. KENT (Cork, East) mentioned the case of Ballycotton, which was one of the finest fishing centres in Ireland, but which was practically idle because of the want of adequate transit facilities.</P>
<P>The Report was adopted.  Ald. T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) remarking that they were much indebted to Mr. Fahy for his report on Fishing at Gorumna and Arran.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES. - FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</Title>
<P>The ASSOCIATE SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS moved and PROINNSIAS O FATHAIGH (Galway, South) seconded the adoption of the Report.</P>
<P>Mr. R.M. SWEETMAN (Wexford, North) asked for more explicit information as to the probability of the Government of the United States recognising the Republic.</P>
<P>The ASSOCIATE SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, in the course of his reply, stated that the case of Ireland had ceased to be a mere party issue in America.  The establishment of Consulates there was going to bind the existing cordial relations between Ireland and the United States.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT remarked that it was not likely that the question of the ratification of the Peace Treaty would come before the Senate earlier than October.  In his latest communication, President de Valera was very hopeful that Article 10 of the League of Nations' Covenant would not be ratified.  It was, of course, impossible to prophesy the result.</P><P>The motion was put and carried.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES. -" RHead="FINANCE">
    <Title>DEBATES. - FINANCE.</Title>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE moved the adoption of the Report.  The amount received from America was not shown separately in the Financial Statement, but it was given in the General Report.</P>
<P>Mr. E.J. DUGGAN (Meath, South) seconded the adoption of the Report.</P>
<P>Messrs. KENT (Cork, East), DOLAN (Leitrim), and the ACTING-PRESIDENT having spoken, SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan, South) asked if there was a Report from the Minister of Defence as to the item of £2,010 in the account of expenditure.</P>
<P>The CEANN COMHAIRLE stated that notice of such questions should be given.  They would be replied to on the following day.</P><P>The Report was adopted.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES. - INDUSTRIES" RHead="AND TRADE AND COMMERCE">
    <Title>DEBATES. - INDUSTRIES AND TRADE AND COMMERCE.</Title>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE moved, and LIAM T. MACCOS <Col N="142"/> GAIR (Kilkenny, North) seconded the adoption of the Report.</P>
<P>Mr. J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary, North) asked whether, in the event of any industry being approved of by the Commission of Inquiry, the Dáil would invest money for the purpose of fostering such industry?</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE replied that one of the purposes of the Commission was to indicate what industries might be fostered when there was money enough to provide a surplus for investment in such industries.  When the time was ripe a scheme would be submitted.  The question did not yet arise.</P>
<P>Mr. J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh, South) asked if co-operation had been dropped, to which the DIRECTOR replied in the negative.</P>
<P>Mr. J. MACBRIDE (Mayo, West) suggested that the question of fuel, which was as essential as the question of food, should be considered.  An attempt should be made to import coal from America.</P>
<P>Mr. M. STAINES (St. Michan's) referred to the personnel of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, and said that the greatest handicap to the Port of Dublin was its Port Authorities.</P>
<P>The discussion was continued by Messrs. D. KENT (Cork, East) and SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan, South), the latter suggesting that the Minister should get into communication with Mr. John Kelly, of Belfast, who recently took over a fleet of thirty steamers.  He regretted that the Commission was composed almost entirely of business men, to the exclusion of representatives of manufacturing industries and of practical engineers.</P><P>The Report was adopted.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES. - LABOUR&mdash;APPOINTMENT OF SUBSTITUTE-MINISTER.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved, and PADRAIG O CAOIMH (Cork, North) seconded, &ldquo;That Ald. Thomas Kelly (St. Stephen's Green) be appointed Substitute-Minister for Labour during the absence of Madame Markievicz.&rdquo;</P><P>Question put and carried.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES. - LABOUR" RHead="COMMITTEE REPORT">
    <Title>DEBATES. - LABOUR COMMITTEE REPORT.</Title>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE-MINISTER FOR LABOUR moved the adoption of the Report.  He emphasised the fact that the success of the work before the Dáil, and in particular the success of the scheme for the establishment of Conciliation Boards, depended to a great extent on the attitude of Labour to the Dáil.  He detailed the result of the intervention of the Ministry in Labour disputes.</P>
<P>Mr. D. KENT (Cork, East) seconded the adoption of the Report and urged that a fair scale of wages should be fixed.</P>
<P>Mr. E.J. DUGGAN (Meath, South) reported on the dispute in Co. Meath. The labourers were prepared to accept mediation, but the Farmers' Union refused it.  The Secretary of the All-Ireland Farmers' Union intimated to him that if mediation were now offered it would be accepted.  The local branch of the Farmers' Union was dominated by ex-officers of the English Army and Unionists.</P>
<P>Mr. R.C. BARTON (Wicklow, West) suggested that the Sinn Fein farmers should join the Farmers' Union, and make their influence felt in the Union.</P>
<P>ART O CONCHUBHAIR (Kildare South) observed that the suggestion was not a practical one as regards Co. Kildare. The Sinn Fein farmers there were leaving the Union, and in fact some of them had been blackballed out of it.  The Co. Kildare Executive of the Farmers' Union was elected in June and held office for twelve months; so that nothing could be done for the present.</P>
<P><Col N="143"/> The ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that the important thing to do was to get in before the strike really started. Where the Farmers' Union refuse to accept arbitration then the Sinn Fein farmers should be got together to endeavour to adjust the questions in dispute. They were entitled where one party to a dispute refuses the offer of mediation&mdash;to throw their force in on the side of the party that accepts the offer.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow, East) believed that political motives were actuating the Farmers' Union to a great extent.</P>
<P>CONCHUBHAR O COILEAIN (Limerick, West) inquired as to the attitude of official labour towards the returned soldiers of the English Army.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE-MINISTER FOR LABOUR, in the course of his reply, stated that the Dáil Ministry should be careful in intervening in those disputes, lest they might meet with a rebuff.  There should be a central Conciliation Board to which matters in dispute could be referred, and efforts should be made to have this Board recognised throughout the country.  As to demobilised soldiers the position was a difficult one.  They were entitled to consideration by their Unions as long as they remained members.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT suggested amending the portion of the Report of the National Arbitration Courts Committee relative to setting up Conciliation Boards by inserting the words &ldquo;or threaten to arise&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;arise&rdquo; in the second line and by deleting the words &ldquo;and it be his duty to intervene&rdquo; in the third line, and the words &ldquo;that it be his duty&rdquo; in the fourth line.</P><P>The amendment was agreed to, and the recommendation, which as amended reads as follows, was put and carried:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That where and whenever disputes between employers and employees arise, or threaten to arise, as to the question of wages, hours and conditions of employment, the Labour Minister be empowered to consult with both parties, to invite them to a conference of representatives, and to appoint a person to act as umpire with power to call in assessors where the need exists.&rdquo;</P><P>The Report of the Labour Committee was adopted, as was also the following motion which was moved by the SUBSTITUTE-MINISTER FOR LABOUR:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That with a view to securing that the scheme of Conciliation Boards to deal with local Labour disputes shall be effective, it is the duty of each Teachta to furnish to the Ministry of Labour immediate information regarding the outbreak of local Labour disputes and strikes which may take place in his area.&rdquo;</P>

<P>The SECRETARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, in moving the adoption of the Report, pointed out that there was no intention in any of the circulars issued to influence in any way the course of legislative enactments by the English Parliament; or in any way to assist or recognise that body.</P>
<P>PROINNSIAS O FATHAIGH (Galway, South) seconded the adoption of the Report, which was agreed to.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES. - LETTER FROM SINN FEIN DIRECTOR OF ORGANISATION.</Title>
<P>The following letter from the Sinn Féin Director of Organisation was read:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;A CHARA,</P><P>&ldquo;In view of the imminence of the necessity for renewed activity of the Sinn Féin Organisation, not merely with regard to general propaganda, but also with regard to Local Government Elections in the autumn, I should like to ask you as Minister for Local Government, under Dáil, to urge on the Members of that body the vital importance of greater attention to the needs of the Organisation within their Constituencies.</P><P>&ldquo;In the course of my work as Director of Organisation.
