  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT OF" RHead="ACTING-PRESIDENT">
    <Title>STATEMENT OF ACTING-PRESIDENT</Title>
<P>THE ACTING-PRESIDENT:&mdash;Since our last meeting over two months ago, Dáil Eireann, a body composed of the elected representatives of the Irish people, has been proclaimed a dangerous association by the enemy.  In convening this meeting, the Ministry sent out a peremptory request to certain members not to attend because there was a possibility that the attendance of these members might involve imprisonment. There are some members whose health would not stand the strain, and there are others who must retain their liberty to carry on the work of the Dáil.</P><P>The period since last session has been one of strenuous activity by the Enemy Government.  On the 13th September they made a general raid throughout the country, issued a Proclamation suppressing Sinn Fein, The Irish Volunteers, The Gaelic League, Cumann na mBan, and the Sinn Fein Clubs, and this Proclamation was promptly followed up by the suppression of the National Press.  The effect of these proclamations and suppressions has been of tremendous usefulness to the campaign in the United States of America.  The President's letters testify to that.  I regard all these acts which succeed each other in regular procession as of the greatest assistance to our efforts in the United States, and it is there that the centre of gravity of the whole political situation is for the present fixed.</P><P>We have had for a considerable time back the assistance of the Socialist elements of the Italian press, while the organs of the middle classes were partly hostile and indifferent.  In the course of the last few months there has come a change.  Quite recently we had over the Special Correspondent of the &ldquo;Corriere d'Italia&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Corriere del Sera.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;Corriere d'Italia&rdquo; has completely come over to our side. A correspondent from the &ldquo;Corriere del Sera&rdquo; is now in Ireland touring the country collecting first hand information as to the situation here.</P>
<P><Col N="159"/> In France there has been a considerable revival of activities during the course of the last two months or so.  I think we may take it as likely that M. Clemenceau will go out at the forthcoming elections, and that M. Briand will be returned to power.  A considerable amount of propaganda is now being done in that country.  This morning I received a request from the Director of the National War Museum in Paris to be supplied with copies of all the Sinn Fein pamphlets which have been issued during the War with a view to giving them a place in the Museum together with the Literature issued by other countries in that period. We have been fortunate to be able to convince the editor of the &ldquo;Chicago Tribune&rdquo; of the justice of our case, and his sympathy has been enlisted on our side.</P><P>Our President opened a big campaign on 29th September, and has since addressed meetings in a very large number of cities in America.</P><P>He visited Cleveland within a day of the visit of the King of the Belgians to that city.  The King of the Belgians was accorded the courtesy due to his position, but President de Valera was received with a salute of 21 guns, and was accompanied by a procession headed by the Police and Military.</P><P>He is thoroughly sanguine that the promise in regard to the Republican Loan will be fully realised.</P><P>The Commission set up by the Dail to enquire into the Natural Resources and the present condition of manufacturing and productive industries in Ireland, and to consider and report by what means those natural resources may be more fully developed, and how those industries may be encouraged and extended has begun its labours.</P><P>The Limerick Technical Schools which were closed as the result of the action of the English Administration have been reopened in consequence of the subsidy granted by the Dail for that purpose.</P><P>I will give a brief summary of the activities of the various Departments. We will take up the detailed reports later.</P>

<P>The Scheme introduced at the August Session by the Director of Agriculture providing for the acquisition of untenanted land for the purpose of its allocation amongst landless men capable of working land has been further developed, and details as to the proposals now brought forward for the working of the scheme and the launching of the Land Bank will be submitted to you.</P>

    <Title>STATEMENT OF ACTING-PRESIDENT - FORESTRY.</Title>
<P>A record of valuable reconstructive work begun is presented in the Report of the Forestry Committee.  The time at our disposal for the preparation for the work of carrying out a successful tree planting on the day fixed for the National Arbor Day was very short. Notwithstanding this, orders approximating to £450 have been placed with the Nurserymen, representing some 80,000 trees.  The Irish Parliament had a record of half a million trees annually under a bounty system, and this record we hope to reach and exceed in future years.</P>

    <Title>STATEMENT OF ACTING-PRESIDENT - PROPAGANDA.</Title>
<P>The following pamphlets have been published since last session:&mdash;</P><P>1.  &ldquo;The Cost of Slavery.&rdquo;</P><P>2.  &ldquo;Fragment of 1916 History.&rdquo;</P><P>There are at present in the Press:&mdash;</P><P>1.  &ldquo;Ireland First of the Small Nations.&rdquo;</P><P>2.  &ldquo;The Voice of Ireland.&rdquo;</P><P>Arrangements have been made for the dispatch of a weekly Bulletin of outstanding incidents in the process of governing Ireland to New York, Paris, London, etc.</P><P>The Director of Propaganda is at present in London making arrangements with London Foreign Correspondents to supply them with Irish versions of Irish happenings, and thus to counteract the British campaign of vilification which is being conducted by means of garbled versions of occurrences in Ireland.</P><P>We recently succeeded in procuring secret orders issued to the Quay Police in Dublin by the English Authorities as to the searching of sailors from ships flying the American Flag that come into the Port.  Acting on our instructions, copies of these orders are now in the hands of the American Government, and we have information to the effect that there has been no recent occurrence to create such uproar and confusion in the Castle as the discovery of these orders.</P><P>In addition to Mr. Bulfin in Buenos Aires, we now have Mr. Kerney as Consul in Paris, Mr. Gerald O'Kelly in Switzerland, Mr. Hales in Geneva, and Mr. Fawsitt Consul-General at New York.  Mr. Fawsitt has arrived at New York, and has opened an Irish Consulate at 280 Broadway.</P><P>One of our members, Mr. J.A. Burke, Deputy for Mid-Tipperary, has arrived in America since the date of our last session.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT then read a report from Mr. Fawsitt, received through Mr. Dowdall, of Cork, covering his activities since his arrival in New York.</P><P>As to the Orders of the Day, he continued, we have a number of Motions, set down after the Reports.  As there is a possibility of our meeting being interfered with, if not interrupted, and as it is of importance that we dispose of the Motions first, I suggest that we adopt this course and take up the consideration of the Reports at a later stage.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="OA" LHead="ORAL QUESTIONS" RHead="AND REPLIES">
    <Title>ORAL QUESTIONS AND REPLIES.</Title>
<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green), to the Acting-President: I should like to know why Mr. Fawsitt sent his report to Mr. Dowdall.  Why did he not send it direct to the Acting-President?</P>
<P>Mr. J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim Co.), to the Acting-President: Was it not possible <Col N="161"/> for Mr. Fawsitt to report in duplicate, sending one copy direct to the Acting-President and the other to Mr. Dowdall?</P>
<P>J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh S.), to the Acting-President: Would the Acting-President inform us of the circumstances under which Mr. Fawsitt was sent out to America as Consul-General?</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT: Mr. de Valera considered that Mr. Fawsitt was the most suitable man for the post, and he was anxious that he should be sent out at once.</P><P>Mr. Dowdall is a member of the Cork Industrial Development Association. This body met and decided to send out two representatives to enquire into the subject of Irish Trade with America, and appointed Mr. Dowdall and Mr. Fawsitt to go.  Both made application for their passports. Mr. Dowdall was granted his, but Mr. Fawsitt was held up.  The latter's passport was granted about two months later, but then there was no available berth in the vessels leaving. He was able at the last moment to purchase a berth from a man who had previously secured a passage.  The Report was presumably sent to Mr. Dowdall to ensure safety of transmission.</P>
<P>SEOSAMH O DOCHARTAIGH (Donegal N.), to the Acting-President: Have any reports been received from the Consul at Buenos Aires?</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT: No.  The matter is being dealt with by the American.  Consul-General and the North American Office is in communication with him.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="FINANCIAL STATEMENT" RHead="AND VOTES OF CREDIT">
    <Title>FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND VOTES OF CREDIT.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT: I will now take up the Financial Statement and the Votes of Credit.</P><P>Having read the Financial Report he moved that the following Votes of Credit be passed:</P><P>£1,000 being the amount asked for by the Department of Agriculture for preliminary expenses in connection with the Agricultural Loan Bank.</P><P>£1,300, being the amount asked for by the Standing Committee, Sinn Fein, in connection with certain expenses incurred by them before the Dáil came into being.</P><P>£5,000, being the amount asked for by the Ministry to cover contingent expenses and eventualities.</P>
<P>W.T. COSGRAVE (Kilkenny N.) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim Co.) desired to know how far the arrangements in regard to the establishment of the Agricultural Loan Bank had progressed, and now soon the scheme would be in working order.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, replying on behalf of the Director of Agriculture, stated that the preliminary arrangements were almost complete and that the appointment of a suitable manager was now receiving attention.</P>
<P>DR. CROWLEY (Mayo N.) also asked for information as to the Agricultural Loan Bank.  There was a farm of 120 acres for sale in his constituency, and a number of young men were anxious to secure it.  Was Dáil Eireann going to advance the money straight off in cases of this kind?  What was this vote of £1,000 to be applied to?</P>
<P>THE SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE: This £1,000 is for the organisation expenses of the Bank.  The money for the purchase of land will not be available until the Bank is organised and sufficiently equipped to do business.</P>
<P>J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim Co.) said that similar cases to that referred to by the Teachta for North Mayo had occurred in his constituency.  He urged the Ministry to hasten matters, and in case the organisation was perfected before the next meeting of the Dáil that money should be placed in the hands of the Director of Agriculture in order to allow of the purchase of these farms as they came into the market.</P>
<P>THE SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE stated in reply that no money could be <Col N="162"/> made available until the scheme had been organised and the Societies set up. He suggested that the vote for the use of the Ministry be increased to £8,000.</P>
<P>THE ACTING-PRESIDENT agreed with the Secretary for Defence.  As regards the Land Scheme, it would be preposterous to expect that money be voted before it had been collected.</P><P>After further discussion the Motion for the Vote of Credit for £1,000 in connection with the Organisation Expenses of the Land Mortgage Bank was put and carried unanimously.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="APPOINTMENT OF SUBSTITUTE" RHead="DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE">
    <Title>APPOINTMENT OF SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE.</Title>
<P>THE ACTING-PRESIDENT explained that on the arrest of Mr. Blythe, Mr. MacGuinness was appointed by the Ministry to take over the direction of the Department of Trade and Commerce. Mr. MacGuinness had his own business to look after and could not be expected to leave it.  He would like to have a man appointed to work the Department under Mr. MacGuinness's directions, as Mr. MacGuinness had not sufficient time at his disposal.</P>
<P>W.T. COSGRAVE (Kilkenny N.) moved that Mr. MacGuinness be appointed Substitute Director of the Department.</P>
<P>DR. CUSACK (Galway N.) seconded.</P><P>Motion put and agreed to.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="THE IRISH" RHead="LANGUAGE">
    <Title>THE IRISH LANGUAGE.</Title>
<P>A resolution from the Ard-Fheis of the Gaelic League asking Dáil Eireann to appoint a Minister for the Irish Language was read by an CEANN COMHAIRLE.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that the Ministry had not taken any action on the subject of this resolution, as it was a matter for the Dáil to deal with.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid) moved that a Minister for the Irish Language be appointed.</P>
<P>L. DE ROISTE (Cork City) suggested that a Minister of Education be appointed. The applications for recognition received from some of the Gaelic Colleges and the Limerick Technical Schools showed the necessity for such an appointment.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford Co.) agreed as to the desirability of appointing a Minister of Education.  He asked the Ceann Comhairle whether that would meet the views of the Gaelic League.</P>
<P>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE said that while it would ill-become him to oppose such a resolution, he thought the Gaelic League, with their 25 years' experience of the work, might be expected to deal efficiently with the subject, and more efficiently perhaps than any Ministry now to be set up.  He was of opinion that the question might very well be allowed to stand over until after Mr. de Valera returned from America. There was no urgency about the matter.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid) said that whilst the Gaelic League machinery was efficient, the Dáil would have <Col N="163"/> more influence in the work of restoring the Irish language.  He was willing to accept the proposition that a Minister for Education be appointed.</P>
<P>J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim Co.) supported the appointment of a Minister for Irish by the Dáil.  This Minister could work in conjunction with the Gaelic League.</P>
<P>Dr. CROWLEY (Mayo N.) supported the motion.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford Co.) thought President de Valera had some definite reason for not appointing a Minister of Education when he was constituting his Ministry.  He thought such an appointment should be deferred until the President returned. Meantime it was essential that the authority of Dáil Eireann should be placed behind the Gaelic League.  He thought, therefore, that pending the President's return a Minister for Irish should be appointed.  He disagreed with the Ceann Comhairle when he said that there was no urgency about the matter.  He moved that they appoint the President of the Gaelic League as Minister for Irish under Dáil Eireann.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) explained that his idea was that a Minister for Irish should be conversant with the whole problem of Primary Education, so that he would be able to assign to the Language its proper place on the curriculum.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid) seconded the motion of the member for Waterford Co.</P>
<P>An CEANN COMHAIRLE said that before deciding on the question, so far as it concerned him personally he should like to consult the Gaelic League, of which he was President.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT suggested that the appointment be left to the Ministry, and that the motion be taken as an expression of the opinion of the Dáil that the President of the Gaelic League should be appointed to the position.</P><P>The proposer and seconder of the motion agreed with this suggestion, and it was put and carried without dissent.</P><P>Applications from the Ard-Sgoil and from Colaiste Nua-Ghaedhilge na Gaillimhe for recognition by the Dáil were presented to the House.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT suggested that these be referred to the Minister for the Irish Language when appointed, and this course was agreed to.</P>

<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) mentioned the setting up of Arbitration Courts by the Sinn Fein Executive, and enquired as to their authority.</P>

<P>The Report of this Committee stated that schemes for affording financial and expert assistance in the development of Irish industries were being considered. Consuls had been established in Buenos Aires, Paris, Genoa and New York and Consuls were en route for other countries.  The English Government had made every effort to interfere with the development of direct trade between Ireland and foreign countries. Cables and correspondence had been delayed and suppressed; British commercial interests had endeavoured to deprive Irish firms of the benefits of direct shipping, and instructions had been issued for the search of the person and belongings of every American sailor entering the Port of Dublin. Steps had been taken to render this interference ineffective.</P>
<P>In proposing that the Report be adopted, DAITHI CEANNT (Cork East) mentioned that the American Consul in Cork had promised to do his best to facilitate direct trading between Ireland and America.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) seconded the motion, and dwelt on the necessity of securing that the warehousing of goods was in the hands of firms favourable to the development of Irish foreign trade.  The provision of return cargoes was a matter of immense importance, and would require the most careful consideration of the Director of Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>THE SUBSTITUTE-DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE outlined the steps already taken in the matter of return cargoes.</P><P>After further discussion the Report was adopted.</P>

<P>THE ACTING-PRESIDENT read the Reports <Col N="165"/> of these Committees which showed that the Agricultural Department had been engaged in developing the details of the scheme for the acquisition of untenanted land for allocation amongst landless men and uneconomic holders and the preliminary arrangements were approaching completion.  The establishment of a Land Bank to provide the Financial assistance necessary for the promotion of this scheme was also being undertaken.</P><P>The arrangements for Arbor Day has been almost completed.  The assistance of local bodies, the Sinn Fein Organisation, Colleges, Convents, etc., had been secured in the organisation of the Planting programme.  Trees had been procured from nurserymen and supplied to Sinn Fein Cumainn and others and expert advice regarding planting had been provided.  Owing to the mildness of the weather it was found necessary to defer the holding of Arbor Day until 29th November.</P><P>The motion for the adoption of the Reports was formally moved and seconded.</P>
<P>J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim Co.) said that the question of organising the Agricultural Loan Bank should be taken up at once, and that practical steps should be taken to settle on the land the people who would otherwise have to emigrate. He moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That the Dáil authorises the Minister of Agriculture to complete as soon as possible the necessary machinery for the Agricultural Bank, and that the sum of £200,000 is hereby voted for the same, and may be drawn on by the Minister as required, provided the money is at the time available.&rdquo;</P>
<P>DR. CROWLEY (Mayo N.) seconded the motion.  The matter was very urgent in Mayo.  Farms were being put up for sale by private individuals.  Some of these farms would be bought by graziers and the old conditions of things perpetuated.  The effect on the country of the purchase and distribution of these ranches by Dáil Eireann would be very great.</P>
<P>E.J. DUGGAN (Meath S.) whilst admitting the urgency of the Land problem said it was clear that nothing could be done until sufficient money was available.</P>
<P>P.J. MOLONEY (Tipperary S.) said there were 300 acres of land on the banks of the Suir which he would like to see in the possession of the young men of the district.</P>
<P>J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh S.) observed that the Joint Stock Banks would be glad to lend money to local men who could provide security for its repayment.</P>
<P>THE ACTING-PRESIDENT replying stated that the Bank could not be started without having a substantial capital behind it.  If the Director of Agriculture used the capital as it came in there would be no Bank left to him.  If there were £50,000 available the Bank might be started.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford Co.) stated that the Director of Agriculture should be empowered to make use of the money as it became available to acquire land straight off.</P>
<P>W.T. COSGRAVE (Kilkenny N.) observed that the Director of Agriculture had stated that it would take at least six months to get the Bank going.</P>
<P>Dr. CUSACK (Galway N.) mentioned that many of his constituents had been making inquiries as to when the scheme would be ready.</P>
<P>DAITHI CEANNT (Cork East) was in favour of the allocation of a certain sum to be available in urgent cases. They should give a lead and show that something was being done in this direction.</P>
<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) suggested that some practical steps could be taken through the medium of the Sinn Fein Bank during the interregnum.  The new Bank should be firmly established before it proceeded with the work before it.</P>
<P>The ACTING PRESIDENT.&mdash;The sum of £1,000 which you have voted under this head is for initial expenses.  If we start this Bank on a small basis it will be a failure.  The Bank cannot be started in 2 month's, or in two months' or in three <Col N="166"/> months' time.  I hold that, as three-fourths of the people are agriculturists, the Land question is the biggest question we have in Ireland.  I would suggest that the motion might be adopted with a direction leaving it to the discretion of the Ministry to advance funds as soon as it is considered advisable, and when there are sufficient funds at their disposal. We have no idea when we may get the money which is now being raised in America.  To decide at present to devote any definite sum such as £200,000 would be an impossible proposition. What should be done is to adopt a proposal empowering the Ministry to deal with the whole question in the manner I have suggested.</P><P>The House concurred with the Acting-President's suggestion.</P><P>The Agricultural and Forestry Reports were then adopted.</P>

<P>M. STAINES (St. Michan's) enquired as to the reason why the issue of the leaflet prepared by the Forestry Committee containing the names of the 16 Volunteer Leaders of Easter Week who were executed, and exhorting the people to plant clumps of 16 trees in their memory on Arbor Day, was stopped.</P>
<P>The ACTING PRESIDENT.  - The leaflet was only withheld from issue with the correspondence of <i>Young Ireland.</i>  Its circulation has not been prohibited.</P>

    <Title>INTERFERENCE WITH DIRECT TRADE.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT said he thought it advisable that the Dáil should present a statement to the United States Government regarding the interference by the English Government with direct trade from Ireland to the United States. If the Dáil approved of the idea he would suggest that the Ministry be empowered to draft the statement.</P>
<P>J. MACGUINNESS (Longford) was of opinion that in drafting the statement the Ministry should take cognisance of the fact that America might feel irritated and might even resent action which would tend to raise matters likely to cause trouble to her.</P><P>The matter was referred to the Ministry.</P>

<P>M. STAINES (St. Michan's) asked leave of the House to refer to the efforts of Alderman O'Beirne on behalf of the Political Prisoners which led to judgment and costs being entered against him in an action brought by Sir John Irwin, late Chairman of the Visiting Justices to Mountjoy Prison.  He mentioned that a fund had been opened for the purpose of indemnifying Alderman O'Beirne, and he would like to know if the Dáil could contribute to same.  The matter having been discussed at length, it was decided that no action be taken.</P><P>This concluded the business of the Session and the House adjourned.</P>
