    <Title>PRESS REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS.</Title>
<P>The ACTING PRESIDENT, in reply to a question from Ald. T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green), stated that a report of the previous day's proceedings had been issued to the Press, but was refused publication by the English Government. Copies of this report had already been sent abroad.  Steps will be taken to have the report printed and circulated after the conclusion of the Session.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - TRADE AND COMMERCE.</Title>
<P>The debate on the Report of the DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE was then resumed, and the report of the SECRETARY FOR INDUSTRIES was taken in conjunction therewith.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR, in reply to various speakers, gave particulars regarding the establishment of the Dead Meat Industry.  The question of establishing a distributing warehouse was receiving attention.  A proposal had been made to him that a number of American millionaires who were interested in Ireland, were prepared to finance an investigation into Irish Resources.  The Co-operative Movement seemed to be the only feasible method of combating Foreign Trusts and Combines.  They should handle the matter with care so as not to endanger the unity of the people, and so as to retain the support of the Labour Movement.</P><P>The debate was continued by Mr. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.), Mr. MACENTEE (Monaghan S.), Mr. ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow E.), M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City), and Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green).</P>
<P>The Debate was closed by the MINISTER OF INDUSTRIES who said that a number of concrete proposals would be submitted later in the Session.  They would of course discourage the exploitation of Irish Industries by Foreign Capitalists by every means in their power.  He was convinced that the development of co-operation, both distributive and productive, was the only way to fight the Trust policy. He did not apprehend any danger of splitting their ranks by the adoption of this policy.</P>

<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) referred to the necessity for attending to an increase in the area under tillage.</P>
<P>A. MACCABE (Sligo S.) said that it was essential for the Dáil to take up a definite stand with a view to securing the land for the people.</P>
<P>S. ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow E.) gave a resume of the condition of affairs on the Cloncurry Estate, which the owner proposes to parcel out in three large holdings, thereby selling the tenant right to which he had no just claim.</P>
<P>J. MACBRIDE (Mayo W.) suggested the establishment of an Agricultural Bank to facilitate the acquisition of land by the young men of the country.  This suggestion was supported by Messrs. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) O'CONNOR (Kildare S.), and FAHY (Galway S.).</P>
<P><Col N="121"/> M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City) mentioned the desirability of endeavouring to retain in Ireland the farm labourers who usually migrate to England.</P>
<P>W. COSGRAVE (Kilkenny N.) explained, on behalf of the Director of Agriculture, that the only proposal so far with regard to the Cloncurry case was that the Director should interview Lord Cloncurry.</P><P>It was decided after a division, by twenty-three votes to six, that the Dáil adjourn until 1.35 p.m. (3 p.m. English time), and on resumption should sit until 4.35 p.m. (6 p.m. English time), when an adjournment until 6.5 p.m. (7.30 p.m. English time) would take place.</P><P>Dáil Eireann re-assembled at 2.5 p.m. (3.30 p.m. English time).</P>

    <Title>MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - CONSULAR SERVICE.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved that:</P><P>&ldquo;The establishment of a Consular Service is decreed.  The Consuls appointed to be amenable to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P><P>Ireland ought to have a Consular Service in Switzerland, France, and Spain.  In connection with America it was proposed to appoint a man there, and he would ask the Dáil not to mention his name.</P>
<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) asked that his name be not disclosed. (Members signified their assent.)</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT, continuing, said that the New York Consulate would be distinct from the political side.  A sum of £3,000 would be required to secure the services of a first-class man and to establish him in a central office in the City.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) seconded.</P>
<P>J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) moved, and M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City) seconded, an amendment to the effect:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the question of appointing Consuls be deferred until after the flotation of the Loan had been discussed.&rdquo;</P><P>This was defeated by nineteen votes to six.</P>
<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) moved an addendum:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That a sum not exceeding £10,000 in any one year be appropriated for the Consular Service&mdash; details to be submitted to a later meeting of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
<P>J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh S.) seconded, and the addendum was accepted by the ACTING-PRESIDENT.</P><P>The original motion thus amended was put and carried.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="MINISTERIAL MOTIONS." RHead="- PROVISION OF LAND">
    <Title>MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - PROVISION OF LAND.</Title>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="MINISTERIAL MOTIONS." RHead="- AFFORESTATION">
    <Title>MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - AFFORESTATION.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved that:</P><P>&ldquo;Dáil decrees November 1st a National Arbor Day, and authorises the appointment of a National Inspector of Forestry, and that a sum of £1,000 be appropriated for the purpose for the present year.&rdquo;</P>
<P><Col N="122"/> LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) seconded the motion, and suggested that the County Councils should be circularised in the matter, and that a small committee be set up to assist the Ministry in dealing with the question.</P>
<P>A. MACCABE (Sligo S.) suggested that the local press should be supplied with material in order to stimulate local action.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT agreed with these suggestions.</P><P>After further discussion the question was put and carried.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="MINISTERIAL MOTIONS." RHead="- FISHERIES">
    <Title>MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - FISHERIES.</Title>

It authorises the application of National Funds up to £5,000 for that purpose, and the appointment of a National Inspector of Fisheries.&rdquo;</P>
<P>S. ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow E.) seconded. He said that piers and harbours were required.  The English Government starved the Irish Fisheries in order to get the men round the coast for their Navy.</P>
<P>J. MACBRIDE (Mayo W.) said that most of the fishing round the coasts of Ireland was done by Frenchmen and Scotchmen.  The Department of Agriculture in Ireland are now issuing orders defining river mouths far out to sea, and thus forbidding the fishermen from fishing on grounds thus defined, running in many cases two and three miles out.  They refuse to say on whose application this is done.</P>
<P>M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City) moved:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the appropriation be increased to £10,000.&rdquo;</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid) seconded.</P><P>The Ministry accepted the addendum and the original question thus amended was then put and carried.</P>

<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) asked whether the members of the Commission would be paid or unpaid?</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT replied that he did not think that any member would require payment as salary, but expenses ordinarily incurred should be paid.  The members of the Commission should be men of standing and eminence.</P><P>After a general discussion the question was put and carried.  T.

    <sTitle>FINANCE.</sTitle>
<P>1.  J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) to the MINISTER FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;For what purpose has the £500 appearing against the U.S.A. account been given?&rdquo;</P>
<P>SECRETARY FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;This matter should be referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.&rdquo;</P>
<P>2.  J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) to the MINISTER FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;For what purpose has the £100 against the Argentine account been given?&rdquo;</P>
<P>SECRETARY FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;It is a payment on account for the establishment of a Consulate in Buenos Ayres.&rdquo;</P>
<P>3.  J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) to the MINISTER FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;What are the items which make up £606 6s. 6d., payments to Ministers, etc.?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;The sum is made up of items of salaries paid to Ministers and Directors of Departments, as follows:&mdash;</P><P>£100 0s. 0d. to E. de Valera, 1/4/'19 to 31/5/'19.</P><P>£57 7s. 3d. to Count Plunkett, 2/4/'19 to 31/5/'19.</P><P>£57 7s. 3d. to Mdme. Marklevicz, 2/4/'19 to 31/5/'19.</P><P>£57 7s. 3d. to L. MacCosgair, 2/4/'19 to 31/5/'19.</P><P>£57 7s. 3d. to M.O Coileain, 2/4/'19 to 31/5/'19.</P><P>£87 10s. 0d. to L. Ginnell, 1/4/'19 to 30/6/'19.</P><P>£47 10s. 0d. to E. Blythe, 4/4/'19 to 31/5/'19.</P><P>£109 7s. 6d. to S.T. O'Kelly, 8/2/'19 to 31/5/'19.</P><P>£32 10s. 0d. to R. Mulcahy, 21/4/'19 to 31/5/'19.</P>
<P>4.  J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) to the MINISTER FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;Who sanctioned payment at the rate of £500 per year to the Secretary of the Dáil?&rdquo;</P>
<P>SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE: &ldquo;When the Foreign Relations Committee handed over their responsibilities to the Dáil, the Ministry consulted Mr. de Valera, and he agreed to the appointment of Mr. Gavan Duffy.  The latter had to give up his position and we decided to pay him a salary.  I do not think it was necessary to come to the Dáil to ask for sanction for such an appointment. I can well understand that Ministers cannot sanction payment to themselves, but if they are to have any responsibility they should be at liberty to make appointments such as they have made.&rdquo;</P>
<P>ACTING-PRESIDENT: &ldquo;If the Ministry is to sit while the Dáil is not in session and be precluded from making necessary appointments, it would be powerless. If ratification is now required to Mr. O'Kelly's salary I move that the Dáil do now ratify the payment of a salary to him of £350.  As to Mr. Duffy's salary being more than the salary of individual Ministers, there is no unusual discrepancy in that.  Ministers in most of the countries of the world are not paid the same salary as Officials and Ambassadors.&rdquo;</P>
<P><Col N="124"/> W. COSGRAVE (Kilkenny N.) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>R. SWEETMAN (Wexford N.) thought that they should now decide what appointments the Ministry were empowered to make without reference to the Dáil.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE pointed out that if it were decided now that they could not make appointments without sanction of the Dáil they would be held up in an urgent case until the Dáil met.</P>
<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) said that his objection was to the appointment of members of the Dáil to salaried positions without consulting the Dáil.</P><P>He moved an amendment that during the time Sean T. O'Kelly was on foreign service in Paris his salary be at the rate of £500 per year.</P>
<P>Dr. CUSACK (Galway N.) seconded the amendment.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT announced that the Ministry would accept the amendment and also the suggestion of Alderman T. Kelly (St. Stephen's Green) that all appointments of Members of Dáil to salaried positions would be submitted to Dáil for ratification.</P><P>The amendment to increase Mr. O'Kelly's salary was put and agreed to.</P>
<P>J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) asked leave to withdraw his motion, &ldquo;That the annual salary of the Secretary to the Dáil be £350 and not £500 as was given by the Ministry without the sanction of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P><P>The motion was accordingly withdrawn.</P>
<P>5.  J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) to the MINISTER FOR FINANCE:</P><P>(<i>a</i>)  &ldquo;How many paid officials are employed by the Dáil?&rdquo;</P><P>(<i>b</i>)  &ldquo;What are their salaries?&rdquo;</P><P>(<i>c</i>)  &ldquo;How much per week is their present cost?&rdquo;</P><P>SECRETARY FOR FINANCE:</P><P>(<i>a</i>)  &ldquo;There are seven officials excluding the Secretary to the Cabinet.&rdquo;</P><P>(<i>b</i>)  &ldquo;D. O'Hegarty, Clerk to Dáil, £250 per annum.</P><P>M. Lynch, Official Translator, £250 per annum.</P><P>P. O'Siochain, Private Secretary to Home Secretary, £260 per annum.  (This was his salary from the Sinn Fein Organisation.)</P><P>D. O'Donohue, Accountant, £208 per annum.</P><P>F. Murphy, Assistant, £130 per annum.</P><P>Miss Mason, Typist, £104 per annum.</P><P>R. Conlon, Messenger, £52 per annum.&rdquo;</P><P>(<i>c</i>)  &ldquo;At the rate of £24 2s. 4d.&rdquo;</P>
<P>6.  J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) to the MINISTER FOR FINANCE:</P><P>&ldquo;Who are the Officials or employes working under Sean T. O'Kelly and G. Gavan Duffy?  Who appointed them, and what precautions were taken as to their fitness before they were appointed?&rdquo;</P><P>SECRETARY FOR FINANCE:</P><P>&ldquo;The Paris Staff are:&mdash;</P><P>Victor Collins,</P><P>Mrs. Gavan Duffy (unpaid),</P><P>M. Caulfield,</P><P>Madame Vivanti.&rdquo;</P>
<P>SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: &ldquo;We got the assistance of Victor Collins, who was Paris Correspondent of an American Paper.  There was the strongest reason for sending Mr. Gavan Duffy to Paris, Madame Vivanti is an Italian lady well known as a leading novelist in Italy.  She was notified by an Italian lawyer to leave Italy for the good of her health, and we availed of her services.  If any payments were made to Mr. Caulfield they were very small, and are included in the general expenses of Mr. O'Kelly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Mr. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) asked why Mr. de Roiste's services were not availed of when offered to the Ministry.  He had a passport, or was promised one.  In reply to a question by the ACTING-PRESIDENT, he said that he had not Mr. de Roiste's authority for putting the question.</P>
<P><Col N="125"/> The ACTING-PRESIDENT replied that Mr. de Roiste mentioned that he was promised a Passport, but that he never heard anything further from him.</P>
<P>7.  LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City): &ldquo;Does the amount paid in respect of the American Delegation represent the total cost, or does it refer to expenses in Dublin alone?&rdquo;</P>
<P>SECRETARY FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;The amount is in respect of the entire journey through Ireland.  The greater part represents expenditure in Dublin which works out at approximately £327 10s. 0d. There is a further sum of £77 5s. 0d. due in respect of this.&rdquo;</P>
<P>8.  J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) to the MINISTER FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;Whether in view of the promise given by the Minister for Finance at the meeting of the Dáil on 1st-2nd April, any constructive proposal will be put forward at this meeting of the Dáil for the introduction of a scheme of banking suitable to the needs of Irish Trade, Commerce, Agriculture, and Industries?&rdquo;</P>
<P>SECRETARY FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;It is clear to anybody that the position depends on the amount available.  There are no proposals before the Dáil for the reason that the necessary information is not available.  A certain scheme is under contemplation, but I do not propose bringing it forward until further details are forthcoming.&rdquo;</P>
