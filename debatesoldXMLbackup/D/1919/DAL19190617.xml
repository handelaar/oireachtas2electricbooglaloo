  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="LETTER FROM" RHead="PRESIDENT DE VALERA">
    <Title>LETTER FROM PRESIDENT DE VALERA.</Title>
<P>The following letter from the PRESIDENT was read:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;I hereby appoint the Secretary for Home Affairs, Art O'Griobhtha, as Deputy President in my absence. The fact that he is Vice-President of the political organisation clearly indicates him for the position, and is an assurance that he will have the loyal co-operation of the whole Dáil.</P><P>&ldquo;I do not know that there is any provision made for it in the constitution but I think it important, so that the number in the Cabinet may not be too small, and that it may include a sufficiency of different types of opinion, to make good the deficiency in number during my absence, by the temporary admission of one of the present extra cabinet ministers, and if this be ratified by Dáil Eireann, Earnan de Blaghd, Minister for Trade, should be thus admitted.</P><P>&ldquo;I am also of the opinion that the Deputy-President should be requested by the Cabinet to accept his salary, as in effect he will be giving all his time to the work.</P><P>&ldquo;For the coming meeting of the Dáil, the Ministers in charge of Trade, Local Government, etc., should have schemes&mdash;practical proposals sanctioned by the Cabinet, and ready to be put into immediate operation if sanctioned by the Dáil&mdash;fully prepared. We must endeavour to begin at once to put into operation the domestic and constructive side of the Sinn Fein programme.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>APPOINTMENT OF DEPUTY PRESIDENT.</Title>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) moved and JOSEPH MACGUINNESS (Longford Co.) seconded:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the Dáil ratify the appointment of Art O Griobhtha, Secretary for Home Affairs, as President-Substitute during the absence of the President.&rdquo;</P><P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  </MainHeading>

    <Title>INCLUSION IN THE MINISTRY OF THE DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE.</Title>
<P><Col N="113"/> CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford Co.) moved and T. MAC SUIBHNE (Cork Mid) seconded:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the Dáil ratify the inclusion in the Ministry of Earnan de Blaghd, Director of Trade and Commerce.&rdquo;</P>
<P>JOSEPH MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) opposed the motion on the ground that this would mean two Ministers of Trade and Commerce.  He asked if the Minister previously appointed had resigned or had been dismissed.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT replied that the Member was labouring under an extraordinary misapprehension.  There was no Minister for Trade and Commerce, but the strength of the Cabinet had been reduced by Mr. de Valera's absence.  There is a Minister for Industries.</P>
<P>J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary North) moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That no Minister be appointed until 16B on the Orders of the day had been discussed.&rdquo;</P>
<P>S. MACENTEE (Monaghan S.) seconded. He asked for an explanation of the absence of the President.  No Member of the Dáil had been consulted. It was neither right nor fair to them that they should be unable to say whether the President had gone away, and where he was.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT-SUBSTITUTE replied that before the Dáil adjourned every Member would be informed as to the facts.  The proposals before the House must be carried or rejected, and until the revolutionary proposals appearing lower down in the Orders of the day were carried they would go on.</P>
<P>EOIN MACNEILL (National University) said that he had no special fitness for the post he occupied.  Mr. de Blaghd had done a considerable amount of work in the Department of Trade and Commerce and he should be glad that he (Mr. de Blaghd) should be appointed an active Member of the Ministry.  There was great danger that while they were gaining the political Independence of Ireland they might lose it economically.</P><P>A Division was challenged on the Amendment, and on a count of five votes for, and twenty-two against, the original question was put and carried.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="MOTION OF THANKS TO" RHead="THE AMERICAN SENATE">
    <Title>MOTION OF THANKS TO THE AMERICAN SENATE.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved the following resolution of thanks to the American Senate:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;The duly elected representatives of Ireland assembled in legislative session in Dublin this 17th day of June, 1919, before taking up the business of the day, desire to record their appreciation of the action of the Congress of the United States on behalf of Ireland, and in particular of the following resolutions adopted by the Senate of the United States:&mdash;</P><P>&lsquo;That the Senate of the United States earnestly requests the American Peace Commission at Versailles to endeavour to secure for Eamon de Valera, Arthur Griffith, and George Noble Plunkett, a hearing before the Peace Conference, in order that they may present the case of Ireland.</P><P>&lsquo;And further, the Senate of the United States expresses its sympathy with the aspirations of the Irish people for a Government of their own choice.&rsquo;</P><P>It is therefore resolved: That the elected Government of Ireland be and is hereby directed to convey the thanks of the Irish Nation to the Congress of the United States; to declare that the people of Ireland cherish no designs on the rights or territories of other nations, but ardently seek to live in cordial peace with, and as one of, the Free Nations of the World; and to assure the people of America that the ties of blood and friendship which subsisted between both nations in the days of their subjection to one common oppressor have endured and are indissoluble.&rdquo;</P>
<P><Col N="114"/> CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) seconded the motion, which was unanimously adopted.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT OF THE" RHead="ACTING PRESIDENT">
    <Title>STATEMENT OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS said:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;The President has, by and with the advice of the Ministry, gone on a mission abroad, particulars of which will be communicated to the Dáil before the conclusion of the Session. In his absence we should, and it is his desire that we should, proceed with as much speed as possible with our constructive programme.  Accordingly we shall ask the Dáil to deal with and advise on the questions of construction that will arise on the reports of the various Ministers.  After the reports have been discussed the ministerial proposals will be proceeded with, and motions of which private members have given notice will then be taken up.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT OF THE ACTING" RHead="PRESIDENT. - CONSULAR SERVICE">
    <Title>STATEMENT OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT. - CONSULAR SERVICE.</Title>
<P>&ldquo;The question of the establishment of a Consular Service has received a considerable amount of attention from the Ministry since the Dáil last met. The necessity for such a service is patent to us all.  If we had had some such service all the hard work at Paris would have been much easier.  In the opinion of the Ministry there should be prominent representatives of Ireland abroad.  Already the Ministry have appointed one representative to Argentina, Eamonn Bulfin; and they are considering the appointment of others, one of whom will be accredited to the United States.  Detailed proposals will be laid before you in connection with the Consular Service, and especially in connection with the question of direct trading between the United States and this country.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT OF THE ACTING" RHead="PRESIDENT. - LAND">
    <Title>STATEMENT OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT. - LAND.</Title>
<P>&ldquo;This matter will arise on the report of the Director of Agriculture. The land question is inseparably bound up with the question of Emigration. We know that the policy of the English Government is to encourage emigration from Ireland if they can open the ports next December.  The Chief Secretary for the English Power in Ireland has stated that their chief difficulty arises from the preponderance of young men in this country.  It will be the business of the Dáil to take steps to thwart that policy which is a very serious matter for us.  I hope that every member will give his best thought and consideration to this question.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT OF THE ACTING" RHead="PRESIDENT. - FISHERIES">
    <Title>STATEMENT OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT. - FISHERIES.</Title>
<P>&ldquo;Proposals for the advancement of Irish Fisheries will be laid before you. At the present time the Irish Fisheries have the smallest yield of any maratime country in the world.  Under the care of an English Department the yield has been steadily decreasing, while the yield from the English Fisheries has increased by £2,000,000 in value during the same period.  The English Department is not going to help our Fisheries; it is bent on destroying them.  We are now going to take practical steps to deal with the matter.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT OF THE ACTING" RHead="PRESIDENT. - FORESTRY">
    <Title>STATEMENT OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT. - FORESTRY.</Title>
<P>&ldquo;The percentage of the area of Ireland under woodland was the least of any country before the war, and during the war fifteen years of the twenty years' supply has gone. Ireland is now worse off in this respect than any other inhabited country in the world with the exception of Ireland.  It will be the duty of the Dáil to find a remedy for this condition of affairs.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT OF THE ACTING" RHead="PRESIDENT. - ARBITRATION COURTS">
    <Title>STATEMENT OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT. - ARBITRATION COURTS.</Title>
<P>&ldquo;We desire that a scheme should be worked out by the Dáil for the establishment of Arbritration Courts in every County.  Suggestions for a practical scheme will be brought for ward.</P><P>&ldquo;OTHER MATTERS which will engage our attention are:&mdash;</P><P>(1)  The question of an exhibition of Irish products and resources.</P><P>(2)  The formation of Irish Boards of Trade.</P>
<P><Col N="115"/> (3)  The establishment of a National Civil Service.</P><P>&ldquo;As control of the local bodies is essential to our policy we must work to capture those which are not yet with us, and set to work with the cooperation of those which are with us.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT." RHead="- BUSINESS OF THE SESSION">
    <Title>STATEMENT OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT. - BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.</Title>
<P>&ldquo;What we propose to do is to read all the ministerial reports to-day, and have the debates on them to-morrow. Then we will take up the ministerial motions and the other motions.  This is suggested as the most satisfactory method of procedure, but it is, of course, for the Dáil to decide the matter for itself.&rdquo;</P>
<P>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE: &ldquo;I take it that the Dail approves?&rdquo;</P><P>Members signified their assent.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="REPORTS OF" RHead="DEPARTMENTS">
    <Title>REPORTS OF DEPARTMENTS.</Title>
<P>Reports of the Secretaries for Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industries, Local Government, Trade and Commerce, and Agriculture, were then read.</P><P>As the Minister for Labour and the Director of Propaganda were at the moment in the hands of the enemy they were unable to furnish reports. The Minister for Finance and the Director of Agriculture being temporarily prevented from attendance by enemy action, their reports were read by the ACTING-PRESIDENT.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="APPOINTMENT OF SUBSTITUTE-DIRECTOR" RHead="OF PROPAGANDA">
    <Title>APPOINTMENT OF SUBSTITUTE-DIRECTOR OF PROPAGANDA.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved and Mr. W.T. Cosgrave (Kilkenny N.) seconded:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the Dáil approve of the nomination of Mr. D. Fitzgerald (Pembroke) as Director of Propaganda during Mr. Ginnell's absence through enemy action.&rdquo;</P>
<P>An Amendment proposed by Mr. J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) and seconded by Mr. F. FAHY (Galway S.). that the question be deferred pending a decision on the motion to revise the constitution&mdash;16B on the Orders of the day&mdash;was defeated on a division by fifteen votes to eleven.</P>
<P>Mr. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) asked if this appointment was for the period until Mr. Ginnell's release, and if the appointment of Mr. Blythe was until the return of the President.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT replied in the affirmative.</P><P>The original motion was then put and carried.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="PROVISION FOR" RHead="MRS. GINNELL">
    <Title>PROVISION FOR MRS. GINNELL.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved and CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) seconded:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the Dáil approve of an allowance at the rate of £250 per annum to Mrs. Ginnell during the period of Mr. Ginnell's imprisonment.&rdquo;</P><P>It was explained that the ordinary payment to Mr. Ginnell would be made to the Substitute Director until Mr. Ginnell returned.</P><P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="FINANCE:" RHead="IRELAND'S CASE">
    <Title>FINANCE: IRELAND'S CASE.</Title>
<P>A general discussion took place on the Report submitted by the SECRETARY FOR FINANCE.</P>
<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) pointed out that it was not proper that the monies of Dáil should be in the hands of a bank which flew the Union Jack.</P><P>This view was supported by Mr. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) and generally agreed to.</P><P>It was explained that £2,000 had been lodged with the Munster and Leinster Bank for convenience, and that it would be withdrawn without delay.</P>
<P>Mr. J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) asked several questions regarding items appearing on the Balance Sheet, and in the absence of the Secretary for Finance, was asked to give notice of the questions.  He complained that <Col N="116"/> the salary paid to Mr. Gavan Duffy was never sanctioned by the Dáil, and was in excess of that paid to Members of the Ministry.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) explained that it was not considered necessary to submit the salary proposed to be paid to an Official to the Dáil for approval, but if the Dáil so desired, this would of course be done.</P>
<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) remarked that it was not a sound principle that members of Dáil should be appointed to salaried positions without the approval of Dáil.</P>
<P>Arising out of the item in respect of the cost of printing &ldquo;Ireland's Case&rdquo; Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) moved and JOHN O'MAHONY (Fermanagh S.) seconded:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the Dáil orders that 100 copies of &ldquo;Ireland's Case&rdquo; be printed for circulation amongst members of Dáil.&rdquo;</P><P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="EAST TIPPERARY" RHead="VACANCY">
    <Title>EAST TIPPERARY VACANCY.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT said that a Select Committee appointed at the Dáil meeting in April last had recommended that the vacancy in the Dáil should be filled, and suggested that the best procedure would be for the body which selected the late Member, Pierce McCann, to select the new member.  The Ministry had not since been able to evolve any more satisfactory system of dealing with the matter.  As the Constituency was under Martial Law this would appear to be the only course open to them.</P>
<P>Mr. M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City) moved and Mr. ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow E.) seconded that the Dáil approve of the proposal.</P>
<P>After some discussion Mr. MACENTEE (Monaghan S.) moved:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Election be deferred for six months.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Mr. MACCABE (Sligo S.) seconded, adding, &ldquo;or until such time as the writ is issued by the English Government.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT suggested that a small Committee to consist of the Members for Tipperary and Mr. MACENTEE, with three Members of the Ministry, Mr. COSGRAVE, COUNT PLUNKETT, and Mr. BLYTHE, should again consider the question and report.</P><P>The suggestion was agreed to.</P><P>A motion to adjourn until 3.30 p.m. English time was agreed to.</P><P>On the suggestion of the ACTING-PRESIDENT it was agreed that a report of the proceedings should be supplied to the press.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="ORDER OF PRIORITY" RHead="OF BUSINESS">
    <Title>ORDER OF PRIORITY OF BUSINESS.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT suggested that 16a and 16b on the Orders of the Day be taken up after the adjournment.</P>
<P>Mr. MACENTEE (Monaghan S.) moved and Mr. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) seconded, that the original order of business according to the Agenda be adhered to.</P><P>After discussion this proposal was negatived by sixteen votes to three, and it was then agreed that the debates on the reports should be taken up after the adjournment.</P><P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.5 p.m. (1.30 English time).</P><P>The House re-assembled at 2.20 p.m. (3.45 English time).</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES ON" RHead="REPORTS">
    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS.</Title>
<P>Mr. MACENTEE (Monaghan S.) felt that important decisions were arrived at in consultation with the American Commission&mdash;decisions with which Members should be acquainted.  He asked whether it were true that Mr. Ryan's return to America was due to a slight he received either in America or in Paris?</P>
<P>Mr. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) asked why the President went abroad, and who sent the Member for South Roscommon to America, and for what purpose?</P>
<P>Mr. MACCABE (Sligo S.) enquired whether any steps had been taken to co-ordinate this movement with movements in India and other places where there is discontent against English domination?</P>
<P><Col N="117"/> COUNT PLUNKETT (Roscommon N.), in reply said that great difficulties had to be faced in Paris owing to the hostility of the French Press Censorship. These difficulties had in great measure been overcome.  They had secured the aid of certain French Publicists, notably M. Treguiez, whose writings were of great service to the Irish cause.  The American Commission had come to Ireland to be advised by the Ministry regarding policy, and had returned to Paris with definite instructions that the demand of Ireland was an Irish Republic.  Mr. Ryan had, as far as his information went, returned to America to report to the American people on the state of Ireland, and on the general progress of his mission.</P><P>The Deputy for South Roscommon had been sent to the United States to co-ordinate the activities of the various Irish Societies in America, and to pave the way for the establishment of consular relations.</P><P>They were working in harmony with the other subject nations of the British Empire, but great care was being taken that the cause of Ireland was not jeopardised in any way.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT, replying to further questions, reminded the Dáil of the necessity of secrecy in matters such as the despatch of envoys abroad.  The fact that the envoys had arrived proved that the secret was well kept.  The whole Italian Press had now come round to the side of Ireland.  Mr. Walsh, one of the American Commission, said that Ireland was making more noise than all the other small nations combined. The Irish Delegates to the Peace Conference had entered a caveat against England's attempt to sign the Peace Treaty on behalf of Ireland, and at a later date a demand for recognition of the Irish Republic would be made on the nations of the world.  There was no alliance between India, Egypt, and Ireland. They were working in co-operation, but the Dáil was the only body competent to make alliances.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - LOCAL GOVERNMENT.</Title>
<P>A short discussion took place on the Report, as a result of which it was decided, on the motion of M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City), seconded by J. O'DOHERTY (Donegal N.), that copies of the Report should be circulated to all Comhairli Ceanntair of Sinn Fein, with a request that a summary of same be supplied to the local Press.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT also suggested the formation of Parish Committees to awaken local interest in the Housing Problem.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES ON REPORTS. -" RHead="TRADE AND COMMERCE">
    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - TRADE AND COMMERCE.</Title>
<P>Arising out of the Report of the Director of Trade and Commerce, Mr. J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) referred to the necessity of counteracting the operation of English Trade Agents in Ireland.</P>
<P>Mr. MACBRIDE (Mayo W.) thought that the establishment of large distributing warehouses was essential to the development of export trade.</P>
<P>Mr. MACENTEE (Monaghan S.) suggested the establishment of an industrial bank, and Mr. SWEETMAN (Wexford N.) referred to the possibilities of utilising the water power of Ireland.</P>
<P>Dr. CUSACK (Galway N.) suggested the appointment of an Industrial Commission to collect statistics regarding Ireland's natural and industrial resources, and handed in a Notice of Motion to this effect.</P>
<P>Mr. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh S.) pointed out the necessity of securing support for existing industries, particularly in the home market.</P>
<P>Mr. MACSWEENEY (Cork Mid) said that it would be best to concentrate on industrial schemes requiring a moderate amount of capital.</P>
<P>Reference having been made by Mr. ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow E.) and COUNT PLUNKETT (Roscommon N.) to the possibility of starting an Irish Glass Manufacturing Industry in Arklow, the ACTING-PRESIDENT moved the adjournment of the debate until 9.35 on the following morning (11 o'clock English Time).  This was agreed to, and the House adjourned at 4.35 p.m. (6 p.m. English time).</P>
