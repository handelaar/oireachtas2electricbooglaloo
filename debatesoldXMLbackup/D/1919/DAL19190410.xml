      <P>A dhaoine muinnteartha, fearaim fáilte ó chroidhe na Dála roimh gach duine atá I láthair anso indiu. Fearaim fáilte roimh na mnáibh maithe, Máithreacha,Inghíneacha agus Dearbhféireacha na laochra atá anois ar shlíghe na fírinne  I ndiaidh an áir, I ndiaidh Coga na Cásga. </P>
      <P>Fearaim fáilte Uí Cheallaigh roimh na mnáibh leis a bhí  I n-uaigneasle bliadhain I gcarcaraibh Shasana, agus fearaim fáilte roimh ár hCómh-Theachtaibh a éalaigh as Carcar Áth Cliath le déanaidhe, agus molaim go hárd a gcródhacht agus a misneach.</P>
      <P>Fearaim fíor-fháilte roimhár gCómh-Theachtaíbh a bhí fé ghlas is géibhinn ag an namhaid malluighthe le bliadhain, agus ná raibh anso againn an uair dheireannach a thángamar le chéile, agus gur áil linn go léir iad do bheith 'nár measc indiu.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chómhairle agus a lucht na Dála, an chéad rud atá orm a dhéanamh ná cúrsaí na hAireachta do chur ós bhúr gcómhair. Tá fhios agaibh gurab é an chéad rud atá orainn le déanamh ná cur I n-iúil anso, agus do mhuinntir an domhain ar fad, ná fuil acht aon Riaghaltas amháin I nÉirinn, sé sin an Riaghaltas atá toghtha ag na daoinibh , agus curtha ar bun le toil na ndaoine. </P>
      <P>Caithfimíd a rádh ná fuil aon Riaghaltas, acht an Riaghaltas san, dleaghthach. Níl aon úghdarás ag Riaghaltas an namhaid anso mar níl sé do réir tola muinntir na hÉireann, agus seasuighmíd go daingean I n-aghaidh an Riaghaltais bréige sin, toisc nár cuireadh ar bun é le toil na ndaoine anso I nÉirinn.</P>
      <P>Tá rudaí anso agam as sgríbhinn an Cháirdinéil Mercier. Deir sé: -</P>
      <P>"Ná fuil úghdarás ar bith ag na daoinibh a tháinig isteach le láimh láidir , nó cómhacht airm, aon dualgas d'éileamh ar na daoinibh sa tír a ghabhdar le cómhacht airm, agus ní hamháin gur cóir do na daoinibh gan an dualgas san do thabhairt dóibh, acht go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar na daoinibh cur go fonnmhar 'na gcoinnibh. "</P>
      <P>Ní Riaghaltas a cuireadh ar bun le láimh láidir an Riaghaltas seo againne. Is é an Riaghaltas Gallda Riaghaltas na láimhe láidre , níl an ceart ag baint leis, agus is cóir dúinne seasamh ar son an chirt, fé mar atáimíd a dhéanamh. Anois cad iad na rudaí atá ceapuighthe againn le déanamh? Tá thall agus sa bhaile daoine a cheapan agus a deirean gur cóir iomlán na saoirse do thabhairt d'Éirinn, agus caithfimíd Toscaireachtaí do chur thar lear, go mór mhór go Paris agus do gach áit 'na gceaptar gur ceart an lámh láidir do bhriseadh chun innsint ansan cad é toil, agus cad é aigne mhuinntir na hÉireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh na Toscairí ansan ag obair thar lear, agus beidh na Teachtaí ag obair sa bhaile, guala le gualainn leó so atá <Col N="46" /> ag obair ar son na hÉireann. Anois tá ceist mhór eile ar ar mhaith liom trácht, ceist ana-thábhachtach iseadh í, agus sí sin ceist an airgid.Ní foláir dúinn cuid mhór airgid d'fháil chun na h-oibre seo go léir. Tá iasacht mhilliúin púnt uainn, agus táimíd réidh anois ar éileamh do chur amach, ar cheathramha mhilliúin chun na nÉireannach sa bhaile, agus ar cheathramha milliúin eile chun na nGaedheal thar lear.</P>
    <P>Tá an sgéim dá réidhteach againn i slíghe is go bhfaighid na daoine bochta bheith páirteach ann chómh maith leis na daoinibh go bhfuil mórán airgid acu.</P>
    <P>Our first duty as the elected Government of the Irish People will be to make clear to the world the position in which Ireland now stands.</P>
    <P>There is in Ireland at this moment only one lawful authority, and that authority is the elected Government of the Irish Republic.  Of the other power claiming authority we can say, adapting the words of Cardinal Mercier:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>The authority of that power is no lawful authority.  Therefore in soul and conscience the Irish people owe that authority neither respect nor attachment, nor obedience.  The sole authority in this country is the authority of the elected representatives of the Irish Nation.  This authority alone has the rights to our affection and to our submission. ...The acts of the usurper have in themselves no authority, and such of those acts as affect the general interests and to which we may give ratification will have authority only in virtue of such ratification which alone gives them juridic value.</i>
    </P>
    <P>...<i>Towards the persons of those who hold dominion among us by military force we shall conduct ourselves with all needful forbearance.  We shall observe the rules they have laid upon us so long as those rules do not violate our personal liberty, nor our consciences, nor our duty to our country.</i></P>
    <P>Our attitude towards the powers that maintain themselves here against the expressed will of the people shall then, in a word, be this: We shall conduct ourselves towards them in such a way as will make it clear to the world that we acknowledge no right of theirs. Such use of their laws as we shall make will be dictated solely by necessity, and only in so far as we deem them for the public good.</P>
    <P>In order to secure for our own <i>de jure</i> government, and for the Irish Republic which the Irish people have willed to set up, the necessary international recognition, we shall send at once our accredited representatives to Paris to the Peace Conference and to the League of Nations.  We shall give them all necessary authority, and that they may proceed there in a manner befitting their character as the representatives of a nation, we shall apply for the necessary safe conduct to enable them to pass through the naval and military cordons with which the power in occupation of our country has surrounded us.</P>
    <P>We shall send also to other countries a number of duly accredited ambassadors and consuls to see that the position of Ireland is understood as it truly is, and not as English propaganda would represent it, and in general to see that the interests of Ireland in these countries are in no way neglected.  We shall thus resume that intercourse with other peoples which befits us as a separate nation, that intercourse which it has been the chief aim of English statescraft to cut off and which indeed English power has succeeded in cutting off for over a century.</P>
    <P>At the present time of general world-reconstruction it is most important that the material interests of this country at home be also looked after, and by Irishmen.  It will be the duty of our Ministry to secure the co-operation and to co-ordinate the activities of the various bodies which have taken voluntarily to themselves the safeguarding and advancement of these interests. Towards English legislation interfering with these interests we shall act in accordance with the general principles I have already indicated, that is, we shall act as we think best for the general good.</P>
    <P>To measures such as the English <Col N="47" /> Ways and Communications Bill, designed, as regards Ireland, to prevent Irishmen from using the natural resources of their own country to benefit their own nation, handing over on set purpose to an English bureau complete control of the communications of this country, so that they may be used solely in the interests of England&mdash;to such measures we shall offer all the resistance we can command as being both injurious and unjust.  It will be the especial duty of our Director of Trade to examine, in co-operation with public bodies, how best to make our resistance effective.</P>
    <P>The Ministers and Directors at the heads of the other departments&mdash; Labour, Industries, Agriculture, Local Government&mdash;will similarly be charged with seeking co-operation with all interested in their departments.  The Minister of National Defence is, of course, in close association with the voluntary military forces which are the foundation of the National Army.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the work of our Government cannot be carried on without funds.  The Minister of Finance is accordingly preparing a prospectus, which will be shortly published, for the issue of a loan of one million sterling &mdash;£500,000 to be offered to the public for immediate subscription, £250,000 at home and £250,000 abroad, in bonds of such amounts as to meet the needs of the small subscriber.</P>
    <P>I think that what I have said is a fair outline of our programme as it stands at present.  An outline is all we are prepared to give, and so I have not attempted to go into details.  The working out of the details will be the immediate concern of individual Ministers and of the Cabinet as a whole. When they are ready we shall bring them formally before you for your approval and sanction.</P>
    <P>In asking the Dáil to approve of our programme as I have stated it, I feel that I need not remind you how short the term is that the present Ministry has been in office nor how our best energies are being absorbed with the international situation of the moment.</P>

      <P>(Teachta Chuan na Mara) - A Chinn Chómhairle agus a lucht na Dála, is mian liom a thairiscint don Dáil go nglacfar leis an bhFaisnéis seo do chuir an Príomh-Aire os ár gcomhair, agus sílim gur cóirglacadh leis gan mórán do rádh 'na thaobh. </P>
      <P>Tá an Riaghaltas nuadh so againn ag dul I bhfeidhil gnótha na tíre go dúthrachtach, chun rath agus séan do chur ar an dtír airís agus is cóir don Dáil agus don tír ar fad seasamh go dlúth taobh thiar don Aireacht I gcoinnibh an namhaid. Mar dubhairt an Príomh-Aire, seasann an Aireacht ar son an chirt, agus ba h@Oir chóir do chuile dhuine againn bheith sásta @''asta dualgas do thabhairt don Aireacht.</P>
      <P>Mhínigh an Príomh-Aire gnóthaí na tíre thar lear agus sa bhaile. Nuair a chruadhan an tslat is deacair í do chama, agus séard atá uainn, ná go bhfeicfeam briseadh, agus fán, agus réaba, meath, éag, agus sgaipe, ortha-san a bhí cionntach le sgaipe agus fán do chur ar Ghaedhealaibh.</P>
      <P>Ba chóir dúinn bheith ana-bhuidheach go bhfuil Riaghaltas againn féin. Tá sé 'na chrann mhór áluinn agus tá sé de dhualgas orainn seasamh leis an Riaghaltas nuadh so againn. Níl sé abhfad ar bun acht tá mórán dá dhéanamh aige. Ar an adhbhar san tá súil agam go nglacfar le tuarascbháil an Phrímh-Airigh.</P>

Is mó rud tábhachtach ráidhte ag an bPríomh-Aire agus ní nach iongnadh tá uaidh dualgas agus congnamh ó'n nDáil chun iad do chur I bhfeidhm. </P>
      <P>Geobhfar san mar is Riaghaltas dleaghthach atá dá chur I bhfeidhm Riaghaltas atá ar thoil mhuinntir na hÉireann. Ní Riaghaltas úghdarásach é do réir dlighe na nGall acht is cuma san dúinne, agus do mhuinntir na h-Éireann, agus do lucht na h-Éireann I gcéin chomh maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an lá imthighthe go brách nuair a gheobhadh aon dream láidir dlighe do chur I bhfeidhm I n-aimhdheóin na ndaoine laga. Tuigean na h-Éireannaigh sa bhaile agus thar lear é sin, agus tuigean <Col N="48" /> siad leis go bhfuil san I n-aigne gach dreama atá fé smacht ar fuid an domhain fé láthair. </P>
    <P>Níl éinní chomh láidir le toil na ndaoine; tá san againn sa Riasghaltas seo againne agus tá súil againn ná beidh aon mhearathal oraiinn á chur san I  n-iúil.</P>
    <P>Rud eile anois. Ceist an airgid. Rud ana-thábhachtach iseadh ceist an airgid agus deallruighean sé go bhfuil mórán de ag teastabháil ó'n Aireacht chun na gnóthaidhe seo atá ar a n-aigne aca do chur I bhfeidhm. Caithfidh muinntir na hÉireann cuidiúgha leis an Riaghaltas san rud sin chómh maith leis na rudaíbh eile.</P>
    <P>Deirtear linin go bhfuil toscaireacht ceapuighthe le dul ag triall ar Chúirt na Síothchána, má's fiú san do ghlaodhach air, agus measaim go gcuirfidh cómhacht na nGaedheal iachall ortha dlighthe macánta do chur ar bun sa chúirt sin.</P>

      <P>(Teachta ó Chathair Chorcaighe): - A Chinn Chomhairle agus a Uaisle, neosaidh mé scéal díbh. Scéal fíor iseadh é. D'innis bean riaghalta I gClochar na Trócaire I gCionn tSáile dhom é . Tráth éigin anuraidh do chuaidh sagart isteach I scoileanna na mban riaghalta. Do thosnuigh sé ar cheisteanna a chur I dtaobh seanachuis na hÉireann ar ghearrachaile sa cheathramha ranng sa scoil. "-Ar airighis trácht riamh an Bhrian Bhóirimhe?" do cheistigh an sagart. "D'airigheas athair, " arsan cailín beag. "Agus cad a dhein sé ar son na hÉireann?" arsan sagart. "Dhein sé troid I gcath Chluain Tairbh sa bhliadhain míle agus a ceathair déag," ar sise. "Cé fuair an buadh?" arsan sagart. "Fuair na hÉireannaigh an buadh athair," arsan cailín. "Go maith," arsan sagart. "Agus ar airighis trácht riamh ar Éamon de Bhaléra?" "D'airígheas athair, " arsan cailín, "do dhein seisean troid ar son na hÉireann I gcath Bhaile Átha Cliath sa bhliadhain míle naoi gcéad agus a sé déag." "Cé fuair an buadh ann?" arsan sagart. Do stad an cailín ar feadh tamaill. Níor mhaith léi a rádh nár bhuaidh na hÉireannaigh. Do las a haghaidh sa deire.  "Níl deire leis an dtroid fós athair," ar sise. "Agus a ndeirean tú liom," arsan sagart, "go bhfuil De Bhaléra ag troid fós." "Tá," arsan cailín, "tá sé ag troid ar son na hÉireann thall I bpríosún I Sasana." </P>
      <P>Bhí an ceart ag an gcailín úd. Níl deire leis an dtroid fós, a bhuidhe le Dia, tá De Bhaléra agus a chómhphríosúnaigh 'nár measc arís chun troda a dhéanamh ar son na hÉireann anso I nÉirinn fós.</P>
      <P>Níl aon dabht ná gur chuir óráid ár dtaoisigh áthas agus bród orainn go léir. Is cuimhin liomsa go maith nuair a thosnuigheamair ar obair Shinn Féin fiche bliadhain ó shin - bhí cuid againn an-óg an uair úd - go mbíodh súil againn go dtiocfadh taoiseach mór éigin a threóróch sinn ar bhóthar na saoirseachta. Níor chuireas féin aithne ar Éamon de Bhaléra go dtí aimsir an toghadh in Oirthear Chláir, acht ó sin I leith Is minic minic a dubhart liom féin - - sin é taoiseach na nGaedhal, siné an an taoiseach go rabhamair ag brath ar a theacht, sin é an taoiseach a thuigean anam na nGaedhal, an duine a bhfuil an éirim aigne aige I dtreo is go mbailigthean sé smaointe na nGaedhal isteach in a aigne féin agus go bhfuil 'na chumas aige na smaointe sin a nochtadh go beacht agus go soiléir ós comhair an domhain. Go mbuainigheidh Dia é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá náimhde na nGaedhal ag obair go fíochmhar indiu. Gach aon cham-chleas a bhí acu riamh tá sé á imirt acu indiu. Táid a' déanamh a ndíchill chun muinntir na hÉireann a choimeád fé chois agus chun a thaisbeáint do'n tsaoghal mór gur dream gan chiall, gan tuigsint, gan charthannacht, gan ghrádh Dé ná ghrásta Dé muintir na hÉireann. Táid na seana-chlis á n-imirt ages na Sacsanaigh fé láthair. Aon dream daoine ar thalamh an domhain atá i gcoinnibh Shasana, daoine gan chiall, gan tuiscint iseadh iad dar leis na Sasanaigh.Na Spáinnigh, na Franncaigh, na Búraigh san Aifric theas, na hAmericánaigh, na Rúiseánaigh, na h-Almánaigh, nuair a bhíodar a' troid I gcoinnibh na Sasanach, nuair a bhí aon iarracht acu á dhéanamh chun cosc a chur le réim Sheáin Bhuidhe ar fuid an domhain, daoine gan chiall gan tuiscint, gan léighean, gan chreideamh, san síbhialtacht, daoine barbardha, <Col N="49" /> fiadhaine, uathbhásacha a b'eadh iad, dar leis na Sasanaigh. Acht daoine breághtha macánta tuiscionacha a b'eadh iad nuair a thógadar páirt le Seán I gcogadh. Acht tá seana-fhuath istigh I gcroidhe Sheáin do Ghaedhlaibh mar is iad na Gaedhil an dream is treise I gcoinnibh a réim leis na céadtaibh bliadhan. Do cheil sé an seana-fhuath I dtosach an chogaidh mhóir. Bhí cleas le h-imirt aige. Bhí Éire 'na h-aon bhall geal. Do theastuigh congnamh na nGaedhal uaidh. Tháinig Asquith anso agus do mhol sé sinn. Do labhair sé go breágh bog réidh linn. Chuir sé dalladh púicín ar chuid d'ár muintir-ne. Seana-chleas a b'eadh é. Do theip ar an gcleas san sinn a mhealladh. Tá Éire na ball dubh dorcha aige Seán indiu. Acht tá sí go geal, go breágh, go hiongantach, go haoibhneach ag na Gaedhlaibh. Tá clis eile á n-imirt aige Seán fé láthair. Tá an lámh láidir aige I nÉirinn féin agus na breaga á n-insint thar lear 'nár leith aige. Do theip air sinn a mhealladh leis a bplámás. Tá ag teip air sinn a bréagnú thar lear.

Tuigean siad cad tá a' teasdáil uainin - saor-stát a bheith againn I nÉirinn agus gan bheith ceangailte le Sasana ná le himpireacht Shasana. Tuigean ár muintir féin I nAmerica, I nAstralia, I dTír an Airgid, ins gach aon bhall ar fuid a'domhain in a bhfuil na hÉireannaigh cad tá ag teasdáil uainn anois. Tuigean na Francaigh agus na Spáininigh agus na Rúiseánaigh agus na náisiúin eile cad tá ag teasdáil ó mhuinntir na hÉireann. Tá a' teip ar Sheán Bhuidhe sinn a bhréagnú thar lear indiu.

Tá cuid d'ár muintir-ne fós a féachaint anonn ar an bPárliméad I Lúndain. Táimíd ag iarraidh ortha gan bheith ag féachaint anonn ansúd a thuille. Táimíd ag iarraidh ortha cabhrú linn-ne sa tír seo, cabhrú linn chun an chirt a chur I bhfeidhm I nÉirinn agus troid a dhéanamh I gcoinnibh an nirt anso I nÉirinn féin. Táimíd ag iarraidh ortha bheith dílis do'n Dáil I dtreo is go gcuirfimís Saor-Stát ag obair anso I nÉirinn gan mhoill. Táimíd ag iarraidh ar mhuintir na hÉireann a dtoil do neartú, a gcroidhe d'árdú, agus an chómhacht a ghlacadh in a lámhaibh féin fé stiúrú na Dála so I dtreo is go ndéanfaimís ár ndícheal chun saoghail mhaith a bhaint amach do gach duine sa tír seo agus go mbrisfimís cómhacht na nGall - an chomhacht atá d'ár milleadh agus d'ár gcéasadh leis na céadtaibh bliadhan.</P>

      <P>(Teachta Oirthir Chiarruidhe): - A Chinn Chómhairle agus a lucht na Dála, tá árd-áthas orainn go léir gur labhair an Príomh-Aire linn mar a labhair sé. An rud ba thábhachtaighe ar ar thrácht sé 'na fhaisnéis, ná Cúirt na Síothchána, dubhairt sé rud a shásóchadh an uile dhuine go mbeadh fonn na saoirse air. </P>
      <P>Tá an Aireacht, agus an Dáil ar fad, dáiríribh, agus fonn oibre ortha acht tá ana-chuid oibre rómhainn amach, ana-chuid ar fad le déanamh.</P>
      <P>Bhí súil ag cuid againn go gcloisfimís níos mó I dtaobh ceisteanna tábhachtacha eile ó'n bPríomh-Aire, ní maith liom-sa aon locht d'fhagháil ar fhocal an Phríomh-Airigh, acht ar son go leanaimíd an Aireacht agus go ngéillimíd dó, támíd freagarthach do na daoinetáimíd freagarthach do na daoine, agus don tír, agus an lá ná beidh an Dáil dílis don Aireacht ní eireóchaidh leis an Aireacht.</P>
      <P>An fhaid is a leanfaimíd do réir toil na ndaoine ní bheidh baoghal orainn. Tá Aireacht againn anois go bhfuil iontaoibh againn asta, agus atá I bhfonn chun na hoibre. Tuigid go bhfuil freagarthach, acht beidh orainne fanacht ortha mar sin féin, mar beidh muinntir na hÉireann ar fad ag faire ortha go géar. Toghadh sinne I gcóir Dáil Éireann agus gach duine go bfhuil po   úghdharásach aige, beidh air gan éinní do cheilt orain.</P>
      <P>Ní theastuigheann ó'n Aireacht éinní do cheilt, nílid acht ag tosnugha, caithfidh siad feuchaint rómpa go bhfeicfidh siad an bóthar rómpa, agus tá súil againn go mbeidh siad aireach I gcónuidhe agus ullamh chun tairbhe do bhaint as gach aon ócáid, agus má thuigean siad an chómhacht atá acu ní bheidh aon bhaoghal orainn.</P>
      <P>B'oth liom nár dhein an Príomh-Aire níos mó tagairt do mhionrudaí, bhí faisnéis beagáinín neamh-chruinn I mo thuairimse acht go h-áirighthe. Tá rudaí go bhfuilim ag tagairt dóibh á sgrúdugha acu san Aireacht is dar liom, acht ba mhaith liom go ndeunfai tagairt dóibh.</P>
      <P>Do dhein an Príomh-Aire dian mhachnamh ar cheist an Oideachais is dar liom, agus beidh an obair sin fé stiúrugha aige. Ceist ana-thábhachtach iseadh an cheist sin bun-phréamh ár náisiúntachta mar deurfá- an fhaid is atá sé fé stiúrugha ag na Sasanaigh d'imrigheadh cos ar bolg, agus lámh láidir ar ár n-anamnachaibh, agus ar ár n-aigne.

    <P>I dtaobh na teangan, deirtear liom ná fuil baoghal uirthi; tá furmhór na dTeachtaí anso go cliste sa Ghaedhilge is ar éigin atá éinne aca ná fuil a bheag nó a mhór de'n Ghaedhilg aige acht mar sin féin, nílim-se sásta ná <Col N="51" /> fuil aon bhaoghal uirthi, agus caithfimíd-ne ár gcroidhe dícheall do dhéanamh ar eagla go ndéanfaidhe faillighe uirthi.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir an Ghaedhilg do chur ar cáirde, agus caithfeam féachaint chuige go bhfaighidh sí cothrom na féinne, agus gheobham san do dhéanamh gan a lán dá duadh d'fhághail. Tá fhios agam ná déanfaidh an Príomh-Aire faillighe uirthi. Aireacht dhá-theangthach agus Dáil dhá-theangthach atá againn agus ba chóir go bhfaigheadh sí ceart agus cothrom ó chách.</P>
    <P>Maidir le feabhasú saoghail an lucht oibre, ghlacamar go fonnamhar agus d'aon toil leis an gclár oibre is tairbhidhe a cuireadh ar bun I n-aon tír ar domhan, agus nuair a cuireadh os comhair na Comhdhála I mBern é bhí iongnadh an domhain ortha so a léigh é, agus thuigeadar ansan cad é an sort Riaghaltais a bhí  againn I nÉirinn anso.</P>
    <P>Rud ana-thábhachtach iseadh é gur chuir Riaghaltas Shasana cosg le n-a fhoillsiú, bhí eagla ortha é sgaoileadh os comhair an tsaoghail; taisbeánan san nach gádh do'n Phríomh-Aire mórán do rádh 'na thaobh, agus sásóchaidh an clár san -- an clár poblacánach san - - an lucht oibre.</P>
    <P>Anois I dtaobh Óglaigh na hÉireann. Ní móide gur misde tagairt do dhéanamh dóibh, agus is dócha go ndéanfaidh an tAire a labharfaidh ar ball an tagairt sin. Isiad Arm na hÉireann iad, agus má bhíonn siad fé smacht ag an Riaghaltas ní foláir nó beidh ortha bheith dílis do'n Aireacht.</P>
    <P>Dubhradh leis na Beilgigh go bhfaighdís foidhneamh leis an Arm Iasachta an fhaid is ná beidhfí ag cur isteach ar a n-anamnachaibh. Is féidir linne bheith ró-fhoidhneach. Tá ana-ionntaoibh againn as an Aireacht, agus tá súil agam ná beidh siad ró-fhoidhneach, ró-fhullaingeach leis an Arm Gallda tá anso 'nár measg.</P>
    <P>Díolfaidh siad so fós as ár ndaoine do chur chun báis. Caithfear pionós do chur ar an bhfealltóir, agus beidh ughdarás agus dualgas ó'n Dáil ag na hAirigh chun toil na hAireachta do chur I bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Is dócha gur ghearr an Príomh-Aire an gad ba ghiorra do'n sgórnaigh ar dtúis, acht tá súil agam go gcuirfear I gcoinnibh comhacht an ghléis Ghallda agus an Airm Ghallda. Deirim arís go bhfuilimíd go hana-mhuinghineach as an Aireacht.</P>

Tuigid siad cad tá uatha agus cad is ceart dóibh a fhághail níos fearr ná mar a thuigeadar ariamh. Táid níos daingne chun a gceart féin do bhaint amach ná mar bhíodar ariamh.

    <P>The following is the message we propose to send to our kindred overseas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To all the Irish race and to all our kindred dispersed in other lands we send our greeting.  From Dáil Eireann to-day, assembled in the City of Dublin, we send you tidings that the people of Ireland are marching on the road of freedom, that &lsquo;we have taken the highway, let others think it good or bad.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That close friendship which has ever been between Ireland and her children that are separated from her we desire to strengthen and confirm. We desire to bind fast the love, partnership and comradeship between you and ourselves so that we may work together to place Ireland in high degree and to earn for her all good and prosperity that is hers by natural right, with the help of God.  &lsquo;May right and freedom flourish, may wrong and bondage perish in every land of the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Messages had been sent abroad before, but, so long as they were concerned with proposals like Home Rule they failed to open the heart of the Irish Race, but there is not a child of the tenderest years that cannot under stand what is meant by what the Dáil stands for&mdash;complete national freedom. Freedom needed no explanation.  There was no need to announce that things done under freedom are better done than in any other way.  Hence the present message would be understood by every Irish mind.  The message, however, was not one appealing for help. They in Ireland had done much of late without any help from outside the shores of Ireland.  But if help be sent they would be grateful.  They did not ask alms, but they believed that the Irish abroad would be all the more eager to assist them when they saw those at home earnest, and loyal, and determined.</P>
    <P>Hence the Dáil look to the Irish abroad to make themselves partakers in the work of freedom.</P>
    <P>The plans which the Dáil had made would be carried out in a spirit of high national dignity, and so would they arouse the heart of the Irish people overseas.  The spirit of freedom was now rising throughout the world, and the only land in which the ideal of liberty appears not to be progressing was that land which sought to maintain Ireland in bondage.</P>
    <P>It should be their part to welcome the rise of freedom and to hold out their hands to all who stood by liberty&mdash; particularly their own people &mdash; in foreign lands.</P>
    <P>A programme of social reform and reconstruction that not long ago might be looked upon as revolutionary, but must now be regarded as practical and moderate, has been recently issued on behalf of the American Bishops and is destined to have enormous influence in evolving a new social order.  Amongst the declarations included in that manifesto were the following:&mdash;&ldquo;That no woman should retain any occupation which was harmful to her health or morals; that if employed they should receive the same pay as men for equal work; that there was no reason why workers should not have more than a living wage if industry could support it; that bad housing should be abolished by the State; unjust manipulation with unnecessary middlemen should be suppressed by law; the curse of incessant profiteering should be frozen out by co-operative enterprise; that until the worker has been made self-supporting insurance against unemployment and <Col N="55" /> old age should be provided by a levy on industry supplemented by the State when necessary; that there should be vocational training for the young, but not to the detriment of a measure of liberal education.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle agus a lucht na Dála, This is a solemn and joyous occasion, and I regret not being qualified to address you in our native language.  It is, I repeat, at once, a joyous and solemn thing to send forth this greeting to our kindred beyond the seas.  We do honour to ourselves as well as to our kindred.  If at any time in the past our kindred abroad had misunderstood us it was because those who spoke in the name of Ireland did not utter the true note.  Had we met in this City and in this Hall to send forth a lower note, to demand &ldquo;Home Rule,&rdquo; or some amelioration of bondage; had we sent forth a greeting in that tone, we might have deserved, and we would have received the scorn of our kindred abroad. It is because we aim high that our race, wherever scattered, understand us perfectly&mdash;we, the children of a foregathered race which has acted highly, which distinguished itself in Europe for a long period before any of the older nations now being revived were heard of; before their people had entered Europe at all; long centuries before any of the new states now being set up were heard of.  This motion enables one, I believe, to call attention to certain requirements of the moment.  From all we hear in this country we have had means of estimating the magnitude of the power of evil arraved against us to-day in Paris.  We have to realise the magnitude of that power, the wide reach of its efforts, the stupendous resources <Col N="56" /> at its disposal in misrepresenting and slandering us before the world to-day.  We have to realise the magnitude of the powers opposed to us there in order that we may realise to some extent at least what our duty is whenever there is an opportunity of advancing President Wilson's principles before the nations of the world.  We owe a debt to our kindred in America, as has been said, but also to our kindred in Canada, South Africa, and, I would say, almost above all, to our kindred in Australia who were among the first to come to our succour during the weeks and months in which so many at home and abroad were stunned by Maxwellism in this city.</P>
      <P>To that branch of our race we owe a special debt of gratitude, and we owe it to ourselves, to the circumstances and the cause we are here promoting, and not only that, but to the cause of human liberty in general to present the case of Ireland on this memorable occasion in a manner worthy of our antiquity, worthy of our record, worthy of our unquenchable spirit, our dignity, and our fidelity to our cause.</P>
      <P>There are resources which the enemy is to-day employing to the detriment of our nation.  Our duty to-day is to see that our representatives in Paris are sustained and that their hands are strengthened.</P>
      <P>Some of the young nations are sending strong staffs to flood foreign countries with their propagandist literature and present every aspect of their case in regard to freedom.  The sooner Ireland's case is put in a similar way the better.  It is a task which may well frighten us in view of the almost inexhaustible resources by which the enemy opposes us.</P>
      <P>We have excellent representatives in Paris.  They are not, however, in a position of equality with those opposed to them, and it is the duty&mdash;the urgent and important duty&mdash;for them to get on a position of equality with those with whom they have to contend.  The reconstruction of States, the revision of old States, and the foundation of new ones deserve that our representatives have full equality in the struggle for the right and justice of the noblest State of them all.</P>
      <P>In the struggle for right, none of these States have undergone anything equal to Ireland in the intensity of the persecutions they have suffered; none of them have borne with such atrocities by an outside power not have been slandered in the same degree.  But, in the reconstruction of Europe, when Empires are being overtaken by the justice of God and show signs of their falling asunder, there is afforded a great opportunity which is not going to recut and of which this Dáil is going to avail to the utmost and at once.  Our policy is, first, a self-reliant dash for freedom, and it is going to be one of the utmost speed consistent with efficiency and permanency. We will choose our own time and our own methods to embarrass the enemy before the nations.  While the enemy is issuing false statements regarding us we must in justice to ourselves circulate the truth with regard to our position and with regard to the atrocities perpetrated in this land of ours, and challenge our opponents and challenge the free opinion of Europe to test our assertions.  We are cruelly handicapped by the vigilant censorship of the Press carried on by our enemy. To take a single example.  In yesterday's daily papers you will find on one page the statement of an English Cabinet Minister that there is no other way to rule this country but by force.  On the same paper you will find that white gloves have been presented to the Judges on the Bench, there being no crime to bring before them.  This is a significant fact.  It is a fact to be put before President Wilson as showing how the people of the most peaceful country in Europe cannot be governed by England because it is peaceful.  It is a declaration before the world by an English Judge on the Pench that Ireland is a crimeless land and yet they are unable to govern it.  Yes; unable they will ever be to humble us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we ask and what we need the support of our kindred in claiming is justice to ourselves and justice to all <Col N="57" /> oppressed peoples.  We want nothing more or less than liberty, the right to rule ourselves.</P>
    <P>It would be a negation of principle and of justice if a crimeless nation like ours is not entitled to the independence now being conferred on smaller and less important nations.  Any statesman in Paris or elsewhere with the experience of our nation under foreign rule before him who imagines that Irealnd can or ought to rest in peaceful acquiescence in that rule, is an enemy of peace and justice and a curse to himself and others.  The spirit that glows in Ireland to-day is due to the knowledge that we have not the smallest intention of making an unworthy claim or submitting to less than justice.</P>
    <P>We are no new people, but heirs of a nation long and glorious in Ireland; and it is because we aim at the recovery of our independence in circumstances very different from those of the past, when our country was made a thing of traffic by the enemy; it is because we aim at refusing to barter the right of our race to live in peace and harmony with neighbouring States that we are filled with a firm purpose and that our kindred are with us to-day heart and soul; and it is because our claim is in every respect&mdash;morally, intellectually, logically&mdash;so strong that we have cut the painter with the foe and from this time onward we shall treat this land as ours and nobody else's; and the people of this country are going to support this Dáil in this attitude, whatever may be done at the peace conference.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to speak of President Wilson and the nation he represents with any doubt or disrespect, But if we come through this crisis it will be by the strength and determination of our purpose.</P>

      <P>(Ce. Liathdroma): - A Chinn Chomairle , cuidighim leis an rún so.</P>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with this message because we all feel how a great number of our kindred left Ireland more or less like &ldquo;a corpse on the dissecting table,&rdquo; and we can realise how they felt when they saw Ireland standing erect and wishing to take her own place with the other States of the world.  By the deliberate act of the Irish people the Dáil is in being.  We are assembled here speaking on behalf of the Irish people; we send them a message of hope; we tell them we mean to abide by the principles that henceforth are going to be the rule of nations. We know that the suspense of our kindred in foreign countries has been a great suspense so far, and that it will please them to know that we are continuing the fight until we have realized the object for which we have set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>COUNT PLUNKETT (Roscomáin Thuaidh):&mdash;I have to bring before the meeting of the Dáil a telegram from a very unexpected source.  It is from Sydney, and it is addressed to Mr. De Valera.  &ldquo;The following resolution was proposed by Corporal Kenny, V.C., and seconded by Private Leary.  V.C., and carried unanimously:&mdash;&lsquo;That this meeting of citizens, representative of Irish-Australian sentiment in New South Wales, <Col N="58" /> express the strongest desire to have the principle of self-determination applied to Ireland.&rsquo;&rdquo;  That cable is signed by Archbishop Kelly.</P>
    <P>Now, the message which it is proposed to address to the Irish abroad must be received with more than mere approval by the Ministry.  It is our business to keep in touch with the scattered Irish people wherever they are: and it is hard to discover the country in which they are not.  I travelled about ten thousand miles in the United States of America, and everywhere I went, from New York to San Francisco, from Boston to the far South, when I met the Irish their first and last question to me always was: &ldquo;Is it the Time?&rdquo;  To-day we say to our own people scattered over all the world, &ldquo;It is the Time.&rdquo;  The hour has come when Ireland, no matter what the consequences may be, stands out in the firing line.  She declares that she will not fall from the high place that God created her for, that she claims nothing less and will accept nothing less than complete liberty.  And this meeting now calls on us to affirm this, in the name of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Now, I have said that the Irish were everywhere; and there was a time when they flung themselves right across the earth.  In the early ages they went forth in the name of God, because they believed that God called upon them to Christianise a pagan world; but afterwards they were flung out under conditions which are horrible to read.  There is no ancient history in Ireland; we feel to-day the pangs our fathers felt when they read of Ireland's ruthless treatment, of the fate of her children who became the exiles of the world.  How did this happen?  It is to Ireland's honour that she has always suffered for her ideals.  And the Irish, whatever their sufferings, always went out in the cause of civilisation.  However stricken they might be, they put their words and their swords at the disposal of other nations, for liberty's sake; and always in the hope that eventually their efforts would lead to the emancipation of Ireland herself.</P>
    <P>There is no fear for the future of Ireland, but our guarantee is not in the fact that the world recognises her power but that Ireland herself recognises it. This is the message that in your name we are giving to the Irish race scattered over the world.</P>
    <P>We do not merely say that we approve of the idea that Ireland shall be free. We say we are determined that Ireland shall be free.  We know that many conferences are being held, even in the name of liberty, to try to restore an older system of tyranny in Ireland. These plots against the light cannot succeed. We have learned enough to be able to say that if the League of Nations is going to be nothing better than the old League of Powers formed in Vienna and called the &ldquo;Holy Alliance,&rdquo; there will be a league of peoples to break it. In the long run the human race will realise that these evil things must be ended.  And it were strange if Ireland did not become again a torch-bearer when reactionary statesmen tried to befog and enslave the world.</P>
    <P>In the beginning of the war England tried to thrust the whole of Ireland into the fighting line.  She felt that the demand of the Irish people for independence was becoming embarrassing, and she concluded that an Ireland without defenders could never strike back. Then she considered that the right thing for her to do was to declare Ireland, in face of the world, a contented country. When this fiction was overturned by the facts of repression and resistance, a new campaign against us was ordered.</P>
    <P>I have been the recipient of a sheaf of papers from American in which every fact in regard to the history of Ireland was perverted and in which the character of the Irish people was generally maligned.  England secured in the United States a large number of agencies, by purchase, for the purpose of defaming Ireland.  Now those plans are coming to an end; the nations are becoming tired of this political pharisaism, and there is a slight relaxation of England's activity in misrepresenting Ireland.  She has carried out her campaign of vilification in Paris, but the French have not forgotten history altogether.  Her powers in America <Col N="59" /> seem to be ripe for judgment, since many of the papers that began by attacking us have come round and backed our cause.  We owe our comparative success to the instinctive decency of human kind, and to the relentless war carried on against evil by our people in the States.</P>
    <P>For a while after America went into the war there was very little liberty there.  The Irish citizen suffered for his political faith in the beginning; but now that the tide is turning, the importance of having the greater portion of America in favour of Irish liberty is being felt throughout the world.  In Paris, with the Peace Conference already in session, and the League of Nations being set up, it was necessary for us to have an agency to speak for Ireland to the assembled delegates.  Seán T. O Ceallaigh was sent out, and he has gathered around him a little group of men, authorised to put the case of Ireland not merely to France, but to all the other countries concerned for peace with liberty.  Of the work to be done in this connection, and the obstacles to be faced, the ordinary newspaper reader can form no idea.  However, we have won a footing in Paris, and Ireland is beginning to be heard in the world.  It is our own business to see that the work so begun will be brought to complete fruition.  For this we need an organisation in the Press, and outside the Press, that will secure our ends.  We are only at the beginning of the fight. We shall have to fight on by our present means, and other means, combining with our friends in America.  I do not say we should rely on extraneous aid alone. I believe firmly that such aid will be forthcoming.  But Ireland is our battle field, and now that we have won a moral victory in Ireland we must carry on a systematic war against the enemy, not in the field the enemy selects, but where we choose; not by exposing ourselves to danger, but by exposing the enemy to danger; not by flinging small armed numbers against England's massed strength, but by getting the whole Irish race to enter the field as an army determined to achieve the freedom of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Some weeks ago two children, one of them but 11 years old, disappeared from the custody of their parents in the County Tipperary.  One of these children was seized on its way back from school by the armed forces of the English Government.  Earlier on that day members of the same forces proceeded to the house of a woman named McGrath, where they seized her child, aged 8 years, and carried him to an outhouse where they kept him from 12 o'clock to 4.45 p.m.  There members of the R.I.C. placed their rifles against that child's breast and threatened to shoot him unless he told them where his father had driven to on a certain evening. One of them also threatened to run his pencil down the child's throat. The child was later returned to his mother in a state of collapse.  The other two children seized by the English militarist forces were brought to Dublin and imprisoned there.  Their parents were refused all knowledge of their whereabouts.  I have here a sworn statement made by T. Connors, the father of the child of 11 years, showing the fruitless efforts made by the father to ascertain the whereabouts of his child and the curt and evasive replies returned by the English authorities.</P>
      <P>Dáil Eireann has considered this matter of kidnapping of children, this new war phase of the usurping power in this country, and suggested certain measures, but we need not discuss them further for the moment.  On the day before yesterday the boy Hogan was released, and yesterday the little boy Connors was also surreptitiously released and sent back to his home in Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Turning to the question of the prisoners of war and their treatment, I desire to mention the engagement entered into between the Prison Authorities and the prisoners in Belfast Prison.</P>
    <P>The state of affairs in Belfast is as follows:&mdash;On January the 21st, the Republican Prisoners in Belfast Jail then numbering about 60, were informed that the amelioration and political status which had been won by the death of Thomas Ashe and various hunger strikes were withdrawn and that they were to be treated as criminals.  This aggressive action on the part of the prison authorities was unprovoked and was taken by the government of occupation with a view to avenging its defeat at Christmas, when the Most Rev. Dr. McRory and the Lord Mayor of Dublin were given guarantees that there should be no punishment of the prisoners for what had occurred.  For over twelve weeks the English Government have been endeavouring to break the Belfast Prisoners in health and spirit.  They are now confined to their cells during the complete round of 24 hours daily and are not allowed out except to the lavatory. They are without stools, tables, or bed-boards.  They are not allowed letters, visits, or newspapers.  All of them had spent considerable periods handcuffed night and day and had to sleep in their clothes.  For 11 weeks no prisoner was allowed to hear Mass. Last week men who spoke to neighbouring prisoners were dragged along the corridor by the hair.  If this kind of thing continues it is almost certain the lives of some of the men will be sacrificed. In Belfast Prison the position is that the attempt is still being made to treat Irish Political Prisoners there as criminals.  In Galway and other jails similar attempts are being made. Already eight men have had to be released on medical grounds and the health of all has suffered seriously.</P>
    <P>In Reading Jail there are two men of Irish blood who are both being harshly treated.  One is a resident of Argentina and the other a citizen of the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Turning to what has been described in other quarters as the criminal state of Ireland, there have been undoubtedly very grave crimes committed in Ireland during the last few years, but the organs of the foreign military occupation do not refer to these crimes or ask why the authors of them have not been denounced and justice done.  One of these organs referred recently to the fact that there had been three murders in Ireland and that no person had been brought to justice for them.  There have, however, been a great many more murders in the past few years and so far nobody has been brought to justice for them.</P>
    <P>On March 2nd, John Ryan died at Ennis, where he was shot by the police. J.M. Russell was bayonetted by English soldiers in the same county and no man was made amenable to law.  John Brown was killed by the police in Kerry. On the 7th. June P. Davis was shot dead at Castleblayney.  On the 25th. Abraham Allen was bayonetted to death in Cork.  D. Scanlon was shot dead in Ballybunion during a celebration of the return of Mr. de Valera for East Clare. The jury in this case brought in a verdict of wilful murder against Constable Lyons, but the English authorities refused to give the assassin up to justice, and have since promoted him to the rank of seageant in its military police force. Not a single person has ever been brought to justice in connection with the murders.  On the contrary, in two of the cases just mentioned the so-called police have been promoted for their service to those they have served so well. These are the cases that reveal the facts in regard to the crimes that have been committed on the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have here extracts from the observations made by some of the Judges appointed by the English military power in Ireland, and with regard to the attempt now being made to depict this country to the outside world as one in which crime in the ordinary sense is rampant these extracts show clearly that nothing is further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Judge Gibson at Wicklow Assize Court:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As far as the general state of the country was concerned, I am informed the general state of the country <Col N="61" /> was the usual pleasing experience of Judges of Assize, that it is in its ordinary peaceful and satisfactory condition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lord Chief Justice at Trim:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was gratifying to him on his first occasion as one of his Majesty's Judges going on Assize to congratulate them on the peaceful state of the county.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Judge Ross at Waterford:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was actually no return of any crime in connection with the city. It was a very gratifying circumstance, because one would expect in a city such as that, that crimes more or less aggravated would take place.  It was a great credit to the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Judge Madden at Fermanagh:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From the returns and information laid before me, I find nothing to suggest that the country is in anything but a satisfactory state.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These Judges, appointed by the foreign government in occupation to-day in Ireland, can find no crime to occupy their attention and they had in county after county to acknowledge the crimeless state of the country.  There are, however, the crimes that have been committed against the Irish people.  I have here a table showing the offences committed against the people by the occupying foreign power and the nature of the charges.  I have arranged this for comparison for the years 1917 and 1918:&mdash;</P>

    <P>These crimes and offences committed against the people of Ireland by the alien power in Ireland were practically confined to three charges:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  &mdash;Making speeches in public.</P>
    <P>2.  &mdash;Appearing in public in military formation.</P>
    <P>3.  &mdash;Having or issuing papers or documents which if published might cause &ldquo;disaffection&rdquo; to the usurping military power.</P>
    <P>These were the charges on which England found 973 criminals in Ireland during the course of the year 1918.</P>
    <P>On October 1st, 1918, a boy was sentenced to one month's imprisonment for carrying a Sinn Fein flag.  A week later a young man was sentenced to five months' imprisonment for &ldquo;being in the company of boys carrying a Sinn Fein flag.&rdquo;  On October 17th, a youth was sent to jail for one month for &ldquo;whistling derisively at the police.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Most of us here are acquainted with the case of Mr. Jack O'Sheehan, who was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for singing a song written more than 50 years ago.  Among those sentenced are women and young girls, and among the men in prison are men over 70 years of age.  This record is incomplete inasmuch as it was compiled for the Press under the English Press Censorship.</P>
    <P>We read during the course of the late war that it was waged for the freedom and in the interests of small nations. The example of the treatment of the political prisoners in Belfast forces the conviction that the objects secured by the winning of that war do not obtain in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I found recently in some of the continental papers particulars of the outrages committed on the Belgium people by Germany during the years 1917-1918. It was stated that a total of 860 Belgians had been tried by German-appointed courts and sentenced by military courts martial.  During the same period in Ireland the number of persons sentenced for political offences, including deportations, amounts to 1,357.</P>
    <P>The Executive proposes, with the sanction of the Dáil, to issue an authoritative statement of these cases and hand a copy of that statement to the representatives of all the civilised nations in Europe and the heads of the various churches, and also to take such steps as they may in connection with the treatment of our fellow countrymen in English prisons.  While we are doing all possible for our countrymen in prison everything is subordinate to the supreme <Col N="62" /> and paramount task of pressing forward the claim of our nation to freedom.  We must never lose sight of the fact that our first duty is the furtherance of the cause for which these men have gone to prison.</P>

      <P>I desire to move that the approval of the Dáil be given to the Ministerial Statement just read, and in rising to do so I should like to point out the urgent importance of some of the matters dealt with therein.  As regards the Republican prisoners, we must always remember that this country is at war with England and so we must in a sense regard them as necessary casualties in the great fight. But that consideration should not prevent us doing everything in our power to focus the attention of the people of Ireland and the people of all civilised countries on the shameful crime against the elemental principles of liberty and freedom that is being committed in this country by the continued imprisonment of these men under infamous conditions. There are some difficulties, such as the English Censorship, that is still maintained here, which prevent us placing before the people of other countries, as we would wish, the dark deeds done in this country against human and national freedom, but the Minister for Home Affairs in the statement just read has indicated some very practicable means of doing so.</P>
      <P>England's prison system, even under normal conditions, is very brutal and dehumanising&mdash;is admitted to be so even by her own social workers and reformers &mdash;and has no parallel in modern countries. Its workings here for the past few years show it to be especially brutal and dehumanising in its application to our Republican prisoners.  Having failed to break the undaunted spirit or shake the high courage of these men, it seems now to be England's fixed and deliberate policy to kill them or permanently shatter their health.  One would imagine she should be satisfied with the blood of Ashe and Coleman and McCann, but it looks as if her thirst were not yet satiated.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to realise the conditions under which our prisoners of war have been living for some time past&mdash;indeed to do so one must carry one's imagination back to the Middle Ages.  This is no exaggerated language.  I have been speaking to some of these prisoners and the accounts of their prison treatment I have heard from them reveal a state of things that is a disgrace to any civilised country&mdash;and it is only a sense of decency and a regard for the feelings of the members of the Dáil that prevent me from publicly retelling in detail here to-day the treatment being meted out to our imprisoned comrades by the country which poses before the world as the champion of the principles of liberty and freedom.</P>
      <P>The President of the Ministry told us at the morning session that we Irishmen owe no loyalty or fidelity to the usurpation masquerading as Government in this country.  Seven and a half centuries ago England established her authority here by brute force, and all through the seven hundred and fifty years has maintained it by brute force alone.  Her rule here has no moral or legal sanction&mdash; and if the young men of Ireland refuse to acknowledge it, or set out to overthrow the tyranny she has by such means established, it is against all the laws of right and justice to punish them by imprisonment or otherwise for engaging in such a splendid work.  Men who set out to overthrow such tyrannies are no criminals &mdash;on the contrary, the real criminals are the representatives in this country of that foreign government which has no fundamental right or title here.  And not only are they the real criminals&mdash; they are mean, unprincipled criminals as well.  A few months ago, as the members of the Dáil are aware, on this very question of our prisoners they broke a solemn compact entered into with a Bishop of the Catholic Church and the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  I leave the matter there and beg to move the approval of the Dáil to the Ministerial statement just submitted.</P>

      <P>Lest any deputy should not have understood my remarks in Irish, I would like to draw particular attention to the case of the Cork prisoners.  Of course the first point for us to realise is that England had no right to imprison these men at all for voicing a nation's demand.</P>
      <P>Some of their comrades, arrested on similar charges, were denied the status of political prisoners.  These men proceeded to break up prison property as a protest.  They were then confined to their cells.  Some of them suffered severely from this treatment.  They hoped to obtain some relief under the terms of the agreement come to by the Most Rev. Dr. McRory and the Lord Mayor of Dublin with the English authorities in Ireland.</P>
      <P>After a lapse of twelve weeks they are still in solitary confinement&mdash;all tables, bed-boards, stools, and even boots, having been removed.  Hence when they weary of pacing the narrow cells they have to lie on the cold floor.</P>
      <P>It was only last week that, as a result of this inhuman usage, one of their number&mdash;Moylan&mdash;had to be taken to the lunatic asylum.  Further continuance of this treatment must tell severely on the men's health.</P>
      <P>Facts such as these should, I suggest, be revealed to the world, especially to the scattered Irish race, so that the &ldquo;Prussianism&rdquo; practised here by a nation that pretends to stand for world liberty may be fully known to the nations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I beg to second the motion that the Ministerial Statement be accepted. This statement is an indictment of the enemy power that has usurped the lawful authority in our country.  This enemy has never changed his methods during all the centuries he has held us in his grip, and therefore we must not now be astonished that prisoners are being treated in the manner told to us, and told in very moderate language. Language would fail me were I to dwell on all the atrocities committed by this enemy of ours.  I will only speak now of those agents who do this evil work. And what shall I say of them?  They are Irishmen, with Irish blood in their veins.  They have foresworn the allegiance they owe to their own land, they have sworn allegiance to the enemy of their country, they have degraded their manhood, and, like lost souls who have sold themselves to the devil, they are eager to do the devil's work in Ireland. Those black-coated rascals who seek to terrorise the weak, the womankind and the widow, who break into peaceful country homes, and scatter the furniture and effects about, who behave in a most irritating and insulting manner, who hold up people on their own streets, and on the country roads with threats, shouting &ldquo;Hands up&rdquo;; who arrest men, and without the semblance of a charge keep them for days and sometimes <Col N="64" /> weeks in the unhealthy atmosphere of these police barrack cells, sometimes to be brought to a so-called trial by law, more frequently to be released because no charge could be formulated. They have sunk to the depths&mdash;the lowest and the meanest&mdash;in their treatment of those little children in Tipperary. That little child, eight years old, whose case has been mentioned, was so terrified by their cruel conduct, that his mother had to call in a doctor to treat him, and this doctor gave a certificate and also issued a warning to the D.I. that if any such conduct was again tried on this child he would probably lose his reason.  Again, the boy Connors, a child of 11 years, a delicate and nervous child&mdash;Why did they take him away?  They took him, as I believe, to frighten the father and mother, in the hope that they might tell them something that they had not the power of telling because they had no knowledge of the affair.  The police authorities hoped also that even though the boys had no evidence to give them, they might, by suggesting things, induce them in their terrified and excited condition to repeat words put into their mouths, so to speak.  What, then, can we do?  I think we can make it uncomfortable for this body of Irishmen who are so well looked after by our English enemy and who are so well paid for their &ldquo;loyalty.&rdquo; I think it should go out to the Irish people from An Dáil that those tools who allow themselves to be made use of for such deeds deserve to be ostracised completely and made to feel that there can be no place for them in the free Ireland of to-morrow.  And the Power that is responsible for such terrorism and encourages such offences against humanity, we can hold up to the world as a hypocrite and despot, whose claim to be the champion of the rights and liberties of weak nations is but a mockery and an insult to liberty.  We can wait and pray for the day of retribution, and when it comes may you and I be there to see it.</P>
    <P>THOMAS KELLY (St. Stephen's Green)&mdash;The new Government has assumed a very good spirit of nationality throughout our land.  If everything goes well with us we hope the present movement will lead to our redemption. This Dáil has now given us an Irish Government, and though I am at the back of the Government benches it must not be assumed that I am at the back of the Government, but I do think and believe that the whole heart of the nation goes out to the President and his Executive, and the heartfelt wish of all is that the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of patriotism may guide them in their councils and in their actions and guide our country to freedom.</P>
    <P>It has been said that when a lie is constantly repeated people come to believe it&mdash;that it is the truth.  The lie has been repeated for centuries that England is a Christian and civilised country, and the English people believe it. Yesterday our press said that a speaker at one of the election meetings stated that there were a good many reasons against the establishment of an Irish Republic.  He said there were four million reasons against such an establishment. At this very moment in British jails there are about 40 of our countrymen all of indomitable spirit and led by a man who is equal to the whole four million British.  They have for over twelve weeks been in solitary confinement, and they are not allowed the necessaries for human cleanliness.  These men have had to lie on their cell floors and their food has to be taken off the floor of the cell.  This is the class of treatment meted out by the power that boasts of her Christianity and civilisation, and still, with the resources that that power can command, she is unable to conquer these Irishmen.  What a magnificent spectacle it is to see Austin Stack standing out against them, and with God's providence he will win. Lecky says that there is not a more moving epoch in the history of all nations than when the whole people speak with the one voice.  So spoke the Irish people on last December.  Some of us have our faults, but it is our right to put our individual point of view and to use our determination in so far as our power lies to do our duty and live up to the promises of the people who gave us <Col N="65" /> their votes.  It is in that spirit I am now speaking.</P>
    <P>We must regard these men as brothers in suffering, and since I do not like that suffering should be inflicted on myself, I do not like to see it inflicted on my fellow-countrymen.  We stated on the opening day that we wished this country ruled by the principles of justice and equality for all, and we mean to do this by the Irish people, and in doing so I must mention that I am one who believes that Christ's Sermon on the Mount was the greatest deliverance ever made.  &ldquo;Liberty, equality, and justice to all&rdquo;; that is the motto that was declared here at the first opening day of the Dáil.  It is, I believe, the spirit that eventually will crown the President's deliberations and his Executive with complete success.</P>
    <P>JOSEPH MACDONAGH (Tipperary N.) &mdash;Mr. Chairman, it is with great regret that I must confess that I am not competent to address you in the Irish language.  The history of the Irish prisoners of war started in the year 1916. In that year the relations between Ireland and England started on a new footing, when England shot the men who had surrendered, and it would be well for us to keep in mind that as prisoners of war Pearse and his comrades lie in quicklime graves in Arbour Hill.  They lie there together, and over their dead bodies the English soldiers drill.  England cannot stand by that act.  She cannot stand by her act in having sent their colleagues to English jails.  Shortly after the release of the other men from Lewes Jail an order was sent forth and men were arrested for making speeches, for singing songs, all over the country, so that in Mountjoy Jail there were about forty Irish prisoners of war, and they demanded the rights of prisoners of war, because they realised there was a state of war existing between England and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The concessions won by the death of Thomas Ashe were afterwards taken away from the prisoners, and the prisoners were taken to Dundalk Jail. Under the Cat and Mouse Act the prisoners were again treated as criminals, and in Dundalk and Mountjoy the fight had to be started afresh, and after ten or eleven days' hunger strike they won the concessions for which Thomas Ashe died.  The police and the warders, from one hundred to two hundred strong, were brought in to enforce the criminal status on the Republican prisoners in Belfast Jail.  Some of the men were thrown down 24 iron steps of stairs. I saw the Chairman of the Kerry Co. Council get his tongue half cut through from a blow by a policeman.  His arm was almost wrenched off.  These men, in spite of what Mr. Bowe, the chief warder of Belfast, said, went to Holy Communion, 84 or 86 of them, with their hands handcuffed, and it was impossible for 48 of them to make the sign of the Cross.  I say that the evidence sworn in the Belfast inquiry was an infernal lie.  It is history now in Ireland that Austin Stack by his inflexible character won a great victory in December, 1918.  The prisoners got a promise that within three weeks they would be sent to an internment camp, but they are still being ill-treated by the warders and police.</P>
    <P>It is hard to realise that men are confined for a space of 12 months under such conditions and are subjected to such inhuman treatment, and it is one of the most urgent matters for the Dáil to consider carefully.</P>
    <P>I heard from one of the Visiting Justices that five men who escaped from their cells took refuge in a ledge under the roof in Mountjoy and for 55 minutes they were drenched with a hose until they fell down in an unconscious condition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the boy Connors he has been let out, but it is a disgraceful thing that he should be detained in order that he would swear something which might swear away the life of an Irishman.  England killed Coleman, and by it showed to the world that when England talks about the sanctity of covenants she talks with her tongue in her cheek.  Against her in that regard we can put up the case of the sixteen men shot in Easter Week and Coleman and McCann.  The fight should be carried <Col N="66" /> on outside as the men in Belfast Jail are determined to carry it on inside.</P>
    <P>EOIN MACNEILL (National University)&mdash;It is impossible for us to escape having our blood stirred at the recital of the details laid before us here to-day. While all that we have heard stirs the indignation, there is not a single one of us who is surprised.  There is nothing in it that surprises us.  We know that only for fear of the consequences such infamous things as have been detailed here to-day would be thrown into the shade.  We cannot allow our feelings of indignation to be uppermost in dealing with these matters when we come together in common council.  In our homes we give full voice to what we think.  The responsibility for these things rests on the heads of the rulers of England (and not on such vague abstracts as the English Government or the English State) from Lloyd George down to Maopherson and those others who are employed by them who are personally engaged in committing atrocities. They are the men we have to defeat.  I hope that any potentate who has been guilty of atrocities will be punished.  It will be a wholesome precedent.</P>
    <P>If they fix the precedent of bringing the ex-Kaiser to trial, we may yet have an opportunity of having other persons brought to the bar of international justice.  I have been watching the development of the English Government's policy.  That policy aims at making the police our masters in Ireland, and we often do not realise that with the single exception of Russia under the Government of the Czar there never was a country so police-governed as this country is.</P>
    <P>Now, it is the determination of the English Government at present, and it is not only their determination but their last resource, to make the police supreme in Ireland, and it is not to relieve our feelings that we have this discussion, but to defeat this infamous policy.  We can, and will, and must, defeat it, and to this end we must pledge ourselves, pledge our children, pledge our friends, and pledge our country on no account to submit in any shape or form or at any future time to be police-governed by the English Government.  The police in Ireland are a force of spies.  The police in Ireland are a force of traitors, and the police in Ireland are a force of perjurers.  I say these things, not that your feelings might be roused, but to convince you of the necessity that exists why you should take such measures as will make police government in this country by the enemy impossible.</P>
    <P>Some of the atrocities have been related to you.  I could relate many that have been covered over and concealed. At the outset of the conscription fight in Ireland we were led to think that some of the police were actually supporting the popular cause.  Many of them were going to the novena every evening to pray against conscription. We now know what the reason of that strange spiritual activity was, and we also know that Lord Curzon read out a long string of testimony supplied to him&mdash;notes that these men had written down in the House of God and sent on to Dublin Castle as information against their own clergy who were opposing conscription.</P>
    <P>It was boasted some time ago by an English Minister that the whole of Ireland was under the police microscope. The police have entered a number of houses in the County of Dublin, arrested young men, and sent them to penal servitude by false testimony.  No one is safe from them.  The same fate may befall any of your sons who stands by the cause of liberty.  It might be anyone's son who was taken away at the same place and time as the boys, the story of whose kidnapping has just been read out.</P>
    <P>Now, the English Government cannot defeat Ireland by a constitutional policy or by a military policy.  The military are there only for the purpose of making the present police force supreme in Ireland.  If you make up your mind the police policy will be beaten.  The supremacy of the police since the coming of the Irish Volunteers has disappeared, and so long as you have the Irish Volunteers in Ireland <Col N="67" /> it will be impossible for the enemy to make their police forces supreme.</P>
    <P>LAURENCE GINNELL (County West-meath)&mdash;The treatment of the police, and the kidnapping of little children has been linked up with the action of 1916, and I wish to bring to your notice an attempt which will further fill up the cup of England's iniquity.</P>
    <P>In 1907 the English Nation signed a convention to the effect that any men arrested with arms in their hands fighting for a public purpose who surrendered and laid down their arms should not be executed.  That is an important fact which should be brought under the notice of the Press in Paris, that England was a signatory to that pact.  Everyone knows that the men who went out in Easter Week and surrendered and were prisoners of war in England's hands were murdered according to English law.</P>

      <P>- A Chinn Chomhairle, bhí nótaí anso agam I dtaoibh na ceiste seo ar fad, acht anois tá an chuid is mó de na rudaí a bhí le rádh agam ráidhte. Is maith liom gur labhair Eóin Mac Néill I dtaoibh Mac Pherson. Is ar chúl na saighdiúirí, agus ar chúl na bpíléirí atá an Riaghaltas Gallda ag seasamh anois, agus ós rud é gur ceist í gur cóir dúinn sgaipeadh ar fuid an domhain, b'fhearra dhom Béarla do labhairt b'fhéidir. agus n cóir an úsáid atá aca dá   </P>
      <P>I rise to propose that members of the police forces acting in this country as part of the forces of the British occupation and as agents of the British Government be ostracised socially by the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is scarcely necessary to explain what is meant by this motion.  The people of Ireland ought not to fraternise, as they often do, with the forces which are the main instruments in keeping them in subjection.  It is not consistent with personal or with national dignity.  It is certainly not consistent with safety.  They are spies in our midst.  They are England's janissaries.  The knowledge of our sentiments and feelings and purposes, which they derive either from their own hearts, because they are of our race, or from intercourse amongst us, they put liberally at the disposal of the foreign usurper in order to undo us in our struggle against him.  They are the eyes and ears of the enemy.</P>
      <P>They are no ordinary civil force, as police are in other countries.  The R.I.C., unlike any other police force in the world, is a military body armed with rifle and bayonet and revolver as well as baton.  They are given full licence by their superiors to work their will upon an unarmed populace.  The more brutal the commands given them by their superiors the more they seem to revel in carrying them out&mdash;against their own flesh and blood, be it remembered!</P>
      <P>Their history is a continuity of brutal treason against their own people. From their very foundation they have been the mainstay of the privileged ascendancy and the great obstacle to every movement for social as well as national liberty.  I need not remind you of their record during the tithe and land wars or of their recent outrages at Ballybunion, for which not a man of them was punished.  Punishment by their British masters&mdash;not likely!  They are patted on the back, praised and encouraged.  The British minister, Macpherson, to whom they are most directly responsible, speaks of their wonderful fidelity&mdash;there have been no Curragh Mutinies in the R.I.C.&mdash;and promises that he and his Government will back them up with all their resources in everything they do and in every action they take.  Very well, they have undoubtedly merited the praise of their paymasters, but the Irish people have a duty to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Mr. Macpherson may incite the police, the Irish people, as an organised society, have a right to defend themselves.  The social ostracism which I propose, and which I ask you to sanction, is a first step in exercising that right.  These men must not be tolerated socially as if they were clean healthy members of our organised life. They must be shown and made feel how base are the functions they perform and how vile is the position they <Col N="68" /> occupy.  To shun them, to refuse to talk or have any social intercourse with them, or to treat them as equals, will give them vividly to understand how utterly the people of Ireland loathe both themselves and their calling, and may prevent young Irishmen from dishonouring both themselves and their country by entering that calling.</P>
    <P>We know how our comrades are being treated in the jails&mdash;in Belfast and Mountjoy and elsewhere.  We know their crime is simply that of loving their country, and of working to achieve her rightful freedom.  We know that it was the direct activities of the R.I.C. that put them in jail. We know that it was the police who tore them from their homes, leaving their families dependent; that it was the police evidence&mdash;open, unabashed perjury as it often was&mdash;that has condemned our comrades to the loss of personal liberty and to the physical and mental tortures they are being compelled to endure; that it was such evidence and such information that led to the deaths of Ashe, of Coleman, and of McCann, and knowing this, in our eyes the pay these men receive from their paymasters is little if at all better than blood money.  To freely associate with them is to prove false to those who are sacrificing themselves in the fight for National liberty.</P>
    <P>These are hard things I have said. The truth is very bitter sometimes. Hitherto, hoping for some change of heart, I have refrained from speaking about the police in the terms their conduct deserved.  I am even now, as you see, speaking without passion, but I feel that as regards our prisoners I have a personal obligation, for I know that I am responsible for stopping hunger strikes&mdash;I feared that there might be conscientious scruples at the end&mdash;and so I know that I am responsible that the men who are now manacled and tortured are not dead or else free long ago.</P>
    <P>England would have it that our question is for her a domestic one. Even if it were, the barbarities of her rule here would in themselves be ample grounds for the intervention of outside States.  What has happened since we came out of Lewes Jail has been no surprise to us.  The day after our arrival in Dublin we sent Dr. Mac Cartan as an envoy to the President of the United States asking that he would note the methods of repression that would be used by England against us in our attempt to have the American principles of Self-Determination and &ldquo;government of the people by the people&rdquo; applied to Ireland.  When he spoke of certain subject peoples saying, &ldquo;Those who suffer see.  Those people have called out to the world generation after generation for justice, liberation, and succour, and no cabinet in the world has heard them; no nation has said to the nations responsible,: &lsquo;You must stop this thing; it is intolerable and we will not permit it.&rsquo;&rdquo;  Perhaps he had not in mind that these words, like many other of his utterances, applied to Ireland with as much exactness as if they were purposely and deliberately designed with her case alone in view.  If he has not seen this already, now at any rate he can scarcely be unmindful of it.  But whether Ireland's cry for justice be attended to or not, there is one feature of our slavery we ourselves must endeavour to put an end to&mdash;this degrading police rule and the weak toleration that is but an inducement under the economic pressure to which our youth are subject to enter that detestable force and be trained in it to forget their nationality and their honour, and to become the ready tools of an unscrupulous foreign domination.</P>
    <P>Before I formally move the motion, as I have mentioned the name of Pierce McCann, I would ask the Members of the Dáil to stand up as a mark of our respect to the first man of our body to die for Ireland, and of our sympathy with his relatives.  We are sure that their sorrow is lightened by the fact that his death was for the cause for which he would have lived, and that his memory will ever be cherished in the hearts of the comrades who knew him, and will be honoured by <Col N="69" /> succeeding generations of his countrymen with that of the other martyrs of our holy cause.</P>
    <P>I now beg to move my motion, and I trust that if passed, the Irish people, no matter how hard it may prove sometimes, will, as they should, regard themselves bound to act strictly in accordance with its letter and spirit.</P>
    <P>EOIN MACNEILL (Derry City and National University)&mdash;I beg formally to second the motion.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The House adjourned.</P>
