<P>2.  BRIAN O HUIGIN (Clare, West): &ldquo;Are the Committees now being set up in each Constituency in connection with the Loan permitted to engage a special Organiser of Finance and pay his expenses out of the monies received?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE replied that the suggestion contained in the question had been considered by the Finance Committee, but that no definite decision had been arrived at.  He thought that the suggestion would be adopted, but the money received locally could not be used for the purpose of paying an Organiser.  Any money spent on organising would be taken out of money at present at their disposal, and not out of money collected locally.</P>
<P>3.  Mr. J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary, North): &ldquo;Is there any information available showing the amount of money collected in America in respect of the Republican Loan?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;The question is dealt with in a general way in the Report of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  There is no information available on this point.  Some amounts have been promised I suggest that the question could be more fully dealt with on the motion to increase the amount of the Loan Issue abroad.&rdquo;</P>
<P>4.  SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan, South) put a query regarding the £2,010 shown against the Ministry for Defence.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE: &ldquo;The sum allocated by the Dáil was drawn out in total by the Minister for Defence. The Secretary for Defence stated that less than £300 of this amount had been spent up to the present. The Member for St. Michan's had the exact figures.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES. - AGRICULTURE.</Title>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE moved the adoption of the Report of the Agriculture and Land Mortgage Bank Committees.  He further explained the proposals in his scheme to set up an Agricultural Loan Bank.  The rate of interest and sinking fund charged would depend on the state of the money market for the time being.</P>
<P>Mr. D. KENT (Cork, East) supported the scheme.</P>
<P>Mr. J. MACBRIDE (Mayo, West) considered that a deposit of 25 per cent. of the purchase money by a prospective tenant was too high.  They should advance up to 100 per cent.</P>
<P>Mr. W. SEARS (Mayo, South) supported <Col N="147"/> the scheme.  He was of opinion that the Republican Government should have a majority in the management of the Bank.</P>
<P>Mr. R.M. SWEETMAN (Wexford, North) inquired if the entire interest on the Indemnity Shares represented sinking fund?</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE explained that the accumulation of the Indemnity Shares which would bear interest at 3 per cent. per annum, was intended to amortise the debt.  The Indemnity Shares were necessary to guard against loss by default of purchasers.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow, East) thought the scheme a good one, the Joint Stock Banks advanced only about 50 per cent. of the Purchase Money as against 75 per cent. to be advanced under the proposed scheme, and in most cases required collateral security for the money.  He considered that £200,000, the amount of the Guarantee Stock, was not large enough.</P>
<P>Mr. J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary, North) approved of the scheme.  There should be provision in it for annuities so as to enable the tenant purchasers to repay the interest and principal at the same time.  This would provide better security for shareholders, and it would also provide a better incentive to people to subscribe.  It would not be a wise proposition to advance 100 per cent. of the Purchase Money.</P>
<P>LIAM T. MAC COSGAIR (Kilkenny, North) expressed the view that the whole basis of the scheme depended for success on the good faith of purchasers, and on the number of people who would come forward as Shareholders.  He would prefer if the Ordinary Shares were reduced to 5s., so as to induce a greater number of investors to come in.</P>
<P>SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan, South) criticised the financial provisions of the scheme.  He calculated that in the first year of the working of the Bank there would be practically no profit.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) disagreed with the conclusions of the Teachta for South Monaghan.  There would be a profit because in addition to the Indemnity Shares there would be the interest of at least 5½ per cent. payable by Societies to whom advances would have been made.  And further. more, investment in this scheme would be a perfectly sound business proposition, and offer a good field to Irishmen who desire to invest their money in Ireland in a sound investment.  The scheme offered an inducement to such men to sink their money at home.  From a purely business point of view the proposition was a perfectly sound one.</P>
<P>Ald. T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) thought the scheme outlined a very good one, and that it provided a fair field for constructive effort.  He asked (1) If object &ldquo;E&rdquo; was essential to the achievement of the purpose which the Bank had before it?  He reminded the House that the Sinn Féin Bank was in existence. (2) What machinery was to be employed in forming the Bank?  Did the promoter of the scheme propose using the machinery of British Law necessary in the formation and flotation of such companies? (3) Had the contingency of the seizure of the money by the English Government been provided for?</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE in the course of his reply stated that for every £100 advanced by the Bank £25 will be given back in shares, so that the Bank will only lend 75 per cent. of the value of the land.  The Scheme should and could live on the good faith behind it.  He was Chairman of a Cooperative Bank floated in 1908, which lent £1,000 per year on an average to people who were unable to pay their rent, and they had only one instance of a bad debt.  As to object &ldquo;E,&rdquo; that clause was inserted for the simple reason that they should not place a limit on the future activities of the Bank.  It was to meet any contingency not contemplated at the moment.  They could not commence operations at once. The £10,000 referred to was the amount estimated to meet the cost of premises and equipment, etc.</P>
<P>The price of land was undoubtedly high at the moment, but the ordinary sales were not reported in the Press <Col N="148"/> It was the extraordinary cases were published.  Furthermore, it was the comparatively small areas that were fetching high prices.  He instanced the case of a farm of 1,300 acres in Meath which recently sold at £20 per acre, there being a valuable supply of timber on the land and a mansion that must have cost £20,000 to erect.</P><P>As to the financial proposals of the Scheme, on the Guarantee Stock of £200,000 they would receive £50,000 Indemnity Shares.  The Bond Issue would bring in £200,000, which secures a further £50,000 in Indemnity Shares, making a total working capital of £500,000.  Interest at 3 per cent. on the Guaranteed Stock, interest at 3 per cent. on the Indemnity Shares, and interest at 5 per cent. on the Bond Issue would make the gross liability of £19,000, and as against that they would have interest at 5½ per cent. on £500,000, or £27,500, which would leave a gross profit of £8,500 to the Bank.  Administrative expenses might be more or less than 1 per cent. of the capital.  In the case of Hungary, where there existed a somewhat similar institution, the expenses for the first few years amounted to 1 per cent.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR asked that cricitisms, proposed alterations and amendments to the Scheme should be submitted to him by Deputies.</P><P>The Scheme in its present form was not final.</P><P>The motion that the Report be adopted was put and carried.</P>

    <Title>SECRET COURTMARTIAL OF A DEPUTY. - RESOLUTION OF PROTEST.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT called the attention of the House to the arrest and the trial by a secret Courtmartial, and sentence to a term of imprisonment by the English Government, of the Teachta for Cavan West&mdash;Mr. P. Galligan.  An elected representative of the country was tried and sentenced in secret. That proceeding was contrary even to English Law.  He moved that</P><P>&ldquo;The Elected Representatives of Ireland assembled in Session in the Mansion House on the twentieth day of August, 1919, call the attention of the Elected Representatives of the United States and of all other free countries to the fact that persons duly elected for Irish Constituencies are now being seized by the English Army of Occupation, secretly arraigned before English Courts Martial and secretly condemned to terms of imprisonment as ordinary criminals.</P><P>&ldquo;On the night of July 14th, Mr. Paul Galligan, the unanimously Elected Representative for West Cavan, in the Province of Ulster, was arrested by a section of the English Armed Forces, conveyed to the Victoria British Military Barracks, Belfast, where he was arraigned in secret before a tribunal of English Military Officers which ordered him to be imprisoned for twelve months with hard labour as an ordinary criminal.  The charge preferred against him was that he had drilled a body of young men.</P><P>&ldquo;The Member for West Cavan is at present in solitary confinement in a flagged basement cell in Belfast Prison.&rdquo;</P><P>The motion was put and carried.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES. - FORESTRY.</Title>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE moved the adoption of the Report on Forestry.  He mentioned that the man proposed to be nominated as National Inspector of Forestry was not available. and that he had invited Mr. Cole to act in the meantime; but he had not yet received a definite reply from the latter.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow East) seconded the adoption of the Report.</P>
<P>Mr. R.M. SWEETMAN (Wexford North) asked to be informed as to Mr. Cole's qualifications.  He suggested that all effort for this year should be concentrated on making Arbour Day a success.  He did not consider the suggestion that each farmer should plant sixteen trees a practical one.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow East) <Col N="149"/> mentioned the good example set by Father Sweetman, who had offered eight acres to the Local Cumann Sinn Fein for the purpose of afforestation.</P>
<P>LIAM T. MAC COSGAIR (Kilkenny North) pointed out that local Councils could accomplish a good deal within the limits of their powers.  It was impossible for them to get a grant for this purpose without levying a special rate. The Dublin Corporation, without striking a special rate, had expended some £10,000 on planting ornamental trees.</P>
<P>Mr. M. STAINES (St. Michan's) referred to a proposal made at a meeting of the Committee on Forestry that every farmer should plant at least sixteen trees, <i>i.e.</i>, a tree to represent each man shot in Easter Week.</P><P>If sixteen trees were not considered sufficient, there could be planted sixteen of each species of tree.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE regretted that the Teachta for North Wexford was not able to be present at the last meeting of the Committee when the question as to Mr. Cole was discussed. Mr. Cole would not accept a salary for his services, and besides he had his business to look after.  He expected that by Christmas he would have an Inspector of Forestry who would devote his whole time to the matter.  As to planting of at least sixteen trees by each farmer, it was a practical suggestion and it appealed to him very much.  It had also been suggested that the sites of battlefields should be planted.</P><P>The motion that the Report be adopted was put and carried.</P>

    <Title>DEPUTATION FROM LIMERICK.</Title>

<P>The CEANN COMHAIRLE intimated that the Deputation could now be received, and that there would be no discussion on the subject of their visit until they had withdrawn.</P>
<P>LIAM T. MAC COSGAIR (Kilkenny North) introduced the Mayor of Limerick, who made a statement to the effect that two years ago the Committee in charge of Technical Instruction under the Borough Council of Limerick appointed Mr. de Lacy as Head Master of the School of Commerce.  The D.A.T.I. at first refused to sanction the appointment on the grounds that there were no available funds to pay for the instruction.  Later on the Department refused to give their sanction to the appointment unless Mr. de Lacy gave a guarantee that he would not again embark on a course of action such as led to his arrest after Easter Week. This Mr. de Lacy would not give, and the Department refused to approve a scheme for the coming year unless Mr. de Lacy's name was omitted therefrom. The Deputation now asked for financial support for the School from Dáil Eireann.  The Committee refuse to appoint any other Head Master.  Failing the financial support asked for, the Committee had but one alternative, namely, to hand in their resignations.</P>
<P>Mr. Hennessy, a member of the Deputation, stated that the amount of money required to run the Schools was about £2,000 per annum.  The entire expenses was about £3,500, but the Committee would be prepared to raise £1,500.  He supplied details in connection with the income and expenditure of the Technical Schools.  The School Buildings were the property of the Corporation.  There were three Englishmen on the Teaching Staff for whose superannuation under a recent Act of the English Parliament the Local Authority was responsible.  They could not therefore dismiss them.  The normal school attendance was 750.  Mr. de Lacy was appointed in September, 1917.  It was admitted by a representative of the D.A.T.I., who called on them in Limerick in connection with the <Col N="150"/> matter, that the case had been taken out of their hands and was being dealt with by Dublin Castle.</P><P>Mr. de Lacy submitted that the Schools could be made self-supporting within two years.  They were badly managed at present.  There were nine or ten teachers who were not doing two hours' work per day.  The Technical Teachers under Municipal Boroughs were permanent officials; under County Councils they were appointed yearly.</P><P>The Mayor thanked the Speaker and Deputies for having been given a hearing, and the Deputation then withdrew.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="MINISTERIAL" RHead="MOTIONS. - FINANCE">
    <Title>MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - FINANCE.</Title>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE moved:</P><P>&ldquo;It is decreed that an additional sum of $23,750,000 may be issued for subscription to the Loan of the Government of the Irish Republic in the United States of America, thus increasing the total amount for the issue in that country to $25,000,000.&rdquo;</P><P>He said that discretionary powers were at first sought to increase the amount of the Loan issue to $5,000,000, and now it was asked to increase it to $25,000,000.  As to the Loan, the actual issue had not yet been made, and the prospectuses had not yet been issued to the public in America.  It appeared that the Friends of Irish Freedom were engaged in a campaign to raise funds for propaganda purposes for themselves, and it was not considered advisable at the time that the Loan Issue should be made simultaneously.  President de Valera was interviewing a number of Bankers one of those days in connection with the matter.  The Finance Committee were about to issue 5,000 prospectuses to every constituency in Ireland, and with them, leaflets for distribution.  After a Teachta had held a meeting of the Comhairle Ceanntair and the Committees had been formed, the leaflets and prospectuses should be circulated and copies sent to the house of each probable subscriber.  In this matter Teachtai had the chief responsibility. The prospectuses would be delivered in a week's time.</P>
<P>LIAM T. MAC COSGAIR (Kilkenny North) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow, East) inquired if the Deputies were aware of the suggestion to form Republican Loan Clubs?</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE, in reply, stated that instructions as to this were being issued with the pamphlets.</P><P>The motion was put and carried.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - ANTI-CONSCRIPTION" RHead="SUBSCRIPTIONS AND THE BOND ISSUE">
    <Title>MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - ANTI-CONSCRIPTION SUBSCRIPTIONS AND THE BOND ISSUE.</Title>
<P>Mr. J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary, North) asked if in the case of monies subscribed to the Anti-Conscription Fund by individuals they would receive Certificates or Bonds, or would they get credit for the sums already subscribed?</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE replied that the proposition would require a resolution of the Dáil.  It would only be possible to take that step with individuals. He was prepared to bring forward a resolution to meet the case.</P>
<P>Mr. R.M. SWEETMAN (Wexford, North) did not agree with this suggestion.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) stated that any persons who could prove that they contributed from one pound upwards were entitled to get a bond.</P>
<P>Mr. D. KENT (Cork, East) was of opinion that the question had better not be raised at all.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) would not mention it, but would adopt the course suggested when the question was asked.</P>
<P>Dr. B. CUSACK (Galway, East) said that there was no question of bonds at the time the Anti-Conscription money was asked for.  He was opposed to the suggestion of the Deputy for North Tipperary.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow, East) agreed with the last speaker.</P>
<P>SEOSAMH MAC AONGHUSA (Longford Co.) asked what was the amount of the Anti-Conscription Funds received by the Dáil?</P>
<P><Col N="151"/> Ald. T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) stated that throughout Ireland the total amount of the Anti-Conscription Funds collected was £250,000.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE, replying to the Teachta for Longford County, stated that the total amount of money received from the Anti-Conscription Fund was not more than £18,000, and was probably much less.</P>
<P>Mr. J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh, South) agreed with the suggestion that the question of giving Bonds for the equivalent amount of Anti-Conscription Subscriptions had better not be mentioned at all.</P>
<P>Mr. W. SEARS (Mayo, South) asked for a definite proposal on the matter.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork, Mid) moved, and J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim) seconded:</P><P>&ldquo;That no Bonds be given in exchange for any monies not specifically subscribed for that purpose.&rdquo;</P><P>The motion was put and carried.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="OATH OF" RHead="ALLEGIANCE">
    <Title>OATH OF ALLEGIANCE.</Title>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE moved:</P><P>&ldquo;Every person and every one of those bodies undermentioned must swear allegiance to the Irish Republic and to the Dáil:</P><P>1.  The Deputies.</P><P>2.  The Irish Volunteers.</P><P>3.  The Officers and Clerks to the Dáil.</P><P>4.  Any other body or individual who in the opinion of the Dáil should take the same Oath.&rdquo;</P><P>He pointed out that it was no new proceeding for a Government to require that the Elected Representatives, the Defence Forces, and the Officers and Clerks of Parliament, should subscribe to an Oath of Allegiance to the State.  He suggested the following form of Oath, which was an adaptation of the Oath subscribed to by Congressmen, Senators and other persons who aspired to become American Citizens.  The American form of the oath as adopted to suit their requirements would read:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;I, A.B., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I do not and shall not yield a voluntary support to any pretended Government, authority or power within Ireland hostile and inimical thereto, and I do further swear (or affirm) that to the best of my knowledge and ability I will support and defend the Irish Republic and the Government of the Irish Republic, which is Dáil Eireann, against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, so help me, God.&rdquo;</P><P>An Oath of Allegiance was administered to every existing Government in the world.  An affirmation might be made by anyone who had scruples about taking an Oath.  The object aimed at was to unify the whole body in this country.  The present Constitution governing the Irish Volunteers prevented them from being subject to any other body but their own Executive.  At the next Convention they proposed to ask them as a standing army to swear allegiance to the Dáil, and it was but fair and just that all Members of the Dáil, and all officials of the Dáil, should likewise subscribe to an Oath of Allegiance.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork, Mid) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>Alderman T. KELLY (St. Stephen's Green) asked if there was any necessity for this Oath?  What had occurred in the past six or seven months to make it necessary now?  Was it that any of their members wished to go to the London Parliament and perform there?  He believed that a man who would not keep his word would not keep his oath.  It had been said that one object of it was to get the Irish Volunteers to become subject to the Dáil.  In his opinion the two bodies should remain separate.  He reminded them of the fate of the Volunteers of 1782.  A time might come when a military demonstration might be necessary. It was a species of coercion to force this issue.</P>
<P><Col N="152"/> Dr. CUSACK (Galway, East) pointed out that every civilised Government required an Oath of Allegiance from members of any foreign country desiring to become citizens, and it was recognised on all sides as a perfectly just procedure. He thought the Minister would be justified in carrying it further than he proposed, and requiring every individual to subscribe to it.  If they had all their people banded together they would be absolutely unbeatable.  Such an Oath would mean that every one of them was pledged to maintain the Republic.</P>
<P>Mr. J. MACBRIDE (Mayo, West) was opposed to the Oath.  If a man conscientiously took this Oath he could not serve on a local body, and Ald. Kelly and Mr. Cosgrave should leave the Dublin Corporation.  In fact he could not vote for a representative of any kind under English law.</P>
<P>Mr. W. SEARS (Mayo, South) thought that there was an obligation on every member to be loyal to the Republic. Even the Quakers in America took the Oath of Allegiance.  As to the Volunteers, he regarded it as a very unfortunate thing if the Dáil had no control over them.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) pointed out that the question was raised at the first Session of the Dáil and that members were required to sign a pledge, which he considered quite sufficient.</P>
<P>LIAM T. MACCOSGAIR (Kilkenny, North) had conscientious scruples about taking an oath unless it was absolutely necessary.  He considered that any military organisation in this country should be under the control of the Dáil.  If it were considered necessary that the Volunteers take an Oath of Allegiance that was a matter for them.  He would subscribe to such an Oath if adequate reasons were put forward.</P>
<P>Mr. D. KENT (Cork, East) pointed out that it was not a question of a suspicion of the trustworthiness of members that was at stake.  They required to band all Republicans together, and he believed that the Irish Volunteers should be under the control of the Dáil.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that he was astonished at finding that the Members had not taken an Oath of Allegiance at their first meeting.  Every person elected there should pledge his or her allegiance to the standing Government of Ireland.  If they were not a regular Government then they were shams and impostors.  The Army and the Government of a country could not be under separate authority.  While there might be a question as to the form of the Oath there could be none as to the necessity for taking the Oath.  They should realise that they were the Government of the country.  This Oath would regularise the situation.  If they were a regularly constituted Government there could be no question about the taking of an Oath of Allegiance.  The taking of the Oath did not preclude one from serving on the Local Boards and doing his best to forward the interests of the country in such a capacity.  He was absolutely in favour of the motion.</P>
<P>COUNT PLUNKETT (Roscommon, N.) said that they were asked to perform a constitutional act in taking this Oath.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow, East) was of opinion that the Oath should be extended to every individual who supported the Republican Government in Ireland.</P>
<P>Mr. J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh, Sth.) inquired of the Minister for Defence if he would get the next Irish Volunteer Convention to acknowledge that the Dáil is the Government of the country and have the Constitution of the Irish Volunteers amended to conform to that?</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE replied that he regarded the Irish Volunteers as a standing Army, and that as such they should be subject to the Government. There had been no argument advanced against the Oath.  The ordinary man thought more of his obligations under an Oath than where only his word was given.  No doubt, a man who would break his word would break his Oath, but that was not the question.  The important thing was that the Irish Volunteers under their present Constitution owed allegiance to their own Executive.  Since the Dáil had come into existence there had been <Col N="153"/> no Volunteer Convention, but one would be held as soon as possible.  It was necessary to have this matter adjusted. He did not think it necessary that persons outside those mentioned should be required to take the Oath.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) moved, as an amendment:</P><P>&ldquo;That this Oath be not applied to members of the Dáil who have already pledged themselves not to recognise the British Government in this country by the Declaration signed at the first meeting of the Dáil in January last.&rdquo;</P><P>The amendment was not seconded.</P><P>On a division on the original motion, 30 voted for and 5 voted against.  The motion was accordingly declared carried, and the suggested form of the Oath was adopted.</P>

<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) to the FINANCE MINISTER: &ldquo;Is the money subscribed to the Loan in America to be first sent to Ireland before any of it is spent?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The FINANCE MINISTER, replying, stated that the proceeds of the Loan would be forwarded to Ireland.  That did not mean that the money would be sent to Ireland in bulk.  Monies spent on services outside Ireland would be spent only under the direction of the various Ministers responsible.</P>

    <Title>NON-MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - THE IRISH-SPEAKING DISTRICTS.</Title>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford Co.) moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That a Committee for the preservation of the Irish Language in the Irish-Speaking Districts be appointed; and that £1,000 be appropriated for this purpose.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He said that the Irish Language was slowly dying, and if something drastic was not done immediately the state of things would be deplorable.  The Gaelic League classes were not coping with the situation, as not five per cent. of the persons who attended these classes were able to speak the language afterwards.  He suggested that a Committee be formed to deal with the matter, and that the Dáil vote a sum of £1,000 to be applied to stimulating the language in the Irish-speaking districts. The idea was to allot prizes in these districts to the best Irish-speaking families. The Committee would formulate a scheme.  The Deputy Speaker and himself might be included in the Committee. A somewhat similar proposal was <Col N="154"/> sent up to the Ard-Fheis but was turned down for the reason that the real facts in connection with the proposal were not discussed.</P>
<P>EARNAN DE BLAGHD (Monaghan North) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>T. MAC SUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) suggested that no English be spoken by Deputies at meetings in the Irish-Speaking Districts.</P>
<P>The DEPUTY SPEAKER referred to the motion before the Ard-Fheis of the Gaelic League, and stated that the published Press reports did not give the actual facts of the discussion.  The motion was discussed with the greatest frankness.  It was stated that there might be a sum of £1,000 forthcoming from the Dáil.  The Gaelic League had done a great deal of useful work for the Language, but it had been greatly hampered. It had been left for two years without a Secretary.  Three years ago Eoin Mac Neill was elected President, but from the time of his election he did not attend three meetings of the Coiste Gnotha.  Two of their organisers had been &ldquo;on the run&rdquo; for a considerable length of time.  It had been suggested that the Gaelic League had done nothing to speak of in the last ten or twelve years.  That was not so.  It had done a great deal.</P><P>Upon the suggestion of the DEPUTY SPEAKER the motion was deferred until the request made at the Ard-Fheis &mdash;that a Minister for the Irish Language be appointed&mdash;should come up for decision at the next Session.</P>

    <Title>LIMERICK TECHNICAL SCHOOLS.</Title>
<P>LIAM T. MAC COSGAIR (Kilkenny North) moved that the Dáil contribute £1,000 to the upkeep of the Limerick Technical Schools.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT said that if the Dáil were going into this question at all they should go into it thoroughly. £1,000 was no good where £2,000 was required.  He suggested that Liam de Roiste, J. O'Mahony, and W.T. Cosgrave should go to Limerick and interview the Committee there, and, provided they reported favourably, and, provided that the Schools could be made self-supporting, that the Dáil should support the Institution.  The propaganda effect of that would be considerable.  If they supported the Institution they would be opening the School and taking back 800 students.  It would be an object lesson to the people.  He moved that they should support it to the extent of £2,000, subject to the report of Messrs. de Roiste.  O'Mahony and Cosgrave.</P>
<P>MICHEAL O COILEAIN (Cork South) supported the Acting-President.  He referred to St. Enda's College, and suggested that they had the nucleus of a National School system in these two schools; and though there was no application on behalf of St. Enda's before the Dáil, the Committee proposed to be set up should examine it also.  He suggested the addition of the names of Proinnsias O Fathaigh and Fionan Ó Loingsigh to the Committee.</P>
<P>PROINNSIAS O FATHAIGH (Galway South) did not think the formulation of a general scheme as was suggested was feasible.</P>
<P>DR. CUSACK (Galway North) said that if the Dáil took up this project it should be made clear that it was because of the action of the English Government in penalising a man on account of his political principles.  He moved that Messrs. de Roiste, Fahy, Cosgrave, O'Mahony and MacSweeney should meet the Mayor and members of the Committee, and that, subject to their report, the Ministry be empowered to allocate £2,000 for the purpose of supporting the Schools.</P>
<P>LIAM T. MAC COSGAIR (Kilkenny North) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford Co.) asked if £2,000 was sufficient?  At the end of a year the School might be in the same position as it was in at present. Provided that the Committee, after consultation with the local people, were satisfied that everything was alright, and that the business men on this Committee were satisfied that it would be a sound proposition, he was satisfied to <Col N="155"/> give £2,000 a year for two years.  The Committee should consider the needs of local industries, and how far the School could be made to serve them.</P>
<P>Mr. J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh South) agreed, and T. MAC SUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) raised the question of providing for the inspection of the School, to secure that its educational programme was being properly carried out.</P><P>The following resolution was eventually adopted:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That Messrs. MacSweeney, de Roiste, O'Mahony, Cosgrave and Fahy be appointed a Committee to go to Limerick and meet the Mayor and members of the local Committee; that they report on the proposal in its financial and educational aspects; and that subject to their report, the Ministry be empowered to subsidise the school, the Dáil to be represented on the Governing Body and to ensure efficient teaching and inspection.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>ACTING-PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT said that the arrival of President de Valera in New York was the biggest thing since the elections in Ireland.  Mr. Boland had been ill for some time but was now well again.  At home a good deal of work had been done by members of the Committees.  There was a good deal of interference with meetings throughout the country.  He had heard that 13,000 extra troops were to be sent to Ulster, and behind this screen of troops Carson was going to re-organise his Volunteers, so that Lloyd George would be in a position to prove that there were two nations in Ireland.  There was no doubt that the military movement in Ulster was being directed by Carson.  In France a General Election was expected in October, when Clemenceau, who was pro-English, was likely to be defeated, and Briand, who was in favour of Ireland, and was anti-English, might be returned to power.  France was anxious to get the Peace Treaty ratified. Her representatives in America had received instructions not to make themselves objectionable to Ireland.  In conclusion, he referred to the shooting of a boy named Murphy in Co. Clare. That boy had been shot by either the Constabulary or the Military.</P><P>The business of the Session was now completed, and the House rose at 6.50 p.m.</P>
