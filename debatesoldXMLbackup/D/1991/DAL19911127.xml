      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider taking a further series of questions at 3.45 p.m. this afternoon in relation to the accident in Dublin Bay last Thursday night?  For the sake of public confidence it would be helpful if some of the questions which did not appear to be answered by the Minister for the Marine yesterday were answered in this House.  It would be for the benefit of confidence in the rescue services and for public information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1) In any case under this Act, where the extent of the damage alleged exceeds £100, the accused person shall have the right, as shall the Director of Public Prosecutions, to elect for trial on indictment.</P>
      <P>(2) In all other cases the matter shall be tried summarily in the District Court.</P>
      <P>(3) The maximum penalty to be imposed on summary conviction shall be six month's imprisonment, or a fine of £1,000, or both.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased the Minister for Justice is present to deal with this important stage of the Bill.  Having had a quick look at the Official Report, I see it is almost a year ago to the day that the Minister moved that the Bill be read a Second Time, which was the last we saw of him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 <Col N="1083" /> addresses a fundamental right of an accused person charged with criminal offences before the court, that is, the right to elect for trial by jury in certain circumstances.  The cumulative effect of the provisions as set out in section 2 and elsewhere in the Bill is that the decision to allow the accused to elect for trial by judge and jury arises in two circumstances only; where the district justice should refuse to hear a charge of such gravity as not to be fit to be tried summarily or at the election of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is particularly relevant to the provisions of subsection (5).  Where an Act is silent on the issue as to who has the right to choose to elect for trial by jury but provides for penalties on both summary or indictable conviction, the High Court has construed this as a signal or facility to the Director of Public Prosecutions to select the venue for the hearing.</P>
      <P>I believe it is a fundamental right of an accused who is faced with a serious charge to have the opportunity to elect for trial on indictment.  The question of what is to be considered serious in this context must have a direct bearing on the position of the accused.  In this context it must be remembered that where a person is charged with stealing or shop lifting an item of any value, from 1p upwards, he or she is entitled as of right to elect for trial by jury before 12 of his or her peers. A conviction on a small matter, on the face of it, could have horrendous consequences for the accused in terms of the impact it could have on the position of the accused in society, in the workplace or elsewhere.  It is not sufficient to allow the right to elect for trial on indictment or choice of venue to rest solely with two of the three agencies before the court, namely the court or the Director of Public Prosecutions the prosecutor.  There must be circumstances where the accused has the right in the interest of his proper defence to have the case dealt with by a jury of 12 men and women selected from his own community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Law Reform <Col N="1084" /> Commission have consistently taken the opposite position in this matter.  In virtually all of the reports on reform of various aspects of criminal law that the Commission have published over the past number of years, and which we in this House have dealt with, their approach has been to write out of our law the right of the accused to elect for trial by jury. In recent times, I have noted in a series of correspondence in the columns of a daily newspaper between the Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane and the Chairman of the Progressive Democrats, Mr. Michael McDowell, Senior Counsel, a former Member of this House, that they are locked in the debate on this very issue. The view of the Law Reform Commission as expounded by the Chairman, Mr. Justice Keane, helps us to address the issue here.</P>
    <P>In his view, the Law Reform Commission are obliged to follow a Supreme Court ruling in the case of McKevitt, Ryan and Hackett <i>v.</i> Delap D. J.&mdash;in fact, I was the solicitor acting for the accused &mdash; which related to their pursuit to elect for trial by jury for the offence of forcible entry and occupation of a shipyard in the mid-seventies under the Act dealing with forcible entry and occupation. The Supreme Court ruled subsequently that they did not have this right and Mr. Justice Keane has said that the Law Reform Commission are obliged to follow the reasoning of the Supreme Court as laid down in that case.  This is very enlightening in terms of understanding why the Law Reform Commission have approached this issue in the current report dealing with malicious damage and why the Minister for Justice has adopted the same formula.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the then Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Treacy, said this was the primary reason for the drafting of this section. This House is not confined to the reasoning of the Supreme Court but obviously we would be greatly guided by them. Indeed, we have often introduced legislation in response to a finding which they, of necessity, found in their interpretation <Col N="1085" /> of the law to bring the matter into perspective in terms of what we as legislators are seeking to do.  A good example is the recent extradition ruling where the Government are now obliged to move with haste to amend the law to keep it in line with what we, as legislators, are seeking to achieve.</P>
    <P>In relation to the right to trial by jury, as legislators we should attempt to draw a balance between the rights of the prosecutor and of the Minister in seeking effective legislation and, on the other hand, protect the right of an individual charged with an offence, whatever it might seem on the face of it, that could have potentially serious consequences for him or her, to ask the court to allow trial before a jury.  As I say, when dealing with larceny offences, there is no prohibition, irrespective of the amount involved.  For that reason I urge the Minister to accept the proposition outlined in my first amendment.</P>
    <P>In that amendment I propose that in any case where the extent of the damage alleged exceeds £100, the accused shall have the right to elect for trial on indictment. The present position in law is that when an accused person is charged with an offence for which the amount exceeds £50, he or she has the right to elect for trial by judge and jury.  In keeping with the movement of time and issues such as inflation, I propose that we fix on a reasonable figure of £100.  However, I would have no objection if the Minister for Justice believed that threshold was too low and proposed that it be increased to another manageable figure.  If he were to suggest £250 or £500, I would not object to that.</P>
    <P>However, I do object to the fundamental position now being written into legislation that an accused person will never have the right to elect for trial by judge and jury, irrespective of the extent of the damage or the seriousness of the consequences of conviction for that person.  I believe that is a fundamental departure this House should not undertake lightly.  In saying that, all other matters below the threshold &mdash; whatever is <Col N="1086" /> agreed on &mdash; should be dealt with summarily in the District Court and maximum penalties should be fixed on conviction.  I have no difficulty with the level of penalties outlined by the Minister. Malicious damage has to be dealt with in a serious way on conviction. Equally we have to recognise that a person charged stands in the dock innocent, that there does exist in our laws a fundamental right to trial by jury and that we should be very slow to remove that fundamental right except for very good reason.  As I said, the Bill, as drafted, takes from an accused person the right to choose.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not come back, as the Minister of State did on Committee Stage, to say that the right of the accused will be protected by the Director of Public Prosecutions or by the court itself in serious cases, refusing to deal with the matter summarily because it should be tried elsewhere.  The considerations that could impinge on the position of an accused person might not enter the mind of the prosecutor or the judge, and even if they were adverted to by the accused standing in the dock &mdash; who might say that he or she objected to the matter being dealt with in the District Court and believed it was of such consequence that it should be dealt with by the Circuit Court &mdash; it could well be that the consequences on employment, for example, might not carry any weight with the District Justice.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this matter, I wish to draw briefly from my experience as a practitioner on the difficulties that an accused person &mdash; an innocent person standing in a dock before a District Justice &mdash; would have in entering into a debate on the venue of a trial.  An accused person would have difficulty saying he or she believed the case should not be dealt with in the District Court but should be sent to a higher court for trial by jury because, while it might not have been intended, that could also be seen as an indirect criticism of the judge himself. It could be perceived that the accused person was unhappy with the way that judge performed, dealt with or dispensed <Col N="1087" /> justice, and was, therefore, attempting to get out of the arena of that judge and into a higher court.  If a judge rules against such an accused and decides the case could be dealt with in his or her court, the defendant would feel very uneasy facing into a trial in front of the judge he may have been perceived to criticise or to suggest was not capable or fit to try the case summarily.  That is one scenario.  Another scenario is one I have found time and time again in my years practising in the criminal courts.  Often the Director of Public Prosecutions will elect for trial summarily in circumstances in which he is perhaps in difficulty with the entirety of the proofs, for example, he is not satisfied that the quality of the testimony of a witness would stand up to close scrutiny by 12 men and women and thinks that a District Justice who might be a little more case hardened would be inclined to take either a harder view or a more benign view in the direction of the prosecution with the testimony that has been presented.  It is a fact of life in our courts that judges of the District Court are perceived to be more receptive to prosecution cases than a jury.</P>
    <P>There are many factors to take into account, such as the difficulty faced by the Director of Public Prosecutions when he thinks that in another six months, or whatever the date for a trial by jury is set his case might not be prepared; or witnesses might have moved on or emigrated, but such factors should not of themselves have a bearing on the issue of venue if one has regard to the right of an accused to trail by jury.  However, those factors can and do arise on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>All I say is that I accept that there are occasions on which cases &mdash; and I would include the majority of petty crime &mdash; should be dealt with in the District Court by summary trial but we must by some means retain the right for an accused person to elect for trial by jury.</P>
    <P>I have proposed the amount of £100 but I have no difficulty with a higher threshold so long as there are left some rights for the accused.</P>

      <P>The Department have tried to reflect the debate and have taken on board a number of the suggestions made and argued in a very practical and reflective way by Opposition Members.  That is reflected in the number of Report Stage amendments tabled in my name.  Of the 23 amendments tabled, 13 are in my name.  As I said, many of those amendments take on board points made on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The point raised this morning by Deputy McCartan was also made on Committee Stage, when he made a very strong case for it.  We considered it but I still regret that, for the reason I give now, I cannot go along with the Deputy on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that at present a person accused of causing malicious damage to property exceeding £50 is entitled to insist on a jury trial.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that the accused should not have an absolute right to trial by jury for minor offences of this kind.  They pointed out that the District Court could conclude that, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, the offence charged was not a minor one. In that event the case could proceed only on indictment so that the constitutional right to a trial by jury in such circumstances is being fully preserved.  I should emphasise that there is no constitutional right to a trial by jury for a minor offence.  There is the statutory position that arises out of the Larceny Act, 1861, but it is not a constitutional right.  I appreciate that under some old statutes, such as those relating to larceny, a jury trial can be insisted on for the most trivial of offences.  That is an anomalous state of affairs in circumstances in which the great bulk of criminal offences is <Col N="1089" /> handled by the summary courts.  Convictions for many of those offences can have consequences for the people involved that are just as serious as convictions for offences of criminal damage. I do not see that any special case can be made in this context for criminal damage offences.</P>
    <P>There are many precedents for the provision in the Bill allowing the Director of Public Prosecutions to elect whether to proceed summarily or on indictment.  As far as I am aware the operation of those provisions has not given rise to complaint. The powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this regard, of course, are subject to the supervision of the District Court so that, even if he were to decide to proceed summarily in what was not a minor offence, the District Court would refuse to deal with it and send the accused for trial before the Circuit Court and a jury whether or not the accused wished to have the case tried in the lower court.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, despite the strong case made by the Deputy and the fact that he has indicated his willingness to increase the figure from the £100 about which he spoke, I do not believe that acceptance of this amendment would lead to an improvement in the Bill.  There were other points made by the Deputy and by Deputy Seán Barrett on Committee Stage which I will be taking on board in amendments we will reach later in the day.  I regret that in this case I cannot agree to the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I am disappointed at the Minister's response. Inevitably he borrowed from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, recommendations that are more often ignored by his Department and Government than are implemented. Indeed what easy succour they find in hiding behind their recommendations whenever it is to their advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this Bill the Law Reform Commission made another very important recommendation, that is that malicious damage offences would be no <Col N="1090" /> longer scheduled for the purposes of the Offences Against the State Act, another matter that would have a fundamental impact on the rights of suspects and accused, if implemented.  Needless to say that recommendation was ignored and will not be implemented.  The Minister faced down my amendment in that regard on Committee Stage also.  It is a hot and cold attitude on the part of the Government and the Minister to say: well, the Law Reform Commission say one thing and I am going to take it, but the Law Reform Commission says another and I am not going to take it.  I am not making a special case.  I am very disheartened at the Minister's response about the idea that the right to a jury trial is something special, that the opportunity for a person to be tried by his or her peers is something extraordinary and should be avoided as far as possible.  The Minister has said he was not prepared to make a special case in this context.  I hope that he, or anybody close to him, never has to face a change in the Criminal Court.  I honestly believe that perhaps until some of us have to stand in the dock or in the Criminal Court faced with a charge we will not begin to appreciate the absolute importance and fundamental right of a person to be tried by his or her peers.  It is cumbersome, in some respects, perhaps expensive, and it can take time but, when one is pursuing innocence and the right of people to be tried fairly, then the jury trial which always has been a major feature of our criminal process is not something to be regarded as extraordinary or special. While we argue from first principles it should be from the principle that the right to trial by jury is the right of an accused to select to be so tried in warranted circumstances. We should depart from that practice in extraordinary circumstances only.</P>
    <P>I have made my case.  I am deafened by the silence of Deputy Bell of the Labour Party and Deputy Seán Barrett of Fine Gael on this matter.  I am not surprised by Fine Gael in that they did not support me in this matter on Committee Stage. For those reasons I would ask that the question be put.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 1, after &ldquo;has&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or has had&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to section 4 which deals with possessing anything with intent to damage property.  This is a rather technical point I raised on Committee Stage. The Minister may have satisfied himself that the fears I expressed do not exist but I decided to table this amendment on Report Stage to seek clarification.  My main fear is with the present wording which reads:</P>
      <P>A person (in this section referred to as the possessor) who has any thing in his custody or under his control intending without lawful excuse to use it or cause or permit another to use it&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am afraid that if somebody actually disposes of, say, the rock or weapon that would be used to cause malicious damage just prior to being apprehended they could be relieved of responsibility on a technical point.  For that reason I decided to retable this amendment to seek clarification from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Committee Stage I have had this matter clarified with the parliamentary draftsman who was consulted and has confirmed that the form of words used in the section is adequate to cover the possession of articles or substances with intent to cause damage irrespective of when possession took place. Therefore he has clarified the point about which Deputy Seán Barrett was rightly concerned and has confirmed that it is already covered in the form of wording used.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is in the name of the Minister. <Col N="1092" /> Amendments Nos. 7, and 10 are consequential and amendment No. 8 is related.  I suggest, therefore, that we discuss the four amendments together.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 6, to delete &ldquo;the owner of the property&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any person (in this section referred to as the injured party') who, by reason thereof, has suffered loss (other than consequential loss)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to meet a point made by Deputy Seán Barrett on Committee Stage.  It proposes to replace the reference to &ldquo;owner of the property&rdquo; with a reference to any person who has suffered loss by reason of the damage caused by the convicted person.  In so doing it recognises there may be cases where the owner of the damaged property would not be the person who would be liable for putting the damage right, say, in the case of a tenant who was liable to keep the premises in good repair.</P>
      <P>The amendment makes it clear that compensation will be available for the actual damage to the property only and not for any consequential losses, for example, the hire of another car while the damaged car was being repaired or loss of profits while the damaged building was being reinstated.</P>
      <P>The calculation of these consequential losses would go beyond what would be appropriate in criminal damage legislation. If the convicted person is a &ldquo;mark&rdquo; for these losses, they can be recovered in a civil action in the District Court for an amount up to £5,000, or otherwise in a higher court.  I trust the amendment will be acceptable to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for tabling this amendment.  My main concern on Committee Stage was that the use of the phrase &ldquo;owner of the property&rdquo; would appear to restrict others from seeking compensation.  I re-tabled my Committee Stage amendment in order to have a discussion on this point but, in the light of the Minister's agreement to <Col N="1093" /> introduce his amendment, which is satisfactory from my point of view, I will not press my amendment No. 8</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 7, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(including a compensation order made against a parent or guardian of the convicted person and notwithstanding, in such a case, any other statutory limitation as to amount)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment on Committee Stage to section 10, which he has retabled as amendment No. 21, revealed an inconsistency in section 9 (1) which my present amendment seeks to eliminate.</P>
      <P>Section 9 (1), as it stands, empowers the court to make a compensation order only against a convicted person, although subsequent provisions of the section make it clear that it also contemplates that in some circumstances an order can be made against the parent or guardian of a child or young person convicted of criminal damage.</P>
      <P>The amendment also removes the present limitation on the amount of damages parents or guardians can be made liable to pay where their children are found guilty of criminal damage.  The present levels are limited by the amounts that can be imposed by way of fine or damages on the children and these are quite inadequate.  For example, the maximum fine or damages that may be imposed on a child under 15 is £2.  For young persons between 15 and 17 it is £10.  These are the limits that also apply in cases where the parents or guardians are ordered to pay the fines or damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say, however, that parents or guardians cannot be required to pay for the damage caused by their children if <Col N="1094" /> the court is not satisfied that, in the words of section 99 of the Children Act, 1908, &ldquo;they have conduced to the commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care of the child&rdquo;.  That limitation will still apply.</P>
    <P>I should say also that section 99 of the 1908 Act, along with the other provisions of that Act dealing with juvenile justice, are at present being examined with a view to updating and modernising all these provisions.  That legislation is included in the Government's legislative programme.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with this amendment.  There is a lesson to be learned from the level of violence and vandalism which has taken place on the outskirts of the city during the past few days.  Children aged as young as nine or ten have been stoning fire tenders and police cars.</P>
      <P>I have spoken in this Chamber on many occasions about the need to update our laws in relation to the responsibilities of parents.  There are certain circumstances where parents are doing their very best and may not be able to do much more, but it is important that legislation should clearly place on parents responsibility for the actions of their children.  We can always make allowances for certain circumstances but the principle of parental responsibility must be established. Nobody will persuade me that a child of nine or ten who is on the street at midnight is under parental supervision.  This legislation can be seen to begin the process of beating home the message that people who bring children into this world have a responsibility for their behaviour until such time as those children are in a position to act of their own accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see, through this legislation, the message going out that we in this House regard parents as being responsible in the area of malicious damage.  If, however, we are to ask parents to accept this sort of responsibility, we must also be seen to give them every opportunity of being involved at the <Col N="1095" /> outset.  I ask the Minister to bear this point in mind in preparing the Juvenile Justice Bill.  Parents should be informed if a child is in a police station or is being questioned outside the door of his own home by a garda.  It should be obligatory to make certain that the parent is present or invited to be present.  All future legislation in this field should help parents to become involved at a very early stage and to continue to become involved in the whole process.  We should not just expect parents to come in at the end of the process and pay compensation.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested that it was an amendment of mine which drew the attention of the parliamentary draftsman to an anomaly.  I do not know if I want to take credit for what is proposed here.  I have retabled my Committee Stage amendment and I note that the Minister has also tabled an amendment to that section.  I have been told that the amendment before us will make my later amendment superfluous. It is provided that the person against whom the order is made will have the right to appeal and I presume that would include a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>I accept that the existing level of fines and compensation orders is ridiculous. Much of our law is outdated in that it provides for penalties which cannot be regarded as a useful mechanism.  A breach of the peace carries a £2 fine, while the maximum penalty for being drunk and disorderly is £10.  We heard yesterday that a ship which carries improperly labelled goods can suffer the imposition by the harbour master of a maximum penalty of £10, under an Act of 1946.  The Minister should introduce some enabling Act which would provide for the movement of penalties in line with inflation or in line with orders made by this House from time to time so that the penalties would be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the maximum monetary penalty which can be imposed for a child under 15 years is £2 and £10 <Col N="1096" /> for children between the ages of 15 and 17 years; that is also the maximum penalty which can be imposed under compensation orders.  I am not entirely sure that that is the everyday practice in the Dublin Metropolitan Children's Court where, on many occasions, I have seen compensation orders far in excess of the levels indicated by the Minister directed against a child or his parents.  As they say, ignorance of the law is no excuse.</P>
    <P>I accept that we should bring the orders into line with what is needed to make the legislation effective.  However, having said that, I do not fully accept the proposition put forward by Deputy Barrett that this will of necessity, address the appalling incidents which have taken place in some Dublin suburbs over the past days and weeks.  I join with him in condemning those youths and their parents for their lack of vigilance in trying to put an end to this unseemly mob violence. I wonder to what extent last night's events and the events over the past few weeks are a result of media hype.  I have no doubt that teams of photographers and news reporters visit Ronanstown and Neilstown every night in expectation of violence.  I believe they get what they look for if they give the right signals, give coverage to the stories in the newspapers and publish photographs.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Fahey, said in the House last night.  His plea to the Government for more funding for youth services and youth support schemes is a far more constructive and positive way to deal with these problems.  Nevertheless, we have a criminal code and people will continue to be brought before the courts so that they can be dealt with.  However, the limits on the penalties which can be imposed are ridiculous in the extreme.  The Minister addresses this issue in his amendment and I do not think anyone in this House could criticise him for doing this.  Consequently, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment which will substantially improve the legislation. I listened carefully to what Deputy <Col N="1097" /> McCartan had to say.  I take it he is proposing a mechanism whereby these penalties would be automatically adjusted in line with increases in the CPI.  A development along those lines would be welcome and perhaps the Minister would give consideration to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of merit in providing right across the board &mdash; and not just in this legislation &mdash; that these penalties can be updated by way of order. This would be a welcome development. I appreciate the welcome which has been given to this amendment by Members on all sides of the House.  It is an important step forward and will place a greater onus on the role of the parent.  I should say that I have already taken action in this area.  For example, in relation to the attendance of children in court, last July I invoked powers which have been in place since the enactment of the 1908 Children Act.  There is now a responsibility on parents and guardians to accompany their children to court.  For far too long parents in Dublin and other areas abdicated their responsibility for the actions of their children and it is vital that parents and guardians fulfil their role in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the disturbances which have taken place in some Dublin suburbs over the past number of nights, I should point out that this is not just a Garda problem; the difficulties go far deeper than that.  I believe the amount of media coverage given to the events in one of these areas has given rise to copycat incidents in other areas.  There are approximately 24,000 or 25,000 people, in about 4,500 homes, living in this area where there are major unemployment problems and very few amenities.  Dublin Corporation who built the houses have left the people to fend for themselves.  We as a society have a responsibility to these people.  It is for that reason the Government decided yesterday to bring all the State agencies, including the Garda Síochána, together to make a concentrated effort to improve the situation in the Ronanstown area.  I should point out that we are not just looking at one <Col N="1098" /> estate; we are looking at other areas in Dublin city and in other cities where there are particular problems which need to be tackled in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>We are not long-fingering the problem; we are tackling the problem in a proper manner.  While short term policing measures are being taken, long term measures are required to resolve the problems which have manifested themselves over the past number of days and months.  I can assure the Deputies who have expressed concern about this matter that the Government are determined to take immediate, medium-term and long term action to tackle the problems which have manifested themselves in these areas in recent months.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Barrett tabled an amendment to section 2 (9) to provide that the jurisdiction of a District Court to make compensation orders should be increased in line with any general increase in that court's jurisdiction in tort.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 16 to 19, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The court, in making a compensation order, may require that the owner of the property concerned to be made known and that the approximate cost of making good the damage to the property (or, where appropriate, of replacing it) be made available to the Court.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment requesting the deletion of this subsection. However, the House decided against my amendment and I have to accept that decision.  I have attempted to draft an amendment which I felt could get the support of all sides, having considered the debate which took place on the last occasion.  What I am suggesting is that the court in making a compensation order may require that the owner of the property concerned be made known and that the approximate cost of making good the damage to the property or, where appropriate of replacing it be made available to the court.  I am attempting to give the court discretion.  The Minister is suggesting an amendment to the subsection which basically places an obligation on the court.  Section 9 (3) states:</P>
    <P>A compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property concerned and the approximate cost of making good the damage to it. . . . . are readily ascertainable.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the court to ensure that the owner shall be known and that the approximate cost be readily ascertainable.  Admittedly, the Minister has put down an amendment to soften the latter part of that subsection.</P>
    <P>I said on the last day that the concept of introducing compensation orders in respect of malicious damage is a good one.  The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing in this legislation.  I ask him not to tie his hands and the hands of the court by requiring various safeguards whereby a compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property concerned and the approximate cost of making good the damage to it are readily ascertainable.  There are circumstances where it may be impossible for the court to ascertain the owner of the property or the cost of making good the damage.  I do not see any need for that provision.  We ought to leave discretion to the court.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I am seeking to give discretion to the court by saying that the court in making a compensation order <Col N="1101" /> may require that the owner of the property concerned be made known.  I am saying also that the approximate cost of making good the damage be made available to the court.  I do not say that must be done immediately; it may be that the court will decide to postpone a decision until costs are ascertainable when the court, in its wisdom, can make its decision.  That is perfectly sensible.  I do not see why we have to tie the courts hands in any way.</P>
    <P>I say that in all sincerity and I do not think I could be accused of making a political point.  This is purely a desire to support the concept, help it work better and to give the court the necessary discretion which is important in cases such as this.  After all, we are dealing with malicious damage.  There is no justification for this type of vandalism or for any young person &mdash; as I said the last day &mdash; to be driving around town in stolen cars, ramming them into walls and burning and damaging people's property.  I can understand many things but I cannot understand that type of vandalism.  We have tried everything but we have not succeeded to date.  One solution to this problem is to hurt people in their pocket by making them pay for the damage they have caused.</P>
    <P>I listened to what the Minister and Deputy McCartan had to say in relation to the happenings in the city over the last couple of evenings.  We have a great habit in Ireland of blaming everybody except ourselves.  The latest now is that the media are being blamed for encouraging this type of behaviour.  I do not accept that for one minute.  If one switches on one's television set any night on most channels one will see nothing but violence and this type of behaviour.  It is the responsibility of the media to highlight what is happening in these communities.</P>
    <P>With due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey, who made a marvellous outburst last night, and who has had responsibility for youth and sport for the past four-and-a-half years, it is rather late to come into this House and say that the Government should be putting money into community centres and <Col N="1102" /> providing all facilities in Ronanstown or anywhere else.  What in God's name has the Minister been doing for the past four-and-a-half years?  If he did not like what was happening he should have resigned from his post.  He should be asking the question that most people outside this House are asking, what is happening to the lottery money?</P>
    <P>I was deeply involved in setting up the national lottery during my term of office. The whole purpose of the lottery was to raise money from the public, not through taxation, but on a voluntary basis primarily to provide sporting and recreational facilities the length and breadth of this country.  It was decided that other moneys from the lottery would be allocated to other activities.  It is very convenient for politicians from all sides of the House when there is a shortage of money for anything to take it from the lottery.  The purpose of setting up the lottery was to provide the sporting and recreational facilities the Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey, talked about last night.  Where has the money gone for the past four-and-a-half years?  I expected that by now when driving around the country regularly one would see large hoardings saying: &ldquo;This facility is being developed through national lottery funds&rdquo;.  I have never seen such notices. I have not seen one regional sporting development take place with the assistance of national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke like myself, had the great privilege and honour of being chairman of Dublin County Council and he represents a constituency within the boundaries of Dublin County Council.  The allocation of national lottery funds to Dublin County Council has decreased during the past three years.  The figures were supplied by the local authority.  I support the Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey, on the need to tackle this problem by investing funds and providing facilities.  I do not think any member would disagree with that. Putting more gardaí on the street and imposing compensation orders, for which we are making provision here, is not the sole answer to the problems we are <Col N="1103" /> experiencing.  I am aware that in addition we must also put in place various facilities; for example job opportunities, proper education facilities and a proper environment in which people can live.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I know that if we are to wait around for these facilities to be provided God only knows what will have happened in the meantime.  Whether we like it or not, until all these facilities are put in place we need gardaí on the streets to protect the ordinary citizen.  We need this legislation which provides for compensation orders, so that people can recover some of the losses they are experiencing through vandalism and damage to their property.</P>
    <P>It is trendy to say, nowadays, that having more gardaí on the streets or having laws is not the answer to the problem. Of course, it is not the answer to the problem.  Of course, there are other aspects, but if we have to wait around until the Government provide 260,000 unemployed people with jobs so that we will not have vandalism and robberies or savage attacks on people, God help us. In the meantime, we need gardaí on the streets, we need compensation orders, and we need our courts to be tough on people who damage property for no good reason.  I do not care where a person comes from or their social background; there is no excuse to set fire to a person's car.  This happens in working class housing estates as much as it happens in middle class estates.  The people in working class housing estates are not prepared to tolerate that sort of vandalism any longer.  They do not stand back and say the unfortunate chap who set fire to their cars is deprived or underprivileged or needs facilities.  As far as they are concerned, their cars have been burnt out and the credit union still has to be paid.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the concept of compensation orders but I would ask him not to weaken them, not to tie the hands of the court. I accept the Minister's amendment improves the Bill but he could take it a bit further by taking my suggestion on <Col N="1104" /> board.  If the Minister has a better suggestion I will be only too pleased to accept his advice and that of his officials.  In supporting the concept of compensation orders the Minister should give the courts plenty of discretion.  Instead of using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the Minister should use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which gives them a little more discretion and which allows for flexibility taking into account the circumstances of the case.  I accept the principle of the decision of the Dáil on Committee Stage.  I tried to have the decision changed but I did not succeed. I am asking now that the Minister gives a little more flexibility by accepting the wording I am proposing.</P>

      <P>As my amendment is being debated with the amendment put forward by Deputy Barrett it would be helpful to the House if I gave my views in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Under the existing text of section 9 (3) which Deputy Barrett proposes to replace, the court may not make a compensation order unless it knows who the injured party is and the approximate cost of making good the damage to the property. It is a reasonable guideline to impose on the court so that the compensation will be paid to the right person and the amount of the compensation is a reasonable approximation of the amount of the damage.  I emphasise &ldquo;approximate cost&rdquo;.  The court does not have to have the exact figures.  In many cases the convicted person will not be in a position to pay the full cost of the damage so it will be the convicted person's ability to pay rather than the cost that will be the primary consideration in determining the amount to be paid in a compensation order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment put forward by Deputy Barrett requires that the owner of the property be made known and that the approximate cost of the damage should be made available to the court. I appreciate that what Deputy Barrett wants to emphasise is that the court should not be prevented from making an order where the necessary information, while not immediately available, would <Col N="1105" /> be readily forthcoming in a short period. For that reason I put down an amendment to subsection (3) on the lines recommended by the Deputy in his Committee Stage contribution.  I trust my amendment will be acceptable not only to the Deputy but to the House.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for his congratulations in relation to the introduction of this concept of compensation order.  It is a major step forward in the battle against vandalism and malicious damage.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation because it answers a number of the points that have been raised.  On balance, amendment No. 11 meets the points made in previous discussions.  My basic difficulty arising from my experience as a member of two local authorities relate to the length of time it sometimes takes to identify the owner.  In a case I dealt with recently, the identification of the owner took about eight years.  The property had passed through probate; some of the people who had been willed interests in the property were in Canada and in America and some had died and passed their interests to other people.  We would get into all sorts of difficulties if we went down that road.  The Minister's amendment adequately meets the points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Barrett, I compliment and congratulate the Minister on introducing this revolutionary concept of compensation orders.  It is a mechanism which I envisage will be used on a wide scale by district justices. Deputy Barrett was right when he says that one of the ways to bring the consequences of crime home to people is to make them pay for their crimes.  I support the Minister's amendment but on reading the original subsection (3) not even that much was needed.  The Minister mentioned the possibility of someone being before the District Court and the district justice might want to make a compensation order but would not be able to because the information as to the cost or as to the owner of the property was not immediately available.  The subsection as <Col N="1106" /> originally drafted indicates that the court does not have to have the information immediately available, but that it can be readily ascertainable.  In that case the district justice could request someone to ascertain the actual cost and bring the information back in a short time.  I accept the Minister is trying to eliminate the possibility of the wrong interpretation ever being taken and he is trying to make assurance doubly sure.  I support the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett's amendment cannot be accepted.  I agree with the Deputy's sentiments and I agree 95 per cent with what he is saying but there is no real need for this amendment.  The original section 9 introduces the concept of a district justice making a compensation order against a person who has damaged property, ordering that person to pay compensation related to the damage done.  If a district justice wants to make such an order he must know who is the owner of the property, as there is no point in making a compensation order if the court does not know who is to be compensated. The court must also have some idea as to the approximate cost of the damage done as, even if the court knows the owner, they cannot make a compensation order in a vacuum.  The district justice must know both these facts.  If a case comes before a district justice that he thinks is a proper one for making a compensation order, and if the information is not readily available, he must get that information if he wishes to make the order. That is all possible under the section as drafted and amended by the Minister. Deputy Barrett's amendment seems to provide that if the information is not readily available the district justice &ldquo;may&rdquo; inquire about it.  The fact is that if the district justice wants to make a compensation order he will inquire anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett's amendment takes the situation further.  He wants to delete subsection (3) and insert a new subsection which would provide <Col N="1107" /> that the court, in making a compensation order, may require the owner of the property to be made known and may require the approximate cost of making good the damage that has occurred to be made available to the district justice.  The use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; there, indeed the general tenor of Deputy Barrett's proposal, would seem to suggest that a district justice be given the power to make a compensation order if he does not know the owner and if the cost of the damage is not known to him.  In reality a district justice cannot make such an order.  He must know who the owner is and must have some idea of the damage.  Otherwise he could not make an order.  Therefore there is no need for this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to the amendments we are discussing would be to opt for that of the Minister.  The issues were well argued by Deputy Barrett on Committee Stage.  I support in principle what he is attempting to achieve, that is, to give an element of workability to the section so that it will be effective and will not be avoided because of difficulties that may arise in ascertaining who the owner is or the extent of the damage.  That is admirable and must be supported.  To balance that, there is also the need for some degree of certainty in regard to the identification of the property and the extent of the damage so that an appropriate figure for compensation can be arrived at taking into account the means of the accused and the approximate cost of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole idea of compensation is an innovation in our criminal law.  It has long been the practice for District Courts and courts of higher jurisdiction to dispose of cases by way of compensation orders.  The concept is not new.  What is new is that for the first time we are providing statutorily for it in our law in so far as section 57 of the previous Road Traffic Act was not really in keeping with what we are talking about here.  The Law Reform Commission report states: &ldquo;There can be no offence in respect of which it would be more appropriate to <Col N="1108" /> make statutory provision for the payment of compensation to victims than the offence of criminal damage and the related offences we have proposed&rdquo;.  It is highly appropriate to include provision for compensation, which will make this an effective piece of legislation for the courts in dealing with wanton and mindless crime in our community.</P>
    <P>The other extremely important element of the law that has been introduced for the first time in regard to malicious damage is that proof of ownership is not an essential ingredient of the charge.  The concept as outlined by the Law Reform Commission is that when one comes to deal with compensation one is not dealing with a penalty but with a device to compensate.  It is, broadly speaking, in ease of the accused that he is given the opportunity to co-operate with the court in seeing that some restitution is made to the injured party.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it is important that the court would have some latitude in determining the amount that should be paid.  I get the impression from some of the contributions that it is felt that there must be absolute certainty as to the full amount, that the court be given all the time it needs to get the absolute final figure on it and that then the accused would be expected to pay every last penny.  I do not think that is what is envisaged by the legislation, and I do not think that is what the Minister intends with regard to it.  The compensation is intended to be fixed having regard to a number of considerations, including the extent to which compensation should be made, the capacity of the accused to pay and the length of time that would be needed to pay it back.  We are not dealing with the need for absolute certainties. We are talking about a process after conviction, where the penalty has been decided and the accused is being afforded the opportunity to co-operate in a scheme of restitution to the person who has lost money or property.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment meets the point raised as to the difficulties about knowing at the time the case is determined the amount of compensation <Col N="1109" /> necessary by allowing for a reasonable period thereafter to establish it.  Otherwise a court would be entitled to use its own common sense and fix an appropriate figure, having regard to the general facts surrounding the case.  Judges, particularly in the District Court, deal with these matters on an everyday basis and would have a general idea of what it would cost to replace a window, to repair a motor car, to do a re-spray or whatever is needed to put things right.</P>
    <P>I am a bit confused about Deputy Barrett's amendment.  For that reason I am more inclined towards the Minister's amendment.  It is not clear what he is trying to get at by suggesting that the court, in making a compensation order, may require that the owner of the property concerned be made known.  If he is trying to suggest the opposite, that a court need not have regard to the identity of the owner, then the amendment should say that.  It would seem somewhat inconceivable that a court could make an order for compensation without knowing who the owner is or being in a position to order to whom compensation should be made payable.  This is specifically a device to see that the owner of property is compensated, not a means of making an extra penalty payable to the court or the State for damages caused where the identity of an owner cannot be ascertained with reasonable certainty after a reasonable period of time.  I believe that the Minister's approach is reasonable and that the section as amended will be a good and workable proposition.  For that reason I support his amendment.</P>

      <P>My amendment will not in any way weaken what the Minister is trying to do but it removes any grey areas, any doubts.  I am a lay person, not a lawyer, but I have come across court decisions that do not make sense to the ordinary person.  Like many other people I am sick to death of listening to judgments being handed down interpreting what is in the Constitution and in law in ways never intended by the people who drew them up.  But convention, court practices and the grandiose airs which permeate the Four Courts and the Law Library are as near to the public as communism is popular today.  I often wonder if these people are living in the same world as I am.  Let me cite the recent case in the Supreme Court in relation to our extradition laws as an example.  Can anybody tell me that the normal human being would say that it is a political offence for me to hold a gun up to a person's head and threaten to blow their brains out and that, consequently, I cannot be extradited but that if I pull the trigger I can be extradited?  Can anybody tell me that any law ever passed or any constitution intend that intelligent people make a decision like that?</P>

      <P>Exactly, but when we read our newspapers and the judgments handed down we say that we all thought that so and so would be the case but that these legal people have interpreted the legislation in a different way.</P>
      <P>My amendment in no way weakens what the Minister wants to achieve nor does it tie the hands of the court.  All I am saying is that in making a compensation order the court &ldquo;may require...&rdquo;.  Any sensible district justice is going to inquire as to who the owner of the property is. Just like everyone else, I am using my common sense.  Of course he is going to ask who owns the property and what is its value but how many times have the drink driving laws, for example, been challenged on technicalities?  Some bright spark some day is going to challenge this and will say that the district justice did not establish who the owner of the property was and did not mention the person's name in court; in other words, they will so argue if the district justice is obliged to ask the question &ldquo;who is the owner of this property&rdquo; when every Tom, Dick and Harry might know that it is either A, B or C.  What I am trying to do is to ensure that the legislation cannot be challenged and that common sense will prevail.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the wise heads will interpret the law in the way the layman would because, from experience, I know there are people walking out of courts on technicalities which do not make sense to ordinary people and that interpretations are being put on the existing laws by the courts which, with respect to the gentlemen who make those decisions, were never intended by those who passed the laws in this House.  Even interpretations are being put on the Constitution that were never intended by those who drew it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me quote the words of ex-Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave.  He said that every country needs a constitution but that no country can afford one which could not fit on the back of a postage stamp.  There is a lot of sense and wisdom in that.  A constitution is necessary but the more words are put into it, the more opportunities people will have to pick <Col N="1112" /> holes in it, and I do not want a good idea to be destroyed by people picking holes in it.</P>
    <P>I do not see how my amendment interferes in any way with the intentions of the Minister.  Despite his generosity in coming forward with his own amendment to try to meet the points I made here the last day I honestly believe that the wording I have put forward is far better and safer than what will remain in the legislation, if passed in the form suggested by the Minister.  For this reason I would like to press my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage there was a fairly long discussion on the proposal in section 9 (5) allowing the court to provide for <Col N="1114" /> the payment of compensation during a period not exceeding 12 months.  I made it plain during the debate on Second Stage that there was no particular sanctity about the period of 12 months and that the appropriate period could be teased out on Committee Stage.  This was done.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, there is a view that payment by instalments should not be so prolonged as to become oppressive or unrealistic.  On the other, there would certainly be cases where payment could reasonably extend over a period exceeding 12 months.  Deputy Barrett, in his amendment on Committee Stage, proposed to impose no upper limit on the period of repayment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State undertook to table an amendment for this Stage which would not provide for any fixed repayment period but would leave it up to the court to decide, in the light of the circumstances of each individual case, what a reasonable repayment period would be and what should be the amount of each instalment.  I trust the amendment, which is in line with the current powers of the District Court in dealing with payment of debts by instalments, will have the approval of the House.</P>

By deleting the words &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; we will improve the legislation.  I could never understand the reason a 12 month period had to be established. If the court decide, depending on the circumstances of a case, that the period should be more than twelve months, then so be it.  It is wise to leave it up to the court to decide, in the light of the circumstances of a particular case.</P>
      <P>Given that, in subsection (7), we are giving a person the right to go back to the court to have an order changed, depending on the circumstances of the case, the courts will have flexibility to extend the repayment period further. This is a very sensible amendment and I thank the Minister for listening to the points of view expressed by this House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 40 to 48 and in page 9, to delete lines 1 to 13 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" />&ldquo;(7) At any time after a compensation order has ceased to be suspended by virtue of section 10 (1) and before it has been complied with or fully complied with, the District Court may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on the application of the convicted person concerned&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  reduce the amount to be paid, vary any instalment payable, or direct that no payments or further payments be made, under the order if it appears to the Court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  that the means of the convicted person are insufficient to satisfy the order in full, or</P>
    <P>(II)  on being satisfied that the injured party concerned has been given an opportunity of making representations to the court on the issue and having regard to any such representations that are made by him or on his behalf, that the damage in respect of which the order was made is less than it was taken to be for the purposes of the order, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  if any amount paid under the order exceeds the amount appearing to the Court to be reasonable compensation for the damage, order that the amount of the excess be repaid by the injured party to the convicted person, and, upon the making of such order, the compensation order shall cease to have effect,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(b)  on the application of the injured party concerned, increase the amount to be paid, the amount of any instalment or the number of instalments payable, under the order if it appears to the Court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that the means of the convicted person are sufficient for the relevant purposes aforesaid, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  on being satisfied that the <Col N="1117" /> convicted person concerned has been given an opportunity of making representations to the court on the issue and having regard to any such representations that are made by him or on his behalf, that the damage in respect of which the order was made is more than it was taken to be for the purposes of the order.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage there was a very full discussion on whether the injured party in a case of criminal damage should have the right to ask the District Court to increase the amount of compensation or the amount of any instalment, if the circumstances of the convicted person improved and it could be shown that he or she could pay more or pay it more quickly.</P>
    <P>At the time the Minister of State expressed the view that such a provision might be open to challenge in as much as it could be contrary to the principle that a penalty should be certain and not capable of being increased: a compensation order is not, of course, a penalty but it will be made by a criminal court in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, a fine or imprisonment, and is, therefore, intimately connected with it.</P>
    <P>However, in deference to the views expressed in the debate he agreed to refer the matter to the Attorney General for his advice.  I am glad to be able to say that the Attorney General has no objection to a provision on the lines of what so many Deputies supported being included in the Bill, that is, a provision giving both the injured party and the convicted person a right to have the compensation order altered if the situation on the basis of which the order was made had changed substantially.</P>
    <P>The amendment meets the case made in Deputy Barrett's amendment and I trust it is acceptable to the House.</P>

I will not be moving amendment No. 15 as the Minister's amendment <Col N="1118" /> meets the points I made on Committee Stage.  We were saying that if the perpetrator of the crime had the right to go back to court because circumstances had changed, then the victim should have the same right.  The Minister has found a way of meeting the requirements of this side of the House.  I thank him for doing so and I will support his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has responded fully and fairly to the issues raised on Committee Stage in regard to this point.  It was said at the time that if the order for compensation could be varied and reviewed by the court on the motion of the accused, a similar right should prevail in respect of the injured party in certain circumstances.  I am glad that it is not a right at large in respect of the injured party and that the section establishes two basic grounds on which the injured party can come back: where, clearly, the circumstances of the accused have changed dramatically perhaps as a result of winning the lottery, found useful employment or received a windfall.  Subsection (2) deals with the issue of the time the court fixed an appropriate cost which, subsequently, proved to be conservative and allows the court, on the motion of the injured party, to fix a greater sum.  In those circumstances the court may vary the order.  It is a very reasonable, sensible and workable amendment which will be supported by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only matter about which I am concerned is the issue with which I dealt on Committee Stage, the position of the parent or guardian in the context of the right of appeal against an order for compensation. In the Minister's amendment the right to vary the instalment is confined to the application of the convicted person concerned under section 7 (a).  I <Col N="1119" /> am concerned about the parent or guardian who is affixed with the compensation order under the provisions of section 9 (4) (b).  Why are they not being given the right to apply to the court to vary the order?  Section 7 (a) seems to be confined to the convicted person and section 7 (b) to the injured party.  Will the Minister advise us of the position of the parent or guardian who has a compensation order attached to them under the provisions of section 9 (4) (b)?  How will they have access to the courts to seek a variation in certain circumstances?  Will their right be confined exclusively to appealing, and nothing else?</P>

      <P>There is a principle involved in the amendment which I very much welcome, the fact that, for the first time as far as I am aware, legislation is now weighted in favour of the victim of crime.  Up to now all legislation seems to have been about the rights of criminals and perpetrators of crime; very little regard was had for the rights of the victim.  This is an encouraging example to the suffering people.  The principle enshrined in the amendment should be followed.  Legislation should be weighted more heavily in favour of the victims of crime because, over the years, there have been great injustices in regard to these people who have to pay for everything and suffer while the perpetrators of crime have been getting free legal aid.  Everything was to their benefit and now victims of crime will be able to appeal when the income of a person has changed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> In page 9, line 23, after &ldquo;order&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and subsections (5) and (6) of that section shall not apply in relation to a compensation order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to a large extent consequential on amendment No. 18, which makes it clear that subsection (1) of section 9 allows the court to make a compensation order against the parent or guardian of a convicted child or young person.  The existing law, section 99 of the Children Act, 1908, which empowers a court to make such a compensation order has two subsections which are inconsistent with the procedure proposed in this Bill for enforcing, and for appealing against, compensation orders.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of section 99 provides that any sums ordered to be paid by a parent or guardian may be recovered from him by distress or imprisonment in like manner as if he himself had been convicted of the offence.  In contrast, under section 9 (8) of the Bill compensation orders are to be treated, for the purposes of enforcement, as if they had been made in civil proceedings.  Subsection (6) of section 99 deals with appeals against orders made against parents or guardians.  The appeal procedure under the Bill is covered by section 10 (4) of the Bill, as proposed to be amended. As Deputies can see, this is a technical amendment and I submit it to the House on that basis.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises out of the amendment tabled to section 10 by Deputy McCartan on Committee Stage and is now retabled as amendment No. 21.

      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 30 to 32.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for acceding to the other proposals which I raised on Committee Stage.  I would almost have traded all of them for agreement on this amendment. We had very little time to debate this matter on Committee Stage &mdash; only about ten minutes &mdash; and I consider it of crucial importance to the whole process. I propose that the provision in section 12 dealing with powers of arrest &mdash; subsection (3) &mdash; be deleted.  That subsection gives a general power of arrest to a private citizen.  It gives the private citizen the right of arrest equal to that of the Garda Síochána.  Section 12 applies to offences of malicious damage.  Subsection (2) gives the right to any person, including a member of the Garda Síochána, to arrest without warrant anyone whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing an offence to which this section applies.  As I understand it, that is the current position in common law, that members of the Garda Síochána and any citizen can arrest a person whom they, with reasonable cause, suspect to be in the act of committing an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) goes much further.  It states that where an offence to which this section applies has been committed &mdash; the time of committal of the offence is not specified &mdash; any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom <Col N="1123" /> he, with reasonable cause, suspects of being guilty of the offence.  Subsection (4) deals with the powers of members of the Garda Síochána to make an arrest in certain circumstances.  Subsection (5) deals with the general power of arrest of members of the Garda Síochána.  Subsection (6) gives power to a member of the Garda Síochána to enter, if need be by force, and search any place.  Thankfully that power has been curtailed to members of the Garda Siochana.  It has not been extended, as has the power in subsection (3), to any person.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about subsection (3), particularly in a climate where there is a perception that there are not enough gardaí on the streets and when there is a belief that there is no effective policing and that there is need for individuals to form committees, set up watches and become more involved in policing and crime curtailment.  In this context I am not talking about the neighbourhood watch scheme which is vastly different from the practice we have been hearing about in places such as Bunclody and elsewhere.  People in these areas decided it was time to take to the streets to stop crime themselves.  I made the point on Committee Stage that I understand that one of the people involved in the Bunclody affair talked about carrying firearms on the street in pursuit of their objectives.</P>
    <P>It is in that climate that I am concerned about a provision such as subsection (3). Subsection (3) allows any person, without warrant, to arrest a person suspected of being guilty of an offence.  Heretofore in common law the general principle was that any citizen or person could not interfere with another person's rights other than in the commission of a crime, where they were a witness to the crime.  The point was raised on Committee Stage that this subsection is designed to cover the position where the crime had been committed, where the window had been broken and the person was running from the scene.  That is covered by the common <Col N="1124" /> law provisions which already exist.  Fleeing from the scene is part of the commission of the crime.  Where the citizen has observed a crime being committed and has seen the person running from the scene there is no difficulty with the common law power of arrest by a citizen in those circumstances.  We do not need subsection (3) to cover such an eventuality. What is dangerous in the context of malicious damage is that, for example, people on their way home from a disco in high spirits interfere with cars, break windows and throw stones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I am talking about a phenomenon in my constituency where people on their way home from a disco in Howth move through residential areas causing damage.  On the other hand, people take part in wanton vandalism and the public are totally exasperated by the fact that their property or that of their neighbours or the community is damaged or interfered with on a regular basis.  People may then come together and someone may say that he was told by so and so who did it or that it could be Mr. X because that is his form.  Suspicions begin to emerge. Indeed some well intentioned citizens may have seen the incident and passed on the information to such a local committee or for want of a better word to a local &ldquo;do gooder&rdquo; who, armed with that information seeks to effect an arrest.  I am extremely concerned about such a scenario because I have had direct experience of the actions of people who travel under the label of &ldquo;concerned parents&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that other Deputies have had experience of the same phenomenon, the so-called concerned parents movement; parents concerned about drug dealing took the law into their own hands a few years ago.  When they suspected people in their community, they arrested them and took them off and dealt with them in the way they believed best.  In the present climate where it is believed that vandalism has got out of <Col N="1125" /> hand and is as great a pariah as drug dealing was some years ago, and perhaps still is, we will see in time, in the not too distant future, committees of concerned parents against those who cause malicious damage, because in Northern Ireland their compatriots are doing this at present.  Such people have been taken out of the community and told to get out of the area; they are given an option they cannot refuse with the assistance of breeze blocks, firearms and so on.  The concerned parents deal in this way with the people they consider &ldquo;unsocial&rdquo; in the community.  I have no doubt that this phenomenon will emerge here, if it has not already done so.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made to set up vigilante groups in my constituency, but thankfully the whole community in an area considered a black spot of the city, ostracised them and ran them from the estate in which they tried to operate. However, this is going to recur, and when this happens the Minister will see subsection (3) being abused.  I am extremely concerned that this House should give to any person, as the subsection provides, the power to arrest a suspected person, if he has reasonable cause, as provided for in the Bill, but who is to decide on that?  The only body which can decide on that issue subsequently is the court, after the aggrieved person has taken a civil action and has brought a case against the concerned parents of this world.  That is not the way to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>Where an act of malicious damage occurs, it is well and good if the citizen catches the person in the act or catches them fleeing from the scene, having seen them commit the crime or, as the law allows, acts to prevent the crime being committed.  That is reasonable.  But should the citizen wake up in the morning and find that his property has been damaged, the proper course of action is for them to go to the Garda Siochana, report the matter and tell them their suspicions, should they have some.  The Garda can then investigate the matter.  Indeed if an independent person witnessed the event, it is his or her duty to go to the Garda Síochána, report the matter to them and <Col N="1126" /> let them act on it.  This section allows the person to go to the local committee and tell how he saw Sonny from No. 3 interfere with a car.  The people who have now the necessary suspicion will call around to No. 3 and haul Sonny to the local Garda station.  I am extremely concerned about the powers being given to people under subsection (3).  These powers are totally unnecessary.  The Garda Síochána are provided with adequate powers which by and large should be exercised by people who are trained, who understand how to deal properly with suspects, who know what a reasonable or just cause means and know how to approach and apprehend a person.  The ordinary person is not so equipped.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the ever increasing presence of security personnel.  If one looks at how they present themselves, one will understand the thinking behind this.  I have seen them come into court to give evidence and one would have difficulty in distinguishing them from a member of the Garda Síochána because of the clothes they wear.  A cult is building up in security firms, that the staff are indeed law enforcers on a par almost, if not entirely, with the Garda Síochána.  This development has to be watched extremely carefully.  We have to make the point that people who work in the security business have no more powers of arrest than the ordinary citizen in the community.</P>
    <P>We are all entitled to our freedom and we are entitled to exercise it beyond unreasonable interference.  The power of arrest has been grudgingly and gradually handed over to the law enforcers on the basis that it will be used in exceptional circumstances where a felony has been committed.  Indeed for a long time our law recognised that a raft of offences known as misdemeanours would be dealt with only by a summons, and even a member of the Garda Síochána could not arrest a person for misdemeanour.  By and large the powers of arrest should be given only to people who have been trained, who understand how potent the power is and have the expertise and <Col N="1127" /> knowledge to use it properly.  The argument that the aggrieved citizen who is wrongly arrested by another citizen may subsequently take a legal action is not a remedy and indeed will not deal with the emerging phenomenon of &ldquo;concerned parents mark II&rdquo; or the damage done to the person wrongly arrested.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to several passages contained in one of the foremost textbooks on the criminal law, <i>The Irish Criminal Process</i>, written by Mr. Ryan and Professor McGee.  They support fully my understanding of the common law and also, interestingly in a legal textbook, make some of the points I sought to make about the dangers of extending the power of arrest unduly to any person at large.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister of State on Committee Stage drew my attention to section 19 of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act as a precedent for the provision intended to be included by the Minister in this Bill.  There is a similar provision for offences under that Act. Having regard to the offences the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act seeks to deal with, I suggest to the Minister that there may not have been an arrest recorded in this State by any person under the powers of section 19 (1).  That Act provides that any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he with reasonable cause suspects to be in the act of committing an offence under section 2 (1).  Subsection (2) states that when an offence under section 2 (1) or (3) has been committed any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he with reasonable cause suspects to be guilty of the offence.  While I accept that there is a legislative precedent for what the Minister is arguing for in the Bill, the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act was different legislation to deal with a vastly different situation.  In fact, exception may not have been taken to it back in 1976 because I do not think anyone would then have reasonably believed that a citizen would attempt to apprehend or confront the kind of persons envisaged and dealt with under the provisions of the Criminal law Jurisdiction Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> The proposal before the House is extraordinary and flies in the face of long-established common law dealing with this area.  The issue of persons who may arrest is dealt with in the book written by Mr. Ryan and Professor McGee under the subheading, Arrests Without Warrant at Common Law.  It states:</P>
    <P>Every person of full age and,<i>a fortiori,</i> a member of the Garda Síochána is obliged by law to endeavour to effect an arrest if treason or a felony is committed in his presence.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>There are no reported Irish cases where a person has been prosecuted for breach of a duty in relation to this matter and the duty is now more in the nature of a <i>power</i> of arrest.  A private citizen who sees another attempting to commit treason or felony, may arrest him and hand him over to the gardaí.</P>
    <P>It is a question of being in that person's presence or seeing him commit the offence.  A further quotation reads:</P>
    <P>Private individuals are also empowered to arrest persons who are engaged upon a breach of the peace while that breach is continuing or if there are reasonable grounds for believing that such a breach is imminent.</P>
    <P>Another passage states:</P>
    <P>Although an arrest effected <i>immediately</i> after a breach of the peace is permissible, any greater delay will mean that an arrest may only be effected by warrant.</P>
    <P>The issue of what occurs immediately after a crime is committed is covered in the common law power of an individual to arrest.  Another passage in the book states:</P>
    <P>A private person who entertains reasonable grounds for suspecting that a felony has been committed is entitled, but not obliged, to arrest the suspect.  Alternatively, he may direct a member of the Garda Síochána to effect the arrest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> The following is the important passage in this regard:</P>
    <P>It is essential where any person purports to effect such an arrest or to give such a direction to a Garda, that a felony should actually be proved to have occurred, although the subsequent acquittal of the person arrested is of no consequence.</P>
    <P>The authorities are making the point that it is essential that the offences actually occurred to warrant the movement by an individual to either effect the arrest himself or herself or to direct a member of the Garda Síochána to act.  The book continues:</P>
    <P>A Garda must distinguish carefully between a <i>direction</i> given to him by a citizen to arrest and information given to him by a citizen about an offence. The powers of private individuals to arrest are rarely exercised today but they loom largest in cases involving shoplifting.  Neither store detectives nor private security officers enjoy any powers of arrest beyond those granted to other citizens.  In any instance where a private citizen makes an arrest he ought to hand over his prisoner to the Gardaí as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The most important feature differentiating the common law powers of the gardaí to arrest without a warrant from those powers which all other citizens enjoy, is that a Garda may arrest any persons whom he reasonably believes to have committed treason or felony, and it is irrelevant in this instance whether or not any offence has taken place.</P>
    <P>I have made the point that I wanted to make in relation to this measure.</P>
    <P>I believe the subsection is unnecessary and that the present law covering malicious damage as reflected in sections 2 (2), (4), (5) and (6) is more than adequate to deal with all circumstances that could arise.  For that reason I ask the Minister to delete section 2 (3) from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to explain the <Col N="1130" /> background to the provision.  The present law, the Malicious Damage Act, 1961, states that any person may arrest anyone found committing malicious damage.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission stated in their report:</P>
      <P>As we are recommending the creation of indictable offences with penalties ranging at the upper end of the scale from ten years to life, it is only reasonable to recommend a power of arrest without warrant for all such offences.  This power should extend to the Gardaí and any other person, where, in either case, there is a reasonable belief that (a) such an offence has been committed and (b) the arrested person committed such offence.</P>
      <P>The Government considered that that recommendation went too far because it would give a civilian a greater power of arrest than he or she has now in the case of a felony in that the civilian would be protected even if no offence had actually taken place.  The Bill provides that civilians should have the same powers of arrest and the same liabilities if they are wrong as apply under the common law in the case of felonies.  That is a reasonable approach that will commend itself to most Deputies.  The incidence of criminal damage offences is such that we should not be seen to provide lesser powers of arrest for those offences than are provided for felonies such as larceny.  I shall be opposing this amendment.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that in many of the points he makes he is confirming my point of view.  I refer the Deputy to section 12 (3), which covers the point he made.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where an offence to which this section applies has been committed, any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.</P>

      <P>The offence has to be committed, which is a very important point. I am opposing the amendment.</P>
      <P>In the first part of Deputy McCartan's contribution he dealt with vigilante groups.  I answered that question in the House yesterday.  I welcome citizens operating Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, but I could not and will not condone, and will do everything possible to prevent, groups operating outside that mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy McCartan's fears in relation to this section.  Of all the amendments we have welcomed I should have thought that section 12 (3) and (6) would have been amended.  With respect I must say I am not really convinced having heard the Minister's explanation. Probably that is because to some extent section 12 (3) is contradictory in that on the one hand it says:</P>
      <P>Where an offence to which this section applies has been committed,</P>
      <P>and then goes on to say:</P>
      <P>. . . with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.</P>
      <P>That wording would indicate to me that, in effect, a person could arrest another because he or she suspects that that other person actually committed the crime.  It would be very different if the subsection were to say: where a person sees an act or crime being committed or observes such.  The subsection, as at present worded, could lead to arrest by hearsay, because a person had a gripe or grudge against another in a housing estate, within an area, or perhaps because they did not like the political party of which they were a member.  I predict it could lead to all sorts of possible abuses.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the wording of that subsection even by way of amendment in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I contend it would appear to lead to the same type of circumstances obtaining in local authorities where work formerly undertaken by full-time employees of local authorities is now being undertaken by people participating <Col N="1132" /> in FÁS courses receiving half the rate of pay.  It would be better were we talking in terms of employing more Garda Síochána so that there would be more of them on the beat, on our streets, particularly in urban areas rather than, as it appears to me, to be transferring their powers to some extent &mdash; certainly on the strength of the wording of the subsection &mdash; to the ordinary citizen who is not trained or equipped and who could be subjected to influence in regard to a crime committed merely because his or her next door neighbour or somebody else tells them that, say, Joe Pentley down the street committed that crime, or that they would &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; he had committed such crime. After all, the wording of the subsection says: &ldquo;... with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the subsection were worded to the effect that where a citizen observes or sees a person commit a crime I would view it in a different light.  I feel very strongly about the power of a garda to enter a house, property, home, at any time of the day or night, simply battering down the front door.  That would not be a good development.  I am not saying that the Garda generally would act in an irresponsible manner.  In the vast majority of cases I am sure they would act in a reasonable manner but always there are exceptions to the rule.  I would prefer that that subsection would stipulate at least that the owner or resident of the property would have the right to allow the Garda to enter the property by agreement.  I have a vision of the Garda coming to a house at midnight and merely because somebody suspects that the person who committed the crime is in there &mdash; people may be in bed asleep or not even there &mdash; and, without warrant, simply force the front door and forcibly enter that property.  I contend that would be going considerably over the top.  I would appeal to the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have had a good debate so far and have reached a fair degree of agreement resulting in a strengthening of the provisions of the Bill.  I would ask the Minister, as I did on Committee Stage, to take <Col N="1133" /> a serious look at those two subsections and ascertain whether the same objective can be achieved while at the same time protecting the rights of the innocent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given this matter some thought since we last debated it.  I listened carefully to what Deputy McCartan said and share a certain amount of the concern he expressed.  It is rather confusing.  The Minister's reply could have been more comprehensive although I think I recognise what he is endeavouring to get at.  Without putting words into his mouth I imagine the intent behind this subsection is that if somebody saw somebody else commit an act of vandalism, or cause malicious damage, and if the perpetrator disappeared into a crowd and the first person saw him down the next street five or ten minutes later, the first person could physically arrest him because he had been seen breaking that window and running away.  I cannot see a lot wrong with that.  It would be foolish were we to stand back and say: I saw that person commit that offence ten minutes ago; but I cannot touch him; I have no powers to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan tells us that, in common law in certain circumstances even after the event has occurred, there would be the right to arrest a person under subsection (2).  If I interpret him correctly that is what he said.  The Minister has not confirmed or denied that contention.  How far can we go?  For example, could we say that a person, immediately after the event occurred, could arrest somebody or do so within a very short space of time?  I do not know what words to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are all sorts of things happening now I would never have predicted.  I would be afraid people could abuse the provisions of this subsection.  I have a fear of groups who call themselves concerned parents and vigilante groups of all descriptions.  My experience of some of them is that they operate under that type of banner but, when we all know who they are, they turn out to be different groups.  Therefore, I have fears given <Col N="1134" /> the circumstances in which we now find ourselves generally.</P>
    <P>Given the recent increase in extreme right-wing groups coming to the fore in many parts of Europe, particularly in relation to immigration policy &mdash; and recent results in the Belgian elections show that this is on the increase &mdash; I have a genuine fear that this racism is building up through these extreme groups.  I do not like extremes in any area.  I do not want to vote against this subsection if its intent is what I think it to be, but at the same time I do not want its powers abused.  I want it rigidly controlled.  I see sense in being able to point the finger at somebody who, ten minutes earlier in another street smashed a window in a car or whatever.  That is sensible, but I do not want, the following day, some group being able to wander up to somebody's house and say there was a car smashed last night and that they are arresting the occupant because they suspect he did it. People might tell me not to exaggerate.</P>
    <P>I do not want people in housing estates trying to create an impression by organising a group to sort out their problems.  The Garda are the ones to deal with such matters.  Will the Minister tell us whether this sort of thing is covered or can we limit the powers under subsection (3) in respect of personal arrest after an event has happened so that the fears expressed by Deputy McCartan will not be realised?  There is a danger under this legislation that vigilante groups could get control.  There is a widespread feeling that malicious damage will no longer be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I can envisage the scenario if ten cars are smashed in the driveways of a housing estate.  The following day a public meeting will be called and a heavy gang formed who will take it upon themselves to sort out the suspects by arresting them. I do not want that kind of thing to happen.  In those circumstances it is time to call in the Garda and let them do the job.  At the same time, however, if I see a person walking down the street who has, to my knowledge, thrown a brick through a window ten minutes earlier.  I <Col N="1135" /> want to be able to tell him that I saw him do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputies McCartan and Barrett and I can understand the fears expressed.  On reflection, however, those fears are groundless.  The Minister is trying to give the private citizen the power of arrest in the same situation instanced earlier by Deputy Barrett, namely, when that citizen has witnessed a crime being committed or in the immediate aftermath of the crime when he or she has reasonable cause for suspicion that the person being taken into custody is the perpetrator.  The private citizen has no power to impose any penalty, so there is an implied legal obligation on the citizen to hand over the detained person to the Garda without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not had the opportunity of reading the Law Reform Commission's report on this matter, but I was interested to hear the Minister state that the Law Reform Commission, who have a specific brief to give mature consideration to these matters, recommended that the Government should go further than the Minister is going.  They suggested that in certain categories of offence, some of which are covered in this Bill, the private citizen should be given power to arrest even when no offence has been committed. That has been considerably restricted here and the power of arrest is confined to a case where an offence has been committed.  Take the case of a person who hears glass breaking but does not see the window being broken.  If he sees someone running away from the scene in circumstances where it is reasonable to suspect that the person has broken the window, the citizen is entitled to arrest the suspected person.  If it turned <Col N="1136" /> out that no offence had been committed and that the window had been broken accidentally, the private citizen would be liable to an action for damages for false imprisonment.  That indicates that this legislation is very severely restricted.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy McCartan. I gave a commitment previously to check the common law in relation to the power of arrest for felonies.  I have to apologise, since I did not get the opportunity to do so.  I have a certain recollection of it.  As I understand it, the position is that any private citizen has power to arrest a person whom he suspects of having committed a felony.  I cannot see how this subsection takes the law any further.  That common law position has existed for many years and there is no evidence that it has been abused or that people have been adversely affected by it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan seemed to indicate that under common law the citizen carrying out the arrest must have witnessed the felony being committed.  That is not my understanding.  The Deputy cited an authoritative textbook which explained the common law position.  If a person suspects a felony has been committed and arrests a person whom he with reasonable cause suspects, he has power to do so under common law.  If that is the case, what is the difficulty about writing it into legislation?  I agree with the point made by Deputy Barrett concerning the law on extradition.  The law must be as clear as possible, to exclude the possibility that the courts will give interpretations of the law which we do not intend.  That is precisely what we are doing here.  We are writing into legislation the common law position in relation to felonies.</P>
    <P>We have a horrendous problem in regard to criminal damage to property. During the ten years since I became a Member of this House my car has been stolen five times.  I am paying through the nose for insurance and not once has anybody been arrested or charged with stealiing my car.  I suspect that the detection figures in relation to damaged property are very low.  I do not believe any <Col N="1137" /> democratic politician is in favour of vigilantes interrogating people in a Gestapolike fashion and threatening to beat them up if they do not confess.  It is not our intention to move towards that and certainly the courts would not countenance it, but, anything that would increase detection rates would have my full support.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan mentioned that people should report crime to the Garda. There are housing estates in Limerick city where people will not report crime because they are in fear of their lives.  In one estate 60 houses which cost £2 million to build are locked up.  When people move out, the vandals move in and rip the houses apart.  We cannot get people to move into that estate.  People queue at my clinic every Saturday begging me on bended knees to be moved elsewhere. We must bring that situation to an end. I am not advocating vigilantes or people taking the law into their own hands.  This legislation will not give rise to that.  There is a common law right when a felony has been committed for a citizen to arrest a person whom he reasonably suspects has committed the offence and there is an implied obligation on him to hand the suspect over to the Garda.  This is what this subsection is writing into this very controversial area of criminal law which has caused much anxiety to the people in my constituency and in other areas; it is doing no more or less than that.  Therefore, I do not see why this subsection should be excluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions on my amendment. Even though the remarks made by some Deputies are diametrically opposed to the position I hold, the debate has been useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems outlined by Deputy Barrett succinctly sums up my worries.  We need to be vigilant about how we draft our laws.  Unfortunately, a new and worrying dimension has emerged in communty life, not just in Dublin city but other cities.  We need to ensure that what we do here does not in any way unwittingly or indirectly aid or assist unlawful <Col N="1138" /> associations or groups such as the vigilante groups about which we spoke.  I am opposed to subsection (3) because, in the worst scenario, I believe it could provide for this.</P>
    <P>The other subsections of section 12 are more than adequate to deal with the issues and problems of apprehension and detection of crime.  I would rhetorically ask Deputy O'Dea whether, if this power of arrest was available, a citizen could have prevented his car being stolen on any of the five occasions mentioned.  If the people of Limerick are so terrified, how could they make a citizen's arrest of any of the people, about whom they will not talk to the Garda unless they band together?  If they do this, what will they become?  That is the kind of difficulty I see arising if people cannot meet merely to discuss these matters but can do something directly about them under subsection (3).  While there may be an implied duty on them under that subsection to hand over the person detained to the Garda Síochána, there may be too much manhandling and roughing up in the process.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to the report of the Law Reform Commission.  He may not have had a chance to look at the report but the Minister for Justice read out exactly what they say.  They deal with this issue in about six lines on page 39 of their report.  I have to admit that they dealt with this issue in a larger discussion document, which I do not have with me today.  Nevertheless they deal with this issue very briefly, succinctly and to the point in their recommendations.  The report has been ignored in other respects and to borrow it in this instance and say we should follow their recommendations is not an argument.  I am concerned that we are unnecessarily adding to the law in the context of what we are trying to do. For this reason I ask that the question be put.</P>

      <P>Is é an t-eolas atá <Col N="1144" /> agamsa faoin togra seo, gnó adhmadóireachta sa cheantar, ná go mbunófar é go han-luath.  Chomh maith leis sin tá siad ag plé tograí eile sa cheantar sin agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh 20 post breise i gceist.  Is é an chéad cheann, áfach, atá á láimhseáil acu ná an gnó adhmadóireachta agus thart ar sheacht bpost atá i gceist.  Ach amach anseo, beimid go léir ag cur brú orthu na poist sin a chruthú chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit a chur ina luí ar an Údarás go bhfuil géarghá le beart a dhéanamh anseo láithreach nó ní bheidh aon duine óg fágtha sa cheantar ar chor ar bith.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The management and maintenance of their rented dwellings are the responsibility of local authorities.  The costs involved are not directly subsidised by the Exchequer and must be met from rental income, the revenue portion of the proceeds of tenant purchase schemes, and the revenue resources of the authorities themselves, including the general rate support grant.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out statistical information derived from returns made by the main local authorities for the year ended 31 December 1990.  Based on these returns, the estimated average maintenance cost per dwelling nationally was £353 in 1990, the highest average cost was incurred by Galway Corporation, £658, and the lowest average cost £30 arose in County Louth.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to his first Environment Question Time.  Is the Minister aware that for instance in the greater Dublin area the local authorities are spending more on maintenance than they are receiving in rent revenue even though rents are now considerable?  Will the Minister initiate an inquiry into this scandal; would he not agree that the tenants do not get a maintenance service even though huge amounts of money are being misspent on it; and would he not further agree that this is one of the most scandalous and inefficient areas of public expenditure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the cost of maintenance is considerable.  The cost of management and maintenance is approximately £18 million per annum. There is an obligation on local authorities to ensure that they get good value for money with regard to maintenance.  In some areas of Dublin the local residents, along with Dublin Corporation, are involved in maintaining their own properties to a very good standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the £80 million that is being spent nationally on house maintenance and of the severe cutbacks threatened in all areas of public expenditure for 1992, will the Minister institute an inquiry to see if some more efficient and effective way could be devised of providing the maintenance <Col N="1148" /> service that tenants need at less cost to the State?</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the headlines of recent days about the problems of public expenditure, would the Minister be surprised to learn that replacing, for instance, a door on a sink unit is costing some local authorities £300 or £400 when a new sink unit would cost a quarter of that amount?  Will the Minister accept that the tenants are being ripped off and getting a poor service, that the taxpayer is being ripped off and that there is a need for an urgent review?</P>

      <P>This is a matter for each local authority.  There is tremendous variation between the different local authorities &mdash; £30 on average in Louth and £658 in the Galway Corporation area.  I know there are reasons for that variation such as the age of the house, the type of dwelling, the type of estate, the size of the house, the standard of maintenance and also the effectiveness of the overall performance of the local authority.  We are concerned to ensure that there is good value for money in the maintenance of local authority houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 19, 40, 49, 51, 93, 94, 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were notified by my Department on Friday last, 22 November 1991, of their rate support grant allocations for 1992.  The allocations for 1992 are the same as the amounts allocated for 1991 and I propose to circulate a tabular statement of the amount for each local authority in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to allocations for earlier years, I refer to Question No. 166 of 15 November 1988 for details of rate support grants for each year from 1980 to 1987; to Question No. 167 of 30 October 1991 for the 1988 and 1989 grants; to Question No. 57 of 20 June 1991 for the 1990 grants and to Question No. 198 of 27 November 1990 for the 1991 grants.  The 1978 allocations are set out in a second tabular statement to be circulated in the Official Report.  I should point out, of course, that simple comparisons between the allocations for different years would be quite misleading, since it is necessary to take into account also the various other adjustments in local financial arrangements made since 1978, including the elimination of levies and demands, the <Col N="1151" /> writing-off of local loans fund repayments, and the provision for direct rate payments by the ESB.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are obliged to hold a statutory estimates meeting within periods which are prescribed in the Public Bodies Orders.  County councils must hold their statutory meetings between 1 October and 16 November.  In the case of county boroughs and urban district councils, the period is 1 October to 30 November.  However, section 10 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 allows local authorities, once they hold the estimates meeting, to adjourn the meeting as often as they wish provided that the estimates of expenses are adopted within 21 days of the date on which the statutory estimates meeting commenced.  While the prescribed periods for the commencement of statutory estimates meetings may be varied by regulations, the 21 day period for adjourned meetings is fixed by statute.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice for most local authorities to consider the annual estimates over a number of meetings and this has been the situation in respect of 1992 estimates.  While I acknowledge that it is desirable to have an early indication of the level of the rate support grant for estimates purposes, I believe that the date of notification of the grant allocations for 1992 has not unduly interfered with consideration of estimates.  I recognise that the adoption of the annual estimates of expenses by local authorities before the commencement of the financial year has proved to be conducive to improved financial management over the past four years and I intend to adhere to this strategy and to facilitate it as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Pending the completion of the Government's consideration of the estimates for the public services in 1992, I am not in a position to determine the road grant allocations to local authorities for 1992. However, I will notify the authorities of these allocations as early as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleague in welcoming the new Minister for the Environment.  We know each other well having served in other areas of responsibility. I welcome the belated notification of the rate support grant received some 48 hours ago and, of course, I claim no responsibility for nudging the Minister on in that regard.  Will the Minister accept that the allocation made this year means a freezing of last year's rate and has meant in reality that since the Minister's party came into Government local authorities have suffered a 50 per cent cut in the rate support grant?  Will he accept that that has had a devastating effect on employment and services provided by local authorities and has crushed the autonomy of local councillors?  Will the Minister accept that it is virtually impossible for any local authority to strike a rate this year without further cutbacks in services and employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that there has been a 50 per cent cut in the grants.  For example, last year and the previous year there were increases of 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent which was in line with inflation, and that was given to each local authority.  The local authorities have responded very well to the national financial situation which the Deputy is aware of and which the Government have had to grapple with over the last four years.  So far this year 12 county councils, one borough council and 24 urban councils have adopted their rate for 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate support grant has been notified very late to local authorities. While I acknowledge that some local authorities have proceeded to strike their rate, will the Minister acknowledge that a small number will have difficulty in meeting the deadline because of that late notification?  Will the Minister be sympathetic to local authorities who request that that deadline be extended by a few days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not usual to extend <Col N="1156" /> the time.  There is a statutory period of 21 days within which councils are obliged to adopt their estimates.  The estimates of expenditure should be adopted within 21 days of the date on which the statutory estimates meeting commenced.  I have had one request so far to extend the time, and that is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that if any council have difficulty in striking a rate on time and extend their consideration of the estimates for a few days beyond the statutory limit, he will not dissolve that council but will give them some time because of the lateness of the notification of the rate support grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister prescribes periods during which the statutory estimates meetings must be held and it is up to each local authority to select the date for their meeting within the prescribed time.  The times set down are as follows: for county councils between 1 October and 16 November; for county boroughs and urban district councils between 1 October and 30 November and for other bodies between 1 and 30 October.  Once an authority hold their meeting they are locked into a statutory time limit which I cannot extend.  The Act lays down that an authority can at their discretion adjourn the meeting as often as they wish but they must adopt the estimates within 21 days of the commencement meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nearly all local authorities consider their estimates over a number of meetings before adopting them.  I can tell the Deputy that three county councils and eight urban district councils adopted their estimates before the rate support grant allocations were notified and that most of them anticipated no increase in the rate support grant for 1992.  I accept that in the past some local authorities failed to adopt their estimates within the prescribed period but did so subsequently when formal departures from the estimates periods were granted following requests by individual authorities.  If any local authority fail to adopt their estimate <Col N="1157" /> within the prescribed period I will consider the situation on its merits having regard to the report of the city or county manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has denied that there has been a 50 per cent cut in real terms but will he accept that the allocation for Cork County Council has been cut from £23 million in 1986 to £10 million this year, that the allocation for Wexford County Council has been cut from £6.8 million in 1986 to £4.5 million this year and that the allocation for Wicklow County Council has been cut from £5.3 million in 1986 to £3.5 million this year?</P>
      <P>In real terms, taking inflation into account, those are the figures I am talking about.  Will he accept that it is highly unlikely that Cork City Council will be able to strike a rate because they are unwilling to make massive cuts?  What is the Minister going to do about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to make.  First, there are variations for a number of reasons.  I have already referred to some of these, such as repayments to the local loans fund; for example, the ESB.  If we take Clare as an example&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is not insignificant. I would also point out to Deputies that the rate support grant represents only a small percentage of the funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A very small percentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Cork <Col N="1158" /> Corporation to which the Deputy made reference it represents about 9.3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the figure for the rate support grant; they have other sources of funding.  I do not accept that the level of spending has been reduced by 50 per cent during the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>

Will he acknowledge that this uncertainty is creating great difficulties for unfortunate Deputies like myself who are in a most difficult constituency and do not know where to work?</P>

      <P>It would be premature at this stage to discuss the outcome of the census to be published in 1992 but the Deputy is quite right when he says that the revised Programme for Government indicates that an independent boundary commission will be established once the data becomes available.  I do not think it would be appropriate to go any further until that information becomes available.</P>

      <P>Ten years after Stardust, a number of years after the Raglan House disaster and almost two years after the enactment of the Building Control Act, it is time that building regulations and building control regulations were published. Will the Minister give the House <Col N="1161" /> an indication of the level of fees proposed? Second, is it the intention to make this money available to local authorities, particularly those who will suffer a reduction in income as a result of the abolition of building by-laws?  Third, will the Minister say what caused the EC Commission to delay the publication of the regulations?  Was it because he proposed to introduce regulations which were below the standards laid down by the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of fees, they will be payable to the local authority for whatever certificate or approval system that might be introduced.  In regard to building control regulations, as the Deputy is aware, a number of options are available such as the certification system, self-certification by the industry or by a third party, independent certification, a local authority approval system or an even simpler system requiring that the local authority be notified of the commencement of work so that they could use their monitoring powers under the Act if they so desire or a combination of the above, an approval system for the more important functions, like fire, coupled with a simple notification of other works.  Those are options and we will adopt one of them in the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the delays in local authorities in making decisions on building by-laws applications?  In introducing building regulations will a time limit be specified similar to the limit which applies in the case of planning applications and planning appeals and, if so, will he indicate if they will be the same or different? Second, will he elaborate the question of fees?  Is he aware that the Dublin city and county manager made provision for a loss in revenue under the heading building by-laws fees in planning the estimates for next year apparently in the belief that no fees will be forthcoming from building regulations applications?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accommodation needs of travellers featured prominently in <i>A Plan for Social Housing,</i> published in February last.  Since then, housing authorities have been urged to make a more determined <Col N="1164" /> effort to meet these needs.  The authorities have, in conjunction with their assessment of housing needs generally, also carried out an assessment of the number of traveller families in need of accommodation in serviced halting sites. The assessments showed a total of 748 traveller families in need of local authority housing and 870 traveller families needing accommodation in halting sites. Housing authorities have been instructed to draw up clearly defined sets of proposals to meet identified needs for the provision of halting sites.  Funding for the provision of such sites has been readily available.  The allocation this year is £3 million and this level will be maintained and, if necessary, increased in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he urged local authorities to take on board the settlement of travellers. Cork Corporation have housed 110 families, provided three halting sites and have one in preparation.  Other local authorities throughout the country have abdicated their responsibilities in regard to travellers.  Will the Minister agree that local authorities who have contributed very well to the settlement of travelling people should not have to bear the brunt of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that some local authorities have discharged their responsibilities better than others.  As I pointed out, the Department have been in touch with local authorities and we now have a system of quarterly reports in place on the progress and provision of accommodation for travellers by local authorities.  The results for the first two quarters of the year have been received and while they show that only a small amount of progress has been made by local authorities it is worthwhile continuing the exercise as it puts pressure on local authorities to provide halting sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that looking at housing in isolation for travellers is a mistake?  It is retarding progress in many local authority areas <Col N="1165" /> because travellers must have their economic, social, educational and health needs taken into account at the same time as housing is provided; they are intertwined because of the culture of the travellers.  Because of that will the Minister consider setting up a national travellers' commission to co-ordinate and press for more progress in regard to this discriminated against minority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is an interdepartmental committee in operation and the Minister for Health &mdash; as I am aware from former days &mdash; is responsible for co-ordinating activity between the Departments which, I agree, is necessary in regard to integrating the travellers in the general community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the sixth report of the committee to monitor the implementation of Government policy on travelling people described it as patchy and inadequate?  At the last count there were 1,146 travelling families living in unacceptable, unsanitary conditions on the roadside?  What plans does the Minister have to ensure that unsatisfactory situation is resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past the Department and the Minister have been in touch with local authorities following the announcement of the plan for social housing.  We are also monitoring, on a quarterly basis, what is happening.  As the Deputy is aware, it is the responsibility of local authorities and members of such authorities have a major contribution to make.  I encourage Deputies who are members of local authorities &mdash; and members of local authorities generally &mdash; to ensure that further progress is made in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has only recently taken up office in his Department, will he review the policy whereby the Department pay only the capital costs of the settlement of travellers? Perhaps he will consider adding a certain element for the maintenance of the site as this has proved to be one of <Col N="1166" /> the biggest barriers in providing sites and getting acceptance from the local community? Will he include in the capital costs an annual fee for maintaining the sites as local authorities cannot do it themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at that matter as I will be reviewing all aspects of policy.  I do not know whether anything will come out of it because, in the main, it is the responsibility of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department provide 100 per cent of the capital for the halting sites and also pay 90 per cent of the salaries of social workers employed by local authorities to look after travelling people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the sixth report of the committee to monitor the implementation of Government policy on travelling people has identified that there are 300 more families on the roadside than there were in 1988 and have identified local opposition as one of the factors inhibiting local authorities from proceeding with their settlement programme, will the Minister consider evolving some kind of promotional or publicity campaign which would draw to the attention of the public the extent of infant mortality and other appalling living conditions which travellers suffer? It would be some contribution towards contributing to a greater degree of public acceptance and goodwill towards the settlement of travelling people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that there are more travelling families because many have returned from Britain.  Every opportunity is taken to create awareness and to deal with the problems, including health problems which unfortunately are more prevalent in families of the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister knows, <Col N="1167" /> there is a very heavy influx of itinerants in County Limerick and we have a very successful record of housing itinerants. Would the Minister agree that the most successful policy in the past was the integration of travellers into housing communities in the area rather than opting for halting sites?  With the decline in house building would the Minister agree that it is extremely difficult to integrate travellers into the community and in those circumstances has he any proposal in this regard?  There are now two types of travellers, those travelling around in big Volvos, with magnificant caravans, who expect the county councils to help them and also those who need help.  What investigations take place to establish the sincerity of the applicants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of accommodating travellers in houses or on halting sites, the views of the travellers have to be taken into account, and in many instances they have indicated a preference for halting sites. However, where they prefer housing obviously that should be the desirable objective.  It is important to recognise that almost 2,500 families have been accommodated either by way of housing or of halting sites.  While there is a major problem which has to be addressed, it is important that we recognise the progress that has been made in this area by local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in order to keep travellers in touch with their traditional livelihood he should make arrangements for the collection and recycling of scrap materials? Is the Minister satisfied with the arrangement whereby travellers have a reasonable chance of being included on the <Col N="1168" /> voting register?  Would the Minister care to comment on ways of improving that position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is need for a national change of view about the travelling community? Rather than see that community as a nuisance we should see it as a valued culture which is part and parcel of our inheritance.  We need to do much more to ensure that children are not reared on the side of the road.  If we are to be a Christian society it should be our objective that within a given number of years, say five, all travellers will be accommodated on properly serviced sites, if not in housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell.  As I have said, a co-ordinated approach is being taken on this matter by a number of Departments.  I am satisfied that my Department in their social housing policy highlighted the need to ensure more progress in the areas in which we have responsibility.  An indication of my interest in ensuring that local authorities respond to the needs is the fact that we are monitoring the position on a quarterly basis.  The main obligation is on members and management of local authorities to make sure that better progress is made.</P>

      <P>A measure of devolution in this matter has existed since 1974 in that regulations are made, on a county by county basis, following periodic reviews undertaken by local authorities in conjunction with the Garda.  While it is policy to implement local authority proposals as far as possible, existing law allows speed limits to be prescribed only in regulations made by me under the Road Traffic Acts.  I am in favour of devolving responsibility for speed limits, other than those on national roads, to local authorities, and I am considering how best this can be achieved.</P>

      <P>I am pleased with the latter part of the Minister's reply.  As the Minister is aware, at present a review takes place only every five years, in consultation with the Department of the Environment.  Is the Minister aware that it can often take 12 to 18 months for the Department to notify the local authority <Col N="1170" /> of the revision of speed limits?  I appreciate the Minister's concern in relation to the national primary routes.  I am sure he is serious in his intent in relation to the devolution of responsibility for regional and county roads.  That decision could be made by the local county council.</P>

      <P>As I have pointed out in my reply, for non-national roads there is no reason local authorities should not make the decision in conjunction with the local gardaí.  I am considering whether it is possible to do so under the Local Government Act, 1991, or whether an amendment is needed to the Road Traffic Act.  As has been announced we will be bringing forward a Road Traffic Bill.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the proposals which he has in place to implement the waste disposal and dumping regulations which are included in all EC directives issued to date; and if he will notify local authorities about the grant aid he will allocate for the development of proper landfill sites.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the planning, organisation, authorisation and supervision of waste disposal operations in their areas under the Waste Regulations, 1979, which give effect to the Council Directive of 15 July 1975, 75/442/EEC on waste; the Toxic and Dangerous Waste Regulations, 1982, which give effect to the Council Directive of 20 March 1978, (78/319/EEC) on toxic and dangerous waste; and the Waste Oils Regulations, 1984, which give effect to Council Directive 75/439/EEC of 16 June 1975 on the disposal of waste oils, and implement a permit system in respect of disposal undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Waste Regulations, 1984, which implement Council Directive 76/403/EEC of 6 April 1976 relating to disposal of PCB's holders of PCB waste <Col N="1171" /> must notify the Minister for the Environment of the holding of the waste and the planned disposal method.  The Minister is empowered to give directions in relation to the disposal which must be complied with.</P>
    <P>Under the Transfrontier Shipment of Hazardous Waste Regulations, 1988, which implement Council Directive 84/631/EEC of 6 December 1984, as amended, local authorities are responsible for the supervision and control of transfrontier shipments of hazardous waste in so far as exports from the State are concerned: the Minister for the Environment is the competent authority for imports of hazardous waste to the State.</P>
    <P>Under the Asbestos Waste Regulations, 1990, which give effect to the Council Directive 87/217/EEC of 19 March 1987 on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos in so far as it relates to the disposal of waste asbestos, there are provisions with regard to the transport and deposit of such waste.  Comprehensive legislation on waste which is being prepared by my Department at present is intended, <i>inter alia,</i> to provide an improved framework for the transposition into Irish law of these, and more recently adopted, EC waste directives.</P>
    <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 213 of 12 March 1991 as reported in the Official Report, column 610, volume 406, the disposal of domestic waste has always been the responsibility of local authorities and I have no proposals to change the position.  Grants of up to 50 per cent are available from my Department to local authorities towards the capital cost of providing co-disposal facilities which would cater for industrial as well as domestic wastes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply but he did not advert to the EC requirements on landfill sites.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 17, 24 and 33 together and to circulate in the Official Report a summary statement of returns made to my Department by local authorities following a request to them to report progress on the implementation of the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> as at 30 September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operational details of all the new schemes included in the plan have been available to local authorities for some months.  In addition, every effort has been made to assist local authorities in the implementation of the plan in a number of ways.  With the Minister of State and senior officials of the Department I met local authority managers and officials on 28 February 1991, to discuss implementation of the plan.  A series of regional meetings between the Department's officials and local authority housing staff was held in May-June, 1991. Bilateral meetings with local authorities have been held, where requested and all queries, written or oral, from local authorities have been promptly dealt with.  A compendium of the detailed circulars issued under the plan has been compiled and supplied to all local authorities. An information booklet <i>Housing <Col N="1175" /> Choice</i> covering the full range of housing schemes has been prepared and supplied in quantity to local authorities for local distribution.  Department officials participated in a seminar organised by local authority managers on 27 September 1991 and legal consultation has been arranged with local authority law agents.</P>
    <P>I expect that some 1,500 new local authority houses will be commenced this year.  In addition, while progress in the implementation of some of the new schemes has been slower than expected in the early stages, I believe that from now on these schemes should begin to benefit significant numbers of persons in need of accommodation and that their potential will be increasingly realised by the local authorities.  My Department and I will continue to monitor progress and to promote effective implementation by local authorities of the various schemes. Their operation will, of course, be kept under observation to see what changes, if any, ought to be made to improve their effectiveness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 56, 64 and 113 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aluminium sulphate is used worldwide in the treatment of drinking water and is accepted by the World Health Organisation and the EC.  I am satisfied that its use in accordance with the drinking water <Col N="1185" /> regulations is consistent with international practice and is safe.  My Department closely follow research developments in this area.</P>
    <P>A report of the Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland (1989), compiled by the Environmental Research Unit, was published on 17 October, 1991 and copies are available in the Oireachtas Library. This identifies local authority use of aluminium sulphate in 1989 to treat drinking water, and the incidence of alluminium residuals above the maximum admissible concentration set in the regulations. Some 1,992 samples, covering 456 water supplies, were analysed for aluminium content.  Almost 86 per cent of these samples &mdash; 1,712 &mdash; were in compliance with the requirements of the regulations, while just over 14 per cent &mdash; 280 &mdash; showed levels in excess of the 0.2 mg per litre standard.  The majority of exceedances are not far removed from the maximum admissible concentration. However 2.3 per cent indicate aluminimum concentrations greater than 1.0 mg per litre.</P>
    <P>The reports have identified aluminimum as a significant problem.  I regard any exceedance of the standard with concern.  However, I should emphasise that a casual link has not been established between aluminimum in water and Alzheimer's disease.  Counter-measures to deal with the exceedances identified are a priority in the programme of capital works for water supply.  Extension and replacement of treatment works and distribution systems, where necessary, are being supported by grants from my Department under that programme.  A small number of water supplies are treated with ferric sulphate rather than aluminium sulphate.  Further experiments with the use of this alternative coagulant are now underway.</P>
    <P>Sanitary authorities have also been asked to review all aspects of the management and operation of water supplies. The indications are that, in many cases, better treatment works practice and more active supervision could bring the drinking water quality into conformity with the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate to the House the degree of sampling that takes place and the frequency of the taking of samples in the various domestic water supplies nationwide?  For example, would he say whether there are any schemes where a lesser degree of sampling than is desirable takes place?  In addition, would he not accept that the 2.3 per cent of high incidence of aluminium found in water supplies is totally unacceptable? What measures does he take, either by way of alternative treatment or otherwise, to deal with that matter?  My last question is: since a number of locations throughout the country have been identified showing excessively high levels of aluminium in water supplies, what measures does the Minister intend taking to combat that problem having regard to its association &mdash; as has been pointed out &mdash; with Alzheimer's disease?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 59:</P>
    <P>In page 44, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where two or more persons are entered in the register as applicants for or proprietors of a patent, the Controller may, upon application made to him in the prescribed manner by any of those persons, give such direction in accordance with the application as to the sale or lease of the patent application or the patent or any interest therein, the grant of licences under the patent application or patent, or the exercise of any right under section 80 in relation thereto, as he thinks fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry has asked that four new subsections be added to section 80.  These impose additional duties on the controller. The primary task of the controller is to grant patents as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The more peripheral duties are imposed on the controller, the less will he be able to perform his primary functions.  Already the controller has many duties under the Bill other than the granting of patients.  He has to deal with restoration proceedings, replication proceedings and patent licensing problems, all of which are time consuming.  It is not appropriate that the controller should be overloaded with further peripheral time-consuming duties such as envisaged in the amendment at a time when the patent examination backlog is so large and the available staff are curtailed.  I cannot accept the amendment, which would deflect the controller in the performance of his main duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event I am informed that the duties in question, being of a litigious character, are appropriate to a court and I do not accept that the controller should be burdened with legal squabbles which should appropriately be considered by a <Col N="1244" /> court.  I received no representations from industry or from inventors to include in the Bill the sorts of provisions envisaged in Deputy Barry's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  What I am seeking is already part of the 1964 Act and it was included in a Bill circulated nearly ten years ago.  I recognise that there is a huge backlog of patents needing attention and that there has been a curtailment of staff. Several Deputies made the point on Second Stage that with the lifting of the Government embargo on staff and proper management the backlog could quickly be cleared and the Patents Office could become a profit-oriented body.  At present it is struggling.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that people should not unnecessarily go to court.  There is delay and expense involved and bad feelings are engendered.  I should prefer to see the Patents Office clear up these matters rather than the courts.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 80 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where a patent is applied for by, or is granted to, two or more persons, each of those persons shall, unless an agreement to the contrary is in force, be entitled to an equal undivided share in the patent application or patent, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if that is adequate.  It leaves the position somewhat uncertain because an equal undivided share can fall into either of two categories.  It can be what is known as a joint holding or a holding in common.  Either of these would fall into the category of an equal undivided share but there is a big difference between the two.  In the case of a joint holding it would fall on the death of one of the joint holders to the survivor, whereas in the case of the holding being in common it would not.  That half share would go to <Col N="1245" /> the next of kin of the person who died. Which is it intended that this should be?</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of A and B who apply together for a patent and are granted it.  Under section 80 as it stands they would each be entitled to an equal undivided half share in that patent.  If A dies, what happens to his half share?  If the undivided half share comes into the category known as a joint holding, it goes to the survivor.  A dies and B takes the lot.  On the other hand, if it is the type of undivided holding that comes into the category of being in common, then A's half does not go to B. B retains the half he already has and A's half goes to A's next of kin or to whomever it is left in his will or would go to on his intestacy.  The section leaves that matter open and in doubt.  I suggest that the holding ought to be in common and that the right of survivorship should not apply.  It would be prudent to spell that out in the section by inserting the words &ldquo;in common&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;equal undivided share&rdquo;.  If the intent is that it should go to the survivor, then the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo; should be inserted before the word &ldquo;share&rdquo;.  I do not think survivorship would be appropriate in a patent and I would welcome the Minister's comments.  In the interests of clarity we should specify which it might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This section regulates the rights of co-owners with respect to each other.  Under subsection (1), co-owners are entitled to an equal undivided share in a patent application or a patent.  Under subsection (2), each can use the invention without reference to the others.  Under subsection (3), one co-owner may not assign or license rights under a patent or an application without the consent of the others.  Under subsection (4), anyone supplying a co-owner with the means of putting an invention into effect will not infringe the rights of the others.  Under subsection (5), anyone acquiring patented products from one co-owner cannot be interfered with by the others. Under subsection (6), the rights and obligations of trustees or personal representatives are unaffected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I accept the reasonable argument put forward by Deputy Taylor in regard to how the rights of the personal representative of one of the co-owners could be affected.  In the interests of clarity it is appropriate that we re-examine this issue.  I think that is the Deputy's concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Pretty much so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Deputy is worried that the personal representatives, spouse or family of an inventor who dies would not benefit from his invention.  He believes that their rights are not clearly spelt out in the legislation.  Subject to advice from the Attorney General and my officials, I agree with the point made by the Deputy. It is very important that we ensure the rights of a successor, spouse or family of the co-owner of a patent are protected under this legislation.  The Deputy has argued that these rights are not spelt out clearly in the Bill.  I will have the matter examined by the Attorney General's office to ensure that these rights are clearly spelt out in this section.  The Deputy may wish to put down an amendment in this respect on Report Stage.  If he does so, I will have it considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, the Minister's response is satisfactory. However, I should like to clarify the point further.  As I said, there are two categories of ownership when a patent is vested in two people &mdash; one being &ldquo;joint&rdquo; when the rule of survivorship applies and the other being &ldquo;in common&rdquo; when it does not.  In the &ldquo;in common&rdquo; case the patent goes to the next of kin and personal representatives of the person who dies.  Usually that is a matter of intent. Two parties who wish to register a patent or property between them can do it anyway they like.  That is a matter for them to decide.  If they decide they want survivorship to apply they can do that. Similarly, if they want &ldquo;in common&rdquo; to apply they can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 80 (1) provides that unless <Col N="1247" /> there is an agreement to the contrary in force they are entitled to an equal undivided share.  However, it does not specify whether this should be &ldquo;in common&rdquo; or &ldquo;joint&rdquo;.  It is implicit from what the Minister said that it is intended the &ldquo;in common&rdquo; type situation should apply.  In other words, the right of survivorship should not apply.  I agree with him.  That would be the correct interpretation. If that is what he is saying, I agree with him.  I do not think the right of survivorship would be appropriate for the joint ownership of a patent unless the parties wanted it to operate that way.  It could be that two people who take out a patent jointly might wish, in the event of the death of one of them, the ownership of the patent to fall to the other and that the family of the person who dies should not be involved in the ownership of the transaction at all.  If they want ownership to fall directly to the surviving owner there is nothing to stop them so declaring. They would have to do this specifically. That is what the words &ldquo;unless an agreement to the contrary is in force&rdquo; in subsection (1) means.  If they want, they can have an agreement to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Assuming that there is no agreement to the contrary, we should clarify the matter.  All the Minister would have to do to put the matter beyond yes or nay would be to add in the words &ldquo;in common&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;undivided share&rdquo;.  This would clarify that the survivorship position would not apply and that in the event of one of the patent holders dying his share would, under his will or his intestacy, go to his personal representatives or next of kin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for further clarifying the point.  Section 80 (6) provides that; &ldquo;nothing in subsections (1) and (2) shall effect the mutual rights or obligations of trustees or of the personal representatives of a deceased person, or their rights or obligations as such&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. In view of the points raised by him it would be appropriate to have these rights clearly stated in the legislation so that there would be no ambiguity.  This could have major repercussions for the rights of the spouse or family of the deceased owner of a patent.  It could be a very valuable asset and there could be enormous legal implications for a family.  In those circumstances I am disposed to ensuring that there are no doubts in this respect.  This provision is taken from the 1926 Act and we should avail of the opportunity to update it so that the rights of the personal represntatives of a deceased owner of a patent are spelt out clearly.  If Deputy Taylor puts down an amendment for Report Stage on what he regards as appropriate we will have the opportunity to tease out these points in detail.  This is the purpose of a Committee Stage debate and I am very anxious to get the views of Deputies on the legislation.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the right of audience before the controller. Any party to a proceeding before the controller can appear in person or be represented by counsel, solicitor, registered patent agent or any other person being a person approved by the Minister under section 106 (3) to act on behalf of others for the purpose of obtaining patents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 106 (3) provides that: &ldquo;The Minister may, at his discretion, permit any person not registered as aforesaid, upon application made by that person, to act on behalf of others for the purpose of obtaining patents ...&rdquo;.  I am concerned about the question of right of audience before the controller.  Why should there be restrictions on this?  Why should any person not be permitted to go before the controller and argue the case other than a barrister, solicitor, patent agent or person for whom the Minister gives permission?  Why should such a right be vested in the Minister?  Why should a person who wants to appear before the controller have to make an application to the Minister?  Is the Minister going to set up a system or procedure to examine people and give them a licence to appear before the controller? This is unnecessarily restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking here about a court; this is not a court of law, it is the controller of the Patents Office.  There are plenty of solid business men and business women around who know their occupation and who are experienced in these matters, who may wish to take a brief and go on behalf of an applicant or a patent owner and argue out some relevant matter before the controller.  What on earth is wrong with that?  The modern trend in tribunals and non-court hearings is to open up these things to people who <Col N="1250" /> feel fit and qualified enough themselves to do it.  That is the best test of the issue, not whether they have a licence.  How is the Minister to know or to determine whether a person is suitable to go before the Controller of Patents and argue a point?  What criteria will the Minister apply?  How could such a position be wished for by the Minister?  Why should he seek to provide that power for himself in section 106 (3) which states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, at his discretion, permit any person not registered as aforesaid ... to act on behalf of others....</P>
    <P>What will he do?  Will he conduct an examination and ask questions before deciding whether he can go in?  If the person is a patent applicant or has a matter of contention pending before the controller under this Act and if he wants to bring another person with him or her to argue their case or make their representations to the Controller of Patents, what could possibly be wrong with that? This is a very backward looking measure confining it to elitist categories &mdash; barristers, solicitors, patent agents or this strange animal, he or she whom the Minister licences to go in.  I do not think that is necessary or appropriate.  It is a matter for the person going before the Controller of Patents to decide whom they want to take with them.  If I am a patent applicant I might value Deputy Barry's expertise in a particular field and want him to come and make the representations for me.  What is wrong with that?  Why should I not be able to take him with me if that is what I want to do. If he is an expert on a certain subject from a patent point of view, does he have to go cap in hand to the Minister and ask for a licence to be allowed go before the Controller of Patents?  I agree that the Controller of Patents is a very important person but he does not have that aura whereby a person who wishes to make representations to him should undergo some examination by the Minister.</P>

Admittedly I have not tabled an amendment on this subject but I would ask the Minister to have a look at this matter on Report Stage to see whether this is really necessary and whether we are obligated to do this.  I do not think the EC would mind whether we include this provision.  Hearings before the Controller of Patents are very informal, they are businesslike.  I do not think any casual person who does not know anything about the subject is likely to have the temerity to present themselves and start making representations on matters before the Controller of Patents.  At the end of the day it will only be people who know something about the subject who will seek to go before the controller.

      <P>First of all, 99 per cent of all applications to the Patents Office comes through patent agents.  There are about six patent agents operating in Ireland at present and they are performing a very important function.  We have allowed a situation here which the patent agents may not be very happy about but we felt it necessary to remove restrictions.  If, for example, there was an application on the engineering or technological side, one would use a person qualified in those fields to put forward an application to the Patents Office. However, we want to be reasonable about this as it is a serious business.  It is right and proper that my Department would have a position in relation to suitable persons putting forward their application. We are leaving it open but we do not want to have persons who would not have expertise in a particular field and <Col N="1252" /> who would be doing a disservice to the patent applicant themselves.</P>

      <P>It is also our affair, and I believe it would be right to ensure that everything is in order.  It is a very simple process and not a cumbersome registration system in regard to having suitable persons.  We have to have regard to the seriousness of this issue and we have to ensure that a patent licensee or applicant would use the services of a person who would be in a position to give the proper advice and submit a proper application to the Patents Office.  In fairness we are ensuring that this would not be a restrictive practice by expanding it. Deputy Taylor would have a case if we had said that all applications have to come through patent agents.  That would be a reasonable point of view.  The patent agents representative would argue very strongly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And rightly so.  Patent agents are responsible for 99 per cent of all applications going before the Patent Office.  We have a major backlog of 20,000 applications which is a very difficult task and we are taking action to resolve it.  This Bill will certainly be of assistance in this regard.  We have made it very broad by saying that any party may be represented by counsel, solicitor, a registered patent agent or any other person approved by the Minister under the provisions of section 106 (3) to act on behalf of others for the purpose of <Col N="1253" /> obtaining patents.  If you are applying for a patent in relation to a pharmaceutical product it would be appropriate to have a chemist or a person with a Bachelor of Science degree or who had experience in that industry to assist in putting forward your application.  The Minister and the Department will be reasonable in this regard but we do not want the use of unqualified persons who would not be able to assist.  I am not in a position to change this provision because it is an admirably reasonable section.  In practice I believe it will be effective and in the circumstances I will not leave it open at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I think about this subject the more hardened I become in my view that this is entirely wrong and against the modern trend.  The modern trend in this issue is derestrictive.  I thought the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, was very hot on this subject.  He will be bringing in the Solicitors Bill &mdash; and I have to declare my interest, as a solicitor, in this &mdash; under which, and rightly so, functions which until now were reserved to their exclusive jurisdiction are now being passed off to what many of my colleagues would think are unqualified institutions. Building societies would be able to do conveyancing.  Banks would be able to do probate.  Things like that which were formerly within the sole preserve of solicitors could be diversified.  That is a welcome trend.  Here we find a completely unnecessary restrictive practice being brought in on this issue.  Why?  It does not add up.  In many tribunals, for example, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the person who is the litigant before that tribunal, which also requires a degree of expertise, can bring in any person to assist him in making a claim even if he is not a solicitor, barrister or trade union official.  That tribunal works well.  Only people who know something about it in fact go in there, but that is the modern trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have an expertise in the various fields of patent law and patent subjects.  Many people would know far <Col N="1254" /> more about it than 98 per cent of the solicitors who are licensed to practice here.  My colleagues would not take it amiss if I said that 98 per cent of them do not have or have never had involvement with patent law in their practices.  The number of solicitors who would have expertise in patent law would be extremely small, yet in this section the Minister gives the right to all solicitors to act on behalf of an applicant before the controller of patents, while a person with far more knowledge and expertise of patent law than a solicitor is barred from going in unless he appeals to the Minister for permission.  That raises a very interesting question.  How is the Minister to decide such an application?  How is the Minister to conduct an investigation to find out whether or not a person is an appropriate person to be allowed come before the august personage of the controller of patents to argue for or against a patent, a variation or whatever?  Will the Minister run into all sorts of difficulties and have his decisions questioned if lone person is accepted and another is not?</P>
    <P>Let us be practical about this.  We know full well that nobody in his right mind will take it upon himself to go before the Controller of Patents unless he knows the subject and is prepared to argue if from a basic knowledge of the patent or industrial property legislation.  Why should it be considered necessary to introduce a restrictive provision like this giving a licensing function to the Minister on this question?  It is a very unusual and novel concept to introduce a provision that one must seek permission of the Minister to allow a person to come before the tribunal on behalf of somebody.  Will the Minister examine the person and his CV and ask questions?  How is the Minister qualified to know whether or not a person has expertise?  With all due respects to the Minister, there are plenty of people who know more about the intricacies of patent law than the Minister.  Is the Minister qualified to decide whether or not a person is qualified to argue a case before the controller of patents?  This provision <Col N="1255" /> is restrictive and it runs contrary to everything the Minister said he stood for.</P>
    <P>Confining the right of audience before the Controller of Patents to barristers, solicitors, patent agents and people to whom the Minister has given permission is completley uncalled for.  It should be left open to the patent applicant to decide who he wants to represent him.  If the patent applicant is as careless or as thoughtless of the prospects for his patent that he would chose to bring in a person who knows nothing about the subject or who would not be able to do justice to the application, let it be on his own head. As the Minister said, patents are very important and valuable products.  In many cases they are worth large sums of money.  We can quite safely leave to the knowledge and discretion of any person who wants to make a patent application, the choice of person to go with him.  It does not behove the Minister or anyone in this House to dictate who a person can bring in with him to argue the case.  That should be the patentee's decision.  He knows the score and who the experts are. He might want to bring in an expert from abroad and that should be his decision. The patentee should be fully entitled to bring in whoever he wants without having to go through the indignity of applying to the Minister for permission.  The person best qualified to decide who should argue the case for him before the patent controller is the applicant who will know the position better than anybody else.  I feel strongly about this.  The Minister is introducing an unnecessarily restrictive provision here and I would ask him to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor suggested that we should be practical about this. We have to be practical and that applies also to Deputy Taylor.  I am practical about it.  The Deputy referred to the possible knowledge of a Minister and his qualification to scrutinise a suitable person.  Under section 106, dealing with the registration of patent agents, the procedure is managed by a board appointed by the Minister of which the controller is <Col N="1256" /> chairman.  That would be an appropriate board to assess the qualifications of any applicant to represent the patentee.  I would use this board to assess the suitability of a person.  The Deputy is making a mountain out of a molehill because 99 per cent of all applicants want to get their patents at the patents office.</P>
      <P>The six patent agents have the expertise and knowledge to ensure that an inventor will get his invention dealt with expeditiously.  In this legislation we are allowing a person to select another suitably qualified person to assist in putting an application through the patents office. This is a step forward.  The Deputy referred to views expressed by Deputy O'Malley with regard to liberalisation in this area to allow for fair competition. That is certainly embodied in this legislation. The Deputy would have a very good case if we did not allow this flexibility in the legislation.  From the point of view of efficiency and effectiveness we could easily have provided that applicants for patents must go through patent agents.</P>
      <P>I would recommend an inventor to go through a patent agent to ensure that the proper procedures were followed.  Patent agents are experts in this field so going through them would avoid the possibility of putting in an application that was not in order and delaying the whole procedure. People would be well advised to avail of the services of the experts in that regard. However, in the interest of fair competition and to allow a patentee to avail of the services of a specialist to assist with an application he may put in the application without any regard to such an agent but will have the option to use some other expert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the points made by Deputy Taylor.  I have already said that if this Bill could be amended to allow a change I would have no hesitation whatsoever in amending it.  However, it is such an important event for a patentee to apply for a patent that we must ensure he has the best possible advice and assistance. It is only reasonable that the Department should have a say as to the suitability of persons.  It will be appreciated that the <Col N="1257" /> Minister would not personally investigate every application before issuing approval.  In this particular procedure &mdash; and Deputy Barry would know this &mdash; the Minister would be the person who would issue the actual approval&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <P>Deputy Barry has had vast experience in various Departments. He will appreciate that the file would come to the Minister and if the Minister felt he required additional assistance he would look for that.  We have a procedure whereby a board is appointed by the Minister, of which the controller is the chairman, to give advice on particular applications.</P>
      <P>The number of cases where this would arise will probably be so minute that I feel we are raising hares on this issue.  I do not think this is a matter of the greatest concern but if Deputy Taylor feels strongly about this he can put down an amendment on Report Stage when it can be discussed further.</P>

Of the 20,000 applicants for patents I would say that 19,900 of them will go through a patent agent.  If the other 100 want to bring in some other expertise they should be allowed do so.</P>
      <P>Having said that, if a person applies to the Minister's office to bring in some person considered to be an expert, I cannot visualise any circumstances where that would be refused.  That is the reality and I do not think this issue is really worth the time we are putting into it, with due respect to the Minister and the Deputy.</P>

      <P>We have to bear in mind that we are not talking about patent applications only.  I agree that in the overwhelming majority of cases an application for a patent would go through a patent agent.  However, this covers a much wider spectrum.  It covers any proceeding before the controller.  There can be all sorts of ancillary proceedings on a wide variety of issue affecting the patent, its use and licensing, and not the actual application, where a patent agent might not necessarily be the person involved in it.  I am not just raising a hare.  It is of more substance and if, as Deputy Barry says &mdash; he may well be right for all I know &mdash; as a matter of course any application made to the Minister to permit a person to go in before the controller, would pretty much be automatically granted, why go to the trouble of having this whole rigmarole put into the Bill?  Why not leave it wide open and leave it to the litigant to decide who he will bring with him before the controller?  I do not want to take up any further time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 63:</P>
      <P>In page 56, lines 3 to 6, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Provided that if in any circumstances he thinks it right so to do the Minister may authorise any person whom he considers suitable to act as a patent agent in a particular case or at a particular time.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to delete subsection (3) and replace <Col N="1260" /> it with my amendment.  The purpose of this is to give discretion to allow nonregistered persons to act as patent agents. The wording has been changed and is more general than before.  It is not limited to persons acting as patent agents in a particular case or at a particular time. However, for the purpose of obtaining patents it is more restrictive.  I recommend that the wording of section 86 (2) of the 1964 Act be reinstated.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Provided that if in any circumstances he thinks it right so to do the Minister may authorise any person whom he considers suitable to act as a patent agent in a particular case or at a particular time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have given this issue a strong airing.  Subsection (3) as it stands is perfectly clear.  It is not obvious therefore why the Deputy wants to alter the wording given that he accepts the principle.  The subsection, as it stands, was vetted by the parliamentary draftsman. As I have stated already, the register of patents agents is a procedure managed by a board, appointed by the Minister, of which the controller is chairperson. Subsection (1) states that the register of patents agents in existence prior to the commencement of the Bill will continue in existence and be maintained by the controller.  Subsection (2) prohibits any person, partnership or company acting for gain from describing or holding themselves out as patent agents unless they are registered in the register of patents agents while subsection (3), as I have already stated, enables the Minister to permit a person not registered in the register of patents agents to act on behalf of others for the purposes of obtaining patents.  Such a person will have to apply to the Minister and demonstrate that he has the capability to act in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances I would recommend to my colleague, the Minister, and to the Department that the board, appointed by the Minister, of which the controller is chairperson, who manage <Col N="1261" /> the register of patents agents be the first to vet applications even though it will be open to the Minister to grant licences or to obtain any other advice that he or she requires.  In adopting this admirable procedure, whereby the board appointed by the Minister will vet applications, we are giving further responsibilities to the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of appreciable differences between Deputy Barry's amendment and subsection (3) and I do not think Deputy Barry referred to all of them.  The first is that subsection (3) constitutes the Minister, for practical purposes, as an alternative licensing authority for patents agents.  It provides that the Minister may allow any person not on the register to act on behalf of others for the purpose of obtaining patents.  In other words, it would be a permanent appointment, and not confined to a particular case.  It would appear that the subsection, as drafted, gives the Minister a general right to appoint persons not on the register to act as patents agents at all times and for as many would-be applicants as they wish. Deputy Barry's amendment is much more restrictive in that it would confine the Minister to appointing a person in a particular case or at a particular time. In other words, this would not enable a person setting up in business to seek commission whereas the subsection as it stands would.</P>
      <P>Another difference is that Deputy Barry's amendment would give a right to act as a patent agent; in other words, to carry out all aspects of a patent agent's work.  This would involve much more than submitting an application for a patent whereas the subsection would confine it to employment for the purpose of obtaining patents; in other words, making applications.  It would not allow a person to carry out other aspects of a patent agent's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection should be reviewed and a distillated mixture of Deputy Barry's amendment and the subsection, as it stands, should be considered. Another look is warranted.  I am not <Col N="1262" /> happy with either as they stand but a mix of the two might be appropriate.  On balance, I would prefer Deputy Barry's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State said, we have argued this point already and I reluctantly accept his point of view.

      <P>Deputy Barry's amendment reads:</P>
      <P>Provided that if in any circumstances he thinks it right to so do the Minister may authorise any person whom he considers suitable to act as a patent agent in a particular case or at a particular time.</P>
      <P>That individual would not be a patent agent as such and would only act for the person in making that application.  That is quite a different matter to registering an individual as a patent agent.  As I said, we have six patent agents already and there is plenty of scope for more given that there is a backlog of 20,000 applications. It is a matter for suitably qualified people to put forward an application which would be scrutinised by the board under the controller and then submitted to the Minister for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are saying is that in individual cases a person may decide to get an expert to apply on his or her behalf.  I <Col N="1263" /> should say, however, that a person does not need to get an agent to put forward the application to the patents office. There are many people who were well qualified and competent to put forward applications on their own.  To allay Deputy Taylor's worries and concerns, a person will be under no obligation to engage a patents agent or an expert to act on their behalf.  That would meet the Deputy's requests.  This does not apply in the Deputy's profession very often. This profession is, however, open to more competition which is not the case in certain professions.  Indeed, the patents agents would prefer if we restricted it to patents agents but we are not doing so. We are leaving it open because we want to encourage people to submit their own applications and make the procedure as economic and as inexpensive as possible. I think Deputy Barry understands fully what is proposed in the section and, having elaborated on it, I feel he concurs with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 64:</P>
      <P>In page 60, lines 31 to 33, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a belt and braces section.  It states that the Minister may make such rules, except in relation to any matter appropriate to be provided for by rules of court, and do such things as he thinks expedient subject to the provisions of the Bill and <Col N="1264" /> it goes on to list 13 matters which must be taken into account by the controller. Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to subsection (1), the Controller may adopt such procedures for giving effect to this Act as appear to him to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>By including that subsection we are wiping out the rest of the section.  The controller will be able to ignore all the matters mentioned and do anything he wants.  This seems to be an odd way of going about it.  While it is very unlikely that the controller would ignore subsection (1), subsection (2) gives him this right.  I am not sure if we should give the controller a blank cheque in that regard. I would prefer to see him tied down unless the Minister can give me a good reason for including the subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hope I can give a very good explanation for including it in the Bill.  This subsection is necessary to enable the controller to lay down internal procedural instructions, e.g., guidelines for examination of patent applications. Subsection (2) merely clarifies that the controller has power to lay down internal official procedures and directions for the performance of duties under the Act. These would include guidelines regarding the examination of patent applications for use by those officers of the controller to whom the task of examination is delegated. Subsection (2) makes it clear by the words &ldquo;without prejudice to subsection (1)&rdquo; that the controller has no authority to make statutory rules under the Bill in the same way as the Minister or this House can.  In this regard, subsection (2) is very important to the Bill. In the circumstances, I could not agree to its deletion.  As I said, the controller has no authority to make statutory rules under the Bill in the same way as the Minister has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Post&rdquo; means any method of post but the use of the ordinary post would be the normal procedure. Registered post may also be used.  The purpose of this section is to permit the Minister at a future date to make rules allowing for the filing of documents by electronic means.  We are leaving it open in that regard because of the new technologies and procedures.  It gives the Minister flexibility in that regard.  It is not necessary to include &ldquo;registered post&rdquo;, &ldquo;ordinary post&rdquo; or any other prescribed means.  Circumstances will change and there is no point in having to amend the Bill at a future date to allow for new technologies which are being developed every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the section allows for new technology and so on. However, at present we are dealng with the provision of serving documents by post.  The Minister says that ordinary post would suffice but I wonder if that is a good idea.  We are talking about important matters which could affect the rights of people and companies and the serving of these documents on them.  Very important and crucial decisions could hinge on serving these documents.  Traditionally, documents had to be served personally or handed in and sending them by post is a relatively recent innovation. There is nothing wrong with that. However, having regard to the type of documents and the issues involved, would it not be prudent to provide for the necessity for the documents to be sent by registered post so that that could be recorded?  After all, anybody can say that a letter has been posted but there is no evidence to that effect.  In the case of a registered letter a receipt is issued by the post office and it is signed for at the other end.  It confers a certain degree of formality; we are not talking about casual <Col N="1267" /> matters, very important issues could be involved.  It is quite a concession to allow important documents of this nature to be sent by post but as the concession is made, would it not be prudent to say that it should be registered?  In that way if a question arises later as to whether it was sent at least there would be a receipt to prove that it had.  Such a degree of formality is warranted because it debases the issue and puts it on a very casual footing to say you can serve an important originating document which would arise under this legislation by putting a 32p stamp on it and dropping it into a letter box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point. However, in the rules which we will be preparing to accompany the Bill I will recommend that documents should be sent by registered post to ensure their safety in regard to the controller and the applicant.  Deputy Barry put forward an amendment in relation to the other prescribed means and, with the advent of future development in relation to technology and computers, it may well mean that the patent agent may be linked to the patents office to speed contact.  There will be quite a number of rules under the Bill which will be laid in the Library of this House in the normal way.  Deputies will have an opportunity of scrutinising rules made under this legislation.  I will recommend that we leave &ldquo;post&rdquo; in the Bill but in the rules I will recommend that documents are sent by registered post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister feels the issue is of such importance that registered post is warranted.  Having said that, I do not know how it can be achieved.  I do not think the Minister can cover the matter by rules and regulations. If he was to provide for that in the rules he would be in conflict with the section. If the section is left in its present form, allowing for the service of documents by post, and the rules provided it be registered post, it would give rise to a difficulty.  The Minister has indicated that <Col N="1268" /> a degree of formality should exist and therefore the section requires a variation. This could be done by adding the words &ldquo;pre-paid registered&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;post&rdquo;.  Will the Minister consider that either now or on Report Stage if he agrees with my suggestion that service of notices in this way should be by registered post rather than by ordinary post?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>At present applications may be delivered by hand.  Couriers may also be used although under the Postal and Telecommunications Act they are not authorised to convey letters.  We do not want to tie ourselves down too much in the Bill.  There will be more flexibility to include that provision in the rules and regulations rather than in the section.  In this case &ldquo;post&rdquo; means &ldquo;post and other prescribed means&rdquo;.  It might be restrictive to specify in the Bill the words &ldquo;registered post&rdquo; because there are other methods of transmitting messages such as recorded post and other terminologies may arise in the future.  The word &ldquo;post&rdquo; is clear and specific.  When making rules under this Bill the Minister and the Department will have an opportunity of including the words &ldquo;registered post&rdquo; or, perhaps, other forms of postal delivery which may be introduced in the future. Perhaps, &ldquo;couriers&rdquo; also could be included in future legislation.  I am leaving the section as open as possible so that we do not have to come back to amend it in circumstances of changing technology or changing practices in future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
      <P>In page 68, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Subject to subsections (1), (3) and (4) of this section, section 120 in <Col N="1269" /> its operation in relation to an international application for a patent designating the State which is treated by virtue of the European Patent Convention as an application for a European patent designating the State, shall have effect as if any reference in that section to anything done in relation to the application under the European Patent Convention included a reference to the corresponding thing done under the Treaty.</P>
    <P>(3) Any application described in subsection (2) which is published under the Treaty shall be treated for the purposes of section 11 (3) as published when, and only when, a copy of the application has been supplied to the European Patent Office in English, French or German and the relevant fee not exceeding the reasonable cost of providing a service has been paid under the European Patent Convention.</P>
    <P>(4) Any application described in subsection (2) which is published under the Treaty in a language other than English, French or German shall, subject to section 120 (6), be treated for the purposes of section 56 as published when, and only when, it is re-published in English, French or German by the European Patent Office under the European Patent Convention.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since I put down this amendment I have been advised that if section 127 (1) is taken in conjunction with the European Patent Convention it would be sufficient to allow section 120 of the Bill to be interpreted as applying to international applications filed and published under the Patent Co-operation Treaty.  I understand the Minister also has been so advised.  If he can give me an assurance on that &mdash; he is nodding acceptance &mdash; I will withdraw paragraphs (2) and (4) of amendment No. 66.</P>
    <P>However, paragraph (3) of the amendment is still necessary.  I understand that this matter is not dealt with under the European Patent Convention because it concerns the prior art effect of the Patent Co-Operation Treaty application against <Col N="1270" /> a national application under section 11 (3).  If paragraph (3) of amendment No. 66 is not introduced into the Bill a Patent Co-operation Treaty application will serve as prior art, that is the state of the art, against an Irish application of later priority date even if the Patent Co-operation Treaty application is published after the date of the Irish application in some other language such as Japanese, Russian or Mongolian and even if the fees are never paid to the European Patent Office to bring the Patent Co-operation Treaty application into effect as a European application.  That is complicated and difficult and I hope the Minister understands the point I was making.  If he takes the opportunity to study it he will see it is correct.  I do not want to force him to accept an amendment in this regard at this stage but, perhaps, he will undertake to consider the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment to insert additional subsections is misconceived. Section 127 was drafted with the assistance of the experts in the World Intellectual Property Organisation who administer the Patent Co-operation Treaty, and there is no need for an amendment.  The points raised by Deputy Barry are reasonable but I do not think the amendment is necessary.  I will consider the matter between now and Report Stage if the Deputy feels it would improve the Bill.  I am not giving a commitment to bring in an amendment but I will consider the points put forward in the House and Deputy Barry's amendment which we did not have the advantage of when considering the matter originally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section and I appeal to other Members to oppose it also.  This section is a total negation of democracy.  The Minister has very extensive powers under this Bill and if we agree to this section we will be giving him even more power.  There probably would not be a Patents Bill, 1991, if the Minister had taken these powers in a previous Act. I feel strongly that if it becomes necessary to amend this section of patent law it should be done in the House; it should not be a prerogative of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to this section in the context of a point I made on section 114.  I ask the Minister to consider subsection (2) which states that the Minister may by order revoke or amend an order under this section.  Subsection (1) gives the Minister power to make an order while subsection (2) gives the Minister power to revoke or amend such orders, but he does not have that power under section 114.  If he is happy with that position that is all right but I am simply drawing his attention to the distinction in the format between those two provisions.  It highlights the point I made earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the concerns addressed by Deputy Garland in his amendment opposing section 128.  I will elaborate further on the section.  It is envisaged in this section that at a future date the European Patent Convention, the Patent Co-operation Treaty or other international conventions to which the State is a party, may be amended, and it is considered expedient, therefore, that the Minister should have power by order to make any necessary provisions to give effect to such an amendment without the necessity to come back each time to the Dáil with primary amending legislation. The Minister would have to place a copy of the rules in the Library and at that stage Deputy Garland or any other <Col N="1272" /> Deputy would be in a position to object to them within 21 days and then the matter would have to be debated in this House. This is a far better procedure than having to amend the legislation on a regular basis because of the changes, some of which may be minor, that will take place and it leaves us with a little more flexibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor said subsection 2 provides that the Minister may by order revoke or amend an order under this section.  This is also provided for in section 3 (4).  The question of revoking or amending an order under the section is clearly stated and gives us such rights, but section 3 (4) also gives us such rights. It states:</P>
      <P>The power to make an order includes power to amend or revoke the order, except in the case of an order under section 1 (2).</P>
      <P>That should allay Deputy Taylor's concern that we have made provision in the Bill to revoke or amend an order under this section.  All such orders will have to be placed in the Library.  Members who wish to object will have the opportunity to lodge such objections within 21 days and the matter will then be debated in this House.  Indeed, as Deputy Garland has said this will afford this House an inbuilt protection in the legislation, in that the Bill could not be amended without due regard to the rights of Members to have the matter debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point with regard to section 3 (4) but in the light of that it seems to me that section 128 (2) should not be there at all because we are simply saying the same thing twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point, but nevertheless it is needed to make the provision quite clear because it refers <Col N="1273" /> specifically to section 128 without refering back to section 3.  We could refer back to section 3 (4) instead of inserting subsection (2) to the section and that would be quite clear.  But I believe that subsection (2) ensures that Deputy Garland's concern is more easily satisifed than by not including it, but it is a slight duplication.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  This is an important section. The Deputy's amendment restricts the additional term of four years to those patents granted under the 1964 Act which have more than ten years left to run when the Bill comes into force.  This would not be equitable when we are so much further behind other European countries in having a patent term of 20 years.  Other European countries have had a 20 year term for the past 14 years or so.  The question of granting an additional four years has to be viewed in the context of the counter balancing provisions of paragraphs 2 (3) and 4 of the Schedule in particular paragraph 4 which significantly circumscribes the effect of the extra four years.  In the circumstances it is very important that that should be clarified.  I know that concern has been expressed by the manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals. However paragraph 3 (1) of the transitional provisions deals with the treatment of petitioning for the extension of the 1964 Act patents, which are still pending when the Bill will become law. The paragraph as amended by the Minister's amendment No. 73a, was prepared with a view to curtailing as much as possible and within constitutional constraints, the duration of extensions in these cases. <Col N="1276" /> The effect of the amendment is as follows: to abolish the link between the extension possible and the length of time an extension petition was pending; to provide for a four-year extension in all cases where a petition has not been opposed; and to provide, in any case where an extension has been opposed, that the petition will be decided under the provisions of the 1964 Act.  Even though this might result in a few cases in an extension of more than four years, it is necessary for constitutional reasons to permit the continued operation of the 1964 Act in those cases and not to wipe out proceedings already in train before the court.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 4 relating to transitional provisions was included with the specific interests of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in mind.  In relation to patents extended under paragraph 2 (1) or paragraph 3 (1) it is provided that any third party may, during the final two years of such extension, make all such preparations, except importation or marketing of a patented product, as would normally have to be undertaken to place a generic version of a pharmaceutical product on the market.  Such preparatory work will be immune from actions for infringement of the relevant patent and will provide a valuable headstart for full commercial marketing after the term of the patented product expires.</P>
      <P>I have given very careful consideration to this matter because the views of the generic pharmaceutical industry, which is of vital importance to the economy, have to be balanced against those of the patented pharmaceutical industry, which is of equal importance.  In Solomon fashion the Bill has to balance all considerations. I feel that I have come up with a reasonable provision in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the weekend I received many representations about this matter, partly because of my former association with the Health portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of medicines in this country is extremely high by any international comparison.  The drugs Bill is of the order <Col N="1277" /> of £120 million.  In our industrial development we have created several factories spawned from what is called the generic chemical industry.  Clonmel Chemicals would be a very good example of that. When the lifetime of a patent is over anyone can make a particular drug under licence from the National Drugs Advisory Board.  That is a very brief explanation of the production of generic drugs. Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers cannot produce a &ldquo;St. Bernard&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Yellow Pack&rdquo; variation of that drug, they have to make the identical product. The significance of that is that generic drugs are often sold for half the price of patented branded products.  Therefore, a huge saving is made to the taxpayer by developing a strong generic industry.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that there is the potential for job losses in the generic sector and that serious disruption may be caused by those who have patents exploiting them for a period longer than that reasonably needed by them to recoup their special research and development costs.</P>
    <P>In support of Deputy Barry's amendment, I must say that it is vital to promote a generic chemical industry.  It is vital that we have cheaper drugs because the savings made could go towards developing an improved health service with better hospital care, nursing care and so on.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his position and to give his views of the job effects in the generic chemical industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Yates, I have considerable problems with the wording of the Bill, to start with.  The Minister appears to have made some improvements but I am not entirely satisfied that it has been improved sufficiently. Nor am I entirely satisfied with Deputy Barry's amendment.  Therefore, I am reserving the right to put down an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important part of the Bill.  Having been involved in the Department of Health, I too, am <Col N="1278" /> well aware of the cost of drugs to the economy.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we have a mix between branded manufacturers and generic manufacturers. Drugs produced by generic manufacturers are not necessarily very cheap compared with branded products. I have to balance the conflicting demands of the branded patented products, which are produced in this country, against generic products.  There is a feeling, and this is evident in Deputy Yates' point of view, that Ireland has only generic producers, but that is not the case.  The actual branded production of even bulk pharmaceuticals is of vital importance to our economy and accounts for a high degree of our export revenue.  That is the balance that the Minister, myself and the Department of Industry and Commerce officials have to bear in mind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland says he will review the situation and may decide to put down an amendment on Report Stage.  That is his entitlement, and it would provide the House with a further opportunity to tease out the issue.</P>
      <P>I have met representatives of different interest groups and I have received representatives from interests on both sides.</P>
      <P>Members have concentrated on the pharmaceutical industry but it is not the only industry to be affected by the Bill. This is not a Drugs Patents Bill, it is a Patents Bill.  It deals with electronics as well as all other kinds of products.  When one considers that there are 20,000 applications pending at this stage, one realises the variety of those applications.  There is a tendency &mdash; and an over-concentration, I might add with respect to Deputy Yates &mdash; to deal only with generic drugs and branded product drugs.  It is interesting that we have not received many representations from other industries producing branded products and patented products that are of great significance to the economy as well as to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To elaborate once again because, as I said, this is a very important part of the Bill, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 which relate to the transitional provisions, when taken together, from a package of proposals for <Col N="1279" /> the treatment of the 1964 Act patents following the coming into force of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 (1) of the transitional provisions permits an additional four years to be added on to the term of patents that are still live when the Bill comes into force.  Anyone with a patent that expires before the Bill comes into force will not be able to avail of these provisions.  The patents involved with the new provisions will have a 20-year term instead of a 16-year term.  Equity requires that a provision to that effect should be enshrined in the Bill.  It is important to note that this applies in respect of all patents, irrespective of subject matter.  Ireland is now some 12 to 15 years behind its European partners in providing a patent term of 20 years.  To refuse now to do what is provided in paragraph 2 (1) would give the wrong signal to the international community as regards our seriousness about protecting inventions, and individual patent holders who have been kept waiting for so long for a patent term in Ireland comparable to other European countries would, to say the least, feel very let down. We owe them a gesture of goodwill.  But let it not be forgotten that we are also taking away certain rights that patent holders have under the present law, and I shall deal with those in a moment.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, paragraph 2 (1) applies across the board, irrespective of the subject matter of a patent.  The only sector which has demurred in relation to paragraph 2 (1) is the generic pharmaceutical industry.  Their representations have, nevertheless, been given serious consideration and the opportunity has been taken to include certain restrictive provisions in paragraphs 2 (3), paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of the transitional provisions.</P>
    <P>It is worth considering the effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the transitional provisions which will directly benefit the interests of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers.  With regard to paragraph 2 (3) of the transitional provisions I should say this subparagraph bans the making of petitions to extend the term of <Col N="1280" /> patents granted under the present Act after the enactment of this Bill.  This is a significant curtailment of existing rights in that at present a patent holder is entitled to make a petition to the court or to the controller for an extension of his patent term and the law allows for the grant of an extension of five years or, in certain circumstances, up to ten years. The curtailment of this right brought about by paragraph 2 (3) is of direct benefit to generic manufacturers who, because of it, can make future plans on the basis of the certainty provided by that paragraph.</P>
    <P>I want to place on the record quite clearly that paragraph 3 (1) of the transitional provisions deals with the treatment of petitions for the extension of the 1964 Act patents still pending when this Bill becomes law.  The paragraph, as amended by the Minister's amendment No. 73 (a) was prepared with a view to curtailing as much as possible, and within constitutional constraints, the duration of extensions in these cases.  The effect of the amendment will be (i) to abolish the link between the extension possible and the length of time an extension petition was pending; (ii) to provide for a four-year extension in all cases where a petition had not been opposed and (iii) to provide, in any case where an extension has been opposed, that the petition will be decided under the provisions of the 1964 Act.  Even though this might result in a few cases in an extension of more than four years it is necessary, for constitutional reasons, to permit the continued operation of the 1964 Act in those cases and not wipe out proceedings already in train before the courts.</P>
    <P>I have very carefully considered this provision.  It is very important that those rights be retained by cases before the courts at this stage.  It would not be constitutionally proper that we in this House would have the right to wipe out the rights granted under that 1964 Act.  I am very conscious of that and have taken sound advice from the Attorney General's office in that regard.  This is a key provision of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate that paragraph 4 of <Col N="1281" /> the transitional provisions was included with the specific interests of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in mind. In relation to patents extended under paragraph 2 (1) or paragraph 3 (1) it is provided that any third party may, during the final two years of such extension, make all such preparations &mdash; except the importation or marketing of a patented product &mdash; as would normally have to be undertaken to place a generic version of a pharmaceutical product on the market.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Yates will be fully aware, to place a product on the market requires the licensing of the drugs organisation here.  That is required for a generic product as much as a branded product.  A generic product must be fully examined by Dr. Scott, or any future &ldquo;Dr. Scott&rdquo;, who may so require.  Having dealt with that organisation, in the Department of Health, I must say it is regarded as one of the most effective and efficient regulatory bodies and is recognised as such in Europe and in the USA for the work they carry out.  In my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Health I went to inspect it and was very impressed. They are very conscious of the need to place drugs on the market as quickly as possible, considering the health and well-being of our citizens.  A generic drug must be subjected to the full regulatory procedures. We are giving generic manufacturers an opportunity to commence their research work two years before the patent expires.  This will be of great assistance to them but it may take five to eight years to get a product onto the market.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that, fortunately in our economy, we have generic companies doing tremendous work.  I want to compliment them because I have worked with them at home and abroad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in my role as Minister responsible for trade and marketing.  I have supported and will continue to support generic drug manufacturers.  But the generic drug manufacturers themselves can become the branded, patended, producers of the future; they are in that <Col N="1282" /> field also.  I can give examples in my constituency, one of which is the Elan Corporation who employ 375 people who have branded products as well as, I presume, being involved in an area of generic work.  Therefore, we must strike a balance between the generic and branded manufacturers here.  I am sure Deputy Yates would like to have such balance struck to ensure that the international community, with clients in our country, who contribute to our economy and exports, who have provided jobs here, are also taken into consideration.  We cannot throw their rights aside.  For example, why should they have less of an opportunity working in our economy as opposed to working in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe?  Surely it is only right and proper that in this Bill we would afford them the rights available to them in other EC member states?  Why should we render our economy less attractive for branded international companies which, from an IDA point of view, we constantly attract here to establish plants?  It is my wish that, in the Single European Market, instead of just manufacturing bulk pharmaceutical products it will be important &mdash; and I have stressed this with the major pharmaceutical companies &mdash; to see the finished product trade here.  We must provide the environment to encourage them to come in here, complete their work, and have the final, branded and packaged product leave this country.</P>
      <P>In the European context to date there have been restrictive practices operated by, for example, the Italians and French, who insist that the branded major companies provide that the finished product be manufactured in their country.  Under the Single European Market a significant change will take place on 1 January 1993 when we will have an opportunity of attracting those companies rather than exporting bulk pharmaceuticals.  I might remind the House that they add greatly to our overall export figure but do not necessarily add to the creation of employment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I must balance the great contribution that will <Col N="1283" /> continue to be made by generic manufacturers here while encouraging the major, if one likes to call them, multi-nationals, to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to ensure that our climate is right for them as well, to have added value to their product made here.  The protection of the patent laws of this country must apply to them also.  I believe we have struck the right balance in this regard.  In the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support this amendment and regard it as extremely important.  If anything it does not go far enough but it is certainly a very welcome amendment.  I am afraid the Minister is getting carried away by his verbosity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that years ago these companies, on the basis of the 1964 Act, applied for and were granted patents for 16 years on their product.  When they applied for that patent they knew that it was for a 16-year period; that was all they expected to get and they were very happy to get it.  They have exploited that position and raked in their profits over the years; that was the arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening now?  What is the Minister doing now?  Unasked for, for nothing he comes along and gives them an extra four years they never expected, do not require and which, let us face it, will have serious adverse consequences for ordinary people.  The Minister used the expression that he was concerned about the health and well-being of our people.  If he is concerned about the health and well-being of our people he ought to bear in mind the cost of drugs and the difference in price between the <Col N="1284" /> branded and generic product.  He did not take that into account in his lengthy statement. He said that equity requires this provision to be made.  That is the most outrageous, illogical statement in this context that I could possibly imagine.</P>
    <P>Does equity require that a company who applied for and were granted a patent for 16 years and expected no more should, for no reason, no consideration, no benefit to the public or to anybody except their own well-to-do shareholders, be given a present of an extra four years of this patent?  Has all sense and logic been turned on its head?  The Minister is turning the whole position upside down.  Equity and logic require a continuation of the conditions under which they applied for and got a patent for 16 years.  That is all they expected and all they need.  They have probably made their profits 50 times over already and equity most certainly does not require that they be given an unasked for and unwanted gift of an extra four years for nothing.</P>
    <P>Regarding the need to cater for the branded products as well, any new product will get the 20 years under the earlier sections, irrespective of this amendment. They will not be adversely affected.  We are talking about existing patents which are due to run out within the next couple of years.  Where is the equity in regard to the generic drug manufacturers who have since 1964 geared their whole manufacturing process, their research, employment and finances, in the knowledge that patents would expire in 1992, 1993 or 1994 under the law laid down in 1964?  They were prepared to take on workers and produce drugs identical to the branded products at a fraction of the rip-off cost which the branded manufacturers, so beloved of the Minister, have been extracting from the populace for more than ten years.  These branded drugs have been making enormous profits for the multinational companies. There has been an astronomical increase in their profits, at the expense of the unfortunate people who need to take their drugs for the sake of their health.</P>
    <P>The legal position has been firmly <Col N="1285" /> established since 1964 but the Minister tells the generic manufacturers to get lost because an extra four years is being added to the life of the patents.  The multinationals will pick up the profits and the unfortunate generic manufacturers who are playing such a wonderful role in catering for the health needs of our people are to be cast aside in the interests of the big fellows, who are to continue making enormous profits, as if they have not already done well enough.  The Minister thinks that the millions they have made on their branded patented products are not enough.  He wants to increase that profit, for no apparent reason.  Santa Claus is not in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking to bestow an extra four years out of the goodness of his heart so that the unfortunate people who need those medicines for themselves and their families will have the privilege of continuing to pay perhaps £15 or £20 for a branded product instead of £1 or £2 for the generic product.  That will be the result of the Minister's action.  He has the means to bring the matter under control but instead of addressing reality he goes on about what equity requires.  His argument does not hold up.  To say that companies have the right to apply to the court for an extension is not relevant.  While a company could make an application, the court has a discretion and might or might not grant the extension.  No court is very likely to be sympathetic to an application to extend a patent beyond 16 years, knowing that this was the term on which the original application was based.  The court would know that the company concerned had been raking in millions hand over fist and would have done well enough already.  There are other companies ready and willing to produce the identical generic product at a small fraction of the price.</P>
    <P>Why do we have to pander to the needs and demands of the multi-nationals? Some excellent Irish firms who have communicated with us all indicated that in the expectation of these patents running out over the next few years they want to protect existing employment, take on staff and produce generic drugs.  Why <Col N="1286" /> must we block them?  For what purpose? Who will benefit?  Are we obligated to do it?  There is no such suggestion by the Minister.  Why are we cutting our own throats?  We wonder about our level of unemployment being the highest in Europe.  If this is a typical example of the way we approach these matters, it is not in the least surprising that our unemployment rate is so high.  It will remain so as long as we behave in this ridiculous fashion by adding on an extra four years of patent rights for the manufacturers of branded products so that they can continue selling their products at an artificially high price.  They have already made their money under the protection they enjoyed for 16 years.  Why not cop ourselves on and realise what is at stake?</P>
    <P>We should do the sensible thing for once by protecting jobs and making these important drugs available at manageable cost to families who desperately need them.  We are not under any obligation. We are in control of our own affairs.  Why does the Minister find it necessary to argue that these companies should have an extra four years which they never sought and do not need?  What is behind it all?  What kind of representations have been made to the Minister to allow this continuation for an extra four years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that the patents cover items other than drugs.  Why make the point that the Minister has not had representations from the electronics and other industries?  So what?  Every firm does not make representations on every issue.  The real issue here is the drug industry.  These firms applied for and got a patent for 16 years, which is a long time.  That is all they expected or could get.  When they did their research for those drugs 16 years ago they knew what the patent period was.  They had no reason to believe that it would be anything other than 16 years.  They did very well and they should keep to the bargain that was made.  One could argue that this period should be reduced.  For example, we could reduce the term from 16 years <Col N="1287" /> to 12 years, which would be long enough. One can imagine the screams and howls of anguish by the multinationals if instead of extending the period to 20 years we took four years off so that the patent would only run for 12 years.  If the Minister put forward an amendment in this respect one would have a great deal of sympathy with him.  I could immediately assure him of the support of the Labour Party because we stand for the rights and interests of the people on the ground who have to buy these drugs.  The Minister has put himself and the Government firmly and squarely on the side of the multinational drug manufacturers.  That is where his money goes.  That is who Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Minister support.</P>
      <P>When a measure like this is introduced there are winners and losers.  On this occasion we have to ask: who are the winners and who are the losers?  The Minister seems to be exercising himself. Perhaps he needs one of the drugs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They will be able to continue to charge the artificially high prices attributed to these drugs for another four years.  This is a very big win. We are not talking about small beer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The people who are given prescriptions by their doctors and who are strapped for cash are the losers because they will have to continue paying the high prices.  They are the first losers.</P>
      <P>The second losers are the people who will lose jobs and those who cannot get jobs as a result of generic manufacturers not being able after a lapse of time, based on the patent, to set up in business to manufacture drugs.  They will be the losers.  Jobs will be lost in these indigenous Irish companies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has always said that his prime objective is to help and benefit indigenous Irish companies.  Virtually all of the generic companies are Irish indigenous companies.  However, they will be the losers and the multi-national drug companies will benefit and be able to carry on for an extra four years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to come in a little earlier to try to stop Deputy Taylor digging a hole for himself with these statements. Deputy Taylor seems to have forgotten that approximately 8,000 people are employed in the branded products area and approximately 1,000 in the generic area.  I believe my party represent the workers.  I have to bear in mind the need to protect their employment, something which Deputy Taylor, if one takes his statements at face value, does not seem to be concerned about.  He seems to have disregarded the fact that multinational companies give tremendous employment to Irish people.  He should not be knocking these companies just because they are multinationals; he should remember that they are employers.  Whether they come from the <Col N="1289" /> USA or Japan multinational companies are welcome here and I would encourage them to set up here.  I do not know if it is Labour Party policy to discourage outward investment in Ireland.  Maybe it is.  I should point out that encouraging and supporting inward investment by these companies which are in a position to provide employment here does not mean we are not giving support and assistance to indigenous Irish generic companies.  We have assisted Irish companies through the Industrial Development Authority.  Why is this regarded as a conflict of interest?  Deputy Taylor in his outbursts on this Bill does not seem to have taken into account the 8,000 people employed in the branded products area. I had to restrain myself from interrupting the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>I thank the Deputy but I can assure him that it was difficult.  I do not like to be political &mdash; this is a nonpolitical Bill which I hope will be fully endorsed by this House &mdash; but the people who support the Deputy's minority party should reconsider their position.  This Bill is long overdue and should be passed as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>I was well aware that this would be the most contentious part of the Bill and I sought to achieve a balance in it.  I should point out to the House that there was no ideological difference between the views expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, and me in this regard.  The extension of the period from 16 to 20 years is justified.  If any of the Deputies opposite were in the position we were in they, too, would have had to include a balanced provision in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1964 Act the courts were given the power to extend the period of a patent.  The average period of the extension was five years but in some cases it could be as long as ten years. <Col N="1290" /> That provision is not included in this Bill. We have provided for a four-year extension only.  In addition, generic Irish manufacturers and other generic companies will be able to undertake two years preparatory work on a product.  This is also a major concession.  Even without the four-year extension they could not put their products on the market because of the lead-in period for generic drugs.  It is obvious that neither Deputy Taylor nor Deputy Yates have had any experience of being in the Department of Health. Their catch-cry on a regular basis is that the cost of generic drugs should be reduced.  They seem to believe that a reduction in the cost of generic drugs would solve all the problems in this area overnight.  Generic drugs cannot be put on the market without going through the proper procedures to protect the interests of the public.  It is simplistic to think that generic drugs can solve the problem of the cost of drugs to the Department of Health and to the economy.  It would be very nice if that were possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, had given careful consideration to this area and he had negotiated with the representative bodies of the pharmaceutical companies for reductions in the cost of drugs.  Providing a branded product in the market place requires enormous costs in research and development.  In a sense, we are not giving recognition to our companies in the pharmaceutical area who should be in the branded drugs area, not just relying on generic drugs that we have not got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have qualified people in this country <Col N="1291" /> who could produce uniquely branded drugs, without relying on generic copycat productions.  I get the impression that that is all Deputy Taylor and Deputy Yates are aware of and that we do not have the expertise to produce new branded drugs when required.  We do have and we will have such expertise in the future.  Enormous investment is required in these companies.  A high percentage of the cost of a drug arises in the research and development area.  When I was in the Department of Health I had the opportunity of seeing them at first hand in this country and also when I went on IDA missions abroad to try to attract major pharmaceutical companies to locate here.  Under the Patents Bill we have to ensure that we provide similar provisions to those which are now available in the other 11 countries of the EC.

      <P>Following careful consideration I emphasise the contribution that branded drugs make to the economy, a point which seems to be disregarded totally by Deputy Taylor particularly; I think Deputy Yates would have a more balanced view and I will be interested to hear his comments.  Deputy Taylor has total disregard to the employment needs. I hope the employees of these companies, who are spread out in very important constituencies, will be aware of the viewpoint expressed by a representative.  On reflection perhaps it was not an authorised statement by Deputy Taylor and that it does not represent the views of his party.</P>

      <P>When companies here apply for patented new branded drugs they will have a 20 year period in which to pay for the cost of research and development.  I hope we can have less emotive contributions to this debate than those put forward by Deputy Taylor.  I represent a rural constitutency which is very conscious of the cost of drugs.  Under no circumstances would I put forward proposals which would result in an excessive cost of drugs to any of my constituents.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct the Minister, first, on his remark that this Bill was not an ideological Bill.  It most certainly is an ideological Bill.  I made this clear on Second Stage when I was the only Deputy in the House to vote against it and I make no apology for it. We are having a rehash of the debate we had last time round on my amendment to section 36 which, as you will recall, basically provided for a reduction in the term of a patent &mdash; not an increase from 16 to 20 years, which is the purpose of this Bill &mdash; from 16 years to ten years.</P>
      <P>I welcome on board the Fine Gael Party in the person of Deputy Yates who apparently has now seen the light.  While their amendment does not go far enough, the ten-year factor has obviously got through to him.  I would recall to Deputy Yates when he was needed he was not there nor were The Workers' Party. There are seven Deputies in The Workers' Party and not one of them had the courtesy to be in the House to deal with this important legislation, to give support to Deputy Taylor and I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion <Col N="1294" /> when my amendment on section 36 was discussed the only contribution The Workers' Party could make was that they came in half way through the debate and did not know what to do.  They voted with the reactionary parties &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; to crucify the taxpayers and the ordinary people in Ireland who, as Deputy Taylor said, are paying far too much for their drugs.  Thanks to Deputy Taylor I had some support in the House for my amendment.  It is much to his credit that he supported me.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the necessity to balance the needs of the generic industry with the patented firms.  I see little sign of balance.  There is a mere 1 per cent gesture which amounts to nothing. The fact is that the Minister is totally in favour of the patented manufacturers. The same number of jobs, if not more, could be created by the generic industries than the patented goods industry.  I accept that there would be disruption and that people would have to transfer from one firm to another or, perhaps, from one area to another.  There is no reason the overall employment in the country should be affected.  Indeed, one could argue that it could be increased.  The Minister raised a spurious argument about employment; of course that matter is important but there are no employment implications that I can see.  On balance and with some reluctance I will support Deputy Yate's amendment although it does not go far enough.</P>

      <P>The Minister started off all right with the point about the 8,000 jobs and the 1,000 jobs but he moved on to his usual bluster and bluff which does not stand up to scrutiny.  On the conclusion <Col N="1295" /> of this debate on this amendment I hope the Minister will see that his position has collapsed and that he should mend his hand between now and Report Stage. When I see these white bits of paper with numbers such as 73a on them, I know that the Department are making it up as they go along.  They are obviously shifting their position as the debate is developing. Why did the Minister find it necessary to mend his hand with regard to amending the First Schedule?  Does the Minister realise the weakness of his position?</P>
      <P>The purpose of a patent is to indemnify those who invest in the high risk area of research and development so that when they hit a new invention, for instance, perhaps a cure for AIDS, they will be allowed a certain exclusive period to recover the high risk expenditure in their laboratories where they might have created drugs which were no good and where they experimented on rabbits and rats and so on.  At the end of the day we have to strike a balance with regard to a reasonable period to recoup that level of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good job that Deputy Garland is not here to listen to the Deputy talking about rabbits and rats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixteen years is more than an ample period within which to recover research and development expenditure. The Minister is saying that if someone invents a cure for AIDS he and his colleagues in Europe, the bureaucrats in Europe, the people who are subject to the pressures and lobbies of big business, will ensure that the cure for AIDS is not produced by other than big business companies.  There is a big business impression on this Bill.  The nature of the exhaustion of the life of a patent, means that anyone can produce such drugs under licence from the National Drugs Advisory Board.  The Minister seems to think he has a monopoly of wisdom on how the National Drugs Advisory Board work.  I, too, have met Dr. Aileen Scott. I, too, spent some considerable time in <Col N="1296" /> the offices of the National Drugs Advisory Board and I can stand over the Minister's confidence to them in terms of their being an office of high repute with an international reputation.  However, when the life of a patent is over in 16 years, anyone can, if given a licence by Dr. Scott, produce a drug.  Inevitably four or five people will produce the drug and the logical conclusion is that there will be pressure on the price.  Because people at that stage will not have the research and development expense, because the formula is available in the patents office, there will be competition for the first time in the pricing.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt as to what big business want, but we must also look at the unrepresented view.  The Minister keeps talking about one section of business versus another.  What about the poor god-forsaken patients, the consumers of those drugs?  What of their rights tonight? Where is their voice being heard?  What about the voice of the poor person who is £4 over the limit for a medical card, the old age pensioner or the person on low pay?  They are being forgotten and ignored in an argument between two sections of the pharmaceutical sector. The Minister has an obligation to patients to ensure that they get value for money and that they are not exploited by extensive lifetimes on patents which go beyond a reasonable point to recoup R and D expenditure, which instead, create an exclusive right to overcharge for a product because no one else can produce it. That is the kernel of what we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made great play of his argument that 8,000 people are employed in this area in the country and that big corporations in the pharmaceutical sector would not be here unless patent law was what the Minister is proposing.  The reason those 8,000 people are employed here is because of the tax code.  It is because we have the lowest rate of corporation tax and because we allow a level of transfer pricing that allows such companies to gain huge profits which will go untaxed because all of the goods are <Col N="1297" /> exported.  If the Minister introduced a 30-year patent life and changed the corporation tax rules, those 8,000 jobs would not be there.  The Minister's argument is falsely based, it is specious and it does not hold water.</P>
    <P>There is a huge jobs potential in the generic sector.  Virtually all of the pharmaceutical companies involved in the 1,000 jobs in the generic industry are Irish companies.  The indigenous pharmaceutical sector is in the generic area, not in the branded area.  If it suits any of the big operators to go to Venezuela tomorrow, they will do so, but the critical factor will be our tax law within the Single European Market and not the patent law.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister is an apologist for multinationals and that he does not understand the case.  The Minister will know from his extensive foreign promotional trips for the IDA to attract industry that patent law is not a factor, that the factor is our tax and our financial incentives by way of capital inducements to industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put much stress on balance, equity and on fair play so I would ask him to review his position.  I appeal to the Minister not to force this matter to a vote which would preclude discussion on it on Report Stage but to consider a half-way house of two years. I suggest that given the preparatory period of two years which the Minister is allowing, he should move to an 18-year period and allow that preparatory time to immediately come into play at the end of the 16-year period.  That would strike a fair balance within industry and it would allow the orderly growth of the pharmaceutical sector.  It would allow a clear message to go out that the Government do not want to see multi-nationals ripping off ordinary patients.</P>
    <P>Where I find most fault with the Minister's argument is with regard to his recollections of his days as a Minister of State at the Department of Health where this was not an issue.  I can assure the Minister that it is now Government policy to use the maximum level of generic drugs.  I am surprised that the Minister <Col N="1298" /> was not aware of this, but, for the Minister's information, the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, sent out a drugs formulary to all general practitioners and all hospitals in the dispensing of drugs, so that where possible generic drugs should be used.  I would go further.  In Sweden they have a very simple system.  If one is a public patient there is a little box on the prescription note, and unless the doctor ticks that, a generic drug, where available, is prescribed. They reckon this has cut their drugs bill by 40 per cent.  That is very significant given that we have a public sector drugs bill of £120 million.</P>
    <P>Not only the patients' but the taxpayers' interests are at stake here.  I ask the Minister to realise the weakness of his position, to stop bluffing and to consent and allow us to proceed with the rest of this Bill by agreeing to, on Report Stage, bring forward a different amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to get involved in this debate.  However, the Minister's comments about the needs of the multinational drug companies forced me to take a stand.  The multinational drug companies are well able to look after themselves.  They are the biggest lobby group in the world.  In Washington, Brussels and other major capitals they pay vast sums of money to ensure they are well represented in the seat of power.</P>
      <P>One must ask who is representing the man in the street.  It is our job to do that. We are the protectors of the public not of the multi-national drug companies. Deputy Taylor was being attacked as being anti multinational.  I have no doubt that Deputy Taylor is not.  We welcome multinational companies.  We welcome industry, but we must have safeguards. The interests of the public are paramount. These companies are welcome and, as Deputy Yates said, it is the tax concessions that attract them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be looking at whether or not the term of a patent should be cut back from 16 years.  We understand the cost of research and development.  It is <Col N="1299" /> very expensive but some of the very wealthy companies in the world today happen to be drug companies.  I have no objection to drug companies making healthy profits.  It is good for our country that companies make profits.  They must, however, be controlled.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that generic drugs would not make an appreciable difference in the overall cost of drugs.  He was in the Department of Health and I, at one stage, was in that Department. What the Minister says is flying in the face of all reason.  Of course it would make a tremendous difference but there was never really the will to use generic drugs because again the drug companies, and their representatives, were whispering in the ears of doctors to prescribe branded products as against generic products.  That is business.</P>
    <P>A very large proportion of the population come under the medical card scheme which means the State is paying for their drugs.  Then there is the cash back scheme for the ordinary person if he spends over £90 in a three month period.  The State are picking up the tab. Any additional years added to the term of a patent will be paid for by the State and, God knows, the health budget is strained to the limit.  There are complaints up and down the country about our inadequate health scheme.  We should be endeavouring to be cost effective right across the board.  Drugs are very expensive and, here we are, making it harder for the State, and the general public, to get drugs at a reasonable price. When drugs are patented we are at the mercy of the drug companies because they can charge what they like.  I had to purchase a two months supply of drugs last week and it cost me £121.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I can pay for them but what about the person on the margins? If a doctor prescribes a drug that person will have to ask the doctor if there is a cheaper drug available.  I am not being <Col N="1300" /> emotive; they are the facts.  People are looking for good health care and we would all like to deliver a good system. The only way we can do that is by trimming our costs.  We can do that in a number of ways but in particular in the area we are discussing this evening. Instead, the Minister is handing over four years more when we should be talking about a reduction of four years.  The European Commission says we must do this and we trot off like the proverbial lamb to the slaughter and make it possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not change his attitude but I appeal to him to do so in the interests of the people of Ireland and in the interests of a good health care system. It is amazing how people change when they hop from one Ministry to another. They seem to forget about the responsibilities they had.  I ask the Minister to look at this again.</P>
      <P>There has been a reasoned argument this evening.  Members are purely representing the public and that is the role of the Opposition.  The Opposition must point out to the Government that they cannot literally ride roughshod over the populace.  Some Members want to protect the public interest.  That is why I am asking the Minister to think again; it is not capitulation, it is just taking another look.  The Committee Stage gives us time to reflect and suggest amendments.  I ask the Minister to reflect on this issue and do the right thing.</P>

      <P>I put it to my young colleague, Deputy Yates, that abuse is a poor substitute for good argument and like the old school of Fine Gael, of which Deputy O'Brien is a member, as distinct from the new school, it would be more appropriate to put forward reasoned <Col N="1301" /> arguments in a calm manner and not to subject Members to abuse just because they read from a script or express their views on this area.  I feel that Deputy Yates did not look at the amendment put down by Deputy Barry.  Indeed, I am delighted Deputy Barry has returned to the House &mdash; he had to leave to attend an official engagement &mdash; because I think he will steer the Fine Gael Party towards a more reasoned view.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while Deputy O'Brien has served in the Department of Health.  Deputy Yates has not had that opportunity as yet.  We will try to ensure that he does not get it for a long time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry has put forward an interesting amendment in which he accepts the extension of four years.  He has however, included certain provisions. I should make it clear that I am not accepting the amendment, rather I am suggesting that it has been put forward in a more reasoned manner by Deputy Barry, unlike Deputy Yates who made emotive and irrational statements in Deputy Barry's absence.  I hope that he will now have an opportunity of leading Deputy Yates into calmer waters and bringing him back to reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would get the impression that there are only pharmaceutical companies in this country.  This provision however, will apply to all companies in the high technology and computer hardware sectors; software is dealt with in the law dealing with copyright.  Approximately 35 to 40 per cent of applications for patents are made by the pharmaceutical industry which is a very important industry but little regard seems to have been had to other industries who rely on patents legislation and who will benefit from <Col N="1302" /> this extension.  Irish indigenous companies will benefit also.  In relation to the pharmaceutical industry, it takes eight to ten years to get a product on to the market.  One can see, therefore, given the period of 16 years, that companies had little opportunity to recoup the massive cost of research and development. Deputy O'Brien put forward a reasoned and balanced view in this regard and is correct when he says that we have carefully considered this matter.  We did not decide on it overnight.  We were open to receiving representations and hearing reasoned arguments but nothing that has been put forward in this House this evening would influence me to change my view in this regard.  I am not accepting the amendment put down by Deputy Barry.  In regard to amendment No. 73a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This is the most comprehensive and far reaching roads legislation to have been brought before the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State.  When enacted this Bill will establish the National Roads Authority on a statutory basis, and update the law relating to public roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority will have overall responsibility for planning and supervising the construction, improvement and maintenance of the network of national roads, including the access routes to the principal ports and <Col N="1307" /> airports.  These roads represent under 6 per cent of total road mileage, but account for about 37 per cent of total road traffic, two-thirds of it work-related. The statutory Authority will be faced with a major task, as will be seen from the review carried out by my Department in 1987 and 1988 which estimated the total long term needs for the development of the national roads at over £3.6 billion &mdash; £3 billion for national primary roads and £600 million for national secondaries. The Operational Programme on Peripherality, which was approved by the EC Commission last August, provides a firm policy and strategic framework on which the statutory Authority can build.  Over the five years of the programme, State grants for the improvement of national roads are expected to amount to in excess of £715 million, expressed in 1991 prices.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part III of the Bill relating to the statutory National Roads Authority were only drafted after detailed consideration of the views expressed by a range of bodies including the local authorities, trade unions and bodies representing industry.  Detailed submissions were received from bodies such as the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Construction Industry Federation, the County and City Managers' Association and the County and City Engineers' Association.  The most important submission came from the interim National Roads Authority who were able to look at the issues involved at first hand.  Indeed, at this point I would like to pay tribute to the work done by the chairman and members of the interim Authority since their establishment.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority, to be established by this Bill, will have a general duty to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads and will be assigned overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of construction, improvement and maintenance works on those roads.  The Bill assigns the Authority a number of important specific functions.  They will be responsible for the preparation of medium term plans <Col N="1308" /> for the development of the national roads: the Operational Programme on Peripherality, covering the period up to the end of 1993, is in effect the first of those plans.  They will prepare or arrange for the preparation of road designs, maintenance programmes and schemes for the provision of traffic signs on national roads.  They will secure the carrying out of construction, improvement and maintenance works on national roads and they will allocate and pay grants for works on national roads.  The Authority will have power to issue directions to road authorities to carry out certain specified functions in relation to the construction, improvement and maintenance of national roads and will be able to carry out the function itself where the road authority fail or refuses to comply with a direction.  While road authorities will normally be relied upon to prepare road design and maintenance programmes and enter into road works contracts, the Authority will have the power to carry out these functions where they decide that this would be more convenient, expeditious, effective or economical. They will promote the case for EC assistance for roads.  This will include the preparation of the national roads elements of future operational programmes covering the roads and other transport sectors. They will promote the provision of private funding for national roads and for this purpose will have the power to borrow up to £500 million subject to the usual ministerial consents and to enter into toll franchise agreements with private interests.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the Minister will have the power to assign additional functions relating to national roads to the Authority or transfer to them any of his functions, roads functions of local authorities or traffic functions of the Garda Commissioner relating to national roads. Any ministerial order transferring additional functions to the Authority will be subject to confirmation by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that the Authority are being given very substantial powers to enable them to get <Col N="1309" /> on with the task of overseeing and co-ordinating the development of our national roads.  This development programme will in turn provide valuable support for the Government's overall economic recovery strategy by contributing to a significant reduction in the transport cost disadvantage suffered by Irish industry, particularly our exporters, when compared with other EC member states trading with each other.</P>
    <P>The proposed functions of the National Roads Authority take particular account of the valuable work which local authorities have been doing in the construction, improvement and maintenance of national roads.  The Bill ensures that their skills and expertise will continue to be availed of and is designed to guarantee continuity and avoid any overlap of functions or duplication of effort.  For these reasons the Bill provides that road authorities will continue to acquire land for national roads, prepare road designs and maintenance programmes and enter into road works contracts on behalf of the Authority unless the Authority decide it would be more convenient, expeditious, effective or economical to carry out the work themselves.  I expect that road authorities will continue to carry out most of their existing functions in relation to national roads &mdash; acting on behalf of the Authority and under their supervision.  I have no doubt that the Authority will be looking very carefully at how these functions might be carried out more efficiently and economically.  They may, for example, be looking at how specialist skills in road design built up by one authority can be made available to others. The important difference is that the Authority will provide the strategic focus for the development of the national roads.  They will provide the planning and supervisory framework within which the local authorities will work and will, as a last resort, have the necessary statutory powers to enforce their mandate.</P>
    <P>The Minister of the day will continue to exercise overall policy supervision.  He will pay central Government grants to the Authority as a global amount and will of course continue to carry out certain <Col N="1310" /> quasi-judicial functions, such as the approval of compulsory purchase orders and motorway schemes.  His Department will, however, no longer have a detailed involvement in the day-to-day supervision of the work programme on national roads.  This function will, under the Bill, transfer in its entirety to the Authority.</P>
    <P>During the drafting of the legislation to establish the National Roads Authority, it became clear that the general law governing the administration of public roads required to be updated and needed as far as possible to be drawn together in a single Act.  It was concluded that there was no point in setting up a statutory Authority with substantial powers and then leaving them to operate in an outdated legal framework.  You do not give somebody a spade when they could use a JCB.  I am conscious that, as a result of this additional work, the statutory establishment of the NRA has not come as quickly as many people had hoped. However, the time has been well used to give us an Authority with a clearly thought-out mandate and a modern legislative framework within which to operate. The Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, and the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979, are being repealed and re-enacted in an updated form in Parts IV and V of the Bill.  Other provisions scattered throughout various Acts are being modernised and some entirely new powers are being introduced.</P>
    <P>The following are some of the more significant proposed changes in the general roads law: the classification of public roads is being simplified; three classes are proposed: national, regional and local; there is a clear definition of the local authorities who will be responsible for each class of public road; the power to declare public roads is being modernised and the power to abandon public roads is being devolved to road authorities; the concept of a protected road is being introduced in addition to the re-enactment of the existing legislative provisions for motorways and busways.  The protected road is intended as a &ldquo;halfway house&rdquo;<Col N="1311" /> between an ordinary public road, which has very limited access control or traffic restrictions, and a motorway, to which all access from adjoining land is prohibited and which is also restricted to certain types of traffic; road authorities will now be able to provide and/or operate service areas along motorways and protected roads.  Alternatively they will be able to make agreements with private interests for their provision and/or operation; the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities have frequently recommended that European Communities regulations implementing EC directives should be transferred into an appropriate Act when the opportunity presented itself.  In compliance with that recommendation European Communities regulations implementing an EC directive in relation to the environmental impact assessment of proposed road development including motorways, busways and certain other types of road construction and improvement are being replaced by sections 48 and 49 of this Bill; road authorities are being given power to provide cycleways; temporary dwellings on national roads, motorways, busways and protected roads are being prohibited as are unauthorised vehicles used for trading and unauthorised signs and advertising hoardings on any public road.  Road authorities are being given appropriate enforcement powers; road authorities will have improved powers to deal with dangerous trees and new powers to deal with dangerous structures along public roads; powers to extinguish public rights of way are being devolved to road and planning authorities; road authorities are being given new powers to control road races and strengthened powers relating to the temporary closure of public roads.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to outline in detail all the provisions of the Bill.  I will, however, draw attention to some of the more important sections.  The Bill is in six Parts.  Part I is largely procedural and deals with matters such as definitions for the purpose of the Bill, commencement <Col N="1312" /> of the Act, repeals and savers and powers to make regulations.</P>
    <P>In Part II, I would like to draw attention to sections 10 to 13.  Section 10 simplifies the classification of public roads. There will be three classes.  National and regional roads will be declared by the Minister and all other roads will be classified as local roads.  This system will replace a number of different and overlapping road classifications which exist at present: trunk and link roads under the Minister of Transport Act, 1919, main, county and urban roads under the Local Government Act, 1925, national roads under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974 and an informal classification of regional roads prepared by my Department which has been the subject of extensive consultations with road authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 11 replaces the existing powers in the Local Government Acts, 1925 and 1953, enabling road authorities to declare roads to be public roads.  Section 12 devolves to road authorities the power to abandon public roads.  Similarly section 69 devolves to local authorities the power to extinguish public rights of way.  In both sections 12 and 69, the only exception is that the Minister's consent will be required where a national or regional road is affected.  At present the Minister's approval is required in all cases and where there are objectons he must hold a public inquiry or oral hearing.  In future the consideration of objections to an abandonment or extinguishment will be the responsibility of the local authority. Section 13 defines which road authorities are to be responsible for each class of public road defined in section 10 and largely reflects the existing <i>de facto</i> position on the ground.</P>
    <P>Subject to the powers vested in the National Roads Authority in accordance with Part III of the Bill, the 27 county councils and the five county borough corporations will be responsbile for national roads.  These 32 authorities will also be responsible for regional roads, while responsibility for local roads will be given <Col N="1313" /> to county councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and urban district councils.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the National Roads Authority.  Section 16 provides for the establishment of the Authority by ministerial order, while section 17 imposes a general duty on it to secure the provision of safe and efficient network of national roads and for that purpose gives it overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of the development of those roads. The section also gives the Minister power to assign additional powers to the authority with the express approval of the Dáil and Seanad.  The specific functions of the Authority are set out in section 19. They include preparing or arranging for the preparation of designs, maintenance programmes and schemes for traffic signs, securing the carrying out of works, allocating grants, specifying standards with the approval of the Minister and carrying out or assisting research.  Road authorities will normally act on behalf of the Authority in relation to road design, the preparation of maintenance programmes and schemes for traffic signs and the placing of road works contracts unless the Authority decide it would be more convenient, expeditious, effective or economical to carry out the work themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 18 obliges the Authority to prepare a plan for development of the network of national roads at regular intervals.  The plan will be the subject of a public consultation process and will also require ministerial approval.  The Authority will be expected to act in accordance with their approved plan and will have to review its implementation each year.</P>
    <P>Section 20 will enable the National Roads Authority to give direction to road authorities to carry out certain statutory procedures, such as the making of compulsory purchase orders and motorways schemes, or to carry out works.  Before issuing a direction which would require a road authority to materially contravene a development plan or a special amenity <Col N="1314" /> area order, the National Roads Authority will have to give notice to the general public and the relevant road and planning authorities and consider any objections or representations received. This procedure mirrors that for a material contravention of a local authority development plan.  Under subsection (5) the National Roads Authority will have a reserve power to carry out the functions specified in the direction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, on behalf of the Labour Party I welcomed the Bill and said that notwithstanding our reservations on certain aspects of it, we would be supporting it.  I compliment Deputy Deenihan for bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>In some Irish political circles youth affairs is often considered a peripheral and minority issue.  Politicians fail to realise the importance of providing our young people with a comprehensive youth service.  The Minister, by his own admission last night, consigned the Government to this category, but following the passage of this Bill I hope we can change that attitude.  Last night I referred to the Costello report which defines youth work as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youth work refers to the provision for and operation of out of school educational, recreational and leisure <Col N="1315" /> activities for our young people operated mainly by voluntary youth organisations.</P>
    <P>On a national basis the youth service delivers a wide range of out of school educational, recreational and leisure activities for young people, and reaches over 500,000 young people.  Youth organisations take a wide variety of forms and manifestations, from uniformed organisations to youth clubs, special interest groups, Church groups and, indeed, youth wings of political parties.  Collectively the efforts of the youth service through the commitment and dedication of some 40,000 plus voluntary leaders and a small percentage of full-time workers seek to ensure that every young person has an opportunity to take part in programmes of informal social education which serve to complement the formal education system.</P>
    <P>Participation in youth organisations provides young people with the opportunity to develop physically, intellectually and socially and also helps young people to become self-reliant, responsible and active participants in society.  The youth services enhance the life of the community as a whole, as involvement in the youth service employs young people's leisure time creatively and greatly reduces the risk of them becoming involved in crime related activities.  The small amount of money invested in the youth services is in my opinion money wisely spent, especially when one considers that it costs about £300 per week to employ a youth worker who can serve 3,000 young people, approximately, and that it costs approximately £500 per week to keep one juvenile offender in custody.</P>
    <P>In recent times politicians appear to be capable only of paying lip service to young people and the issues facing them in the nineties.  Young people are fed up hearing politicians describe them as the nation's greatest resource, yet at the same time the same politicians fail to listen, understand or create a comprehensive policy for our young people. <Col N="1316" /> Young people do not need to be told they are Ireland's greatest natural resource. They are already aware of this but they need the Government to be prepared to implement specific policies directed at Ireland's youth.  In view of this, can we really blame young people for being disillusioned with politics or questioning the relevance of Dáil Éireann or the Oireachtas.  One can appreciate young people's apathy to politics when one considers that only 1 per cent of young people are involved in the party political process.</P>
    <P>Young people are looking for hope, for jobs and a future for themselves here. They look on this debate as a source of hope.  In this period of renewed Government cutbacks and despite the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> by the Government and the social partners to tackle the problem of unemployment, unemployment has increased to a staggering level. Young people have been particularly affected by the increase in unemployment: youth unemployment is running at 27 per cent and over 30 per cent of those under 25 and unemployed now fall into the long term category.  What kind of future can these young people hope for, when the Government are not capable of facing up to the problem, never mind succeeding in formulating positive job creation programmes?</P>
    <P>While the overall funding for youth services increased from £8.761 million in 1990 to £9.761 million in 1991, funding for mainstream youth organisations has been cut.  These cutbacks have a very damaging effect on the provision of services for young people and particularly on services for disadvantaged young people.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a statement made by the Minister last night in which he gave the impression he was looking favourably at the needs of organisations catering for girl guides.  The message went out clearly that he was dealing with this group in a very sympathetic manner, but the facts are quite different, which is borne out when we compare the provisions made in 1991 with those in 1990.  Over the period <Col N="1317" /> there has been a 28 per cent reduction in development grants available to the four main organisations with responsibility for girl guides.  The National Youth Council in their pre-budget submission stated that a large number of summer projects and programmes aimed specifically at disadvantaged young people had been cut from youth organisations programmes and nothing has been put in their place. The training of youth leaders has also been affected to the extent that training programmes in youth organisations have been severely curtailed.  Mainsteam services for young people from all socioeconomic backgrounds have also been curtailed.  Is this the way the Government hope to nurture and develop the potential of our greatest natural resource?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party consider that it is of the utmost importance, particularly as Ireland has the largest youth population in Europe, to encourage and foster youth activities and out-of-school educational activities.  Such activities should not be allowed to decline because of lack of funds.  In the light of current cutbacks, it would appear, unfortunately, that the Government do not value the work being done by youth services in that regard.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I welcome the Bill.  I believe that the Bill is both timely and opportune in its proposal to put the youth service on a legislative basis, which is one of the strengths of the Bill.  I know that the Minister did not agree with that last night, that he did not consider it to be so important.  But one point made very clearly by young people and representatives of youth is that they want proper funding, they want a proper base and they want the youth service to be put on a legislative base.  I ask the Minister to accept that point.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome in the Bill the establishment of a national advisory committee which will have a research and advisory role and promote co-operation between youth organisations, social services and, most particularly, Government Departments.  At present six Government Departments, provide either direct or indirect support for those <Col N="1318" /> working with youth, namely, the Departments of Education, Social Welfare, the Environment, Health, Justice and Labour.  Far from providing additional opportunities for funding and support, such a system creates only confusion, uncertainty and, in many cases, frustration. While the work of the National Youth Council in co-ordinating voluntary youth organisations must be recognised, acknowledged and protected, the absence of a Government youth policy causes uncertainty and frustration.  The Advisory Committee on Youth Work outlined in the Bill, whose brief includes advising the Minister on the development of youth work and assisting in the co-ordination, provision and evaluation of State expenditure on the youth service, could go a long way towards achieving both the co-ordination of services and a vision of a comprehensive youth service, which is clearly necessary.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations with regard to the proposed local advisory committees. It is envisaged that the local advisory committees, comprising representatives from local youth organisations, will provide a forum at local level for voluntary groups to exchange views and develop policy, assist the needs of young people in their areas and report annually to the Minister and the advisory committee, with administrative support from local vocational education committees throughout the country.  I hope, in the light of the proposed Green Paper on Education, that those vocational education committees will still be in operation to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>In the context of the local advisory committees, and as a Labour Party T.D. representing the greater Dublin area, I feel obliged to refer specifically to the County Dublin area.  The County Dublin Local Voluntary Youth Council has pointed out the particular difficulties in designating the whole of County Dublin as a local area.  Providing a forum for voluntary groups to come together in the County Dublin area is a proposal of enormous complexity because of the demographic and geographic features of County Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> I wish to refer briefly to a few of those areas and to some of the alarming statistics occurring in them.  In geographic terms, County Dublin stretches from Balbriggan in the north, in my own constituency, to the new towns of Blanchardstown, greater Clondalkin and Tallaght to the extremes of south County Dublin in Shankill.  A feature of the growth of Dublin in recent years has been the creation of new towns which lack the normal infrastructures and social mix one could expect to find in a town or city of similar proportions elsewhere in Ireland.</P>
    <P>During the past 30 years the area of Dublin county has experienced growth in population unprecedented here in Ireland or within any other member nation of the European Community.  The population of Dublin county has increased at an average annual rate of 3.3 per cent since 1971.  County Dublin has the largest youth population of all local authorities, with the 1986 census showing that there are over 400,000 people under the age of 25 in County Dublin.  In 1944 Comhairle le Leas Óige, a subcommittee of the City of Dublin vocational education committee, was established to provide youth services and grant aid for young groups in the city area which was identified as an area of particular need. While not taking away from that particular need, which I believe did exist, today County Dublin is in even greater need, but for a variety of financial and illegal reasons a similar service has not been provided there.  That shortcoming in the youth service was identified as far back as ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I remember being on the County Dublin vocational education committee at that stage, when we made direct representations to have a similar service set up.  Indeed, we made that same case in our submission to the Costello commission. However, although local broadly based youth services were set up, initially in Tallaght and Blanchardstown, followed by Clondalkin, Lucan and the general Balbriggan-Swords area of north County Dublin, the financial allocation for those services does not include an <Col N="1320" /> individual subvention to youth groups.  It is accordingly clear that, given the size of County Dublin, large youth population, the diversity of needs, the gaps in existing services and the knowledge that many young people, especially those in the under-16 age group, are not currently catered for by youth organisations, I must once again call on the Minister to designate County Dublin as an area to be treated separately, irrespective of the outcome of this Bill next week.</P>
    <P>Having referred to youth groups organised under various umbrella bodies, I now wish to refer to groups that are non-organised. I refer particularly to sports clubs, which provide a fantastic service throughout this country.  In this regard I might refer to the allocation of youth and sport grants to County Dublin.  For example, since 1987 the figure for such grants has remained at £56,000 which works out at less than £100 per club, which is totally inadequate.  It does not take cognisance of the contributions made to the youth of the areas, or the many clubs catering for male and female members throughout the length and breadth of the country and &mdash; in respect of my remarks here this evening &mdash; especially in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Many of these people and mentors give of their time and energy in providing, in many cases, the only service or outlet for these young people.  They do not want thousands of pounds.  It should not be too much to expect that a county as large as Dublin would be allocated a grant enabling perhaps one of these clubs, or a team from each of them, to purchase a set of jerseys or gear each year.  That is not asking too much.</P>
    <P>Irish society still experiences deprivation and inequality in many areas, particularly inequality of access to education, employment and housing.  Many of our present problems emanate from these inequalities.  For example, young people from deprived backgrounds under-achieve in the educational area and experience unemployment to a much greater extent than their counterparts in better-off families.  It is from this disadvantage in most cases the problems of <Col N="1321" /> youth emanate.  It has to be said that this problem has been well known by successive Governments and leaders of our society.  The questions must be asked: why was change not effected?  Why were alternative policies not devised to alleviate these problems?</P>
    <P>In the late seventies and early eighties we had a housing crisis such as is being experienced today.  But rather than rejuvenate the inner city of Dublin, where derelict sites were becoming the norm, planners, with Government support, decided to transport those problems of the inner city to the green fields of County Dublin, transplanting unemployed people out to four walls and a roof without any attendant infrastructures.  Some ten to 15 years later some of these people still await basic facilities such as shops, public transport and schools.  In addition, in many of these housing estates, regrettably, up to 80 per cent of the population remain unemployed.  Therefore, is it any wonder we encounter these problems today?  It must be said that many of these groups and communities are holding themselves up by their boot laces and warrant every bit of support we can give them.</P>
    <P>The upsurge in urban violence in Dublin over the past week is a clear signal that more and more of our young people are becoming involved in crime, that the policies pursued over the years have failed.  In most cases this type of crime is perpetrated by a small minority living within the community effectively attacking its very fabric.  In certain areas of Dublin communities are being victimised because of the activities of a small minority. If the Government do not respond immediately to their cries for help other illegal groups could take on the role of guardian on account of Government inability to comprehend the magnitude of the problem.  The Government must come to the assistance of these communities, in terms of community facilities and long term job creation.</P>
    <P>This requires a policy of positive discrimination in favour of these disadvantaged areas, which is the direction in which we must move.  The lack of <Col N="1322" /> facilities is a major continuing problem in most areas.  Even where infrastructures do exist, such as those in schools and colleges, they are not always available to the young people living in those areas. Why cannot these facilities be made available for, say, meeting rooms, rooms in which discos or other sporting and/or social activities can be conducted under supervision during non-school working hours?</P>
    <P>I repeat my appeal to the Minister to respond to this need.  I contend there is a total waste of resource occasioned by the lack of access to school facilities afforded youth and community organisations throughout the length and breadth of the country, while acknowledging that the boards of management of some schools have looked favourably at the provision of such facilities.</P>

      <P>With regard to sports and recreation facilities I wonder whether the community at large has reaped adequate return on their investment of hundreds of thousands of pounds allocated to sports and community buildings from national lottery funds.  For example, I am aware that many young people still experience great difficulty in gaining access to some such buildings, in some cases on account of lack of capacity and, in others, due to cost factors.</P>
      <P>I now propose to the Minister that, in respect of future applications for grant-in-aid buildings from national lottery funds, such grant-aid be given on condition that a room, or preferably an annex to the relevant building, be included in the proposal for youth purposes solely.  This would mean that young people could organise themselves in such a room or annex under the supervision of the wider community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer in particular to major <Col N="1323" /> growth areas nationwide.  For example, along with the construction of houses we should provide meeting rooms and infrastructures to serve as community centres. There is no point in constructing houses without providing adequate back-up facilites for young people in the same areas. I am asking the Minister, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to consider revising the requisite mechanism to enable planning authorities, in laying down conditions and giving planning permissions, to make a contribution to basic infrastructures such as meeting rooms and so on for young parents and, eventually, their children. The problems of our youth cannot be ignored any longer.  Young people out there want answers and look to us, collectively in this House, to ensure that those who will govern the country in the future will have the requisite mechanisms and ability to attain the objectives I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record, as labour spokesperson on youth affairs, my compliments to youth organisations nationwide who, in the most difficult conditions, provide a service for some 500,000 young people.  In responding, I hope the Minister will have something fruitful to promise, allowing these people to look to the future with some degree of hope.</P>

      <P>All of us will have heard the maxim: &ldquo;mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí&rdquo; which has been quoted <i>ad infinitum</i> when speaking of the youth of Ireland.  For too long young people have been talked about as the great potential of this country.  Every day we hear about their wonderful educational qualifications and earning potential.  It is high time those young people, and everybody else began thinking of the young people of Ireland as a power in the land, a great source of energy and enthusiasm capable of tremendous achievements.  It is time to acknowledge that the Irish youth of today are among the most highly educated in the world.  Whether we consider young people leaving the education <Col N="1324" /> system after primary, secondary or third level they withstand comparison with the men and women, their counterparts, of any other nation.  But very few of those leaving our schools are qualified in the fine art of living.  I attribute part of this to the lack of status, recognition and need for youth work and youth services here. After all, youth services are an essential component, aimed at assisting all young people become self-reliant, responsible and active participants in society, as was stated in the Costello report which has been much bandied about in this Chamber over the past few hours.</P>
      <P>The need for the expansion of this philosophy throughout each community is even more warranted when we see the plight of many of Dublin's suburban communities and the escalation of juvenile delinquency.  As a person who studied social science and participated in a programme for juvenile delinquents in Dublin and also in Scotland, I fear that if the energies which are being channelled into wrongdoing are not tapped soon we will have greater problems than we have seen in Great Britain and the United States.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Government for the numerous projects concerned exclusively with the disadvantaged.  Unlike the Labour Party who were part of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, we are making progress.  There have been numerous successful projects. Foróige have done tremendous work in Tallaght and Blanchardstown, along with the local vocational education committees. I would hope to see greater involvement of other youth organisations and the vocational sector in providing such venues for the disadvantaged and the deprived.  Disadvantage and deprivation are not confined to County Dublin.  Rural communities may not face the same type of disadvantage, but they have other problems because of their isolation and distance from youth clubs and community centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youth work has been steeped in the tradition of tapping the energies and frustrations of young people, educating them <Col N="1325" /> in the art of citizenship, leisure management, self-control, awareness of their skills and potential and basically educating them for living.  The work of all the youth organisations is to be commended and expanded.  This can only be done by pouring more money into the youth services, not by adding another layer of bureaucracy as proposed in the Bill.  Another disregarded and powerless advisory committee will not serve the interests of the youth organisations and I would see difficulties in the terms of reference as proposed in section 8.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Deenihan's point regarding the spread of responsibility for youth affairs between the Departments of Justice, Health and Education.  This is a cause of concern and frustration for many, as was evident some time ago during the debate on the Child Care Bill. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, has been given the daunting task of examining all these matters and I eagerly await the result of that examination.  Too often we pass the buck between the various Departments responsible.  The buck will have to stop somewhere, hopefully as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>They might create a new ministry and somebody might look after it.  The advisory committee would do very little to co-ordinate services which are now under the auspices of the Departments of Justice, Education and Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding problem is a matter of serious concern to me and to all youth organisations.  Many organisations are facing crisis due to staff shortages, reduction in services and a loss of enthusiasm among those engaged in youth work. In 1990 Foróige received £691,500, while in 1991 they received grants of only <Col N="1326" /> £650,000.  The National Youth Federation received in 1990 £1,112,000, while in 1991 they received £1,043,000. Such restrictions and reductions strangle development and I would ask the Minister to emphasise the dire need of all youth organisations for an increase in funding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan spoke about the girl guides suffering a reduction in their moneys but unfortunately they had to take a cut similar to that suffered by every other youth organisation.  I do not think they were picked out.  It is unfortunate that every youth organisation has had curtailed funding.  I would lend my voice to the Minister's plea for further funding. Everybody is behind the Minister in pushing for that.</P>
    <P>If the money problem is not resolved, some of our young people will lose heart and become disinterested.  Volunteers will no longer be bothered to make the sacrifices they have had to make over the years.  To be a voluntary leader takes tremendous time, energy and sacrifice.  It means a reduction in one's own leisure time, yet there is a thrill in seeing young people enjoying these services.  I recently attended the achievements awards for the Foróige people in Donegal and I saw the tremendous work done by small rural communities and the joy of the leaders in giving prizes and awards to the young people.  It gives heart to the leaders as well as to the young people.  The same applies in other associations not exclusively concerned with youth such as bands and football clubs.  The voluntary aspect is well rewarded and I should not like it to disappear.</P>
    <P>The notion of volunteerism is one which I hope will not slip from the basic principle of youth policy.  There has been a tendency in other countries, including Northern Ireland and England, to pay youth workers.  I realise that there are paid youth workers in certain organisations, especially on the administrative side, but I would hate to see a change in the basic philosophy.  It would be the <Col N="1327" /> death knell of many of our youth organisations. The enthusiasm and commitment would not be as prevalent if workers were to receive a salary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan mentioned the need for the training of youth workers, which is provided for in section 5.  Youth organisations provide training courses to meet their own needs.  There have been a number of initiatives, notably the Maynooth course.  There is a need to expand that facility but such matters should be undertaken under the vocational education committees.  Awards might be given by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the need for section 6.  We already have local advisory committees on a pilot basis.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary to bring in Bills to encourage Ministers to do things.  Deputy Ahearn spoke at length on issues relating to sexism, equality and sex stereotyping in the education sector.  Fortunately I did not have to suffer that.  The secondary level in Sligo must have been &ldquo;with it&rdquo;.  I had the opportunity of studying honours physics, honours mathematics and honours chemistry. The old philosophy of girls not being able to undertake these subjects is slowly but surely being eroded.  In the vocational sector most schools can offer <Col N="1328" /> technical drawing and technology courses to girls.</P>
      <P>Much of this can be attributed to the Department of Education.  In March 1991 the former Minister for Education set up the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment who were mandated to eliminate sexism and stereotyping from curricula and to work towards the implementation of sex equality in schools.  In December 1990 a working group was established to achieve the elimination of sexism and sex stereotyping in text books at post-primary level. In 1988 an advisory committee on the elimination of sex stereotyping in primary education was set up.  This working group will report to the Minister this year.</P>
      <P>The need to avoid sexism and sex stereotyping in schools is stressed in all the in-service courses run by the Department of Education for teachers.  The Department's science inspectorate have, as part of the national programme for equality of opportunities for girls in education, developed intervention projects to increase the number of girls studying physics and chemistry at senior cycle. This project has been so successful it has been extended to 28 schools with 60 associated schools.  Numerous other initiatives have been undertaken, for example, grants for mature women students and an action-research project designed to encourage the participation of girls in school activities related to new technologies.  In March 1990 the former Minister for Education issued an equality pack which was sent to all primary and post-primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can deny that strong measures have been taken by the Department of Education to remove sexism and sex stereotyping in the educational sector. There is a need for the continuation of such measures.  The attitude of women's role in education and the work place has changed.  This can be attributed to the colleges of technology and the regional technical colleges where there has been a dramatic increase in the number of young women undertaking studies in what are not normally regarded as <Col N="1329" /> women's studies.  For example, many women have obtained B.Comms. and many others are encouraged to take up science subjects, architecture and law. Women are now taking their rightful place in the educational sector.  They have not taken their rightful place in either the Dáil or Seanad but I do not think the educational sector has much to do with encouraging women to get involved in politics.  I hope there will also be changes in this area in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy Deenihan for putting youth affairs on the agenda of the House.  This debate has given us the opportunity to speak on issues which unfortunately, like the Irish language, are often put on the back burner.  There is a need for greater expansion and training in the youth services area.  We must also meet the real needs of our youth.  There is nothing more sickening than the pat on the back which is given to our youth.  As Deputy Ryan rightly said, young people are sick, sore and tired of hearing how good they are. Yet they are not given the opportunity to show how good they are and what they can achieve.  I hope that in future our youth services will meet the needs of young people.  Funding is vital if this is to be done.  I would impress upon the Minister the need to increase funding for youth services in 1992.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the younger members of the Dáil to keep youth affairs to the fore.  However, as in the case of most young people, our views often fall on deaf ears.  There is a saying that success is like a mother-in-law, it is relative. All successes and failures can be divided between those who have tried and those who have not made any attempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should also like to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for keeping youth affairs to the fore.

Although we cannot support Deputy Deenihan's Bill &mdash; I am sure he is most disheartened to hear this &mdash; we are taking a step in the right direction in regard to youth affairs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome this Bill which gives us an opportunity to discuss the problems in the youth services area.  Even though we will not be supporting the Bill I welcome any debate which gives us the opportunity to put forward our views on the services which should be made available for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for the commitment he has shown to young people not alone as a Minister but also during his four years in Opposition.  I think Members on all sides of the House agree that our youth services could be improved.  Ferns Diocesan Youth Services in County Wexford have been very much to the fore in providing services for the young people of the county.  They have provided training for young people, carried out surveys and helped disadvantaged young people to become part and parcel of the community. Because of the high unemployment level in County Wexford, unfortuately many young people do not feel a part of society.  It is important that we provide further amenities for these young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has done much valuable work in the youth services area.  However, there seems to be duplication in respect of the work carried out in this area by the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment. Much of the bureaucracy which has been created in this area has hindered the development of services for young people generally.  It is time all the efforts in this area were brought under one Department. Both the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, have been trying in recent times to unravel the problems in the youth services area.</P>
    <P>Today Foróige, who are basically a rural organisation but who have many members from urban areas also, contacted me because they believe their grant for 1992 will be cut.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at this issue because Foróige provide very valuable services for young people in rural Ireland.  They involve themselves in different types of projects for rural areas and in the provision of services which are needed in the areas they represent.  It would be a pity if there was a reduction in grant aid to a youth organisation, such as Foróige, <Col N="1332" /> considering the tremendous work they do for young people.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for many different regulations, an advisory committee on youth work, registration of youth organisations, education and training all of which are worthwhile in their own way.  At present we have sufficient youth organisations throughout the country which are providing a great service to young people.  As Deputy Coughlan said, what they need is more money to provide an expanded youth service for our people.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that when the estimates are being decided there will be no reduction in the amount of money available to youth services but rather a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>If the need arises, substantial amounts of lottery funding should be transferred to the area of youth where we have the basic organisation but because of lack of money we are unable to provide the necessary services.  If a substantial amount of lottery money was made available it would be of valuable assistance to young people in the various areas.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about the problems that exist in Dublin, over the last three or four nights particularly, in the breakdown of law and order, involving young people.  I would like to say to the Minister for Justice and the Government that Dublin is not Ireland and it was not until the problem arose in Dublin that we got Government action.  For a long number of years, and particularly during the last six months, Deputies such as myself from rural areas have been highlighting the problems we have experienced in relation to vandalism, crime and other problems related to a minority of young people because of high unemployment rates in housing estates and social problems arising therefrom.  If there is to be an influx of gardaí to help solve the problems in Dublin I would hope also that there would be a substantial increase in the number of gardaí who will be made available to rural areas to combat and counteract the problems in those areas.  The problem is not confined to Dublin, it is a nationwide problem and should be tackled on that basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> Another matter the Minister should look at is that of low pay for young people.  A survey carried out in Wexford recently showed alarming figures in relation to low pay in that county, which is regarded as reasonably prosperous and well off.  The large number of young people on the job market is creating the problem.  The survey pointed out that low pay is mainly concentrated in the following sectors: sales and retail; hotels, catering and services; petrol retail sales, etc.  These groups are exploiting the young people by paying them a pittance so far as wages are concerned.  There are examples of young people who work 40 hours, 50 hours and 60 hours for £60 per week.  That is not acceptable in this day and age and it shows the need for the introduction of a statutory minimum wage which would bring us into line with our EC partners and ensure that we do not have continuous exploitation of young people in the future in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The supermarket chains in Ireland are a disgrace so far as the amounts they pay. They pay, per hour, £1.27, £1.15 and £1.40.  This type of hourly rate paid to young people is exploitation.  I would ask the new Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Kennedy, to take on board the problems I have outlined and to call in those employers and tell them it is not acceptable in this day and age to have young people exploited.  I may be straying slightly from the terms of the Bill but I think it is important that young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In fairness to the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, she made efforts to provide education for disadvantaged young people.  A programme which comes to mind is the Youthreach programme for young people who left school at an early age without any qualification or vocational training.  County vocational education committees have been set up in the different urban areas, including my own constituency, and provide training schemes for young people.  On Monday next, in Enniscorthy, 25 young people will participate in a Youthreach course.  It will be of major benefit to those young people in an attempt to bring them back into the educational system and it will help them to acquire jobs in the future.  I hope this scheme will be extended to the major urban areas.  Also, we had the vocational training opportunities scheme for long term unemployed adults over the age of 21.  This scheme is advantageous and it shows that the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at the Department of Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have seen the recent scramble in Maryfield and Virginia where hundreds of thousands of young people congregated to plead and beg for visas.  President Bush and the American people should be down on their knees thanking those young Irish people who are highly intelligent and articulate and who provide tremendous development for the American economy. They should grant those visas to the young Irish people.  This is an area in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs should take a more direct interest to ensure that this situation does not occur again.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party support this Bill.  I congratulate Deputy Deenihan on introducing it.  This is the <Col N="1336" /> first time in the term of this or the previous Government that we have had a real debate on youth services and youth organisations.  I know Deputy Deenihan has always been interested in this issue and in education, particularly physical education.  I fully support the proposals in relation to the advisory committee and their functions as outlined in the Bill. This will help with the integration of the services.  One of the functions of the advisory committee will be to put proposals to the Minister.  I understand they will also deal with different Government Departments such as Labour, Justice, Health, Education, Social Welfare and Environment, which are concerned with youth affairs.  It is important to have a co-ordinating body to deal with youth.</P>
      <P>I note that this morning the Minister for Justice set up a co-ordinating body for a large number of Departments.  That was a very important move because Departments are operating independently without any idea as to what other Departments are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Co-ordination between Departments on youth affairs would work very well.  It is time also that we had a register of youth organisations.</P>
      <P>What are youth organisations?  Some organisations are regarded as youth organisations and others as sporting organisations.  In many areas practically all the work with youth is done in football and boxing clubs where there are teams for every age.  Hundreds of thousands of children are catered for every weekend by voluntary workers in sporting organisations. They should be registered as youth organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Training and education of youth workers has collapsed in the past year. Last year was a disaster for youth services <Col N="1337" /> and youth organisations.  The Minister four years ago had the good will of youth organisations throughout the country and he got a tremendous boost from the lottery funds at that time.  There was great scope open to the Minister then.  There was great enthusiasm behind him and he had many opportunities for expansion and development.  The good will has now turned to great anger and disenchantment. Many youth organisations are quite dissatisfied with what has occurred particularly during the past year.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a pitiful and incredible performance calling for more funding for youth services.  He said youth services are underfunded.  Who is the Minister calling on for more funding?  Is the Minister asking the national lottery to sell more lottery tickets or is he appealing to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet?  If so why can he not do that through his senior Minister, or is it the case that the Minister for Education does not support the Minister of State in Cabinet?  Does anybody listen to the Minister in Government? Is that the point the Minister is trying to get across and why he must appeal over the Government to the public?  There is something wrong.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister was in charge of that section of the lottery funding for youth and sport.  Certainly, the Minister handed money out to golf clubs, particularly in the Galway area.  Has he the funds?  The Minister remarked that the money he referred to was Exchequer funding.  Lottery proceeds is not Exchequer funding although it is repeatedly being made part of Exchequer funding. That is wrong and illegal.  I understood lottery funds went to the Minister of State responsible for youth and sport or were they grabbed from the Minister like everything else.  It may be that the Minister has not got a penny and that is why he called out in a pitiful manner, &ldquo;please give us more money for youth services, I am the Minister responsible for youth and sport&rdquo;.  The Minister has got himself into such a bind that his <Col N="1338" /> only option is to resign.  Not alone has he lost the assistance of the Government and the Minister for Education who presumably is not speaking up for him in Cabinet, but he has lost the confidence of all youth organisations.  That has been clear for the last six to eight months.  As a result of the Minister's cuts 35 full time youth workers have lost their jobs.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Council, on the cuts in funding, said that a large number of summer projects and programmes aimed specifically at disadvantaged young people has been cut from youth programmes and nothing replaced them. They said that training of youth leaders had been affected to the extent that training programmes by youth organisations had been severely curtailed.  The training of youth workers is a vital element of the Bill.  The National Youth Council believe that cutbacks in funding to youth organisations will put a greater financial burden on the State as more and more young people engage in &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; activities.  That was a prophetic statement by the National Youth Council when one considers what happened last week.  The &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; activities are alcoholism, drug addiction, vandalism and crime.  One leads to the other.  Alcoholism and drug addiction lead to crime, vandalism and so on.</P>
    <P>The youth organisations, and their voluntary and full-time workers are saving the Government millions of pounds by keeping children from the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; activities.  Any money spent on youth services is well spent.  The Minister should be able to use that argument to persuade the Government to produce the money.  The Minister is in a bad situation and I understand he is afraid to attend the National Youth Congress.  A Minister who had a good relationship with youth organisations is unfortunate to have got himself into this position.</P>
    <P>With regard to lottery funding I must assume, until I hear differently, that the Minister has some authority over it.  In this connection Dublin City Council <Col N="1339" /> adopted a civic charter and one point of that was a five year programme to provide every local community in Dublin city with a range of local amenities and leisure facilities for young and old, including allocation of a block grant from the national lottery fund for this purpose. The point is to involve local authorities and communities in the whole area of consultation from the very beginning of the allocation from the lottery fund.  That has been adopted in our charter which we will pursue vigorously with the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Education to ensure that the block grant is given to all local authorities so that all local authorities will be involved.</P>
    <P>They are already very much involved in the youth area through the communities and they should be integrated in that too. I am sure an amendment could be got into this Bill on Committee Stage in regard to funding.  I know Deputy Deenihan did not want to go into the whole area of funding, but in regard to the lottery funding for youth and sport which was specifically put down in legislation, there must be something there to ensure that the money goes where it is supposed to go.  The advisory council would also be in touch with local authorities and local communities.</P>

Nobody else had any contact whatsoever with him.  I am glad to have the opportunity of clearing that up.  The Minister's is the Ceausescu party.</P>

      <P>I am particularly interested in unorganised youth.  They should be of particular concern of the Minister.  There is much talk about disadvantaged areas. The Minister for Education loves talking about disadvantaged areas, and so does Minister of State Fahey.  It comes into nearly every reference and absolutely nothing is done for disadvantaged areas. It is disadvantaged people we are talking about, by the way, and the disadvantaged youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent acts of vandalism and violence involving considerable numbers of young people in parts of my constituency are only part of a wider problem.  As Deputy Browne said, it is all over the country, smaller in some areas but larger in other areas.  The size of the problem only came to light in the past week, although it has been there all the time.  It is experienced in most low income areas in our cities, and a new response is required in which expanded youth services and local authorities should have a central role.  It is only when we are faced <Col N="1341" /> with serious outbreaks of crime or riots that any consideration at all is given to the area of youth and youth services. I hope that the ugly scenes which are witnessed in a number of urban areas nearly on a nightly basis now will convince those who control the purse strings that it makes economic and social sense to ensure that funds are available for the development of youth organisations and youth services.</P>
    <P>We are now one of the few countries in Europe in which local authorities have no role whatever in policing.  We want to see established in each local authority area a police liaison committee made up of members of the Garda, councillors, neighbourhood watch co-ordinators, representatives of youth communities etc. who would have a co-ordinated response to this type of crime.  Again in our civic charter in Dublin City Council we refer to the need to tackle the problem of crime, drugs and vandalism in conjunction with the Garda and local communities to ensure that the homes and streets of Dublin are safe for the citizens and visitors.  A special committee for this purpose is being established at the moment.  This special committee on crime and vandalism of Dublin City Council will co-ordinate the local authority with local communities, the Garda etc.  This is a necessary feature in coordinating activities for youth in the area and the type of advisory council or committee that is referred to in this Bill would be a great help to us in setting up.

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot to say. I wanted to tell people here about Ronanstown.  Nobody knows anything <Col N="1342" /> about this area.  In fact it has no identity at all.  Sometimes it is called Neilstown; sometimes it is called Ronanstown; sometimes it is called north Clondalkin.  Then it is called Clondalkin-Lucan.  The people there have no identity even in name. There are almost 25,000 people in that area sent out on a plan made 25 years ago for a satellite town of 100,000 people. There are 25,000 people there but there are also more in Lucan; so there are about 50,000 people in the conurbation that is planned.  However, they are out there in a green field desert with no shops, no facilities whatever.  They have one dark and gloomy that is built almost like a prison.  The town centre which they were to get has now been abandoned because somebody wants to build a huge shopping centre up the road in a different place.  They have no jobs, no cars, no telephones and no buses in the evenings.  No bus will go in there after 7 o'clock.  Can you imagine how abandoned those people must feel. There are 10,000 children in that area, and only a handful of people from the area have jobs.  One can go through a whole estate and see maybe only five cars.  In other places in Dublin one can go around and see five cars at each house. It is a place that people should go out to visit so that they can understand what is happening, how people are deprived and how people are deserted.  That is what Ronanstown is.  To anyone who thinks there is any easy way of telling parents to control their children, I can say it is an impossible task.  Children will not go to school and those who do, even at the age of eight, nine or ten are talking about what country they will go to when they grow up.  There is no prospect, no hope whatever of a time coming when they will get a job.  They do not think about that at all.  They think about where they will go if they can get out of the country.  They just get out as early as they can.  They do not see education leading to anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very difficult area to tackle but it can be tackled.  There are some marvellous <Col N="1343" /> people out there who are doing tremendous work.  I mentioned the football clubs.  Half the men in the area are involved on a daily basis, and almost every weekend, in organising children, organising matches, running draws and raffles to bring the children across the city to other places to play matches.  They spend their whole lives at that.  Because they are not working they have nothing else to do, but they are spending their time working for youth in the area in an unorganised way.  The only thing they know is football.  They do not know about the various other things they could be trained to know about in the youth organisation area.  It is vital that both the Minister and the youth organisations tackle that problem and include football clubs, boxing clubs and all other clubs which fathers happen to know something about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Deenihan on introducing the Bill as it gives us an opportunity to discuss our youth services, a topic which has not been discussed in this House for quite some time.  Deputy Browne mentioned the Morrison visas.  I would like to direct my remarks to the effect that emigration has had on our youth and youth organisations.</P>
      <P>Emigration is a malignant cancer which has infested the body of Ireland, always there.  We seem to get only the odd remission but never a clean bill of health and a sound prognosis.  Occasionally, we get an opportunity to do something to help alleviate the problem but, invariably, we pass up the chance to act positively.  The Bill before the House tonight presents us with an opportunity to address the problem of the lack of co-ordination of emigrant services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three agencies responsible for delivery of services: the Department of Foreign Affairs, who look after emigrant matters in the United States of America, the Department of Labour, who, through DÍON provide for emigrant <Col N="1344" /> centres in the United Kingdom and give a mere £10,000 to the emigrant Advice Centre in Dublin; and the Department of Education, who fund the youth information centres which provide emigration advice services.  For example, the Galway Youth Information Centre counselled almost 2,000 people in 1990 and 1991 who were preparing to emigrate.</P>
    <P>This is crazy and absurd and it smacks of disorganisation.  It is symptomatic of the Government's ashamed embarrassment at having to admit that people have left and are still leaving this country in droves.  What we need &mdash; and the Bill makes provision for this through the advisory committee on youth services and the local committees &mdash; is co-ordination, management and the funnelling of resources to the organisations and people who are providing this much needed and valuable service to young people and others who are forced to emigrate.</P>
    <P>FÁS, the training and employment agency, are not in a position to provide pre-departure emigrant advice to those who call to their offices or to trainees participating in training courses.  The reason for this is that their placement officers are overstretched by existing and ongoing work.  In the case of trainees, the Minister for Labour should direct FÁS to contract this work out to the youth information centres who would be in an excellent position to provide this essential information for our emigrants.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if enacted, would provide a forum for co-ordination of advice in this area and would provide a stimulus for the plethora of State agencies who deliver services to get their act together once and for all and to encourage, for example, funding for on-the-line networking of computer systems in the youth information centres, in the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants, who have 60 staff working abroad in the United States of America, in continental Europe and in the United Kingdom, and in the Irish centres in the United Kingdom.  This <Col N="1345" /> would mean that at the flick of a button the potential emigrant from Carrick-on-Shannon, the west or from any part of the country could obtain information on accommodation, taxation, jobs, living conditions and Irish support groups in New York, Munich or Camden Town.</P>
    <P>I should also make the point that the Minister of State has excluded the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants from the youth information monitoring committee set up by him last year despite the fact that this commission, who have an experienced staff working at different locations throughout the world to help Irish emigrants, know what it is like to work at the coal-face where our emigrants are in difficulty.  I cannot understand the reason this commission have been excluded.  It does not make any sense and the Minister of State should explain the reason for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to include them.  It is an absolute disgrace and I was appalled when the Minister of State decided to exclude them.  It is an indication of the Government's lack of interest in our emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an emigrant myself living in New York, I recall the Minister of State who has responsibility for youth affairs raising the ante on a number of occasions and complaining that previous Governments did not look after our emigrants. I agreed with him but what annoys me is that last night he appealed to Members of the House not to blame one Government or another.  One of the reasons people are cynical about politicians and are showing apathy is that individuals like the Minister of State, who found himself in a serious position as a young person and who had gained the trust of our youth, made statements which they have not lived up to.  I recall that when I lived in New York the Minister of State made a statement in which he indicated that <Col N="1346" /> both he and Mayor Koch had reached an agreement whereby young Irish emigrants living in New York would receive hospital treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks after he had made that statement I broke my ankle while playing football in Gaelic Park, as a legal alien in that country, but when I went to a hospital and said that an agreement had been reached with Mayor Koch I was told that if I wanted my ankle seen to I had to pay.  I said to myself fair dues to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and all the work he is doing for the young people in New York.  I hope he is looking after the people of Galway better.</P>
      <P>This must be viewed against a background of the Government's derisory funding of emigrant advice centres.  The subvention for the Irish Episcopal Commission for emigrants is paltry, to say the least.  I should say that those providing services for young people and emigrants are generally happy with the support from our embassies and consular network. However many would say that the level of service in the Munich area needs to be re-examined.  Many young people complain that the honorary consul in the city could be more accessible.  As the Minister of State is no doubt aware, Munich attracts many young Irish people every year.</P>
      <P>The problem of the lack of information and co-ordination at an official level is worrying, given that we are now living in a decade when we will see increased mobility throughout Europe, with 250,000 people travelling to live and work there.  We are not prepared for this and, as a country on the periphery of Europe, information and knowledge are the key to success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State indicated that there was no need for this level of co-operation and co-ordination; yet the Minister for Justice, as Deputy Mac <Col N="1347" /> Giolla has outlined already, has announced that an interdepartmental committee, comprising representatives of six Departments, will be established to consider the position in the Dublin suburbs.  I cannot understand the reason Members on the other side of the House cannot see that that is what we are trying to achieve in this Bill.  We are trying to bring all Departments under one roof so that youth counsellors and all those who deal with our youth will be able to deal with one organisation.  However Members on the other side of the House cannot see that.  I always knew that Fianna Fáil had a bad memory but a lack of commonsense seems to be afflicting them also.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very grave matter of significant public importance in relation to our emergency marine rescue services on the east coast. The topic would not have been raised but for the failure and the evasiveness of the Minister for the Marine yesterday in the House in failing to answer various questions. I hope that the Minister of State will answer straightforward, simple questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the events in Dublin Bay last Friday morning, will the Minister of State clarify who rescued the 11 sailors off the <i>m. v. Kilkenny?</i> From where did the helicopters which went to the scene originate and how many were there? These are crucial questions because it has been put to me that it was not the rescue services which saved the 11 men within 20 minutes.  The Minister said yesterday that he was particularly proud of the rescue services and that it was important, in the context of the House and the country, that they had saved 11 of the crew of the <i>m. v. Kilkenny</i> within 20 minutes.  I took up this matter with officers of the Department of Defence today to find out the position of the cover.  I was told that in Baldonnel airport there is only an <Col N="1349" /> Alouette helicopter and that it does not have any night flying facilities.</P>
    <P>Dublin port is the most significant in the country, it is the largest cargo port and it is beside one of the largest ferry ports, Dún Laoghaire.  It is on the busiest sea route, the channel.  I was told that only an Alouette is in place and that, most significantly, the flying time for a Dauphin helicopter from Shannon to Dublin is 55 minutes.  I was also told that the cover is dependent on the RAF on the east coast.  Is the cover adequate on the east coast?  On 15 July the Minister for the Marine commissioned the Sikorski S61 helicopter from Shannon airport at a cost of £25 million over a period of five and a half years.</P>
    <P>The critical factor in relation to a sailor going overboard from a ship into turbulent seas and exposure is the first 30 minutes.  As we have such enormous traffic there is an obligation to have nighttime services and for the Government to upgrade the facilities at Baldonnel.  If it transpires that we are dependent on Welsh RAF helicopters or those located in Shannon, rescue within the first 30 minutes cannot be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should answer the questions which were unanswered yesterday.  He must ensure that there will be no repeat of this horrendous tragedy. We were very fortunate that the waters were calm at the time of the accident; in different circumstances there could be greater loss of life.  Will the Minister also clarify reports that it took 20 minutes to alert the Dún Laoghaire lifeboat?  These reports were made to me and I do not know whether they are accurate. However, I am very concerned about this matter.  I want clear answers from the Minister.  Who took the 11 people from the water last Friday morning?  From where did the helicopters originate?  Will he acknowledge that there is a deficiency in the service which needs to be upgraded by providing Baldonnel airport with night-time facilities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West):</i> As the Deputy is aware, a detailed review of the air-sea rescue services was made by an international expert group chaired by the former Commissioner of An Garda Síochána, Mr. Eamonn Doherty.</P>
      <P>The report was published, and the Government have adopted the report as a basis for their emergency planning.  In particular, that report recommended that a 24-hour helicopter service should be put in place at Shannon and at Finner Camp, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>For Dublin (Baldonnel airport) the group proposed the reintroduction of the Alouette III helicopter for daylight search and rescue to supplement, in particular, the deployment of helicopters to the west coast for the national 24-hour service.</P>
      <P>A critical element in meeting the report's recommendations was the location of a medium-range 200 mile radius helicopter at Shannon.</P>
      <P>The Shannon based medium-range helicopter is a national resource.  It was acquired to supplement the Dauphin helicopter, not only in terms of longer range, but also in terms of carrying capacity and better bad weather performance. The Shannon location was chosen because it is the most central in the Irish search and rescue region equipped with the facilities to support a 24-hour search and rescue service.</P>
      <P>Since the Sikorski S 61 became operational on 15 July 1991 it has been called out 56 times and saved 37 lives.  It has given invaluable assistance to fishermen, island communities and holiday-makers particularly on the west and south-west coasts.  The Dauphin aircraft at Finner, County Donegal has carried out 16 missions since its deployment and saved five lives.  The international standard for night time search and rescue helicopter response is two hours from call-out to incident location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine <Col N="1351" /> medium range helicopter based at Shannon can reach any point on the Irish coast except for north and west Donegal within two hours at night.  Donegal is covered by the Air Corps Dauphin helicopter based at Finner Camp.  The Irish Sea is also covered by three British west coast helicopter bases.</P>
    <P>In the recent incident in Dublin Bay, the Shannon medium-range helicopter arrived one hour 25 minutes after call-out; the RAF helicopter arrived 15 minutes later.  These responses were well within internationally accepted response standards for night search and rescue helicopters.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that this was a very successful rescue operation.  Eleven of the crew were rescued in less than 35 minutes after the collision.  I would like to pay particular tribute to the master and crew of the <i>Leinster</i> and <i>Hasselwerder</i> for their rescue response.  The services involved in the rescue worked throughout the night searching for other survivors. There was excellent co-ordination and co-operation between the Department of the Marine, Dublin Port and Docks Board and B &amp; I.  This close co-operation is continuing in the search for the missing crewman and the salvage operation.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps guarantee a daylight only service from Baldonnel.  The incidents in the Dublin area generally involve pleasure craft or swimmers in daylight inshore and the Alouette III helicopter is suited to this task.  Since June, 1991 the Alouette III service at Baldonnel have performed 28 search and rescue missions and 70 air ambulance missions.  The priorities for the deployment of the Dauphin helicopter are: (i) a 24-hour search and rescue service at Finner, County Donegal which is in operation since mid-July 1991; and (ii) Sea and Air service at Cork, when helicopter is not embarked on <i>l.e. Eithne.</i></P>
    <P>Night-time helicopters are not on immediate standby since the crews do not <Col N="1352" /> remain on base.  The general international standard is for 45 minutes standby before a helicopter is airborne. Therefore, even if a night service was available at Baldonnel, a response of less than 50 minutes could not have been expected.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the deployment of the Alouette III at Baldonnel, British search and rescue helicopters on the west coast of Great Britain and the Department of the Marine medium-range helicopter at Shannon, all locations in the Irish Sea are covered within the internationally accepted response times of one hour by day and two hours by night.</P>
    <P>In looking at the search and rescue &mdash; SAR &mdash; capabilities on a particular coast, we must have regard to the other SAR resources available there.  For example, the east coast is very well served with lifeboat stations especially compared to the west.  There are nine lifeboat stations with 11 lifeboats between Rosslare, County Wexford and Kilkeel, County Down.  On the west coast, there are five stations from Valentia, County Kerry to Arranmore, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>When the new arrangements have been in operation for a reasonable period on summer-winter conditions, the director of Slánú, the Irish Marine Emergency Service, will report to me on the incidence of accidents, on the responses and response times, on the number involved, and will recommend to me any changes in deployment that are desirable on the basis of experience.  The preliminary investigations are under way and it is hoped that they will be completed within a very short time.  I will then be in a position to adequately answer one of the questions posed to me by the Deputy this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my thanks to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for choosing this important and urgent subject for debate tonight.  In many ways this question, which was put down as a Private Notice Question yesterday, was anticipated by replies given by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil yesterday. However, this short debate will give the Minister an opportunity to elaborate on his wise proposals to deal urgently with the problem not only in Clondalkin but in the outer suburbs in general.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to north Clondalkin, or is it Ronanstown or Neilstown?  One of the problems is that this area does not even have a proper name.  It was to be part of the new town of Lucan-Clondalkin which was to be one of three new suburban towns to the west of the city. The proposals for Tallaght and Blanchardstown went ahead but those for Lucan-Clondalkin did not go ahead. Therefore Ronanstown which was to form part of Lucan-Clondalkin is an isolated community without proper services, with no heart and, for many people, no hope.  It has a lot of problems, one of which is that it has no shopping centre.  The Balgaddy shopping centre which has been part of the draft plan for a long time, has not gone ahead.  To some extent this has been adversely affected by the rezoning of the Quarryvale site not very far away.  There are many provisions needed in this area.  The local Deputies, including myself, have fought for these for a long time.  As I said in a recent statement &mdash; the Minister made a similar comment in the House yesterday &mdash; allocating more gardaí to these areas is not the solution.  Of course more gardaí are needed but that would be a one dimensional approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the initiative taken by the Minister for Justice in setting up an interdepartmental group provided it is not a talking shop or a delaying tactic, because <Col N="1354" /> that would be very unwise and is something which could explode in the Minister's face.  I suggest to the Minister, for reasons which I will elaborate on shortly, that he extend the group to include Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  Another hopeless feature of what is properly called Ronanstown &mdash; it is called various names &mdash; is that most of the houses there are Dublin Corporation houses but the people do not elect city councillors.  They elect county councillors who have no say in the provision of services for those houses.  People, including public representatives, who wish to make inquiries about this area are sent from Billy to Jack.  The county council say it is the responsibility of the corporation to provide certain services and <i>vice versa.</i> Therefore it is vital that the Minister include on the interdepartmental group an assistant city manager from the corporation as well as from the county council.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the area has no shopping centre.  Neither has it an enterprise centre even though a site has been allocated by Dublin Corporation for such a centre.  Despite the valiant efforts of myself and others in the last five years, calling meetings of public representatives, the IDA, FÁS, county councillors, corporation officials and health board officials, to try to set up an enterprise centre, we still have no such centre.</P>
    <P>In the inner city, about which I now know a lot as a result of the changes in constituency boundaries, there are warehouses and old buildings where small factories and work units could be set up. People with skills could set up small businesses, thereby providing employment, but there are no such places in the new suburbs to set up enterprises.  It is not surprising therefore that Deputy Ahern when Minister for Labour told me in this House only six months ago in reply to a question that in some estates in Ronanstown unemployment is as high as 70 per cent.  I do not want to suggest that <Col N="1355" /> unemployment or poverty can be used as an excuse for some of the things that have happened in this and other areas in the last few weeks.  That is not an excuse. Urgent action is needed.  Hard-pressed as the Exchequer is, funds will have to be found for this area.  In the past few years terrorist organisations have been very surreptitiously operating protection rackets in certain estates.  We have kept quiet about it in order not to add further to the humiliation of the 90 per cent of good people who live in these estates. There are protection rackets in operation and urgent action is needed to put a stop to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been taking a direct personal interest for some time in the difficulties with juvenile vandalism which has been emerging in some Dublin suburbs.  Last May I visited these areas to see the situation for myself and had discussions with local gardaí and others.  Subsequently, there has been a follow-up by senior gardaí and Department of Justice staff.</P>
      <P>It was as a direct result of my inquiries in this regard that very worthwhile community projects were commenced over the summer months in Ronanstown and Killinarden.  The recent difficulties in suburbs to the west and south of Dublin have prompted the Government to take special steps to improve the delivery of support and community services to these areas.  I acknowlege Deputy Mitchell's support for the initiatives that have been announced.</P>
      <P>We need to begin any discussion on this topic with a wider understanding of where and why trouble begins in such areas.  The vast bulk of the population of these urban areas are decent law abiding citizens, supportive of community life and striving to do what they can to rear their families properly against a background which can at times be extremely trying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> Governments of every stripe have played their part in past mistakes and, indeed, in past and present efforts and initiatives to tackle the roots of urban vandalism, joyriding, etc.  I do not think a partisan debate on this topic will get us much further in dealing with it and I am glad it is not taking place in such an atmosphere.  I hope these remarks will set the right tone for my description of what I and my collegues have done to address the problem.</P>
    <P>The first initiative taken by me in this area related to the setting up of a formal Garda schools programme to reach young people before they would enter the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; category.  It is now in place in several suburbs of Dublin and Limerick and will be further extended in the new year.  I also approved at that time the first major re-organisation of the Garda juvenile liaison scheme in their 30 years in existence.  That scheme now has a national director at Garda superintendent level and all the juvenile liaison officers have been enabled to work evenings and week-ends as part of our strategy to enhance the effectiveness of the juvenile liaison officer scheme.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service of my Department and the local gardaí have initiated a whole series of local projects to deal with young people at risk in the community.  Specific remedial projects for young offenders are at this stage in place in Cherry Orchard in Dublin and Southill in Limerick and also in Coolock and Darndale.  Community projects, which are intended to spawn such young offender remedial projects have also been in place since the summer in Killinarden and Ronanstown, two of the locations mentioned in recent news stories and again in this Adjournment debate.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute here to all the people and groups working on these ventures especially to the Foróige and Catholic Youth Council organisations. Unfortunately some young people at risk <Col N="1357" /> cannot be assisted effectively in the community setting.  It is for this reason that we have the option of special education in a custodial setting at the discretion of our courts.  There is a substantial provision made by the State in this regard under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Education with five institutions of various types having between them residential capacity of over 200 places.</P>
    <P>This summer, following consultation with the president of the district court and the attorney general, I prevailed on the District Court Rules Committee to issue Rules of Court for the children's court which enable the authorities to compel the small minority of non cooperating parents of guardians of children and young persons to attend the court hearing where their child is charged with an offence.  The rules include a warning notice which the Garda may serve on both parents of a child compelling their attendance at the court hearing.  The courts have discretion to issue arrest warrants to compel attendance of persons who fail to comply with the warning notice.  The new juvenile justice Bill, being prepared by my Department will, of course, update the whole law in this area of young people before the courts.</P>
    <P>The agencies under the aegis of my ministerial colleagues in the Departments of the Environment, Labour and Social Welfare are all playing a major part in community centred initiatives for deprived areas.  The valuable contribution of agencies like FÁS and the Combat Poverty Agency are also widely acknowledged.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of protection for fire brigade and other officers of the State attending for specific call-outs in these areas, I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Authorities are fully aware of this situation and have taken certain steps to deal with it.  I want to compliment the fire brigade officers who have not allowed <Col N="1358" /> such incidents to deter them from carrying out their life preserving mission for the public.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that last evening, I met the Garda Commissioner and many of his management team for urgent talks on this whole issue.  We comprehensively reviewed the policing situation here in Dublin and in other urban centres and agreed appropriate follow up on points which emerged.  I am satisfied that the force at this time are very conscious of and committed to their responsibilities of preserving public order and the freedom of the public to go about their daily lives in peace and safety.  The contribution made by garda at all levels towards the various community projects I mentioned earlier has been enormous. It is at times like this the public see how important the role of the force is in our national life.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that the solution to the complex issues behind juvenile vandalism is not easy nor is it within the capacity of any single Minister or agency to do so.  For this reason the Government have yesterday decided to bring together senior officials at Assistant Secretary level &mdash; in the Departments of the Environment, Education, Health, Labour and Social Welfare together with my own Department to look at these matters and to submit proposals as a matter of urgency.  The reason the Department of the Environment are involved is to cover the complex issue of county council and corporation areas, but having listened to Deputy Mitchell, I will take his suggestions on board.  The reason for bringing these officials together is to pool experience and provide a broad response to the difficulties on hands.  There is no point in imagining &mdash; as some apparently do &mdash; that it is simply a matter of locking up a few ringleaders and temporarily slipping the problems under the carpet by means of this strategy.</P>
    <P>A broader strategy is required.  The aim is to make a genuine effort, now, to <Col N="1359" /> address the issues in a serious comprehensive manner and to try to improve matters within our resources, in whatever way we possibly can.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to correct the notice I gave to your office which refers to the lack of food and water supply to the 80 gardaí participating in the United Nations operations in Angola.  In fact some ten and not 80 gardaí are involved in the operation. The issue is nonetheless as important and pressing for the ten gardaí involved.  I hope the record will be corrected to show that the error was mine and not made by anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ten rather than 80 gardaí involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the matter is as important and urgent, no matter how many are involved.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter and the Minister for Justice for finding time to deal with it tonight.</P>
      <P>We should be justifiably proud of the contribution that the members of our Defence Forces have played in United Nations' peacekeeping operations throughout the world during the past three decades.  In more recent years members of the Garda Síochána have also been called on to play a role in these operations, where their particular expertise and training as police officers is more appropriate than that of soldiers. The high level of risk faced by all our personnel on UN operations was brought home again just ten days ago with the unfortunate killing of Corporal Michael McCarthy in the Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personnel who go abroad accept there is an element of risk involved.  They accept also that as they are generally going to less developed countries facilities and conditions will not be as good as <Col N="1360" /> they are at home.  This was particularly so in the case of the ten gardaí who went to Angola, a country which is recovering from a devastating 16 year civil war and whose people face deprivation and famine.  Even allowing for this, the conditions under which the ten gardaí with the United Nation's mission in Angola are now operating is a matter of serious concern and merits a strong protest to the United Nations.  There seems to have been an utter lack of planning on the part of the United Nations.  According to a recent report in <i>The Garda Review,</i> officers have been allowed to fend for themselves because the United Nations failed to put in place the necessary administrative and back-up network.</P>
    <P>Accommodation is poor, logistical back-up is virtually non-existent and basics like food and water are in short supply.  The situation is so bad that members have to devote most of their time and effort to providing for themselves rather than doing the policing task for which they were sent out.  I was alerted to the appalling conditions in Angola when I read the November issue of <i>The Garda Review,</i> which I received yesterday and I appreciate that the Chair allowed the matter to be raised this evening.  The position of the ten gardaí is appalling and is negating the functions which they were sent out originally to perform.  It appears from the account in the report that they are foraging and fending for themselves most of the time and are not able to engage in any effective policing, the work they were originally asked to do.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Garda surgeon, Dr. John Malone, is due in Angola this month, but in the meantime I ask the Minister to let us know what action has been taken to assist the plight of our gardaí there; what pressure has been put on the United Nations to provide the back-up services that are a normal part of an operation like this?  Have we sought assurances that before we agree to send gardaí abroad again &mdash; and 20 gardaí <Col N="1361" /> are on standby to travel to the Western Sahara &mdash; they will not be abandoned by the United Nations and left virtually to their own devices?</P>
    <P>Given the appalling conditions under which the gardaí are working in Angola, there is a need to look at the allowances being paid to them.  I understand they are receiving a daily allowance which is only half that paid to the gardaí who recently returned from Namibia, where conditions were much less severe than those being experienced by the gardaí in Angola.  The allowance clearly should be increased to compensate them for the dreadful conditions in which they are working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, let me say at the outset that the number one priority for the Government in relation to participation in United Nations missions is to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the members of the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces who partake in them.  There is no denying the fact that these missions are extremely demanding on those who take part in them.  The job requires exceptional physical and mental fitness and selection procedures are designed to choose only those volunteers who are well capable of meeting the heavy demands placed upon them.</P>
      <P>I am aware from Garda reports received from Angola that conditions there are far more demanding than those which normally apply on UN service.  The whole infrastructure of Angola has been torn apart during the 16 year civil war which raged there to such an extent that food supplies are disrupted and local transport, accommodation and communications systems are virtually non-existent. This has presented the UN command with major logistical difficulties in establishing their UNAVEM mission. My understanding is that these aspects of the mission are currently receiving priority attention and that the welfare of mission personnel is foremost in the minds of the mission commanders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> I have no wish to play down the extreme conditions which Irish personnel are currently enduring in Angola.  At the same time, however, it is important that we maintain a proper perspective on this matter.  I want to assure the families and friends of those courageous gardaí and soldiers who are serving in Angola that there is no question of their loved ones being in any imminent danger.  Reports indicate that they are all continuing to give of their best in the harsh conditions in which they work and that morale is good.</P>
    <P>Neither do I want word to go out from this House that the Government are doing nothing more than monitoring conditions in Angola while Irish personnel are having to endure unacceptable conditions there.  I can tell the House that strong representations have been made in person to Mr. Marack Goulding, Under General Secretary of the United Nations during his recent visit to Dublin.  Mr. Goulding had been to Angola prior to his visit here and was in no doubt as to the appalling conditions there.  He has given a firm commitment to ensuring that the Angolan mission receives immediate and priority attention and that all the necessary improvements in accommodation, food supply, transport and communications are advanced as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>The Permanent Irish Representation to the United Nations in New York has been fully briefed by the Department of Foreign Affairs about our concern for our personnel in Angola and they are putting continuing pressure on the UN to ensure that the undertakings given by the Under General Secretary are fulfilled in the shortest possible time.  Notwithstanding the undertakings received from the UN, the Government have acted to guarantee the welfare of our personnel in Angola.  I have authorised the Garda surgeon, who holds the rank of Assistant Commissioner in the Garda Síochána, to travel to Angola and to observe first-hand the conditions which <Col N="1363" /> face each member of the Garda contingent. I will be seeking an immediate report from the surgeon on his return to this country in the coming days and I can assure the House that whatever action is necessary on foot of this report will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight I wish to raise my concern about recent developments in orthodontic services.  As the House will know, enormous numbers of children are waiting for orthodontic services.  In the Eastern Health Board area alone there are more than 9,000 on the waiting list and the outlook is probably a wait of five years for those at the bottom of the list, that is if they are ever reached at all and, unfortunately, many will not be reached.  Nationally, there are about 25,000 waiting for this treatment.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will know, for years it has proved impossible to fill consultant positions.  They were advertised on numerous occasions but were not filled. The positions require a high degree of skill, it takes nine years to obtain the necessary training.  I think that everyone recognises that any alternative, such as farming out the work to private orthodontists, would prove extraordinarily costly and would not provide the kind of public service needed for the children who are waiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hopes of most people were quite high with the beginning recently of recruitment to orthodontic consultant positions.  There was a feeling that we were at least taking the first step towards dealing with the problem.  The most recent appointment was made to the Eastern Health Board.  However, it came as a major shock to me to find that in the case of the most recent appointment, the appointee has resigned after less than five months.  There also seems to be a problem in other areas where consultant orthodontists have been appointed.  The <Col N="1364" /> problem seems to relate to their precise role in the service.</P>
    <P>The very welcome development of a corps of public orthodontists providing care for public patients is now in jeopardy. At the heart of the problem seems to be an issue as to whether these consultant orthodontists should operate from a hospital base where the patients would be referred and the consultant would have available a wide range of back-up services.</P>
    <P>I earnestly ask the Minister to intervene in what appears to be a growing problem of the position of these orthodontists that may jeopardise their key role in developing a service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply.  I can tell the Deputy that I have already intervened in that matter since I came into the Department and, following improvements, I am now relatively satisfied as to the pay and conditions attached to the post of consultant orthodontist. Following the Local Appointments Commission competition, offers of employment &mdash; as Deputy Bruton knows &mdash; were made in the Eastern, South-Eastern, North-Western and Southern Health Boards.  As the Deputy himself said, there are still difficulties to be ironed out in relation to the role and conditions of the consultants.  However, I am glad to tell the Deputy and the House tonight that these matters are in the process of being sorted out.  I am confident that the filling of the posts now will bring about a significant improvement in the orthodontic service, which is regarded as a priority service by the Department and by all of us here in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's particular reference to a person who had taken up a post and resigned after five months, there were several underlying difficulties in that case.  I am satisfied, as I said, now that both of the two issues identified, the <Col N="1365" /> terms and the role, have been satisfactorily addressed, we will have appointments early in the new year and, following on that, a much greater rate of progress of admission and treatment under the orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, was originally opened in 1942 to cater for a population of 47,000 people.  With the amalgamation of Kilkenny and Carlow that catchment area doubled in 1971 to 100,000 people, with no extra bed space provided.  In 1987 St. Luke's Hospital was rated as the seventh busiest surgical unit in the country, with still only one operating theatre.  That shows the commitment of the staff, who are working under appalling pressure.  I might add that the hospital has one of the highest patient throughputs of any hospital in the country at the moment.</P>
      <P>Extra beds are urgently required in the female medical unit.  That unit has only 19 beds, yet the Department's norm for a 100,000 catchment area would be 40 beds.</P>
      <P>When the hospital was built it had one theatre for the use of one surgeon.  Today four surgeons operate, using the same space, with no room for orthopaedic trauma at all.</P>
      <P>The hospital has no paediatrician, no facilities for parents to stay overnight and no play area.</P>
      <P>Since 1973 beds have had to be put in the corridors of all of the hospital's departments.  The daily average for January 1990 in that respect was 27 beds, and that is a situation that could constitute a fire hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large, modern labour ward is required at the hospital.  At present the labour ward is too small, there is no space <Col N="1366" /> for spouses and one room has to be used as an admission area-cum-bathroom.  In summary, female patients are bearing the greatest proportion of the inadequate facilities at St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I was glad that when the Taoiseach intervened in relation to this matter in March 1991 he gave an undertaking to Deputy Liam Aylward that work would commence in September 1991 on the much-needed extension of the hospital. September 1991 has come and gone but I hope that with the Minister's new appointment there will be imminent progress on this urgent matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments.  I am glad to answer his question and to share with him, with Deputy Aylward and with Deputy Pattison the consistent approach that they have all adopted in their constituency towards the furtherance of this project.</P>
      <P>As is known, tenders have been sought and received in the Department.  They have been worked through and any technical difficulties have been sorted out. All of the Deputies for the area realise that it is now just a matter of the go-ahead for the project being given.</P>
      <P>I am ten days exactly into the Department but I am not new to the problem of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny.  I realise that conditions have been far from satisfactory there.  I also realise that the staff, the management and the patients have put up with a great deal in order to keep their very fine facility and that work has been carried out under great pressure.</P>
      <P>I hope to have some definite views to convey on the matter quite shortly to all of the Deputies in the area.  I am glad that the question has been raised here tonight.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in wishing the Minister every success in the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak tonight about Edenderry. There has been a promise from as far <Col N="1367" /> back as 1985 that a 40-bed unit would be provided at Edenderry District Hospital. This was to be in the context of an overall scheme for the county involving the development of hospital bed units in Tullamore and Birr as well as Edenderry.</P>
    <P>Tonight I reflect the very serious concern of the people of the Edenderry area about the failure to date to provide a 40-bed unit at the Edenderry District Hospital for the elderly people of that area.  That is an issue of top priority to the people residing right across the Edenderry area of County Offaly.  As far back as March last the Chief Executive Officer of the Midland Health Board, Mr. Doherty said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Edenderry proposal was at the most advanced stage of the three proposed units in Offaly, the others being located at Tullamore and Birr.  He went on to say it would be helpful if the Midland Health Board pressed the Minister for sanction for construction.</P>
      <P>The position is that at present this proposal is awaiting approval by the Department of Health to go to tender.  Many people who have sick relatives or people wishing to enter hospital at present are being sent to different hospitals quite a distance away, in Mountmellick, Athlone and different surrounding areas.  As the Minister will be aware, there is grave difficulty experienced in gaining admittance even to those hospitals.  In fact some people at present hospitalised there are asked to go home to make beds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a number of representations from people requesting me to have this project pushed forward.  I am sure the Minister will share my concern and use her good offices to have this <Col N="1368" /> proposal sanctioned at the earliest possible opportunity when she will be highly thought of right across the county.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Enright for raising this problem of which I am aware.  Though not in my constituency it is within the Midland Health Board area and has been highlighted over a period of time.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of finance.  Tenders are in and all is ready, but it is a matter for each health board to establish their priorities and determine where capital moneys can be spent.  I know that Deputy Enright and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment present spoke to me in my previous portfolio about this project for which there is great need in Edenderry.</P>
      <P>With the finite budgets available to me for allocation to the various health boards they, within their finite budgets, must establish their priorities.  However, I will undertake to have the matter examined as requested.  I will take a close look at the budget to be announced for the Midland Health Board to ascertain whether it affords any leeway for the commencement of this project, when I will be in touch with the Deputy and the Minister of State present about the matter.  I thank the Deputy for having raised the issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Gweedore has the reputation of being the most densely populated rural area in Ireland if not in Europe, accommodating an industrial estate with a workforce in the region of 1,000 people, five primary schools and a community school, at least seven hotels and various other businesses. It has a severe housing crisis.  For a parish of its size and population it is unique in Donegal, in that it has not got one single local authority housing scheme, many of its senior citizens living <Col N="1369" /> in demountable dwellings and sub-standard accommodation.  Many young couples and their families live in caravans, mobile homes or in overcrowded conditions.  It is impossible and prohibitively expensive to obtain rented accommodation in the parish.</P>
    <P>In spite of significant industrial development the local authority have failed completely to provide for the housing needs of the parish.  Sites in the centre of the parish are almost unobtainable.  In the past year there has built up a tradition of building one's own home in Gweedore, when substantial Gaeltacht grants were availed of and the people proudly built their own homes.  With the escalation in building costs and the inadequacy of grants that practice has almost ceased.  The lack of housing in the parish is contributing to social problems and even emigration.  Plans for a 24-house scheme were submitted by Donegal County Council to the Department of the Environment in 1984.  I understand approval of the scheme was issued by the Department in March 1985, but, unfortunately, little or no progress has been made since.</P>
    <P>I am requesting the Minister of State present, and the Minister himself &mdash; who is no stranger to Gweedore and knows the position obtaining there &mdash; to have this matter investigated immediately and provide the requisite resources so that the scheme, approved since 1985, can proceed without further delay.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council received an allocation of £2.583 million for their 1991 programme, allowing them to start or acquire 100 houses throughout the county.  I should say it is a matter for the local authority themselves to determine how this allocation is distributed having regard to the needs of each area of the county.  My Department have approved the cost plan, lay-out and house types for a 24-house scheme at Gweedore, subject <Col N="1370" /> to some technical considerations.  I must stress that it is a matter for the local authority to determine, within the limits of their annual allocation and the authorised number of new starts when to nominate this scheme as part of their housing programme.  I might add that we have now changed our method of allocation and do not any longer name schemes.  Therefore, it is a matter for the relevant local authority to decide on their priorities.  In turn, it is a matter for Donegal County Council to decide, when they receive their allocation, what housing schemes they should proceed with.</P>

      <P>I want to appeal to the Minister of State present to make available a special road grant to Dublin County Council to allow for the commencement of work on the Upper Carrickhill Road in Portmarnock, County Dublin.  This is a county road which carries the equivalent traffic volume of many national primary roads and indeed more traffic than many national secondary roads, approximately 5,000 vehicles daily, while roads such as those in the Minister's constituency from Tullamore to Birr would not carry anything like that amount of traffic but can receive full grants from his Department.</P>
      <P>Of more significance is the presence on this road of a 1,000-pupil community school, putting these pupils' lives at great risk daily as they enter and leave school on to a 24-foot road without any footpaths and on a bad bend.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council prepared plans a number of years ago and lands were acquired under compulsory purchase orders and paid for.  But on account of severe cutbacks in rate support grants to Dublin County Council over the past four years, they have not been able to find the requisite £500,000 to undertake this full improvement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister to pay out, not the full £500,000 required but £100,000 needed to implement an interim <Col N="1371" /> improvement scheme, that is to straighten one bend, provide a footpath on the school side of the road and undertake the drainage and accommodation work on the project.  Such interim scheme would greatly enhance the safety of these pupils and other road users.  If there is a child killed on that road I predict the requisite money will be found.  Let us not wait for this type of tragedy to occur.  I appeal to the Minister to act immediately to rectify a problem which would not exist if Departments of State, such as Education and others, were subjected to the normal planning process required of a private developer when this school would not have received planning permission without the road in the vicinity having been made good.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to reply to me that his Department do not give special grants because there were plenty available a few years ago to upgrade roads for the EC dinner held in Malahide Castle.  Let us see some more of those special grants being given for the improvement of this road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank <Col N="1372" /> Deputy Owen for having raised this matter.  I should say that Carrickhill is not a national road and is the responsibility of Dublin County Council.  First, Dublin County Council can undertake such work out of their own resources and, second, by way of a discretionary grant.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the discretionary grant to Dublin County Council from my Department in 1986 amounted to £972,000 which was increased this year to £1,395,000. However, determination of priorities in the expenditure of such grant is a matter for the local authority themselves.  The Deputy knows full well that it is a matter for Dublin County Council &mdash; or any other local authority nationwide &mdash; to decide on their priorities.</P>
      <P>Regrettably I have no funds at my disposal for the improvement of this road. I must reiterate that it is a matter for the Deputy's local authority, that is Dublin County Council, and their elected members to decide on their priorities, just as it would be for any other local authority with a road of the same nature.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 November 1991.</P>

      <P>Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1991, sets out the arrangements which will apply in relation to the reorganisation of local government in Dublin.  This involves the establishment of three area committees by the county council, the appointment of three area managers and the preparation of a reorganisation report jointly by the area managers in consultation with the area committees and the Dublin city and county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the Act, this report will outline the general arrangements needed in preparation for the abolition of the existing county council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the establishment of the new county councils, and it will outline the administrative, organisational and transitional measures necessary. The Act provides that, in preparing the report, regard must be had to the need for the co-ordination of services and it contains a specific provision under which the report must include an outline of the co-ordination arrangements considered necessary between any two or <Col N="1189" /> more of the proposed councils and between them and Dublin Corporation. It must also specify any services which should be provided jointly by any two or more authorities.</P>
    <P>Copies of the reorganisation report are to be submitted to the Minister and to the Dublin authorities, including Dublin Corporation, who may make submissions to the Minister.  Under the Act, it is only when he has considered this report that the Minister could make regulations to give effect to necessary preparations for the establishment of the new councils.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the foregoing that the Local Government Act, 1991, sets out a framework within which the preparations for, and the transition towards, the establishment of the new councils in Dublin can take place.  The Act deals only with the basic principles on which the reorganisation is to be effected and leaves it to the local authorities, in the first instance, to develop proposals for detailed working arrangements, including co-ordination of services.  I am satisfied that this is the right approach and I do not therefore propose to intervene in the matter at this stage.  I will, of course, be considering the question of co-ordination fully at a later stage in the light of the proposals in the reorganisation report.</P>

      <P>The <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> indicated that there were about 6,500 rented local authority dwellings still lacking bathroom facilities (some 2,500 of which also lacked an indoor toilet) and announced the introduction of a new sub-programme backed by a special provision of £2 million in 1991 to assist local authorities progressively to eliminate this deficiency in their housing stock.</P>
      <P>In regard to housing generally, the 1990 survey of the housing stock, which will be published shortly, indicates a very significant improvement in the position regarding sanitary facilities over the past ten years.  In addition, the results of the 1991 census of population will provide the usual ten yearly definitive figures.</P>
      <P>The provision of bathroom facilities in private houses occupied by disabled or elderly persons can be assisted under the disabled persons grants scheme and the task force for the elderly.  Under the new scheme of improvements in lieu of local authority housing which was introduced in the <i>Plan for Social Housing,</i> local authorities may also provide these facilities in the context of making a house fit for occupation by a household that is qualified for local authority housing.  Furthermore, the revised loan and income limits for local authority house improvement loans, announced in the plan, should help occupiers of private housing to provide these facilities.</P>

The cost would fall to be met from local resources, supplemented by the discretionary grant provided by my Department.

The immediate aim of that policy is to achieve a reduction in road-related deaths and injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major road safety campaign was launched in September 1990.  Its success to date can be judged by the fact that provisional statistics for the first nine months of 1991 show that road deaths have fallen by over 13 per cent as compared to the same period in 1990.  The overall campaign places particular emphasis on the safety of children and this is reflected in the awareness aspect of the campaign.  This is the responsibility <Col N="1200" /> of the National Safety Council whose programme for the campaign included the launch of a special road safety video aimed at young people.</P>

      <P>The question of permitting &ldquo;left turn on red&rdquo; in the circumstances suggested was examined by my Department in 1987 when the conclusion was that the potential adverse safety implications would outweigh any advantages in terms of traffic flow, lower exhaust emissions and fuel saving.  In the circumstances, it is not my intention to change the law in this regard.  It is, of course, permissible for local authorities, <Col N="1204" /> with the consent of the Garda, to make provisions, through traffic signs and signals at particular junctions, to allow leftturning movements where these can be accommodated without adverse safety implications.</P>

      <P>Section 12, Finance Act, 1967, provides relief for expenses incurred for maintenance or treatment in a private nursing home.  For the relief to apply the following conditions must be met: the nursing home must be approved by the Minister for Health for the purposes of section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 or by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Health; the stay in the nursing home must be necessitated by &ldquo;an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the advent of the EC Single Market on 1 January 1993, it will be necessary to discontinue most of the existing customs checks and controls on intra-Community traffic.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Revenue Commissioners carried out a study to assess the impact of this event on staffing in the Customs and Excise service and to consider revised organisational structures appropriate to the post-1992 environment.</P>
      <P>The resulting report &mdash; made available to all members of the Customs and Excise staff and union representatives &mdash; showed a substantial reduction in staff numbers required to perform the traditional Customs and Excise work remaining post-1992 and proposed certain changes in organisational structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present organisational structure, the country is divided for Customs and Excise purposes, into five administrative areas known as collections. Each collection is in the charge of a collector.  The report proposed that, in the post-1922 environment, for collections only would be required (viz. Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Galway) with Limerick being closed as the seat of a collection.  It is envisaged that all the work now administered by the collector Limerick would be redistributed among <Col N="1207" /> Galway, Cork and Waterford collections and the collector's office in Limerick (23 staff) would be closed.  It is proposed that 82 staff currently serving in the stations attached to the Limerick collection area will continue to serve in the same locations but within new administrative areas.</P>
    <P>In making this particular proposal, the future volume and concentration of Revenue work in the provincial collections and the suitable location of administrative centres were taken into account.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the proposals and findings in the report are based on certain assumptions and positions relating to the Single Market.  Some of these issues have not yet been fully worked out, either because basic decisions on direction (Community or national) have yet to be reached, or, because practical measures for the implementation of decisions taken &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; have yet to be advanced. Consequently the proposals are necessarily tentative.</P>
    <P>It may emerge that compensating revenue and non-revenue work will absorb some of the surplus Customs and Excise staff resources.  This situation is still developing and is being fully explored by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of the commissioners to try to provide a career for all Customs and Excise staff in, or close to, their present locations so as to minimise domestic disruption to staff and their families. It is envisaged that discussions between the commissioners and staff interests will be on-going as the situation develops in order to resolve this issue.  Given a reasonable degree of flexibility on the part of Revenue staff interests there is a good possibility that a substantial proportion of any staff surplus arising in Limerick can be absorbed within Revenue there when a branch of the commissioners' office is re-located in <Col N="1208" /> Limerick in 1993 under the Government's decentralisation programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.  The stretch of the River Bonet between Dromahair and Lough Gill was excluded from the Bonet catchment drainage scheme for practical and economic reasons.  The channel immediately downstream of Dromahair (the Lower Bonet) has a very steep gradient levelling out as it nears the lake.  These lower reaches of the channel comprising two-thirds of its length are greatly influenced by lake levels which would to a large extent negate the effects of any drainage works.  Drainage work upstream of Dromahair has had a negligible effect on water levels in the lake. The bed of the river is largely composed of rock which would render prohibitive the cost of any works which might be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that drainage upstream has changed the pattern of water flows, the Commissioners of Public works have had a number of surveys of the area carried out during the course of scheme works and the results of these show that the drainage scheme has not caused any deterioration of the position.  Any flooding which occurs is of shorter duration through marginally more extensive than existed pre-drainage and the commissioners are satisfied with the capacity of the river to cater for post-drainage flows.  The commissioners will, of course keep the position under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Killerry River enters the Bonet at a point downstream of Dromahair and like the Lower Bonet is largely influenced by water levels in Lough Gill.  It is not included for drainage as part of the scheduled works of the Bonet drainage <Col N="1213" /> scheme.  However, recently a scheme of drainage works for the Killerry River has been advertised for pre-qualification to contractors so that the commissioners would be in a position to commence works rapidly should such a decision to proceed be made.</P>

      <P>In July last I made an order under the Video Recordings Act, 1989, which enables the film censor to prohibit the supply of pornographic videos.</P>

      <P>All uniforms used by members of the Garda Síochána, and the prison service, traffic wardens and other persons employed by <Col N="1219" /> my Department or by bodies under their aegis are supplied under contracts awarded by the Govenment Supplies Agency on the basis of open tender competition and I understand that all such contracts in 1990 were placed with Irish firms.  The total expenditure involved in the supply of such uniforms in 1990 was £1,357,000 approximately.  The quantities involved were approximately 9,000 uniforms, 3,000 overcoats and additional supplies of individual items of uniform. In addition £77,590 was paid to senior members of the Garda Síochána by way of uniform allowance.  The more detailed information sought in the question is not readily available to my Department and its compilation would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>

      <P>I have no such proposals. However, the income limit for local authority house purchase and improvement loans is regularly reviewed in the light of inflation.  Arising from the last such review, the limit was increased from £10,000 to £12,000, with effect from 14 February 1991, in the case of an application where there is only one earner.</P>

      <P>The bridge in question is owned and maintained by Iarnród Éireann.  In July 1991, following emergency repairs carried out by Iarnród Éireann and pending permanent strengthening works, Leitrim County Council imposed a weight restriction prohibiting use of the bridge by vehicles with an overall weight exceeding 1.5 tonnes.</P>
      <P>Agreement has recently been reached between the council and Iarnród Éireann that the solution to the structural problem is to provide a concrete saddle over the arch and Iarnród Éireann's design staff are preparing the design and drawings for this work.  The question of the funding will be the subject of further discussions between the council and Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>No provision has been made, in the Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989-93, for the carrying out of major improvement works on the N16 during the period of the programme. Grants have been made available, however, for normal improvements to this road.  In 1991, road grants totalling £125,000 have been paid to Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council for pavement strengthening works in the townlands of Gortnagrelly and Lugnagall in County Sligo, and at Manorhamilton in County Leitrim.  In addition, a grant of £45,000 has been allocated to Leitrim County Council for bridge strengthening on the route.</P>

      <P>Aras Attracta, Swinford, was completed in 1985, and has a capacity for 186 adult places.  The first resident was admitted on 7 November 1988 and 86 places have been commissioned to date.  The Western Health Board, which is responsible in the first instance for the administration of this centre, are examining the possibility of transferring a further 40 people with mental handicap from St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar, to Aras Attracta during 1992.  It is hoped to offer further places to Aras Attracta to people with mental handicap currently in centres outside of the Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper will be a discussion document designed to initiate a process of consultation and dialogue leading to a policy White Paper and later an Education Act.  Accordingly no formal consultation or meetings have taken place on the Green Paper with any of the concerned interests in advance of its publication. In the course of the regular meetings, which take place on an ongoing basis between the Department and representatives of the various uconcerned interests, e.g. teachers, parents and school managers, groups would occassionally have expressed their general views in relation to the Green Paper. However the Department have not engaged in any detailed or specific discussions with any group except to emphasise that all interests will have ample opportunity to make their views known following the publications of the Green Paper.</P>

      <P>Inquiries have been made from the relevant local authorities and I regret to say that the person in question does not, under the current regulations, qualify for a higher education grant or for a vocational education committee scholarship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as recently agreed in the Programme for Government, the amendment of the higher education grants scheme in a number of areas is being considered.  The proposed amendments include regarding a mature student who secures a place in an approved course in a recognised third-level institution as <Col N="1237" /> satisfying the academic requirements for the award of a grant under the scheme. When a decision has been arrived at in relation to these proposals details of the scheme will be available from the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>Tender documents have been completed for the proposed extension to the school in County Limerick referred to by the Deputy.  The question of the invitation of tenders is being considered in the context of the 1992 budgetary situation and the many priorities and commitments. I am not therefore in a position to say, at this stage, when tenders will be invited for the project.  Officials from my Department met with the school authorities recently and fully explained the situation to them.</P>
      <P>Due to pressure of work I am not in a position, at this point, to meet a delegation from the school.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 14 May 1991 (Official Report Volume 408, column 776) to a question on this subject, I am committed to the maximum possible amount of decentalisation.  I have asked Telecom Éireann to have a further look at the possibility of finding staff for decentralisation and I understand from the company that any future opportunity to locate staff in Waterford will be considered very seriously.  Meanwhile my Department are in contact with Telecom Éireann about the possibility of finding staff which might be decentralised to Waterford.  The provision of office accommodation for any Telecom Éireann staff located in Waterford would be a matter for the company.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Chairman of CIE that automatic half barriers were installed at Newberry East level crossing, County Cork in 1989 and at Oranmore level crossing, County Galway in 1991. These crossings were previously gated level crossings operated by a crossing keeper.</P>
      <P>In addition to these automatic barriers, semi-automatic barriers were installed at Skehacraeggaun and at Dock Road, County Limerick.  These crossings are both situated on the Limerick Cement factory siding.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that automatic level <Col N="1240" /> crossings operating in conjunction with associated warning lights, road traffic signs and markings are safer for road users than older gated crossings.</P>

      <P>The Chairman of CIE has informed me that the track at Torrydonnellan accommodation crossing on the Dublin-Athlone railway was raised approximately 8" during track renewal work in 1990.</P>
      <P>I understand that following the track renewal the road approaches to the crosssing were improved by Westmeath County Council to compensate for the track lift.  The width of the crossing surface was also increased to meet the demands of road users.  I am advised that when the track structure settles early in the New Year it is proposed to install a precast concrete surface, which is on order at present.</P>
      <P>Manned attendance is not provided at the level crossing and users have responsibility for opening and closing the gates and for the safe use of the crossing.</P>
