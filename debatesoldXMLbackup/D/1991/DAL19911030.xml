      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the relationship of the Chester Beatty Library with his Department as evident in the manner in which new trustees were recently appointed and having regard to the funds given to the library from State resources, he intends to introduce legislation to put the library on an accountable statutory basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am monitoring carefully the manner in which the trustees are managing the Chester Beatty Library with the moneys provided by my Department and the Office of Public Works.  As I indicated to the House last week, I hope that matters will now proceed more satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The question of legislation, therefore, does not arise but the continued Exchequer funding could, if necessary, be made subject to stated requirements which it would be reasonable to expect to be observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate how his Department are carefully <Col N="1878" /> monitoring the operations of this library given that last week in the House it was with surprise he learned of the appointment of Dr. Masterson and Mr. Desmond as trustees of the board of the library?  Surely, that indicates that the monitoring mechanisms in his Department are woefully deficient and that legislation is, therefore, necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.  The trustees had the right to co-opt new trustees. My Department and I were not aware that they proposed to appoint two new trustees but when I talk about monitoring I am talking about the general management of the library and all questions of administration.  The co-option of two trustees by the board of trustees would not normally come within the definition of &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only because the Chester Beatty Library is of such immense significance that I am pressing this question today, I accept there are other matters of concern.  Would the Taoiseach not finally accept and can a message not to be sent to the people in Shrewsbury Road that their stewardship of these possessions, which belong to the Irish nation, is woefully deficient despite the best efforts of his Department?  Would he not reconsider&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that as a result of continuing discussions which have been going on now for a period, I hope that a new director will be appointed and that the entire administration and management of the library will greatly improve.  I suggested here the last day that the Deputy &mdash; and Deputies generally &mdash; should give the <Col N="1879" /> new arrangements an opportunity to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not a normal civil servant in my Department; he comes from one of the cultural institutions within the ambit of my Department and he is a very skilled professional person.  I am not sure exactly when he will take up the appointment as director, but I understand it is imminent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the House on 16 October that, on 8 October, along with the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Food, Labour and Social Welfare, I met the Central Review Committee to discuss the general economic and fiscal situation.  It was agreed at that meeting that bilateral discussions at officials' level between the Government and the social partners should take place on issues relevant to commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the 1992 budgetary outlook.  These bilateral discussions are now under way and, so far as the recently negotiated Programme for Government is concerned, matters of relevance will form part of the discussions. It is envisaged that a meeting between members of the Government and the social partners will be held at a later stage when the discussions are further advanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach confirm that any alterations which might be made to the terms and conditions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as ratified by the Dáil, are a matter primarily of concern for the social partners and the Government, that representations from teachers' unions and other public sector unions to Opposition Deputies can only fall on deaf ears as we had no part to play in the negotiation of such terms and that any proposed changes are a matter primarily of concern for the Government and the public sector unions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that the discussions taking place are a matter primarily for the social partners and the Government, although, of course, the <Col N="1881" /> outcome of those discussions will be a matter of very great public interest.</P>

      <P>In the light of the Taoiseach's and the Government's experience over the past nine months of the operation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> is he now prepared to reconsider his decision not to establish an Oireachtas economic affairs committee who would be able to participate in this ongoing process?</P>

      <asker>Mr. Sheehan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the latest position on the return of the Bandon Mace to the Bandon Town Commissioners for display in the Bandon museum in County Cork.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bandon Mace is in the possession of the National Museum. It was given on loan to the museum and the lender indicated that responsibility for decisions in relation to its display rests solely with the museum while on loan there.</P>
      <P>The Bandon Town Commissioners have raised the issue of returning the mace for permanent display in Bandon on a number of occasions, including with my predecessor, Deputy Nealon, when he was Minister for Arts and Culture, and directly with the National Museum.</P>
      <P>The response that has always been given is that the museum authorities consider that the mace should be retained as part of the national collection and I am not prepared to overrule that judgment.</P>
      <P>I will, however, discuss with the museum authorities appropriate arrangements to place it on display for a short period in Bandon, subject to satisfactory security arrangements being agreed.  I would also urge that the Bandon Town Commissioners would accept the offer of the museum to provide a silver replica for permanent display in Bandon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply is very unsatisfactory.  The Bandon Town Commissioners have made repeated requests to the National Museum for the return of the Bandon Mace which was lent to the National Museum by Lady Jennifer Bernard some years ago.  Now that there is a museum of distinction in Bandon &mdash; I hope the Taoiseach will visit it when he is next in west Cork &mdash; it is right and proper that this mace should be returned to the town of Bandon to be displayed in the museum.</P>

However, Lady Jennifer Bernard, to whom the Deputy referred, confirmed in writing that the museum are in full charge of the mace, have the responsibility for its safe-keeping and the right to decide when and where it shall be on display.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

I support the point raised by him; I wish to point out to the Taoiseach &mdash; and I hope he will respond &mdash; that not just the Bandon Town Commissioners but the Bandon community are very keen to see the restoration of the mace to the town as secure arrangements have been made within the town to ensure that, on its return, it will be fully and properly looked after.  In that context, will the Taoiseach have whatever meetings are necessary to review this decision?</P>

      <P>Funding for projects relating to the physical heritage is available from the National Heritage Council, subject to my approval.  The council have already assisted a project in a town now designated as a heritage town.</P>
      <P>The question of whether to offer grant assistance to projects is entirely a matter for the council who have complete independence in deciding on the priorities for grant assistance and the amount, if any, in each case.  It would be a matter for those concerned with projects in heritage towns to make application direct to the council.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a lack of knowledge among the towns which have been designated in regard to what grants are available.  Will the Taoiseach make available to Members &mdash; or ask the National Heritage Council to say exactly what they propose to do &mdash; the rate of grant and in what circumstances the grants will be awarded?</P>

      <P>Education resource material dealing with HIV/AIDS has been developed by the Departments of Education and Health and was distributed to all post-primary schools by the Department of Education at the beginning of October 1990.</P>
      <P>In addition, it has been distributed to youth clubs and organisation, communtiy training workshops organised by FÁS as well as to the educational services in prisons.  Parent groups and others have requested the material.  There is little doubt that there is a widespread demand for the material.</P>
      <P>Also, a major programme of local seminars dealing with the use of the material has been organised by the Department of Education in conjunction with the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>In total, 17 seminars for teachers were held at local venues during the past school year and this programme of in-service training is continuing this year.  For example, seven seminars are planned for this term.  Much of the feedback on the use of the material is being provided during these seminars.  Some special seminars are being organised for those dealing with particular circumstances e.g. community training workshops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the resource material and its distribution together with the associated in-service training for <Col N="1890" /> teachers has been welcomed with enthusiasm and I am satisfied that the materials are being used wisely.</P>
    <P>The question of an educational programme related to AIDS at primary level will be considered as part of the overall review of the programme at second level.</P>
    <P>The provision of sex education in schools is a matter for the management authorities of the indivisual school in consultation with parents and the staff of the school.  My Department also issued guidelines to the authorities of secondary schools in February 1987 on the development of sex/relationship education.</P>
    <P>In relation to primary education, the Primary Curriculum Review Body in the course of their comments on health education in their report last year, recommended an examination of issues relating to &ldquo;sexuality education&rdquo;.  This recommendation is receiving attention in my Department.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that a programme has issued to schools, is the Minister not aware that the vast majority of second level schools are not operating this programme?  The National Parents' Council recently indicated that from their cursory survey &mdash; they are now carrying out an in-depth analysis of the matter &mdash; there is no AIDS education or awareness programme in operation in the vast majority of schools and that there is a need to greatly accelerate the in-service courses for teachers because teachers feel very ill-equipped to deal with what is a very sensitive but very vital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely incorrect to say that the vast majority of second level schools are not operating this programme.  Indeed by making that statement the Deputy is doing a grave disservice to the schools which are carrying out the programmes very efficiently and conscientiously.  The number of seminars which have been held and the number of enthusiastic teachers who have attended them bear witness to the fact that teachers are extremely conscious of the urgent need for such courses.  A <Col N="1891" /> survey of schools is being undertaken by my Department on the use of the materials and that will be carried out in the earlier part of 1992.</P>
      <P>I accept that Deputy Higgins shares my concern in this regard.  Thankfully all sides of the House agree on the urgent necessity to have these issues addressed in a proper educational setting, always with the agreement of the parents taking into account the distinct ethos of the particular school.  Neither I nor the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon are content to let the matter rest at that.  Following the dissemination of information to all the schools and the holding of seminars, we are now carrying out a survey as to how much time each school is spending on the programme and how many schools are operating it, again, as I said, against the background of their particular ethos.  I also intend to issue again to post-primary schools an updated and reviewed copy of the Department's sex relationship guidelines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey being carried out will show that the National Parents' Council are right in that a minority of schools are operating the programmes as distinct from having them.  May I ask the Minister if there has been any liaison between her Department and or the Department of Health with ACETP, the AIDS, Care, Education and Training Programme, which operates in Northern Ireland?  This is a very successful programme aimed at a high impact message given by people who have practical experience of working with AIDS victims. It is operated on an extremely low budget but is very effective.  Can the Minister say if there is any liaison or dialogue between the authorities in the North and ourselves on the respective programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, there is very distinct liaison between the Minister for Health and myself.  We formulated the programme together and as I said in the reply, our Departments worked together in the holding of the <Col N="1892" /> seminars and the dissemination of information. As regards the information on the AIDS association operating in the North, I have not that precise information here but I will convey it to Deputy Higgins.</P>
      <P>The joint programme adopted between the Department of Health and the Department of Education has been presented at a number of international workshops and conferences organised by bodies such as the WHO, the International Union of Health Education and the European Community.  They have asked us to furnish them with our materials and we have done so.  The feedback from that was that they are held in very high regard by each of those international organisations and they compare very favourably with any similar resource pack available elsewhere.  We accept that the resource material is authoritatively and authentically produced.  It now remains for me to follow up on the survey of the huge number of enthusiastic teachers who have presented themselves at the seminars to see how they are faring in their schools with the programmes which they are operating.  Both the Deputy and I share a common interest to ensure that young people are provided with the very necessary information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13, 24, 27, 36, 48, 58, 60, 74, 79, 85, 181, 182, 194, 195, 196 and 197 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> In the course of my speech in this House on 18 October 1991, on the Motion of Confidence in the Government I made an extensive and detailed statement on the whole Carysfort issue with particular reference to the purchase of the property by UCD.  I refer Deputies to this statement in which I put on record the position in relation to many of the issues raised in these questions.  Further to that statement I wish to reiterate that in the process leading to the purchase of Carysfort by UCD no meetings, correspondence, agreements or contacts of any kind took place between myself or my officials and the vendors or their agents.  All such contacts were made by the UCD authorities.</P>
    <P>In late October 1989, my Department were approached by the agent for the new owner who it subsequently transpired were Davmac Developments Limited to explore our interest in any future use of Carysfort College.  This approach resulted in an offer for sale on behalf of the new owners on 28 February 1990 of the Carysfort premises and 20 acres of land for £8.25 million.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge the only involvement by the Taoiseach in the sale of the property to UCD was the meeting of 12 December 1990 which I referred to in my statement and a telephone conversation of 21 December 1990 with Dr. Masterson, President of UCD, which he refers to in his statement of 8 October 1991.  In the course of this statement Dr. Masterson confirms that this was the only meeting he had with the Taoiseach and this was also attended by the chairman of the Graduate Business School and myself.  The £9.7 million voted by the Dáil as a supplementary estimate on 18 December 1990 was made available, in the normal way, to the Higher Education Authority.  I understand that no fees were paid by UCD to any estate agents in connection with the purchase of the property.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made that my Department should purchase Carysfort. This suggestion was not feasible since my Department does not operate third level colleges.  A further <Col N="1897" /> consideration was that unless a definite use for the premises had been established before its acquisition substantial maintenance costs would have arisen.  The suitability of the premises for use as a regional technical college was considered. A detailed study carried out by technical officers of my Department made it clear that it was not suitable for this purpose.  Its use for the Business Graduate School was not in question at that time in view of the plans to develop it at Roebuck.</P>
    <P>As the President of UCD noted in his recent statement the situation changed in 1990 when financial problems arose regarding the development of the business school on the Roebuck site.  The possibility thus presented itself for the first time that the Government's policy on expanding third level places and UCD development plans for its business school could coincide.</P>
    <P>I met with representatives of UCD in early September 1990.  In a number of further meetings over a short period of time it became clear to me and to the UCD authorities that up to 600 additional undergraduate student places could be provided at the Belfield campus if UCD could secure Carysfort for this Graduate Business School.</P>
    <P>I indicated that UCD should pursue the possibility of acquiring Carysfort and that the Government for their part would be open to consider any proposal which might subsequently arise.  A formal proposal was made to me on 29 November, 1990 in a letter from the Secretary of UCD.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately Question No. 14 was answered before Question No. 26, which really is the kernel of the issue I was hoping to raise.  I questioned <Col N="1903" /> the Minister previously on this matter and she was in agreement with me.  Will the Minister make provision in the curriculum for primary schools and in the syllabus for primary teachers for the teaching of one continental language, at least in the allocated time of 20 hours and 50 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is asked in Question No. 26.  In line with that I refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of 12 February 1991 in which I stated that Continental languages do not at present form part of the primary school curriculum and that the Curriculum Review Body recommended against the inclusion of a third language in the curriculum. As I said at that time, I am keeping the matter under review.  It is worth pointing out that French can be taken as an option in the primary teacher training course at St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra and Mary Immaculate College in Limerick.</P>

      <P>We have gone beyond the question but I am pleased to answer Deputy Deasy at any time.  As I have said, the Curriculum Review Body did not support that idea.  Their report had been disseminated throughout the NCEA.  The debate which you and I had Deputy some months ago will, I am sure, be looked at by the members of the review body and perhaps they will come back to us on it.  I prefer to proceed in an orderly manner rather than issuing diktats on the matter.  However, I hope that the debate that has emerged here will be taken on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The list relates to Deputy Gilmore's previous question on the matter, Question No. 669 of 16 October 1991.  The total current enrolment of those 57 schools is about 21,000 pupils. Grants for teachers' salaries in those schools amount to about £23 million annually.  The total amount paid in other grants is in the order of £2.5 million a year.  The amount in question, then, is £23 million to £25 million annually.  At post-primary level the schools in question are recognised secondary schools which did not opt into the scheme for free post-primary education introduced in 1967. National schools do not charge fees and those private primary schools which do charge fees are not recognised as part of the State supported system of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister three brief supplementary questions. First, is she giving consideration in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper to changing the level of subsidisation to fee paying post-primary schools?  Secondly, has she given any consideration to the possibility that some of those fee-paying post primary schools may now wish to opt into the free education system and is she disposed towards that?  Thirdly, can the Minister offer any <Col N="1905" /> justification for the State continuing to pay £25 million a year as a subsidy to private education while at the same time she refuses to sanction appointment of teachers, extension to school buildings, renovation of buildings and so on for the rest of the education system due to lack of finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know that recently there has been quite a debate about the matter, a debate fuelled by radio, television and the newspapers. The debate has all been in the context of the Green Paper and it is very helpful towards the ongoing education debate. The Deputy asked whether the Green Paper would address the issue of fee-paying schools.  Yes, that matter will be considered and discussed in the context of the Green Paper and that will hold for us and the various interested parties to have further discussions on the matter.  I do not consider that I have been in any way backward at proclaiming that, so I make that statement quite clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether I had given consideration to schools in the fee-paying system that might wish to opt into the free system.  Obviously, that would arise from discussions.  I stress that the Green Paper is a paper of discussion and consultation, not of diktat, so in a hypothetical case schools may well wish to opt for the free system.  We would certainly consider the position if any of the schools in the fee-paying system did opt to change into the free system.  We are discussing something that might occur later on, but I do wish to be as helpful as possible.  The Deputy also asked for a justification of my Department continuing, in the context of scarce resources, to pay in the region of £23 million to £25 million to schools in the fee-paying system.  I wish to make two points in that regard.  Of course, children stand to be educated no matter which school they attend.  Obviously, if schools wished to opt into the free system they would then fall into the pupil-teacher ratio arrangements of the day.  That would want to be put very clearly on record.  Also, it is because of the need to look at what appear to be <Col N="1906" /> anomalies and inequities that the matter will be addressed in a consultative fashion in the Green Paper.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to amalgamate Saint Kevin's boys, girls and junior schools when the refurbishment scheme for the permanent buildings has been completed.

      <P>I ask the Minister to <Col N="1907" /> recall a meeting she had with myself and Councillor Betty Coffey representing Deputy David Andrews on 18 January 1990 when the Minister gave an assurance that the work in question would be completed by September 1990.  Is the Minister aware that the request for the amalgamation of the schools dates back to 1985 when the Department of Education requested the amalgamation?  Is she aware, too, that she gave approval for an additional teacher under the special scheme to help schools in deprived areas on condition that the amalgamation of the schools took place by September 1990.  We are now heading into 1992 and the best the Minister can say is that the amalgamation is still proposed.  I ask the Minister to give a categoric assurance here today that she will go back to her Department and make the funds available immediately for various reasons, none more important than that the infants' school is housed in buildings that are old and falling down, that the children have to use an outside toilet in weather such as we are having at the moment and that it would be cheaper for the Department to amalgamate the schools &mdash; it would save money and land would be available for sale which would more than recoup the costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Deputy Barrett, I did indeed have a meeting with you, with Councillor Betty Coffey and with some parents from the schools as well. My Department are committed to this scheme.  I refer the Deputy to a question of 23 April 1991 to which the answer given to Deputy Gilmore &mdash; Deputy Barrett himself also asked questions at the same time &mdash; stated that my Department's architects had completed the working drawings and specifications for the proposed improvement works to Saint Kevin's schools, Sallynoggin, County Dublin.  Those documents were forwarded to the school authorities at the <Col N="1908" /> end of March or the beginning of April to enable them to make application to the local authorities for by-law approval. I presume that would take the requisite two months and then a third month for final approval, which would take it to June, and the permission would have come through in the final document. While the decision to look for amalgamation and then the subsequent granting of a teacher within the status may go back to 1985, the procedures have gone on ahead and it now remains for us within the context of the upcoming Estimates to decide on our priorities for 1992.  I shall certainly bear in mind the very strong representations made to me on the matter by Dáil Deputies, by elected representatives from outside the House and by parents.</P>

Unfortunately subjects which do not carry examination status often receive less emphasis and do not receive their due recognition.  I am waiting to ascertain what syllabus will be presented to me by the NCCA in regard to civics, political and social studies on the schools curriculum. I agree with the Deputy that subjects such as civics often can be addressed in a cross-curricular manner, <Col N="1911" /> so that modules or elements can be encompassed within other subjects.</P>

    <P>The Department at all times try to ensure that only qualified substitutes are employed in national schools.  Last September Circular 21/90 was issued to boards of management advising them that untrained substitutes could be employed only in exceptional circumstances. If an unqualified substitute is employed the chairperson must complete and submit a certification form to the Department certifying that every effort was made to secure a qualified teacher before payment is issued.  Letters are issued regularly to boards that employ unqualified substitutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the Department telling the boards of management of national schools they must fill in a form every time they obtain an unqualified teacher &mdash; proving that they have tried every other possibility &mdash; what steps are taken by the Minister or her Department to assist such boards of management in obtaining qualified teachers as substitutes?  It would appear each board of management must hawk around the country seeking a qualified teacher, as a substitute, in a rush, perhaps having been advised only that morning or the evening before when it could appear also that there is no assistance whatsoever forthcoming from the Minister or her Department?  What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that there are sufficient qualified teachers available <Col N="1913" /> because I am sure she would agree it is an absolute disgrace to have children in any school taught by an unqualified teacher?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised many questions which I shall be delighted to answer.  It is quite incorrect for the Deputy to state that I or my Department have not done anything to ensure that boards of management are assisted in obtaining qualified teachers.</P>

      <P>The Catholic managers association say differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had meetings with the Catholic schools' managers association on the matter.  They clearly told me they found it very difficult, despite the fact that they have drawn up rotas of qualified teachers within their respective areas, to locate or obtain qualified teachers in rushed circumstances. From what they have told me I am satisfied they have made every effort to do so.  On the other hand, I have had several meetings with the INTO who have emphasised in their joint meetings with boards of management and the Department, that they wish to have qualified teachers only employed.  Of course, that would be the wish of any education authority.  I put it to Deputy Mac Giolla that the precise number of days on which substitute teachers are required to meet that need are, on the Deputy's admission, very uncertain.  One never knows how often such disparities will occur.  For example, in the year 1988 the number of school days on which such substitute teachers were required was 18,000 approximately whereas, in the year 1989, the figure was 9,325 only, demonstrating an amazing disparity between those two consecutive years.  I should say that every effort is made by my Department to locate suitably qualified teachers in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As final evidence of what the Department are endeavouring to do in order to resolve this matter I should say that, at a recent meeting with the INTO &mdash; that is between their officials and myself &mdash; the <Col N="1914" /> matter of a panel system of qualified substitute teachers was raised, as it had been on an earlier occasion.  At that meeting, which took place within the past few months, my Department gave a commitment to ascertain how a pilot scheme for such a substitute panel teachers arrangement could be put in place.  Discussions are taking place between boards of management of schools, unions and ourselves on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that talks are in progress in regard to such a panel arrangement. Will the Minister say whether her meeting with the Primary School Managers' Association took place after their annual general meeting in May last when they passed a motion to the effect that no action had been taken by the Department to assist boards of management of schools in the procurement of trained substitute teachers.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the criteria governing the school transport scheme and there should, therefore, be no considerable difficulties experienced now as compared with previous years.</P>
      <P>The school transport scheme is a complex nationwide operation involving the daily transportation of some 165,000 pupils to and from school.  It operates under rules and procedure which are designed to ensure a fair and efficient service to all concerned.  Given the demands on the service, it is inevitable that local difficulties will arise from time to time and mechanisms are in place to deal with such situations.

      <P>Is the Minister aware <Col N="1919" /> that low cost schooling could be equated with low cost housing which proved a disastrous experiment a few years ago? Is he further aware that, because of cutbacks in the school transport system, rural school children have the longest working day and working week in the country?  Some of them leave home in the dark at 7.30 a.m. and do not get back in large tracts of rural Ireland until 5.30 p.m. when it is again dark.  Because the school bus stock, some of which is over 20 years old, is continually breaking down, school children, particularly in the Mayo region, are being left stranded on the side of the road, missing education and having to walk home.  Is the Minister aware of this major problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no cutback in the specification of school buildings as a result of the changes which have been made.  With regard to school transport there has been no major cutback in the level of service provided.  The same criteria exist now as over the past 16 years.  I can pick up any file over the past 16 years which will show that children left home very early and arrived home late in the evening.  We would all like to see a better level of service provided, but it would entail a massive amount of public expenditure which the Fine Gael Party Leader is committed to cutting back, in the same way as the Government are committed.  If we wanted to spend money <i>ad nauseam</i> we could pick up children at their doorstep half an hour before school.  We have to operate on a very tight budget and we are providing a good service in the light of budgetary constraints.  I totally reject that CIE are being negligent in the level of bus service they are providing.  If the Deputy has specific instances of buses which are continually breaking down I will be glad to bring the matter to the attention of CIE.</P>

      <P>In 1990-91, 12,769 trainees availed of vocational preparation and training, VPT-2, courses and the number is expected to increase to approximately 13,500 in the current year. VPT-2 is aimed at trainees who have either completed a senior cycle programme or a VPT-1 course but who need further training to enhance their prospects of gaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation by schools in the programme is subject to approval annually by my Department.  A range of vocational designations is available to choose from for which syllabus material is provided.  As the programme is designed to respond flexibly to local labour market needs, schools also have the option of developing their own programmes, subject to approval by my Department.  Delivery of the programme is monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department's inspectorate.  At present, <Col N="1921" /> each trainee who successfully completes the programme is awarded a certificate by my Department which is supplemented by locally based assessment-certification. However, there is a need for a national performance-based certification system to cater for vocational training courses at this level within the education sector.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I formally launched the National Council for Vocational Awards representative of concerned interests, which will address this issue.  The new council will develop and implement a comprehensive system of national certification. In order to ensure that training courses respond to regional, national and international needs, a regional structure will also be established to complement and reinforce the services provided by the national council.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the information contained in the Minister's reply.  I am sure she will agree that post leaving certificate courses are probably the best development in education in recent times.  I am glad the Minister is considering the question of certification. These courses are half way between second level and third level education and it is an area which has experienced growth in recent times.  Has the Minister taken into consideration the importance of these courses and the necessity of giving students certification on completing their post leaving certificate courses? When does the Minister expect this matter to be finalised?</P>

I hope they will put forward proposals to me as quickly as possible.  I gave them that brief and I look forward to their submission.</P>

Therefore, this would pose difficulties in relation to the matters the Deputy raised. Vocational Education Committee colleges and regional colleges have always operated a very minute quota for the purposes referred to by the Deputy. There are two schools of thought on this issue: does one discriminate for or against in such circumstances?  This matter is under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Private Notice Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I wish to repeat my categorical rejection of the suggestion made last Tuesday, 22 October 1991, in this House that I had meetings with the Chairman of Greencore at which I suggested that NCB and John S. O'Connor and Company Solicitors be appointed for the privatisation of Greencore.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that no such meeting ever took place and that I made no such suggestion at any time to Mr. Cahill or anybody else.</P>
      <P>This exchange with Deputy Spring took place in the middle of a series of supplementary questions being addressed to me by Deputy Joe Sherlock when Deputy Spring interrupted me and the subsequent remark should be read in the context of the cross-fire which ensued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not say as is now being suggested that I had no meetings with Mr. Bernard Cahill, Chairman of Greencore.  What I <Col N="1928" /> said was that no meeting of the kind suggested by Deputy Spring took place.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday in the Dáil when I said no meetings or no such meetings had taken place I was stating that the specific type of meeting alleged by Deputy Spring never took place; nothing else.  I invite the House to examine the record for Tuesday 22 October 1991.  The relevant exchanges are in two separate parts.  The first part reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Spring: May I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a grave inconsistency between his treatment of Mr. Smurfit in Telecom, Mr Paircéir in the Custom House Docks and the tolerance shown to Mr. Cahill and Mr. Desmond in their chairmanships at that time?  May I further put it to the Taoiseach that he had meetings with the chairman of Greencore at which he suggested that NCB stockbrokers and Mr. John S. O'Connor and Company, Solicitors, would be appointed for the privatisation of Greencore and that as a consequence of that meeting he is in no position to take any action in relation to Mr. Cahill's position?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: I reject that with contempt.  That is totally untrue and it does the Deputy no credit to make this sort of unfounded allegation.  I suggest to him on that score that he too await the outcome of the present investigations when he will find&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Spring: The Taoiseach had no meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Taoiseach: I had no meetings.  I suggest to him on that score that he too await the outcome of the present investigations when he will find that he will find that he will owe me an applogy.</P>
    <P>I believe it is clear from the totality of this passage that what I was rejecting with contempt was not the fact that I had a meeting or meetings with Mr. Cahill but the unfounded allegation that I had sought to influence the Chairman of the company in any way as to the choice of its advisers for privatisation.  This is fully <Col N="1929" /> confirmed by the latter part of the exchanges which went as follows:</P>
    <P>Taoiseach: I have no hesitation in giving the Deputy a categoric assurance that whatever meeting he has in mind &mdash; is it the one with the Chairman of Greencore?</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring: Yes.</P>
    <P>Taoiseach: No such meeting took place.</P>
    <P>That exchange clearly indicates that I was asserting that no meeting of the kind Deputy Spring had suggested, that is a meeting at which I made the type of proposal to the Chairman about advisers, ever happened.  &ldquo;No such meeting&rdquo; was the phrase I used.</P>
    <P>I would also like to observe that, despite what has been claimed, nothing that appeared in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> contradicts my statement to the Dáil.  The article in that paper did not allege that I made any proposal to Mr. Cahill about the appointment of advisers to the company.</P>
    <P>I did have meetings with Mr. Bernard Cahill, Chairman of Greencore.  One of them was held in May 1990, when Mr. Cahill came to my home on his own initiative for a general briefing on the company's plans for privatisation and the many benefits that would accrue to the State and the industry.</P>
    <P>At this meeting I put forward views on two issues only.  These were matters of concern to me and which I felt were in the public interest.  The first was my concern that the workers of the company and the beet growers supplying the company should be given special treatment in the allocation of shares in the new company. The second was my concern that a commitment made by the Irish Sugar Company to the people of Tuam to put up an investment of £2 million to support an industrial project in Tuam would be adhered to.</P>

      <P>I did not make any suggestion or recommendations about <Col N="1930" /> advisers or consultants selected by the company.</P>
      <P>At another meeting held in my office, which was also attended by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Labour, the question of trade union representation on the new board was discussed.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that, at the time I was being briefed by the Chairman, well in advance of privatisation, Mr. Comerford was briefing the leaders of Fine Gael and Labour, as part of the company's preparations for privatisation.  I would be interested to hear if the two parties confirm this.</P>
      <P>It was my duty as head of the Government to be fully informed about a matter of such major importance as the privatisation of one of our principal and more important semi-State commercial companies.  I reject any suggestion that I should not have had such meetings or that there was any impropriety in having them.  There was no secrecy about the meetings I had with the Chairman of Greencore.  I had no doubt at that time that the board of Irish Sugar were aware of them.</P>
      <P>I reject the suggestion made on RTE Radio this lunchtime by the Fine Gael Leader, Deputy Bruton, that there was any lack of liaison on the matter of the privatisation of the Sugar Company between myself and other members of the Government concerned, including the Minister for Finance.  The principal issues were discussed at Government on several occasions.  The criticism made by the representative of the Minister for Finance this morning at the EGM about lack of consultation by the board referred entirely to the transactions concerning Sugar Distributors Holdings, and had nothing whatever to do with the process of privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see all this as nothing more than part of the concentrated campaign of personal attacks on my integrity which has been carried on now over a considerable period.  Meetings that I held and actions that I took in the normal performance of my duties as Head of Government are now being retrospectively attacked as <Col N="1931" /> suspicious or improper without the slightest justification.</P>
    <P>The approach seems to be that as Taoiseach I should sit in my office in some kind of splendid isolation, meeting no one, hearing nothing, discussing nothing. In one newspaper this morning there is a headline: &ldquo;Haughey may admit meeting Cahill&rdquo;.  Things have now got to the stage where, apparently, the head of the Government must not even meet the Chairman of a State company.  As I said in the confidence debate, to suggest, as has now become the practice with a number of Deputies in this House, that there is something wrong with such contacts or something improper about them is completely irresponsible.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat now what I said to Deputy Spring on Tuesday, 22 October. The affairs of Irish Sugar are being thoroughly investigated by two inspectors appointed by the High Court.  I am confident that the report will show that I had no involvement of any kind in the affairs which have caused so much public disquiet.  I believe the House should await that report.</P>
    <P>Finally, Ceann Comhairle, I wish to state to you and through you to the House, that I have never misled this House and that I did not intend to do so on this occasion and that any fair and reasonable interpretation of the record will confirm that I did not do so.</P>

Do the same standards apply in regard to the Taoiseach as applied to Deputy Lenihan?

      <P>I reiterate firmly and categorically that I did not attempt, nor did I mislead this House with regard to meetings with the Chairman of Greencore. As I said, taking the record as a whole, it is quite clear that what I was rebutting to Deputy Spring was any suggestion that a meeting of the kind he was talking about took place.  I was saying that no meeting at which I had made an improper suggestion to the Chairman of Greencore ever took place.  If one reads the record fully and takes all the combination of answers into account, a fair minded person would not come to any other conclusion.  Also, it would be quite impossible for me to have attempted to suggest to this House that no meetings took place between me and Bernard Cahill the Chairman of Greencore.  The meetings I had were well known to a <Col N="1934" /> number of people.  The meeting in my house was certainly known to the Chairman of Greencore and, I believe, to the board and to many others.  The meeting I had with him in my office was attended by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Labour.  That was equally well known.  The outcome of the discussions I had with Bernard Cahill, Chairman of Greencore, in connection with the privatisation were conveyed to the appropriate Government Departments. It is absurd to suggest that I would have attempted here last Tuesday to say to Deputy Spring that I had no meetings with Bernard Cahill.</P>

Every Deputy who heard his reply went away from this House last week believing that no meetings took place between the Taoiseach and Mr. Cahill.  The Taoiseach is now attempting to explain this by speaking of the content of this meeting.  However, I put it to him that at the EGM of Greencore today Mr. Cahill indicated that, among other things discussed at that meeting on 22 October, NCB was discussed. Will the Taoiseach indicate how many such meetings took place between himself and Mr. Cahill, if on 22 October anyone else other than himself and Mr. Cahill was present, if the Minister for <Col N="1937" /> Finance was present or if any private individuals were present at that meeting or at any other private meetings which were held between himself and Mr. Cahill because again Mr. Cahill said at the EGM today that several such meetings took place?</P>

      <P>Can I ask the Taoiseach some questions in relation to the meeting that took place in his home?  I assume, his home being in Kinsealy, that Mr. Cahill flew by helicopter from Cork to attend.  Was that meeting arranged by an officer in the Taoiseach's Department? Second, has a record of that meeting been kept and will the Taoiseach produce that record?  Does the Taoiseach accept, as Mr. Cahill has said at the EGM today, that the question of the appointment of financial advisers was discussed at that meeting and can he explain to this House why the Minister for Finance, who has ultimate responsibility for these affairs, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, were either not invited or not wanted at that meeting?  Will the Taoiseach not now, in view of all these circumstances, make the apology I asked for at the outset?</P>

      <P>The meeting in my home took place.  There was only the chairman and myself present.  The meeting was at the request of the chairman who indicated to me that he wished to brief me fully on the proposed privatisation and the company's strategy in regard to it and to enlist my support as Head of the Government for the privatisation process.  I am also reminding the House that at that time my information is that while chairman Cahill was briefing me, Mr. Comerford was briefing the leaders of Fine Gael and Labour.</P>

I did not.  The only two matters that I put forward views on at that meeting were the question of the shareholdings and the question of the contribution to an industry in Tuam.

Will the Taoiseach indicate the date or the dates on which the various meetings he had with Mr. Cahill took place, specifically the date of the meeting at which the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Agriculture were present?  I ask this because on 21 June, more than three weeks after the meeting that the Taoiseach had with Mr. Cahill and at which he discussed the privatisation of Greencore, the Minister for Agriculture and Food in this House at Question Time stated that the options regarding the future of Greencore were still being discussed by the Government, and it was not until 25 October that a Government announcement was made that Greencore was to be privatised and it was not until December that the Bill was published regarding the privatisation of Greencore?</P>

      <P>The meeting between myself, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Labour took place.  I cannot give the exact date but it took place in my office before the legislation was introduced because we were discussing aspects of the legislation of vital importance.  The chairman of Irish Sugar, as it was then, was at that meeting and the results of that discussion were helpful in enabling the whole process of privatisation to go through.  I want to go back again to the meeting in my house. One of the main purposes of chairman's Cahill's approach to me was to secure my support as Head of the Government and specifically to suggest that, if at all possible, the legislation dealing with the privatisation should be brought in before the summer recess.  That is one of the reasons why he sought the meeting in May.  In the event that did not happen, but that is one of the reasons he approached me on that occasion.</P>

We feel aggrieved that there has not been Private Members' Business ordered for this week.  The Government had indicated to us that we would have the business of an ordinary week maintained on the basis that we would sit on Friday and it was with regret that we learned that the Government would not agree, therefore, to allow Private Members' Business to be ordered on Thursday instead of the other two days of Tuesday and Wednesday.

The debate should take place only when we have a clear statement in advance and not a series of statements on the floor of the House.

      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy.  I think that would be very foolish because, as the Deputy knows, the negotiations with regard to Maastricht are probably the most intense and confrontational that there have been for a long time.  I think it would be most unwise for the Government in the middle of these negotiations to declare their position on a whole variety of issues which are still in the melting pot.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, a debate on such matters &mdash; the Government's negotiating position would be reinforced by having the support of this House &mdash; would be the wisest course of action. Rather than weakening the Taoiseach's hand it would strengthen it in relation to the matters that concern him.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case, Sir, that every other Parliament in the European Community is having such a debate in advance of the Maastricht Summit?  Is it not the case that the only reason that the Government do not want to have a debate on their policy in preparation for <Col N="2070" /> those meetings is, quite simply, that the Government do not have a policy?</P>

      <P>The Deputy should permit me to finish.  I have promised a debate, so the Deputy's opening statement is incorrect.  I have promised this House a debate before the Maastricht Summit and it will be open to every Deputy to give his or her views.  What I am suggesting to Deputy Quinn, whom I think is reasonably responsible in these matters, is that it would be unwise for the Government at this stage when everything is still in the melting pot on a wide range of issues and when we still have to negotiate, to put forward any final definitive position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete line 20, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) damage caused by death or by personal injuries, or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that I do not see an amendment in the name of the Minister on this matter because the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, who took the Bill on Committee Stage, indicated that he would look favourably on this amendment. In a nutshell, the position is that the Minister in putting forward the Bill has altered the wording of the Directive which has come from the EC and has altered it seriously adversely against the <Col N="2079" /> interests of consumers.  Under the terms of the Directive, consumers were supposed to be able to get compensation arising from personal injuries or from death caused by a defective product.  For that reason I just cannot understand, and cannot imagine, why the Minister and the Government have altered the wording of the Directive.  They have altered it to the extent that rights given in the Directive are taken from the consumer by reason of the altered wording in the Bill.  That is totally inexplicable and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Article 9 of the Directive gives a definition of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo;.  The first thing I might say is that I do not think any definition of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; was necessary in the Bill because the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; is a well established notion in the laws of this country; judges have interpreted it down the years.  It is already very well defined in judicial decision. Any judge of any court will know immediately what may be the extent of damage an injured person can claim.  But if it is decided that it is necessary to include a definition of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, I just do not understand why the definition given in the Directive is not used because the definition given in Article 9 reads:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of Article 1, &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means:</P>
    <P>(a)  damage caused by death or by personal injuries;</P>
    <P>But the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in the definitions section of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;damage&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  death or personal injury, or&mdash;</P>
    <P>It excludes damage caused by personal injury.  What is the difference between the two is the question which may be posed.  Very substantial differences could arise.  For example, if a person was injured by a defective product, was out of work for, say, six months or a year as a result of that injury, quite clearly &mdash; under the terms of the Directive &mdash; that person should be compensated and be entitled to be compensated for the loss <Col N="2080" /> of their earnings because that would be damage caused by personal injury.  If one looks at the wording of the Directive clearly that would be included in that it says &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means damage caused by death or by personal injuries.  Just to take one category, loss of earnings is something the Directive envisages an injured person would be entitled to; that could be a very substantial amount of money for a person who received a serious injury.  But the definition inserted in the Bill restricts that completely and confines damage either to death or personal injury, that is to say, there the person would be compensated for the actual injury but not for its consequences, not for loss of earnings and not for consequential losses or damages.</P>
    <P>There have been many instances in this House of legislation having been introduced following on EC Directives.  When we in the House have endeavoured to secure improvements on that position, or even slight alterations thereto, the one identical response always forthcoming from the Government side, from the Minister concerned, from whatever Department may be involved is; that is the wording of the Directive; much as I would love to change it we are bound by the wording of the Directive; we must follow the wording of the Directive; that is the way it comes from the bosses of Brussels; we cannot change it, not to the right, not to the left.  Yet here we find a blatant, obvious classic example where, on a matter of importance so far as consumers are concerned, the wording of the Directive has been altered.</P>
    <P>If it were merely a matter of academic interest one might say all right, it is just a matter of verbiage, it is of no practical consequence, but that does not apply here.  Here it is a very different matter. Here it is a very real difference.  People will suffer and consumers lose as a result of this cutback on the rights the Directive intends to give consumers.  There was no explanation of this forthcoming on the last occasion we discussed this matter. Indeed, I cannot see how there can be any explanation.  Consumers are entitled <Col N="2081" /> to have the wording of the Directive followed; they are entitled to the rights conferred on them in the Directive.</P>
    <P>What is the point in giving this &ldquo;out&rdquo; on such an important matter to producers, for the most part large manufacturers, most of them not even operating within the country at all?  Why is the Minister extending himself to give unnecessary, uncalled-for protection to producers and manufacturers as against the interests of consumers?  Is the Minister anti-consumer?  One must pose that question.  Why has the Minister gone out of his way to take the very unusual step of varying the wording of a directive that could mean substantial losses to consumers when the only benefit that will accrue therefrom will be to the benefit of producers and manufacturers?</P>
    <P>One would not approve of it but could understand it if the taxpayers' position was involved, if it were something the taxpayer could not afford, would not be able to bear or whatever.  One would not sympathise with that position but one could understand it.  The only parties that will gain from this very strange variation in the wording of the directive are the large producers and manufacturers.  One must ask why.  I do not understand it for the life of me because I contend that consumers' interests should be paramount. The EC went to great lengths to provide the very limited protections given under the provisions of this Bill, and they are limited, as became all too apparent as we discussed this matter on Committee Stage, but even those limited provisions are being further cut by the Minister's alteration in the wording of the Directive.</P>
    <P>It cannot be accepted and the House should not accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate the Minister for Trade and Marketing, Deputy Leyden, promised Deputy Taylor he would give further consideration to this amendment and return to it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> Having consulted with the office of the Attorney General on the matter we have established that, although the wording of Article 9 (a) of the Directive, at first sight, seems to be an attractive reason for accepting this amendment, it is the result to be achieved under Article 9, rather than its exact drafting, which is mandatory on the State.  The correct way to translate Article 9 (a) into domestic Irish law is by means of the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in section 1 (1) of the Bill. This accords with the approach in the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in section 21 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961 which is the principal statute governing civil liability in this country, and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;damage&rdquo; includes loss of property, loss of life and personal injury.</P>
    <P>Taken in conjunction with section 2 (1) of the Bill which provides that&mdash;</P>
    <P>The producer shall be liable in damages in tort for damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in his product.</P>
    <P>that is sufficient to make applicable the domestic Irish rules concerning the assessment of damages, including pain and suffering, consequential loss, etc., subject only to the limits expressly imposed by the Directive which are reproduced in the Bill.  In fact, the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in the Bill would have this meaning even if section 2 (1) were not there, or were drafted differently.  At all events, section 2 (1) explicitly meets the point raised by Deputy Taylor in proposing his amendment.</P>
    <P>For the same reasons it is unnecessary to reproduce in the Bill the last sentence of Article 9 of the Directive.  Indeed, it would be positively undesirable to do so as the effect would be to emphasise one domestic Irish rule concerning the assessment and scope of damages to the exclusion of others which would be equally applicable, subject only to the limitations imposed by the Directive, thereby running the risk of causing confusion and uncertainty where none should exist.</P>
    <P>I hope that neither Deputy Taylor nor I will take the absolute position that because something is in the directive I <Col N="2083" /> must adhere 100 per cent to it or to the counter proposition he is putting forward. We have a Directive which has to fit into a European convention and into an Irish situation.  We are meeting the Deputy's considerations and the fears being expressed are therefore groundless.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is under a slight misapprehension. There is no question of adversely affecting the consumer.  The whole desire in this Bill is to enhance consumer protection.  We are trying to devise the best possible legislation and we are prepared to listen to solid views and put them in place to improve legislation if we can.  When the protective clauses in this Bill are combined with existing legislation, the position of the consumer is undoubtedly enhanced.  By no stretch of the imagination could there be an adverse effect on the consumer's position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the debate.  I supported this amendment on Committee Stage and I continue my support on Report Stage. Having regard to what the Minister of State has said in talking down the amendment, I must make some comment on the absence of the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden.  The amendment was specifically withdrawn by Deputy Taylor on the undertaking by Deputy Leyden to consult with the Attorney General and to look at the matter afresh.  I appreciate that this has been done, but with the change of Minister for the debate we are being asked to abandon entirely the position taken by Government in promoting this Bill on Committee Stage. That position was repeated again and again by the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, and it prompted me to withdraw a later amendment because there was agreement in the House that we would pursue the wording of the Directive and that alone.  The Minister of State indicated that his preference was as far as possible to uphold and transfer the wording of the Directive into the Bill.  I withdrew amendment No. 6 on Committee <Col N="2084" /> Stage on that understanding.  It related to fisheries and the Minister was firm in his view.</P>
      <P>I have tabled amendment No. 3 today and while it might seem at first glance to be pedantic, it argues that the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; should be deleted and the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; inserted.  I will clarify my position when we reach that amendment, but it is based on the way the Directive is worded.  The Committee Stage debate last week progressed on lines promoted by the Government but now the Minister of State seeks to abandon that line of approach and asks us to look not at the wording but at the objective of the article. I do not necessarily disagree but I am somewhat confused.  Has another man been put in to bat because there is a different line of thinking in the Attorney General's Office?</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister who took the Bill on Second Stage and Committee Stage is not here for Report Stage.  This is no reflection on the Minister who is here.  Two weeks ago at the Whips meeting we were advised that there was an urgency about this legislation, that the Committee Stage would be taken last Wednesday and the Report Stage today.  Deputy Leyden was consulted as late as last Thursday about Report Stage today.  There would not have been any difficulty in deferring Report Stage to another day to enable the same Minister to be here for all three Stages.  When the Government order business they should seek continuity not just in thought and argument but in terms of the personnel available.  I understand that things can happen at the eleventh hour which can make this difficult but it is a little annoying that having adopted certain positions in a good debate only a week ago we are being asked by different personnel to abandon those positions and go a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My argument in favour of this amendment is that we should stick with the Directive because that is the better approach.  If there is no doubt in the mind of the Government as to the construction of the legislation as it stands and if what Deputy Taylor is proposing does not <Col N="2085" /> advance the matter, why not err on the side of adopting what is in the Directive? It will not take away from the legislation and it will satisfy an opponent.  I have no doubt that Deputy Taylor will be able to express better than I some of the doubts and reservations.  Litigation is the art of making argument and there is no doubt that legal energies will be consumed following the passage of this legislation by people trying to draw inference and importance from the fact that there is a different definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in the Bill from that contained in the Directive and in 1961 Act.  Would it not have been better to achieve consistency between the Bill and the Directive and then argue that this is complementary to the 1961 Act? Deputy Taylor's proposal is eminently sensible and I am confused by the Government's point of view, despite the fact that it has been so ably put by the Minister of State, Deputy Smith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my colleagues have said on the need to analyse the section to which this amendment refers.  This issue was well analysed and discussed on Committee Stage by the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, who indicated he wanted the wording in the legislation to be as close as possible to the wording of the Directive.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, that he has not given one iota of new information on this subject to the House today and has not put forward any good reason he cannot accept the wording proposed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>The reason I support the wording proposed by Deputy Taylor in his amendment is that the need for consistency between the legislation of member states will become more obvious after the completion of the Single Market.  If the wording of this legislation is not consistent with the wording in the Directive put forward by the European Commission I can see considerable difficulties arising in the future in the interpretation of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not explained why we should change the wording in the Directive to meet the Irish situation.  Our legislation on civil liability goes back to 1961. The wording in that legislation and the wording proposed by the Minister in this legislation are somewhat in conflict&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has yet to <Col N="2087" /> convince me of that.  By accepting the wording proposed by Deputy Taylor in his amendment we would be safeguarding in a more pronounced way Irish consumers who wished to take a case under this Bill for damages arising from a defective product imported from another member state.  I am well aware that consumers have tremendous difficulties in gaining access to their rights in other jurisdictions in relation to such matters as taxation and insurance purely because of the different interpretations of tax law and insurance law in other jurisdictions. We are trying to harmonise the laws in these areas under EC Directives before 1992.  Now that we have an opportunity of complying with what other member states, with the exception of Luxembourg, have already agreed to, why can we not adopt wording which is as close as possible to the wording in the Directive so that there will be no prospect of inconsistency in subsequent decisions which might be made in this jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could accept the Minister's assurance that the objective of the Directive is being met in the wording of the Bill.  If I could in all sincerity and honesty accept that that has been done I would have no hesitation in withdrawing the amendment.  However, I am afraid that that is simply not the position.  I would ask the Members of the House and the Minister to look closely at this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 2 (1), a very good provision and if that was all there was in the section it would be all right.  If section 2 (1) stood alone it would be 100 per cent satisfactory in my book and I would be very happy with it.  Section 2 (1) states that: &ldquo;The producer shall be liable in damages in tort for damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in his product&rdquo;.  That wording is perfect but the trouble is that the Minister has not left the section at that.  The crucial word is &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, which does not have the normal meaning in law of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, because the Minister has <Col N="2088" /> chosen to interpret this word in section 1.  He has chosen not to give it its normal meaning but rather to give it a special meaning, a restricted meaning.  He has gone out of his way unnecessarily to do that.</P>
    <P>One does not read section 2 (1) on its own because when one comes to the key word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; one has to ask what damage is for the purposes of the Bill and the Minister has gone out of his way to define the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo;.  He has given it a restricted definition which is at variance with the wording in the Directive. It will be no good for lawyers, if they have time to absent themselves from all the inquiries and court cases which are going on at present, to go into a court and start talking about what may be the objective of the Directive.  The court will only be concerned about the wording of the Bill and will look at it closely.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that if I was a lawyer acting on behalf of a producer or manufacturer and some hapless plaintiff who had bought a seriously dangerous and defective product which had caused them a major injury, put them out of work for a year and caused all manner of consequential losses, come in to see me seeking damages for all of those things, I would say to a court &mdash; I think I would have a fair good chance of success &mdash;&ldquo;this plaintiff is claiming damage and the damage he is entitled to is laid down in the Liability for Defective Products Act and it is limited&rdquo;.  The court will only be able to allow him for damage which is referred to in the Bill and only two categories are permitted.  The first category is death or personal injury &mdash; if he breaks his leg he can get damage of, say, a few thousand pounds for pain and suffering &mdash; and the second category is damage to an item of property other than the defective product.  I will refer to that when we are dealing with my next amendment. Those are the only categories of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; that the person will be entitled to claim.  The normal use of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; is taken away from him.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had put in the Bill that the definition of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; would be the same as in the Civil Liability <Col N="2089" /> Act that would have been acceptable.  If the Minister had left it without restricting the definition of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; to what is contained in section 2 (1) that, too, would have been acceptable but he has put in the restricted definition.  Any court must say that this is a special new remedy in respect of damages and the Bill defines the categories.  One can claim for a broken leg and for damage to other property.  Loss of earnings is a consequential matter.  Loss of use of a destroyed article is a consequential matter and loss of the article is specifically excluded.  One can claim only for those two categories.  Why should that be so when the Directive does not intend that to be and when it defies all logic and commonsense?  Why should the consumer have those basic innate rights of compensation taken away from him in respect of a defective product?  If he is out of work for six months why should he not be entitled to compensation?  The matter seems clear; it seems to be an unanswerable argument in a court.</P>
    <P>Let us go further and say it is arguable. When we are at the stage of forming legislation why should we pass legislation that falls into the category of being arguable? Surely, this is the place to put it beyond yea or nay.  We should avoid the <Col N="2090" /> necessity of argument, such as those referred to by Deputy McCartan, of going to the High Court on cases stated or to the Supreme Court and so on.  Why is it that so many cases end up in the Supreme Court earning enormous sums of money for lawyers and so on?  Perhaps it is because we do not apply enough care in this House at the formative stage, perhaps it is because Ministers and Governments are not sufficiently responsive, sympathetic and understanding to non-political points made at the formative stage to try to avoid these things, take the matter out of the realm of argument and put it beyond yea or nay by a simple clarification of words.  That is all I ask.  It is not a matter of political contention unless one takes a consumer's point into account.  The point I am making is pro-consumer, it is to clarify the intent of the directive.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 26, to delete &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest this amendment for two reasons, first because the wording I am proposing is the wording in the Directive. I was prompted by what I believed at the time to be a totally solid commitment <Col N="2093" /> on the part of the Minister of State in Government to the notion that the wording of the Directive should be followed. Second, I believe there is a substantive difference between something that is primarily used and something that is mainly used for a particular purpose.  What we are attempting to address is the definition of damage in the Bill referring to the proviso of that definition: &ldquo;Provided that the item of property is (i) of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption, and (ii) was used by the injured person primarily for his own private use or consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Directive, in fact, says that the item was used by the injured person &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; for his own private use or consumption.  I believe there is a substantive difference between those two words in terms of defining what item would or would not be covered by the Directive and for that reason I believe that we should follow the wording of the Directive.  This is a simple proposition of substituting one word for the other.  I hope I am not too presumptuous in hoping that this amendment is acceptable to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not like to see Deputy McCartan down on his knees pleading with me like that, but I went to the trouble of looking up the dictionary for those words.  In one &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; is &ldquo;highest in rank, of importance&rdquo;.  In the same dictionary &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; is &ldquo;first in importance or extent&rdquo;.  Basically there are no real grounds for accepting the amendment, but in case there is a shred of doubt about my commitment to be cooperative and gracious, I am quite happy to agree to a word which means the same as that already there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is intended to make quite clear that consequential losses or damage sustained by an injured party are within the ambit of this Bill.  I think the Minister, in his remarks to my amendment No. 1, conceded that in his view they were.  I am not sure about that but I think he said that.  I would like to know if it is intended that consequential losses will be included and recoverable.  If so, why not agree to the amendment and thereby put the matter beyond yea or nay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remarks I made on amendment No. 1 would apply again here.  The definition of damage that is given in the Bill in section 1 is very specific and very restrictive.  It makes no reference to the definition of damage as in the Civil Liability Act.  It means that a court may not use the well defined meaning of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; or &ldquo;damages&rdquo; that has evolved over many years in law.  All I am saying in the amendment is that consequential losses and damages are to be included within the ambit of the Bill and that such losses are to be calculated in the same way as damages in tort cases are calculated in law much the same as is stated in section 2 (1) of the Bill.  It would tie in with that very well and make it clear that consequential losses, such as loss of <Col N="2095" /> earnings, loss of use of articles and so on, would be included.  That category of damage is always provided for in law when a tort is committed upon a person. To deny that category in a claim arising under this Bill would put claims under the Bill in a completely separate category to those applicable to any other category in tort.  I do not think that is something we would wish to happen.  Consequently I hope the Minister can accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Taylor will accept that the substance of this amendment has been provided for by the Attorney General's views regarding consequential damage as expressed in connection with amendment No. 1.  I would reiterate what I said in relation to that &mdash; that consequential damage is covered and included as a legitimate claim within the context of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the recent appointment of Mr. Whelehan to the Office of Attorney General.  I have not had the opportunity to do so in the House before.  I noticed him in the House earlier in the afternoon and while I have wished him well privately I think I should publicly do so here.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the advice emanating from his office in this regard.  The efforts being made by the amendment to address a certain amount of confusion that has now arisen &mdash; given that we have certainly two definite sources for the definition of damages in civil law, that contained in the Bill in the context of strict liability and that contained in the Civil Liability Act, 1961 &mdash; is a source of major worry.  Deputy Taylor made the point earlier on this matter &mdash; that it would have been preferable if the Bill did not carry any definition whatever of damage and merely left it to the established constructed law based upon the 1961 provision and the judicial interpretation built upon that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Bill has sought to give a particular definition, and it is a definition <Col N="2096" /> which in its construction does not include the concept of consequential loss.  Therefore, loss that would arise as a consequence of damage occurring does not appear to be contemplated by the way in which the Bill is drafted.  As has been pointed out, that does not appear to be the intention of the Directive.  The Directive is drafted differently and it is drafted differently specifically so that it does allow for a measure of consequential loss to be included.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the Office of the Attorney General has constructed a view based upon a combination of the definition of damage in section 1 together with the references to damage in section 2 (1) as giving a cumulative equivalent to the already existing definitions at law based on judicial construction of the 1961 provision.  All that is terribly uncertain in my mind.  It is very confusing.  Therefore while the preference would have been not to have any definition of damage whatever in the Bill, given that it is there, given that the Government have not accepted amendment No. 1 on Report Stage, what this amendment specifically proposes is a very important addition to clarification of what is intended by all and sundry.  The Government, the Attorney General I have no doubt, Deputy Taylor, Deputy Hogan and I want to ensure that people who have a remedy under the provisions of this legislation have a remedy to the same extent as they would have in general tortious law elsewhere, namely, for general damages, damages entailing suffering and for consequential loss.</P>
    <P>That unanimity being so, this amendment in no way takes from the view adopted by the Government and Opposition parties alike.  It gives an articulate representation and manifestation to what we all want which is to ensure that those who sue to achieve a remedy under this Bill will have a right, without ambiguity or doubt, to consequential loss.  That is what the amendment addresses.  It would inject certainty into the realm and reflects the universal view of the House.  The Minister should accept the amendment on the basis that we are doing good work <Col N="2097" /> on behalf of those who will ultimately benefit from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I am not permitted to speak a second time but on a point of clarification I wish to point out that the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; contained in the Civil Liability Act, 1961 includes loss of property, loss of life and personal injury. I have emphasised that on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify a point? The worry is to what extent, when one comes to deal with the remedy under the Bill, one will have to accept the definition specific to it and not the one contained in the 1961 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civil Liability Act states that the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; includes those things but the Bill does not, rather it states something very different.  It states that the definition of damage &ldquo;means&rdquo; these things.  That is a different matter and it produces a different consequence.  When the Civil Liability Act states that those items are included it does not exclude other items.  When one states however, that the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means these things one is confining it very strictly to what one has specified.  If one only specifies (a) and (b) then a person who brings a claim under this Bill will be confined strictly to those.  I do not believe that is what is intended by the Directive; I am quite certain of that.  I also believe, in fairness, that it is not what the Minister intends either but it seems that is what it is stating.  Very often things are not intended.  If the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means only the two items stated at (a) and (b) that is all that will be recoverable. That point will be argued.  Perhaps the matter will go to the Supreme Court but I do not think such course of action is warranted.  If I was to give advice on it it would be to look at the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; which means death or personal injury or damage to property other than the defective product itself.  If a person is to recover he will have to come within the ambit of those two categories.  If that is not what the Bill and the intepretation <Col N="2098" /> section mean I do not know what they mean.</P>
      <P>I can tell the Minister from personal experience that these matters are interpreted strictly by the courts; there is no broad sweep of the hands or statements such as &ldquo;on logic, it should include this, that or the other&rdquo;.  The courts do not work that way.  They look at the wording very carefully and say it is their job to give out money in damages strictly in accordance with the law which is laid out here &mdash;&ldquo;damage&rdquo; means personal injury, not the consequences of it or consequential losses.  A person will receive damages in respect of pain and suffering from a broken leg and that is it.  If property, other than the item itself, is damaged a person will also receive damages and that is it unless this amendment is agreed to.  I doubt if that is what the Minister intends.  I hope not but that is what it states.  Why leave the issue in doubt?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;where damage is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another example of an important variation the Minister has made to the wording of the Directive.  We are dealing with the definition of the word &ldquo;electricity&rdquo;.  The Minister has provided in the Bill that the definition of &ldquo;product&rdquo; includes electricity but only where damage is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity. The Directive has its own definition of the word &ldquo;product&rdquo; which is a simple one. It simply states &ldquo;product&rdquo; includes electricity in all its forms and facets so far as the generation and supply or any other facet or aspect are concerned, but the Minister has changed that.  He has not <Col N="2099" /> done what he was told to do in the Directive.  A Directive is something which directs him to do something and the Minister should do what he is told in these matters by the Directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the regrettable situation in which we find ourselves resulting from our membership of the European Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a cliff ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I campaigned against that when I argued that orders would be sent to us from Brussels.  Having accepted that position the Minister should do what he has been told to do.  He has been told what the definition is but he has not accepted that and has cut it back, varied and altered it.  Unfortunately, it is not a matter of academic interest either.  It could well be of serious importance and could lead to a very serious loss for those who are adversely affected by it.</P>
      <P>There is more to electricity than just the process of generation.  For example, there is the question of supply.  After it leaves the generating station it runs down the lines.  Quite clearly, a defect in the supply of electricity down the line would come within the ambit of the Directive because it states the definition of &ldquo;product&rdquo; includes electricity.  However, the Minister states that &ldquo;product&rdquo; includes electricity but only where the damage is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation.  That is not good enough.  Why should the Directive be cut back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a defect in the supply of electricity, not in the process of generation, for example a change in voltage as a result of something going wrong down the line, and this causes substantial damage to computers and sensitive scientific equipment, if the definition in the Directive is followed they will be covered but if the Minister's definition is adhered to they will not be covered.  The ESB <Col N="2100" /> will argue that this happened not in the process of generation but rather in the process of supply.  It leaves that defence open to them and to which they would not be entitled under the wording of the Directive.  Why, when there may be possible adverse effects to the consumer, should the Minister cut back on the definition of &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; as given in the Directive?  The Government have become so used to cutbacks in health, education and other areas that they have even reached the stage of cutting back on definitions in the Directive.  I strongly argue that when the Directive goes out of its way to give a definition which covers all aspects of electricity, generation and supply, in the fullest manner possible, why should we reduce it?  Are we legally in order in doing so?  If a person was adversely affected by the change in definition might he or she not go to the European Court in Luxembourg to make a complaint stating that we have not complied with the Directive and that the Minister is at fault?  It could involve considerable expense.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not say that such a contigency is very unlikely and improbable, unlikely and improbable things happen.  Perhaps in ten or 20 years this issue could become a very real one involving very large sums of money and injuries resulting from a change in the definition.  What is the purpose of the change?  The Minister's argument in relation to the previous amendment cannot apply in this case.  In that case he said he varied the Directive because his amendment improved it.  As I said, it cannot apply here because the definition is clear and simple and should be followed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no more succinct statement in the Directive than the three words already referred to by Deputy Taylor &mdash;&ldquo;product includes electricity&rdquo;.  There is no other qualification of electricity at that stage, it is quite succinct and clear that when we are dealing with liability for defective products the concept of product includes electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> The Government, in drafting the Bill, seemed to substantially depart from that very succinct three worded statement by suggesting that &ldquo;product&rdquo; shall include removables of all sorts apart from the exceptions we have already dealt with in the Bill.  When it comes to the concept of electricity, from the point of view of the Government and the Bill, electricity is referred to only where it is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity.  I do not understand why this very restricted view of electricity and its impact on consumer life has been adopted by the Government. Who made representations to the Government to adopt this much narrower approach?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we have heard enough about meetings for today. However, I am interested to know how this came about.  I worked on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities when we drafted the report on this very important Directive in 1987 and 1988 and there were no representations, good, bad or indifferent, to that committee or to the author of the report on this issue.  The report advises of the other interests and bodies in the Community who made very good and wide-ranging representations on issues arising in the Bill, such as the impact on the insurance industry, jobs, product liability, the farming community dealt with by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in Galway and the state of the art defence &mdash; about which we will be speaking later &mdash; from the Federated Union of Employers and other bodies.  There is no reference at any stage from anyone in the energy and power industry in this country &mdash; or indeed elsewhere &mdash; making representations that the Directive was too widespread and sweeping in its dealings with regard to the product of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, there are many more electricity producers apart from the ESB.  Private electricity producers supply <Col N="2102" /> the national grid and, indeed, many electricity producers supply directly for their own use and do not avail of the ESB. Who prevailed on the Government to alter the Directive in this way?  If it was the ESB I would be outraged because it would be very wrong of a conglomerate holding a near monopoly in the area of energy generation, with all their resources and the backing of Government, to be able to bring such a restricting proviso to bear on legislation and which would be against the interest of consumers.  That would involve someone with a great deal of muscle exercising far too much of it in the context of a debate such as this.  Our deliberations at the Oireachtas joint committee did not identify anyone making representations in this regard.  We were quite happy that the report we drafted did not raise any reservations about this proviso in the Bill.  I am legitimately asking where, and out of what concerns, was this qualification developed and devised.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister of State agreed to look at the matter for Report Stage as he was not in a position at that time to clearly indicate why this qualification to what was in the Directive was introduced.  Perhaps I overlooked asking him the reasons.  If my memory serves me correctly &mdash; and Deputy Taylor who will have the last word can perhaps help in this regard &mdash; on Committee Stage we were going for the wording of the Directive and the Minister was going to rethink very carefully because we had not adopted the wording in this regard.  That was, by and large, how we progressed on this matter on Committee Stage.  It really centred on the use of language.  However, as the Minister of State has not come back with a consistent position in regard to adopting the language of the Directive, I wish to probe a little deeper into why Government proposals in regard to this very substantial restriction on the Directive in this area were arrived at.</P>
    <P>A massive area of electricity deals with an area other than generation, I am speaking about transmission and consumption.  Generation is confined to the generator at source and will primarily <Col N="2103" /> deal with the issues of the worker, a visitor, a licensee or whatever.  It is a very restricted area and it can be argued that the interests of those involved will be very comprehensively covered under other legislation and laws dealing with a place of safety at work and work practices.  However, where electricity from the point of view of the consumer will be of primary concern is in the home where it is being consumed and applied for consumption purposes to all the various different electrical appliances which make the home liveable.  This Bill should be directed in towards the area of electricity &mdash; not with generation but with transmission through the community, particularly at the point of consumption, in the workplace or in the home.</P>
    <P>It would appear from a precise interpretation of what is in the Bill that it is not intended that the standards of strict liability will apply to the electricity generator at the point of consumption, that is, in the home or in the factory.  That is totally unacceptable.  It makes absolutely no sense in the overall context of what we are talking about in this Bill, unless there is some good reason that has not been made known to us and was not made known to the committee who dealt with the Directive in 1987.  Perhaps the Minister will be in a position to tell us why this extraordinary departure from the wording of the Directive should be entertained by us as legislators in this primary legislation dealing with strict liability in the area of electricity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor was extremely anxious that we would slavishly follow the wording of the Directive &mdash; even though on Committee Stage and again here this evening, he pointed out that there is no reason to do that &mdash; that we should make changes where we see fit.  Deputy McCartan is arguing for consistency.  It is important that we take into consideration the whole matter and not run away with the feeling that there is any agenda other than to have the best possible legislation.  Deputy McCartan is right in saying that the frame of this <Col N="2104" /> amendment was put forward on Committee Stage by Deputy Taylor and at that stage, the Minister, Deputy Leyden, indicated that he would, on Report Stage, elaborate further on the Directive.</P>
      <P>The intention of the Directive so far as electricity is concerned is indicated in a statement on the subject entered in the Council minutes on the occasion of the adoption of the Directive which states:</P>
      <P>The Council notes that the inclusion of electricity in the definition of products in Article 2 is intended solely to cover defects which are due to a failure in the process of production of this commodity and not defects which are due to external agents intervening after electricity has been put into the network.</P>
      <P>The intention of the Directive and, therefore, the Bill with regard to electricity is to cover surges in current but not power cuts.  Failure in the process of generation of electricity is intended to refer to defects such as surges in current which could occur during the production process.  When drafting the Bill it was felt that the wording of the Directive was not specific enough on this point and that account should be taken of the intention conveyed in the Council minutes.</P>
      <P>Because the wording is very simple in terms of the Directive &mdash; when we were drafting this Bill we had consultations with the EC Commission &mdash; the wording which is in this Bill is that proposed by the Commission.  There was no pressure from any source, domestic or otherwise, to make changes, as Deputy McCartan seemed to imply.  It was in response to the very specific nature of the minutes of that Council of Ministers meeting where the Directive was passed, and the final wording was in total agreement with the EC Commission.  In my view Deputies cannot have any basic fears as to what is specifically intended in the context of this provision.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response on this issue introduces a novel concept. This is something I have never heard before.  Many times I have heard it said that this is what is in or is not in the <Col N="2105" /> Directive and that line is followed but the Minister is now telling us that he is going not by what is in the Directive but by what is in the minutes of the Council which are not before the House.  That is a very strange proposition to put forward. I can only refer to the Long Title of the Bill:</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to enable effect to be given to the provisions of Directive No. 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of laws...</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone so far &mdash; something I welcomed on the last occasion &mdash; as to add as a Schedule to the Bill the full text of the Directive.  I do not think one can go behind the wording of the Directive and refer to the minutes of a meeting or what may or may not have been said under certain circumstances on a particular aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same principle applies in a court when one is interpreting a Statute.  I do not think the courts would allow you &mdash; Deputy McCartan will confirm this or correct me if I am wrong &mdash; to go back to the official Dáil Reports, and say a Minister or a Deputy said this or that. The court proceeds according to the Act and interprets it accordingly.  We have the Directive in black and white before us, included as a Schedule to the Bill.  We cannot go beyond that and start talking about minutes.  I have not seen the minutes, nor has Deputy McCartan or Deputy Flanagan.  Maybe somebody argued about this or made a point out of context but under the Treaty of Rome and its amendments, the minutes have no force.  Only one document has force and that is the Directive before us.  That is <Col N="2106" /> the only relevant document.  I do not think there is anything in the Treaty of Rome which says that in adopting Directives one has to have regard to the minutes of meetings or what a Minister said about these minutes.</P>
    <P>That is a very strange note to introduce.  Does that mean that, when we are adopting legislation in connection with a Directive from Brussels, as well as studying the Directive, which is difficult and complex enough, we also have to pore through the minutes to see what contributions were made by various members?  As well as including a Directive as a Schedule to a Bill, are we also going to include the voluminous minutes?</P>
    <P>Let us be serious, practical and sensible about this.  This is not on.  The idea of going back to the minutes or to what is subsequent to the Directive should not be entertained in the House.  The Directive is rightly put before us as a Schedule to the Bill, the Directive gives the broad definition of electricity.  If the Minister or whoever sends these Directives were minded to vary the Directive, no doubt there is a procedure for doing that and they should have amended it and dealt with it accordingly, but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>We have the Directive and the definition before us &mdash; product includes electricity &mdash; and that definition should have been followed.  It should not have been varied if it could have a possible adverse effect on the consumer.  That is not acceptable and in the circumstances I have to press the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 18, after &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including electricity generated by nuclear energy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The specific reason for the amendment is to qualify the definition of &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; in subsection (1) (b) by including &ldquo;electricity generated by nuclear energy&rdquo;. That is an area with which Deputy Smith will be familiar because in the previous Government for a brief period he was Minister for Energy.  He will be aware that the international conventions and agreements that cover nuclear energy are very limited in their scope in terms of providing individual remedies for people who suffer loss or damage through accidents caused by the generation, transmission or consumption of electricity created by installations in the nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for adding the qualification to the word &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; in the subsection is that Article 14 of the Directive states: &ldquo;This Directive shall not apply to injury or damage arising from nuclear accidents and covered by international conventions ratified by the member states&rdquo;.  That provision is geared primarily, I suppose, to draw in the EURATOM Treaty, which is the fundamental international convention regulating the European atomic energy facility and capacity.  For example, we know from countless replies to questions asked in the House of the present Minister for Energy &mdash; a somewhat similar tune has been heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Smith &mdash; of the inability of the Irish Government to invoke the provisions of the EURATOM Treaty or, indeed, of any international convention to challenge Britain in the international forum about Sellafield and injuries and damage being caused to the Irish community and environment by that nuclear facility.  Equally, if not all the more so, we know of the inadequacies of those <Col N="2110" /> conventions to deal with the personal rights of consumers.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to ensure that when an individual goes before the domestic courts here suing for loss and damage occasioned by an accident from electricity generated by nuclear facilities he or she will have the same full rights as any other person standing before the courts under the provisions of this Bill.  In other words, the amendment seeks to ensure that strict liability will apply because of the singular failure and inadequacies of the international conventions that deal with this area.  Those inadequacies have been identified and highlighted by the inability of the Irish Government to move in international fora in that regard.</P>
    <P>The amendment basically seeks to address that difficulty.  It may to some extent depart from the wording of the Directive that at least now we have established the principle that the Directive is not sacrosanct for today's debate, so I presume the Minister of State will not use that argument against me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also presume he will accept that what we are trying to do is enhance the rights of the consumer as opposed to in some way restricting and taking from them.  The provision is worth while and I hope the Minister of State will see his way to accept the spirit at least of what has been argued for here. It may be that I have not adequately drafted the amendment to highlight what I am attempting to deal with but I would welcome the assistance of the Minister of State in devising a better amendment to achieve the same ends, if that is what he would be inclined to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another amendment that was raised on Committee Stage, when the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, agreed to return to it on Report Stage.  I have again consulted the Office of the Attorney General in this matter and he is in agreement with the opinion expressed on Committee Stage, namely, <Col N="2111" /> that electricity is covered by the Bill no matter how it is generated.  In the view of the Attorney General this is absolutely clear from the Bill.  The proposed amendment would not create liability on the part of nuclear installations in the United Kingdom or anywhere else for nuclear accidents or leakages if such liability is excluded under the Directive.</P>
      <P>In his own way Deputy McCartan has been able to explain to the House how he felt there were perhaps inadequacies in the manner in which he was approaching this problem.  It is no harm to raise the matter.  It is fair to say that the international arena as far as dealing with the matters to which he referred in the context of this Bill &mdash; which undoubtedly cannot be dealt with within the context of this Bill &mdash; are ones which warrant attention and should be dealt with in another forum.</P>

      <P>If the Minister can assure me that electricity, generated by whatever method, including nuclear energy, will be covered by the provisions of the Bill I am happy that at least I have addressed the issue and that Article 14 of the Directive cannot be applied in the context of electricity generation as an excuse or waiver.  Therefore, I am disposed to withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 23, to delete &ldquo;£350&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£50&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment involves an important issue of principle.  I had been proposing on Committee Stage that there should be none, or no sizeable, threshold included in the provisions of this Bill under which a litigant would not be entitled to recover damages.  Section 3 proposes that there be a threshold of £350.  In other words, where loss or damage accrues from a defective product a consumer would have to lose more than £350 worth of damage before being entitled to recover such <Col N="2112" /> cost.  Of course, any damage in excess of £350 would be subject to the deduction of that minimum amount of £350.  That provision would militate most of all against those who should benefit most from this type of consumer protection Bill.  I am thinking of persons who could least afford to suffer loss in the first instance, namely, those who live very close to, if not below, the poverty line, almost one-third of our population.  Such people in particular would be penalised and disadvantaged by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Other Members have expressed the view that there should be no threshold at all included.  Because of the framework within which Article 14 of the Directive is drafted I was inclined to the view that we should at least adhere to that framework but fix our figure based on the economic circumstances prevailing here, those pertaining to our society rather than be bound by a European-wide figure that might be more relevant to the more advanced, industrialised areas of the central European plain but which would entail real hardship for many litigants before our courts, thereby entailing hardship for those who can least afford to suffer loss, those least able to withstand any loss arising from a defective product in any financial sense.</P>
    <P>The answer given by the Minister of State in the course of our Committee Stage deliberations was that the Directive stipulated £350.  Even though there is provision for the Minister, subsequent to the passage of the Bill, to alter the threshold figure, the Minister of State clearly indicated that any such alteration would not be effected downward.  Therefore, within a given period of time &mdash; be that weeks, months or years &mdash; if it became apparent to this Government that the provisions of this Bill were having the effect I predict &mdash; namely, visiting a very serious disadvantage and penalty on the majority of our people who are less well off rather than better off &mdash; they would not intend to invoke unqualified power under its provisions to reduce the threshold figure downward, rather that the minimum figure of £350 <Col N="2113" /> would remain and, furthermore, if any change took place, it would be in an upward direction.  That was a remarkable statement on the part of the Minister of State in the first instance &mdash; that the Government would never contemplate rendering the provisions of this Bill more workable, accessible, available to the less well off within our community.  Indeed its provisions will be totally irrelevant to the greater portion of our population who might have hoped justifiably to have benefited from the strict liability standards included.</P>
    <P>Let us remember for a moment what we are endeavouring to do by way of the provisions of this Bill, which is to divorce consumers from the onerous task of proving negligence or breach of contract, into a strict liability position so that, whenever they suffered loss, they would have a direct, unanswerable right of action against a given producer or, in certain circumstances, distributor or retailer.  The provisions of this Bill were designed to afford consumers a quick effective remedy, without debate, exemption or saving clauses, without waivers, without arguments about negligence under the terms of contract and so on.  It was to be a consumers' charter and a major advance in that respect.</P>
    <P>Having accepted the spirit and preamble to the Directive, it appears we are now going to say that, while travelling in that direction, by the way, we are also introducing a proviso which will render this Bill virtually irrelevant to the majority of our consumers because of that £350 threshold.  There was then the remarkable statement made by the Minister of State in the House last Wednesday that, if ever the provision with regard to the threshold were to be amended, it would be to exclude more people from having recourse to a remedy.</P>
    <P>From my experience as a practitioner in law, £350 is in or about the standard amount one might expect to recoup by way of reasonable damage to, say, household items resulting from a defect, such as carpets having been destroyed, clothes, items of food and so on, whatever corrective action needed to be taken.  In <Col N="2114" /> the modest demesnes within which poor people are forced to live in our community, a figure of £350 would represent a sizeable if not the total of what they might well be seeking by way of damages. Yet we are saying to such people: Sorry, strict liability is not available to you; you have to go into court &mdash; courts which at present are cumbersome and expensive &mdash; in order to argue your case.  Therefore we are saying to such people continue as you have been doing; you will have no right to the standard of strict liability.</P>
    <P>Because there is authority given the Minister under section 3 (2) to alter that threshold figure, I see no reason, good bad or indifferent that, in its drafting in the first instance, we cannot depart from the Directive and insert the threshold figure we believe to be correct.  What we legislators can do today is what the Minister can do the day after its enactment.  If the Minister can do it, then I see no reason we legislators cannot do it now and fix a figure that will render the provisions of this Bill accessible to the majority of our consumers and render them somewhat more meaningful in their operations once effected.  I urge the Minister to accept this proposal.  To do otherwise is to be unnecessarily restrictive of the Directive and to render the legislation disappointingly ineffective for the vast majority of people who would otherwise see it as a good day's work on our part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague stated last week on Committee Stage that this amendment conflicted with the provisions of Article 9 of the Directive which sets a lower threshold of £350 in respect of damage to or destruction of property arising from a defect in a product.  The figure applies not to damage done to the defective product itself, which is clearly covered by contract law, but to damage to other property caused by some malfunction in a defective product.  For example, if an electric kettle or other appliance bursts into flame due to some defect in that appliance, then any damage caused to, say, kitchen furniture or fittings in excess of £350 would be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> It is clear from the contribution by Deputy McCartan that he is setting out to ensure that people who purchase a product which proves to be defective have adequate access to compensation. However, he is not clearly distinguishing between the defective product itself and the damage to property arising from the use of the defective product.  This section is very specific.  As far as I can ascertain, within the constraints of the general regulations laid down for the implementation of the Directive, it leaves absolutely no room for manoeuvre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is subsection (2) all about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new Directive which will constitute new European law. It is focused in a particular area and I do not think it would be possible to meet the kind of considerations outlined by Deputy McCartan within the context of this Bill.  Where there is a defective product, normal recourse to existing legislation will enable the offended party to gain compensation.  If we were to include figures of the order the Deputy has outlined, perhaps the main thrust of what we want to achieve in this legislation could not develop.  I have tried to ascertain the position as far as I can in the context of our obligations under the Directive and I am absolutely assured that we have no discretion with regard to changing this provision.  I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed to hear the Minister reiterate what his colleague said last week, i.e., that he is not in a position to vary the order.  He has given himself power to do so in subsection (2). There are cases where access to justice is very limited.  For that reason the Government have decided to establish a small claims court.  This court is to be introduced early in 1992.  Access to justice in respect of small claims will be much cheaper.  The Minister could usefully include this legislation as qualifying for <Col N="2116" /> inclusion under the small courts procedure. Obviously consumers will suffer damage to their property caused by defective products to a lesser extent than £350 but many people will not be able to afford any such loss.  People living in poverty must seek redress in whatever way they can for damage done to their property by a defective product.  It would cost them very little to go to a small claims court to seek compensation.  The excess of £350 will mean that there will be no frivolous claims before the courts. However, this will mitigate against the consumer seeking a smaller award in respect of damages caused.  It works very much like an excess clause in an insurance policy which stipulates that the first portion of a claim is automatically absorbed by the policy holder.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the argument that the defective product should not be part of the claim.  I do not see why the consumer should be at the loss of the defective product, apart from the damage caused by that product.  The consumer is now to be at the loss of the defective product and of any damage where the total cost is less than £350.  These consumers are entitled to compensation in the same way as people who can afford to buy a replacement for a defective product and bear a loss up to £350 while being able to claim for any damage in excess of that figure.  Deputy McCartan's case is very reasonable.  Frivolous claims would be eliminated by having an excess of £50. The small claims procedure would allow the consumer to go into court in an inexpensive way to seek compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this amendment had to be put down, only to be rejected by the Minister, highlights the <Col N="2117" /> fact that this Bill is very far from the consumers' charter that it is cracked up to be.  It is so hedged around by restrictions, exceptions and exclusions it is not really going to be of very great benefit to the bulk of people who would wish to use it and who might think, from reading about it, that it is going to cover the case of a person who buys a consumer item such as a fridge or television set which goes wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or consequential damage.  The main category of claims arise in respect of the product.  I do not want the Minister to tell me that if one is in a contract relationship one can claim against the shopkeeper from whom one bought the product.  I know that.  If one is in a contract relationship one can throw this Bill out the window; one would be better off without it.  In a contract relationship one does not have to worry about this nonsense of not claiming for the article itself, consequential damages being more than £350 or any injuries, because one is entitled to fully claim for all in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If a constituent of mine or of the Minister buys an item which is defective they should get recompense for all the damage it does.  I am sure that is what the Minister would advise his constituents to do at his clinics.  They would be entitled to recompense in law. There is no problem when they are in a contractual relationship with the shopkeeper who supplied the article and when that shopkeeper is still around to be made amenable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is supposed to deal with situations where a person buys a fridge, television or some other article which <Col N="2118" /> goes very wrong and the person they bought it from, as happens regrettably all too often, is no longer there, has gone into liquidation or not available.  In such cases the person who is injured and suffered loss is thrown very much back on the Bill.  Unfortunately, when they come to look at it, they will find to their sorrow that it is not going to do them very much good because the first claim they make is for damage to the article.  I am sorry the Minister's colleague, Deputy Michael Barrett, is not present because earlier he highlighted the case of a person who had bought a dangerous and defective pram. He was very anxious that that person should be covered.  I wish he was present so that I could tell him he can forget it because the article is not covered. Damage to property which may be less than £350, which is the overwhelming bulk of cases, is also not covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>I want the cowboys to be responsible if they cause damage to property even if it is £300.  I do not want them to be able to say: &ldquo;I am clear because only £300 in damages was caused&rdquo;.  I want the cowboys to have to pay the £300 because that is a great amount of money to some people and a big addition to their household burdens. It will be no consolation to people who are at a loss because of these cowboys to say the damage caused was only £300 but if the damage caused was £400 they would be in business.  However, they would not get £400, they would only get £50 because of the threshold limitation we are putting in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the view &mdash; I said this on Committee Stage &mdash; that there should be no threshold.  I disagree with Deputy McCartan's amendment in that respect. He proposes reducing the threshold to £50 but I do not think there should be any threshold.  If we are bringing in a new principle and a new concept of strict <Col N="2119" /> liability, let us do the job properly or not. Why bring in this new concept and make out that it is a big new deal for consumers, that there will be strict liability for the cowboys who send out defective products into the community and say they will have to pay up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but when.  First, they will be liable only for amounts in excess of £350 and, second, they will not be responsible for the actual damage to the product.  That is the strangest provision I have ever heard.  As Deputy Hogan rightly said, it is the most ridiculous provision in a measure of this type.  It is obvious to people that the first thing a person who is sold a defective item ought to be put right on is the replacement of the defective item.  That is the one thing being excluded from the Bill.  The Bill has no rhyme, reason or sense to it.  That should be the number one item to be reinstated.  The Minister is shaking his head.  I know that if a person has a contract he or she will get recompense but the Bill does not address this issue; it addresses the situation where the person who sold the item is in liquidation or where a person cannot get recompense and has to go higher up the line to get it.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked when we are going to cop on and deal with the cowboys. That is a very good and correct question. I say the time to do this is now.  We could make a major contribution to this by accepting Deputy McCartan's amendment. Deputy McCartan is trying in his amendment to remedy to some extent a very serious exploitation by cowboys which the Minister is permitting in this section.  That will mean they will not be responsible unless the damage caused to property amounts to more than £350.  In other words, if a person suffers damage of £100, which is a great deal of money to some people, they will get nothing and if the damage caused amounts to £400 they will get £50.  If that is not a get out for the cowboys I do not know what is.</P>

      <P>The Minister is harping back, when it is convenient to his position, to the Directive.  He says he is tied by the Directive, but I want to remind him of his remarks at the beginning of this debate earlier today when he said that none of us should be too hidebound by the Directive; those who say we must <Col N="2121" /> follow its words exactly or those who say we need not follow its words exactly.  This is a case in point.  We should be sensible in making this law and say, &ldquo;this is an admirable concept, the idea that a person who sells a defective item which causes damage, self-destructs or damages other property, has to pay for it whether it is more than £350 or less than £350, otherwise, the Act will not be in application at all&rdquo;.  The first pre-requisite of the Bill is that the item has to be defective, so why protect them and say they can cause damage to property provided it is less than £350?  We are giving them a free run up to £350.  That makes no sense in law, is not commonsense and makes no logic.  People out there would not understand what the Minister is about in doing that.  We can remedy the situation for the most part, although not completely, by accepting Deputy McCartan's amendment, which I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed and even more confused with the Minister's response and more confused yet again with the interjections he has made across the Chamber to Deputy Hogan and to Deputy Taylor suggesting that from the position we argue we have the wrong approach.  Let us look at the legislation for a moment and see who is being protected and who has the right and the wrong approach.  On the one hand, is the cowboy &mdash; the person who peddles the defective product &mdash; and on the other the consumer.  Under the provisions of this Bill there is doubt in the minds of the Opposition that the issue of consequential loss may not be adequately covered.  The defective product is excluded.  If it is defective you cannot get compensation for it on strict liability terms from the cowboy.  For other items of property which are damaged you can only obtain compensation if they are items which are used ordinarily in the private use of the individual.  Nothing used in the area of work or employment or of public use is covered by the Bill. Primary agricultural products, fisheries, and game are excluded from the Bill.  All items of development, of industry and <Col N="2122" /> research that can claim they were using the &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; defence &mdash; the best available knowledge to them at the time &mdash; are entirely excluded from the workings of the Bill.  Only the generation of electricity is covered but not its transmission or consumption.  Now we have a proviso that says that if the extent of the damage caused by the defective product is under £350 you get nothing and anything over £350 will be deducted, the first £350 in the first place.  That is what is contained in the Bill so far as the cowboy is concerned.  He will be happy that this Bill is not what it is presented to be.</P>
      <P>We started out with the basic Directive that said it is useful in the European context of consumers' rights to introduce strict liability as a test when one comes to establish the rights of the consumer <i>vis-à-vis</i> the producer.  All of these qualifications, modifications and detractions forming the principle I have outlined have been introduced: some because the Directive says so, more because the Government have added to the definitions &mdash; some in the most remarkable circumstances, one relying on a minute of a meeting of the Council of Ministers not embodied in any Directive and others where there is a proviso available to derogate and we have opted not to derogate. It is not because the Government's hands are tied in all instances by the Directive. The Minister says that by arguing to lower the Directive we have got the wrong approach.  I believe the Government have got the wrong approach and I am totally at a loss &mdash; Deputy Taylor has argued this point far better than I could and there is no point in my repeating it &mdash; to understand the Minister's point of view.  Later, when we come to debate similar type amendments, perhaps the Minister would suggest to us how we are wrong and the Government right in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggests the amendment is in conflict with Article 9.  Article 9 sets down the figure of 500 ECU, which is equivalent to £350 in our money terms. If we are absolutely bound by the proviso of £350 why do we have in subsection (2) a provision that enables the Minister and <Col N="2123" /> gives him the power to alter that figure when there is no provision in the Directive, explicitly dealing with the figure, to alter it.  There is talk about reviews at five and ten year intervals under different Articles.  We were told by the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, on 23 October 1991 that there have been no reviews on the workings of this Directive at any level so far because it has not been in operation on a sufficiently wide basis within the Community.  Therefore, I query why there is a proviso in the Bill allowing the Minister the day after the legislation is passed to alter the figure if we are so inextricably bound to the Directive and what is contained in the Articles.  I am completely at a loss and totally confused.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested to Deputy Hogan that if this threshold applied to the product itself he would have doubts about it, but he could see the logic of the argument we were making.  I do not understand what is the difference between the product itself on the one hand and the loss to the consumer from the defective product in the home or wherever it is used.  What is the difference?</P>

We had an in-depth discussion with his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, here last Wednesday about the statistical basis on which the Government were proceeding with some of the provisions in the legislation, one of which was their failure to employ the derogation with regard to primary agricultural products.  The Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, said last Wednesday that that would increase the cost to the farmer substantially on the insurance level. When we asked that he give us statistics he said he had none and was not in a position to quantify.  He said they are just not available.  I am glad the Minister of <Col N="2124" /> State, Deputy Smith, has suggested that in this area I should be reading statistics. Tell me where they are, I will read them.</P>

      <P>If one approaches it from the point of view of the consumer I cannot see why a threshold is any different in terms of loss when you are dealing with a product itself and when you are dealing with consequential loss.  In short, if the consumer is to be compensated, he is best compensated in full.  The introduction of a threshold is a penalty on <Col N="2125" /> the consumer.  There is no other way of looking at it.  It is more than a penalty when it comes to dealing with the vast majority of very poor people in this community who can least afford loss consequential on a defective product.  I do not need to be reminded that we are not talking about the defective product itself in the context of the Bill.  I am talking about people affected, because the washing machine is defective, the floor floods, and the floor covering has to be replaced; or, in the case of a defective heater or a kettle, the wallpaper or the worktop has to be replaced.  For working class people, for poor people, who can least afford thresholds, £350 could be the making or breaking of their opportunity to put right what was done wrong by reason of a defective product and for them the threshold is a very real penalty.  The figure of £350 by and large will render this legislation inoperable and unusable.  This approach must be added to the other litany of outs, of reservations and qualifications to what was in the first instance, a very good principle.</P>
      <P>This side of the House argues very consistently a much better approach to the protection of the consumer than do the Government and I urge the Minister at this late stage to recognise that what we are doing is equitable and fair and that the Government should make up their own mind on this and in the spirit of subsection (2) recognise that they have the power to deviate from the Directive in this regard and say that they intend to do so in the best interests of the majority of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 15 to 18.</P>
      <P>In discussing this amendment I can say that my reason for not calling for a vote on amendment No. 8 is that amendment No. 9 is the single most important provision which we will debate in the context of this legislation at this stage.</P>
      <P>Having dealt with the issue of primary agricultural products and the failure of the Government to deal with this, amendment No. 9 is one of the most important, central issues in the legislation. The amendment proposes the deletion of paragraph (e) of section 6 which establishes a number of defences available to the producer, indicating that the producer will not be liable in strict liability terms for damages to the consumer in certain circumstances.  Paragraph (e) outlines the circumstance:</P>
      <P>that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is what is known as the &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; defence.  Where a product is defective and causes damage or loss to the consumer a producer can argue in court that the circumstances were such that the state of the scientific knowledge and information available to the industry generally and to the producer at the time was such that the subsequent defect that <Col N="2127" /> caused damage would not have been known at that point of the process.  It is argued that this is the licence for the inventor and that if this defence was not available the area of exploratory invention would be eliminated and that we would not get producers to come forward prepared to take a chance.  It is argued that it would be penal in the area of research into drugs and other such items if this defence were not available to producers. In some of the papers I have read with regard to this legislation the argument has been made that if this type of defence had been available to the producers of, for instance, the thalidomide drug, there would not have been cause of action available to the victims of that horrendous drug.  There are perhaps other legal remedies but in the context of this legislation if one were to establish and maintain this type of defence in the area of pharmaceuticals the manufacturers of thalidomide could have said that when they produced the drug they did so on the basis of the best scientific and technical knowledge available at the time and that they could not have anticipated the horrific consequences that emerged when the drug was put into circulation.</P>
    <P>This is a very live issue, particularly here where we are seeking to develop a strong industrial base based on scientific research and on the drugs industry. It behoves us to scrutinise what exactly we are being asked to do having regard to the establishment of this defence.  The legislation seeks to establish strict liability on the part of the consumer for loss consequent upon a defective product. This defence is basically saying to the consumer that he must take a chance with all new concepts, new products and new ideas coming on to the market.  It is saying that the producer, the manufacturer and in some instances, the distributor and retailer are entitled to take a chance on the basis of the best available information. They can always rely on that in court action should things go wrong. From the consumer point of view, which <Col N="2128" /> I am arguing, the concept is unacceptable and has horrendous implications.</P>
    <P>The Directive is not binding in this regard.  It provides the opportunity for Government to derogate and to say that we will not make this defence available in our domestic law and that we will establish the right of all consumers to pursue damage, loss or injury as a result of a defective product.  In doing that our Government will be doing no more than did other EC countries.  We will not be unique, we will not be the odd ones out. Other countries have signalled their intention to seek a derogation.  The Minister has indicated that one country has sought a derogation and that makes my case.  From preparing the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee I know other countries were intending to seek a derogation and I would like to know why they have not.  Because of the peculiar nature of the industrial base we are trying to develop in the area of pharmaceuticals and because we are seeking to build an industrial base dependent on research and development, it is important that we seek to establish the highest standards possible.  I believe that the employment of the derogation in this area will work to that end.  It is similar to the argument in the context of primary agricultural products.  We should not have exempted them from the provisions of the legislation because again it would be a signal to the wider community that we have nothing to hide, that we do exert and expect the highest standards and, most important in the context of this legislation, that we stand four square behind the consumer and seek the ultimate and best protection for them.</P>
    <P>I propose that we delete that paragraph from the Bill and mandate the Government in this House tonight to seek a derogation from the Article in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also concerned at the inclusion of this clause.  The Minister should consider deleting section 6 (e) of the Bill which makes it a defence for the manufacturer or other producer as defined in the Bill to prove:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> (e) that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered.</P>
    <P>Allowing this defence to manufacturers or other producers runs against the whole purpose of this Bill.  The major beneficiaries of such a defence will be big chemical and pharmaceutical companies. Where these companies are sued for injuries caused by defects in their products, it will be almost impossible for the injured consumer to defeat this defence in most cases; no doubt these companies &mdash; many of them huge multi-national corporations &mdash; will back each other up and swear blind in the words of section 6 (e)</P>
    <P>that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered.</P>
    <P>If other manufacturers have to compensate the injured consumer of a defective product for injury caused by that product, there is no justice in saving large drug companies from their mistakes &mdash; particularly when these drug companies are better able to afford to compensate the injured consumer than, for example, the bakery which turns out contaminated bread.  If, for example, we were to witness another Thalidomide disaster &mdash; and I pray God that we will not, but no one can say that we will not &mdash; it would be a disgrace if the grievously injured children were unable to sue under this Bill because of section 6 (e).  I, for one, would not like to have to explain to the parents of such children why they have no remedy under this legislation because of section 6 (e).</P>
    <P>Article 15 (1) (b) of the Directive expressly provides that each member state may:</P>
    <P>subject to the procedure set out in paragraph 2 of this Article, provide in this legislation that the producer shall be liable even if he proves that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product <Col N="2130" /> into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of a defect to be discovered.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is nothing to prevent the Minister from withdrawing the existing section 6 (e) of the Bill and inserting a new section providing that the manufacturer or other producer shall be liable &ldquo;even if he proves that the state of scientfic and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of a defect to be discovered&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very important section and there is genuine concern that the ordinary person will not be in a position to take on the companies concerned in this event.  This is a major flaw in this welcome, long overdue legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment and subsection go to the root of the Bill.  I had an identical amendment down on Committee Stage.  I thought I had reentered it for Report Stage but it seems to have got lost along the way.  That is no matter.  The important thing is that the amendment is before the House.</P>
      <P>The question arises of what we are doing in a Bill of this nature by allowing this defence to be there.  It has no place in a Bill of this character.  As has been said, in respect of this important matter the Minister cannot say that he is bound by the terms of the Directive and that while he might sympathise he has no choice in the matter.  He is specifically given the power of derogation in respect of this item in Article 15.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy McCartan is quite right when he said that he would have to go back and seek a derogation.  I think the derogation is written into the Article itself.  It is intrinsic and there is nothing to stop the Minister availing of it this minute by agreeing to this amendment if he was of a mind to do it.  The specific provision is made for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To allow this defence is completely alien to the basic thrust of this Bill.  What is the basic thrust of this Bill?  It is to provide for strict liability on producers or manufacturers who send out for public use a defective product, irrespective of <Col N="2131" /> whether they were negligent or not.  That is the essence of the Bill.  If the Bill is not doing that, it is not doing anything.</P>
    <P>Even if there were no defective products Bill passed into law at all, what is the legal position so far as defective products are concerned?  The first point is that a person who bought a defective item from a vendor will have a contractual claim against him.  That is existing law.  Where a producer or a manufacturer produced and sent out a defective product, and it can be proved that they were negligent in so doing, again under existing law there is no problem and a person who can prove that negligence will have a claim.  We do not need the Bill or this new Act to cover a situation either where there is a contractual relationship or where negligence is provable up along the line. The Bill adds nothing to those situations because they are already well covered under existing law.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>The one type of new circumstance which is not covered and which the Bill, in its broad approach, quite rightly seeks to address is one in which there is no contractual relationship and where there is no negligence or negligence cannot be proved.  That is the category for which the Bill caters.  If that aspect of the Bill is taken away, there is nothing left because everything else is covered under existing law and is not worth introducing or taking up the time of the House on.  That is why the Directive includes a right of the Minister to allow the derogation.  Yet the Minister refuses to take up the option which is given to him in the Directive.  Why does the Minister refuse to take up the option he is given in the Directive to allow this derogation in ease of the consumer?  Who benefits, and who pays as a result of the Minister's approach on the issue?  First, there would be no charge on the taxpayer. The losers would be the manufacturers and producers who sent out the defective products, while the gainers would be the persons who suffered as a <Col N="2132" /> result of consuming or using a defective product.</P>
    <P>There is a choice to be made: who is to lose and who is to gain.  The Directive intends that it should be the consumer who should gain and we should be on the consumer's side.  I suppose it could be argued that, if a producer manufactures and prepares a product which turns out to be defective through no fault of his and somebody sustains a serious injury as a result of eating or using it, it would be hard on the producer or manufacturer if they had to pay damages to compensate the person who sustained the injury when he was not negligent.  I take that point but we have to look at it this way: a serious injury was done and damage caused by, let us say, a pharmaceutical product &mdash; not just Thalidomide, there are others and a case is pending with regard to the drug Attivan. I believe that there will be others with regard to drugs which were defective and which destroyed people's lives, to put it in a nutshell.</P>
    <P>The question which then has to be determined is whether that person should get compensation from the manufacturer who produced what turned out to be a defective product even though he was not negligent in producing it.  One party or the other would have to suffer for the damage done.  Either the person who took the pharmaceutical product and destroyed themselves in their innocence would have to carry that and all that it involves or the manufacturer and producer would have to carry it even though they were not negligent.  Somebody would have to suffer and we in this House on this amendment have to decide who it should be.  Should we try to put the consumer who bought and used the product and suffered or was injured, in their original position by compensating them or should we say no, that they should carry the can and that they should get no compensation in respect of the injury sustained and the disruption caused and that the manufacturer, because he was not negligent in the production process, should go free and should pay nothing? That is the choice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> I have no hesitation in saying, in the spirit of the Directive, regardless of whether the producer or manufacturer was negligent, the fact remains that it was a defective product.  The Bill will not apply unless it is a defective product.  I say without any doubt or hesitation in my mind on this issue &mdash; and I have thought about it very carefully &mdash; that the producer and manufacturer prepared a defective product, a member of the public suffered grievously and they must compensate that person.  It would be utterly unjust of us in this House on this Bill, which provides for strict liability, to give that manufacturer and producer an out to say that they should go free and that the person who suffered as a result of using a defective product should carry the can.  That would be very unjust.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the category of case where there was no negligence.  I would now like to talk about another category, the case where they were negligent but a person cannot prove it.  This probably applies to a case involving a pharmaceutical product more than any other; it could apply to many others but it is easily understood in the realm of pharmaceuticals.  When one of the big multinational companies produces a new drug, the state of the art, for example, Thalidomide or Attivan, and people's lives are wrecked as a result, the question of bringing a claim against them arises.  I understood this matter as I have been involved in this kind of case.</P>
    <P>The pharmaceutical companies, the producers, have at their disposal expert witnesses.  When one talks about state of the art one is talking about the evidence in court of the top experts in this field. They can hear two dozen experts because, when something goes wrong with a drug, the expression &ldquo;a catastrophe&rdquo; is not too alarmist an expression to use because the results which ensue are nothing short of catastrophic; so it was with Thalidomide and so it is with Attivan and other drugs.  They have these experts in their laboratories and they can pay for them because they are multi-billion pound firms.  Some of them probably have budgets bigger than the budget of this State <Col N="2134" /> and they have no problem in calling up the experts who will tell the court <i>ad nauseam</i> or in as complicated a fashion as one likes that it was state of the art, that they are very sorry and that they did everything they could, all the tests and all that was known to man but, notwithstanding all this, it turned out to be a catastrophe and people's lives were destroyed.  They will call in the experts to establish the state of the art defence. They have those people on their staff and, if they do not, they will pay through the nose to get them.</P>
    <P>That is their side of the picture but what is the position of the unfortunate consumer?  Where are they going to get an expert from?  Where are they going to get even one expert who would have knowledge of the tests done on the drug or who would know sufficient to counter the evidence of the team of experts which the pharmaceutical company can and will call in?  It is a very serious business for them.  The profits from new drugs are enormous.  Millions of pounds are involved and if these new drugs go wrong the damages also run into millions.  They will spend inordinate amounts of money on lawyers and, more importantly, expert witnesses to resist the claim and to establish the state of the art defence.  There is no limit to it.  It is a very uneven contest. Indeed, it is so uneven, I will not say it is impossible &mdash; nothing is impossible &mdash; but it is well nigh impossible for the injured party to prove negligence.  A person just cannot get the experts they need to establish negligence in that situation. That is why it would be unfair and unjust to leave the manufacturers and the producers with that defence.</P>
    <P>The essence of this Bill is strict liability, if we allow that state of the art defence it is no longer a strict liability Bill.  We are back to a negative position and the Bill will be of little value if this defence is allowed to remain.  I urge the Minister to accept this critical, crucial amendment and to give the Bill what was intended by the Directive.  I am sure that every Member of this House would like this to happen.  Deputy Wallace's contribution was spot-on and I am sure that many <Col N="2135" /> backbenchers on all sides feel the same way about the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that this legislation will take effect, not just throughout the European Community but throughout the European economic area, that in the EFTA-EC area like legislation will apply since products from the greater European economic area will now be accessible throughout the European Community in the same way as products of EC member states?</P>
      <P>This is very technical legislation.  It is clear that it has been prepared not by parliamentarians but by Eurocrats, passed to our civil servants and processed by them.  Given that situation and the developments in Europe it is time not just to look at reforming this House and putting such technical Bills through Committees of the House but also looking at the whole question of a bicameral system at European level to vet these directives and this legislation in the first instance. Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to answer the question I raised in relation to the European economic area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all my colleagues who contributed in the most committed way to the debate on this amendment. As Deputies stated, member states were allowed under Article 15 of the Directive to exclude this defence, known as the &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; or &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; defence.  In accordance with the Government decision, taken at their meeting of 16 April 1991, it has been decided to include the defence in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the discussions on the Directive at EC level some member states argued &mdash; as forcefully as Members here have &mdash; that the inclusion of this defence was contrary to the principle of strict liability and, in certain cases, would leave the consumer with recourse to compensation. This defence, would, it was claimed, also bring about problems relating to proof and the courts would have to give lengthy consideration to cases where <Col N="2136" /> the defence was used.  Most member states, however, argued that the absence of such a defence would cause enormous problems for manufacturers, for example, the high cost of insurance and the stifling effect on innovation, especially in high risk industry such as pharmaceutical production, where considerable research is involved in the development of what are in many cases life-saving drugs.  Regarding insurance costs, the Irish Insurance Federation feel that the exclusion of the &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; defence would have a serious inflationary effect on liability insurance costs.</P>
    <P>In any event, the burden of proof will be on the producer to show that, because of the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time the product was put into circulation, he could not have been expected to discover the existence of the defect and providing such proof is likely to be extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>In their report on the implementation of the Directive on Product Liability the Fifth Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities favoured the inclusion of the &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; defence as they felt that the higher insurance premiums which would probably result from its exclusion would damage producers' competitive positions both on the home and foreign markets.  I do not know whether Deputy McCartan was a party to the decision but he would have been quite familiar with its implications.</P>
    <P>Of the nine member states who have so far implemented the Directive, eight have included &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; defence in their national provisions.  Of eight, Germany has extended the defence to all products except pharmaceuticals for which such provisions had already been in force nationally for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Article 15 of the Council Directive also states that the option relating to &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; will be reviewed by the EC Commission ten years after the date of notification of the Council Directive, i.e. after 25 July 1995 and the Commission may, in the light of the <Col N="2137" /> experience of member states in relation to this option, make proposals to the Council for changes.  This is the essence of what has happened in the Community so far.  In reply to Deputy Mitchell, quite a number of EFTA countries are already in the same position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor, Deputy Wallace and Deputy McCartan made very concentrated points relating to genuine fears regarding the freedom which the pharmaceutical industry might have in the context of this amendment not being included in the Bill.  There was a reference to the Thalidomide disaster and its results on families; nobody wants to see that repeated.  However, it is important for Deputies to understand that these matters are controlled through the Medical Preparation (Licensing, Advertising and Sale) Regulations, 1984 and 1989 and are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  In accordance with these regulations every medicinal product sold must have an authorisation granted by the Minister for Health.  These authorisations are granted on the recommendation of the National Drugs Advisory Board who test the preparation in question with particular regard to quality, safety and efficacy.</P>
    <P>Patenting and subsequent authorisation of products can take eight to ten years and, therefore, there is a need to make sure that the right type of encouragement is given for investment in research.  I am talking about research in the broadest term because all Deputies will accept that we do not have enough research and that the percentage ratio to our gross domestic product is not on a par with many of our competitors.  They will also accept that a great number of people are seeking post-graduate courses and that we will want them to carry out research here in pharmaceuticals, electronics or in other high-tech areas.  We must try to make sure that that happens.</P>
    <P>It is very important in a Bill like this to strike a balance in the difficult scenario of encouraging more investment in <Col N="2138" /> research which produces the kind of drugs we all want to see on the market to deal with cancer, AIDS, heart disease and unanswered medical questions.  We must find resources and get young people into the sophisticated system where developments of that kind will continue to take place because it is of paramount importance.  Nobody is arguing in that regard and I know everyone is in favour of such a policy.  You are as concerned about AIDS, cancer and so on as I or anybody else.  In this country we have been unable to ensure that the resources that are necessary are made available. Certainly, as Minister for Science and Technology I have fought, particularly on the European front, to enhance and improve research and activity which would support the initiatives that we take.  It is of fundamental importance that we create a better climate for that to happen.  That is not to say that any group, company or individual would find it easy to produce &mdash; Deputy Taylor was inclined to suggest that there are those who would want to put a defective product on the market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to put words in the Deputy's mouth but the emphasis on what he said tended to be that that is almost a prevalent condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the facts.  If I was a manufacturer would I want a bad product?  Would I want the publicity attached to the legal scenario outlined by the Deputy?  It would be in my interest as it would be in the interest of the young graduate working in research not to work in an environment that would produce anything that is dangerous.  It is in everybody's interest that the test system &mdash; I referred to the authorisation as far as the <Col N="2139" /> Department of Health are concerned &mdash; be enshrined and operated in the toughest and most stringent way to protect people from ever having to suffer as did young mothers and children deformed as a result of Thalidomide. Even up to today there are other potential problems which have been outlined, but unfortunately we cannot deal with all of these.  You can take a scenario whereby the risks are too great and where one would not look for a special drug to solve a certain problem.  There are risks involved in the investment, in the testing apparatus and so on needed to bring these drugs onto the market.</P>
      <P>All I am saying to my colleagues in this House &mdash; I am not pretending that there is an absolute position on this in the sense of who is 100 per cent right and who is 100 per cent wrong &mdash; is that there is an onus on us, when there is authorisation from the point of view of pharmaceutical firms and legislation is in place and is being rigidly adhered to, not to place further inhibitive factors in the way of carrying out as much research as we can into these matters.  I would like this country to be in a position to invest more in research.  I would like to see many more of our bright people here at home involved in research.  By the implementation of such policies we would be able to ensure that the products we produce in this country, whether in the electronic, pharmaceutical, food or health area, are of a high quality, safe and efficient.  That is the aim and that has to be achieved. In regard to this amendment, I think Deputies will appreciate that one side is not trying to pretend that they have all the answers, that doors will be opened and that consumers will be affected detrimentally by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to insurance, Deputy Taylor knows from his experience, that these measures can result in the consumers having to pay, with the person who is least able to afford it having to pay more money.  More fundamental is <Col N="2140" /> the fact that in a world which has reached across bridges, soared to the sky, sank into the sea and made major improvements in a lot of areas, there are still testing problems in the health and other areas that have to be researched.  We must find an apparatus, internationally and nationally, which supports that endeavour; but in so doing we must ensure that nobody can bring to the market products or pharmaceutical goods that will damage anybody in the community.</P>
    <P>As far as the Government are concerned we have tried to find a balance.  I hope Deputies will accept that our interests in this matter are the same as theirs.  Nobody is sure who has all the answers.  I would ask the Deputies to withdraw the amendment in the context of what I have said.  I have tried to explain why the position is as it is and that all matters in the context of the regulations governing the areas I have mentioned are already covered in existing legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very spirited rejection of my proposed amendment.  I have listened carefully and understand the reasons he has given.  They amount to two basic propositions: that to accept the amendment and not include a defence in our law would, and I quote, present enormous problems for producers on the one hand and that it would lead to serious inflationary effects on insurance costs on the other.  With those two reasons being advanced one wonders why bother with this legislation at all.  When talking about balance I believe we should approach it from the point of view of the consumer. The Minister presented a very flowery image of reaching to the heights of the skies and the bottom of the seas; but that is done for the consumer and it is from the point of view of the consumer that we should be legislating.  The Minister's rejection of my amendment leads to a very basic inconsistency in Government <Col N="2141" /> thinking in this area and for that reason I insist that the question be put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I also thank the Minister for coming to the House to answer me.  I acknowledge the interest she has shown in the schools in County Kildare since she became Minister.  If the Minister moves to greener pastures I hope she passes on that good habit to the new Minister.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me, I wish to mention the schools in question: Maynooth post-primary school; Confey College, Leixlip; St. Wolstan's Holy Faith secondary school, Celbridge and Scoil Ignáid Rís in Naas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school that probably has the least number of problems, Maynooth post-primary school, is one with which the Minister is familiar.  It is probably the best furnished school of the four and has many facilities but is suffering from the effects of a fast-growing population.  It is located in what is very much a developing area.  All of the schools now are in what has been identified as the fastest growing area of population in the country with the exception of the Fingal area in Dublin. There are two matters in relation to that school that need attention.  The first is that the site is somewhat restricted, and second, its recreational facilities are somewhat restricted as a result.  There is also the outstanding matter of a sum of money for the fitting out of classrooms some years ago.  That was not necessarily the <Col N="2144" /> responsibility of the Minister but I ask her to attend to it at some stage.</P>
    <P>Confey College in Leixlip is located in a very fast-growing area of population. The vast majority of the buildings at that school are prefabricated structures which are unsatisfactory for the ongoing education of students and are not conductive to satisfactory facilities or good educational standards from the point of view of students, parents and teachers.  I urge the Minister to provide the necessary finances in the Estimates to provide permanent classrooms.</P>
    <P>St. Wolstan's in Celbridge, has the selfsame problem of several prefabricated structures.  Classes have been housed in those structures for several years and the position is likely to continue unless the Minister makes a decision to rectify the problem and ensure the provision of adequate accommodation so that students and teachers will be able to carry out their work in a proper climate.</P>
    <P>A similar situation exists in relation to Scoil Ignáid Rís in Naas.  The school is under pressure as a result of a decision made some years ago by the Minister's predecessor not to proceed with a similar school in Kill.  The result is that the school is under pressure, the number of applicants being turned away each year is increasing, class accommodation is restricted and, as a result, the standard that teachers, parents and pupils would like achieved is becoming more difficult to attain.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging all the Minister has done so far I ask her to try to provide the necessary finances in the Estimates for the schools mentioned.  If that is not done we may later find that generations of students going through those schools, with the exceptions of one, will be accommodated in prefabricated, unsafe, unfit classrooms and, as a result, not have a chance to avail of the high standards we would like to give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for <Col N="2145" /> raising the issue of these schools.  He has discussed them with me informally on many occasions and through the medium of written and oral questions in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Deputy freely admitted that Maynooth post-primary school was the best equipped school of the four in that it has regular buildings.  As the Deputy knows, it is the sole post-primary provider in this area.  The school buildings completed in 1981 are capable of accommodating 600 pupils.  The temporary classroom was provided in 1988 and the school now has 625 places.  I know there are many calls by people who wish to send their children to that school.  The schools mentioned by the Deputy are well run, well staffed and well managed and, on several occasions, have had to refuse pupils.  Of the four schools the Maynooth school has the most modern accommodation and great calls upon its places.  The Deputy asked about an outstanding grant in relation to fitting out buildings and I shall have that matter looked into.</P>
      <P>The second school referred to was Confey College where a major extension is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  The vocational education committee's design team are working on some comments made by my Department on the recently submitted combined detailed design/bill of quantity stage of planning.  It is at that stage now and it is freely recognised on all sides that we rushed through various stages of planning for that school to arrive at this position. The area in question is populous and the need for post-primary places is emerging in those centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third school raised by the Deputy is at Celbridge.  As the Deputy knows there are currently two post-primary schools there, the Salesian College for 573 boys and St. Wolstan's which has 514 places.  The Salesians have a newly built school and plans have been made for St. Wolstan's.  My Department have been reviewing the project in the context of the likely short and long term needs.  We met management about this matter.  I <Col N="2146" /> accept that the number seeking post-primary education in the area is set to increase in the short term.  Meetings have been held with the school authorities in order to discuss how best to meet the needs of the area and further meetings are planned with the school authorities of both of those schools.  The situation is slightly different from that pertaining at the other schools but I shall keep the Deputy informed as to the progress of those meetings.</P>
    <P>With regard to Scoil Iognáid Rís in Naas an extension is planned, particularly for specialist rooms for subjects such as geography, science, woodwork, building construction and mechanical drawing.  We have been examining those to ascertain the details of the project, such as the nature of the site and the two-tier approach involved, which warrant careful examination.  That is continuing at present.  We are discussing the relevant matters with the management.</P>
    <P>I accept that these are urgent matters since the needs of post-primary pupils in this area are beginning to emerge strongly. I do not foresee any period, certainly in the short to medium term, when pupil's enrolment or intake will decrease in those areas, not like the trend in some other areas, which has been downward already in primary schools and which will, of course, eventually manifest itself in the post-primary sector.</P>
    <P>The matters of the four schools Deputy Durkan raised are live issues.  I will keep the Deputy informed of developments. May I say through you, Sir, to the schools concerned that we in the Department appreciate the great efforts being undertaken to cope with the ever increasing numbers of pupils in them.</P>

      <P>There is now an urgent need to provide sufficient money to allow regional fisheries boards to operate as they are supposed to do under statute.  The position obtaining under which regional fisheries boards are having to cut back severely on their allocations is totally unacceptable.  The Minister must make allowances for boards' increased expenditure so that they may comply with the recommendations of the Ballycotton Tribunal.  It would appear now that there are the farcical circumstances in which regional fisheries boards throughout the country are directed by the Department of the Marine to implement the recommendations of the Ballycotton Tribunal from their resources.  This will result in inevitable severe cutbacks on a service already cut to the bone.</P>
      <P>The report of the Ballycotton Tribunal clearly outlined the fact that no meaningful additional resources by way of staff or funding had been provided for the regional fisheries boards despite the fact that they had been obliged to develop strategies to deal with an extension of their areas of operation.  Financial cuts and embargoes, together with voluntary redundancies and early retirements, mean that there has been a severe reduction in the overall staffing of boards.  This has meant that fisheries boards have had to operate and fulfil their increased responsibilities with fewer resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salmon industry is worth millions of pounds to our economy.  Therefore it is common sense that adequate resources be allocated to the regional fisheries boards nationwide so that they can fulfil their legal obligations to develop and protect this great natural resource.  It is pointless to instruct already hard-pressed fisheries boards to comply with regulations while at the same time not providing them with the necessary finance to carry out the recommendations of the Ballycotton Tribunal.  The safety measures outlined in the report of the <Col N="2148" /> Ballycotton Tribunal &mdash; for example, the provision of certain types of boats, survival suits, radio equipment, shore vehicles, training of personnel and extra staff &mdash; are matters for and the responsibility of the Minister and his Department. Unless the financial resources to implement these necessary measures are made available the overall objective of the Ballycotton Tribunal, which was to investigate the deaths of four fisheries officers and make recommendations, will have been in vain.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give the House a full commitment this evening to reimburse the fisheries boards for what they have been instructed to spend on the various safety measures recommended by the Ballycotton Tribunal.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan's plea in this matter.  It is very sad that the small additional amount of money needed to safeguard our fisheries is simply not available.  It must be stressed that our fisheries, both inland and offshore, constitute a precious resource which must be preserved.  I would remind Members that this is a crucial period, a time when salmon, sea trout and brown trout are spawning, a time when they most need protection.  Nobody in this House should say there is not money available.  There is plenty of money in this country.  The pubs are full.  Indeed, the amount of tax avoided by some of the Taoiseach's friends would be sufficient&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West</i>): I agree with Deputies that extremely serious issues are raised by the emerging financial position of some but not all fisheries boards.  The total financial allocation for fisheries boards in 1990 came to approximately £5.682 million. This included an exceptional provision of over £400,000 to enable the boards to substantially reduce accumulated deficits and to start with a relatively balanced position going into this year. This allocation was made on the strict condition that boards would take all necessary measures to avoid any overruns in 1991.</P>
      <P>Allowing for provision for various pay increases the present allocation for 1991 will be close to £6.5 million, showing a very substantial nominal increase on the underlying position for 1990, but, I would concede, very little by way of a real increase.  However, the Deputy must accept that in present financial circumstances the maintenance of real levels of expenditure could not be considered to be unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I have been alarmed in recent weeks at reports that, leaving aside some exceptional items, a subtantial deficit was emerging in the overall financial position of the boards for 1991.  This is an extremely serious matter as boards are required legally to live within the resources they have been allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> The allocation by the boards of available resources as between different services is largely left to the boards themselves to decide in accordance with their views of local priorities.  It is a matter for the boards to manage their ongoing expenditure in a prudent fashion, allowing for contingencies including risks as regards the timing and level of own resources and the seasonal pattern of expenditure, so that the possibilities of running into significant unavoidable overruns late in the year when the scope for taking corrective action is limited are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>If boards have difficulties now they are largely of their own making.  It is totally unacceptable that they should turn around and seek to blame the difficulties they themselves have created by crying wolf and threatening extreme measures. These boards are in no different position from any other agency financed largely by the taxpayer and must live within their means.</P>
    <P>In the light of these developments I have asked for a full report from my Department on all aspects of financial control and management by the fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>The Deputy correctly raised the question of safety issues.  I agree with him that such expenditures should have a high degree of priority within the boards' expenditure programmes and that services should be curtailed, if necessary, rather than put their staff at any undue risks.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the difficulties faced by the regional fisheries boards during and after the Ballycotton tragedy and in terms of the expenditure incurred by them in connection with the legal fees associated with the Ballycotton inquiry, following the review of safety and having regard to the recommendations of the Ballycotton inquiry report.  However, the legal responsibilities of boards with regard to operating within approved estimates is quite clearly defined in the 1980 <Col N="2151" /> Fisheries Act.  While boards may not be totally satisfied with the resources available, I would have to point out that similar views are held by most State organisations which are largely financed by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will accept that a system whereby State organisations could themselves set their own level of expenditure and send the bill to the taxpayer would be a recipe for financial disaster. All State agencies must accept their legal responsibilities to live within the resources they are given.  Should these legal responsibilities be ignored the consequences could be extremely serious for the agency concerned.</P>
    <P>I am of course not unsympathetic to the pressures of boards and will do all I can to assist them.  But as of now I have no funds available for that purpose.  I can give no guarantee that such funds can be found.  Accordingly, the boards have no option but to take all appropriate steps to reduce as far as possible any excesses emerging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Government to abolish the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation represents the latest and perhaps one of the most unacceptable cuts yet in the development aid area.  The decision is being implemented at a time when the council have completed a major review of all the areas of Irish aid programmes, <Col N="2152" /> including the role of the council, at the request of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It covers issues such as future funding, structures and policy in the aid programme.</P>
      <P>It is beyond belief that for a saving of just £84,000 the Government would decide to abolish the advisory council.  There is clearly more involved.  The Government have embarked for some time past on a deliberate policy of running down the Irish aid programme.  It is my information that active consideration has been given to ending the entire bilateral aid programme and that a policy of emergency relief only would be substituted. Ireland's bilateral aid has already been cut drastically and in five years has fallen by more than one-third as a proportion of our GNP.  Ireland's official contribution is now just half the British level, less than a quarter of the United Nations' recommended level and is probably the lowest in the developed world.  The advisory council were in the best position to offer a critique of these cuts.  The fact that the Government have failed to specify any coherent reason for their abolition indicates that the real reason is an unwillingness to face up to the issues raised by the council.</P>
      <P>In the recent review of the Programme for Government there is a commitment to achieve a higher ODA/GNP contribution by the end of 1994.  This is a platitude with little or no substance and leaves many unanswered questions.  Will bilateral aid be increased or will our obligatory contributions to the UN in multilateral aid account for any increase there might be?  Will there be any increase at all in 1992 and 1993?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to abolish the advisory council shows that the commitment to increasing ODA levels in the new Government programme is an empty promise.  There is no goodwill towards developing or taking a leading position in various European and world fora in favour of ending the poverty and hunger of two-thirds of the world population.  In a situation where an estimated 30 million <Col N="2153" /> people face starvation in Africa, where an estimated one billion people live in absolute poverty throughout the world and where over one million children under the age of five die every month, a fundamental reassessment of our bilateral aid programme is urgently required. It is a stark fact that approximately 230 children will have died of hunger by the time this ten minute debate ends.</P>
    <P>To develop and maintain a coherent, viable and meaningful Irish aid programme the Government need the assistance and advice which the advisory council can provide.  Instead of abolishing the council steps should be taken to give them an expanded executive function to carry out specified work related to project selection, function and accountability.</P>
    <P>I conclude by urging all the parties in this House to respond to an invitation I made over a year ago that we approach this matter on an all-party basis which would take the issue of ODA out of the area of confrontational politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa. The proposal to abolish the advisory council is the greatest act of cynicism on the part of this Government who, in the past ten days, reiterated whatever commitment they had to the Third World by including an aspirational line in the renegotiated Programme for Government. We now see the value of that aspirational line.  This Government's record, together with the record of the 1987-89 Fianna Fáil Government, is a litany of cuts and shame.  The bilateral aid programme has been cut by 40 per cent since 1986, the Oireachtas Committee for Development Co-operation has been abolished, the co-financing element with the excellent voluntary agencies has been drastically reduced and the percentage of GNP spend on ODA has been cut from 0.25 per cent annually in 1986 to 0.16 per cent in 1991.  Now we have this further abolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs clearly wish to undermine our democracy by doing away with <Col N="2154" /> any independent expert voice which might from time to time be a thorn in their side.  How can the Minister claim that he needs to save the paltry sum of £84,000 by abolishing this expert council when other Departments of State have consultancy budgets ranging from £145,000 in the Central Statistics Office to £260,000 in the Department of Energy and a whopping £10 million for consultancy fees in the Office of the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>In the course of my work as spokesperson on development co-operation I have found the reports of the advisory council extremely useful.  I compliment the many expert people who have given freely and generously of their time and expertise.  This country's representatives will no longer be able to hold their heads high at international development fora if this Government continue to cut away at our development assistance to the poorest of the poor.  Ireland has the lowest record of official development assistance of all OECD countries.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to publish as soon as possible the two most recent reports submitted to him on the gender issue in relation to development co-operation and on the overview of the Irish aid programme.  I would ask him to tell me what he means by an informal independent committee which he proposes to set up in place of the advisory council.  It would probably cost him a great deal more than the £84,000 he is trying to save.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the points raised by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Owen.  I appreciate very much the manner in which they have put their arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Advisory Council on Development Co-operation was established in December 1979 by a Fianna Fáil Government to provide a forum for a representative discussion of matters relating <Col N="2155" /> to development co-operation and to offer advice to the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on such matters.  The present council of 19 members was appointed in 1989 and their term of office expires in December 1991.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen referred to the fundamental reassessment of our bilateral aid programme.  I asked the council to carry out this task and the reports to which Deputy Owen referred were prepared at my instigation.  The decision to abolish the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation was taken by the Government in the context of the need to find savings in all areas of public expenditure.  This step was taken with regret and only after the most careful consideration.  I fully recognise that in a situation where such savings must be made in the interests of a tight control on Exchequer spending, it is inevitable that hard decisions will be necessary, even in respect of such items as ODA expenditure.</P>
    <P>I wish to reassure the Deputies and the House that the decision to abolish the council does not in any way diminish the Government's commitment to overseas development assistance.  We are making every effort within the resources available to increase our levels of expenditure on multilateral and bilateral aid to developing countries.  In 1991 our total ODA allocation is almost £46 million, or 0.19 per cent of GNP, an increase over 1990 of some £11 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Tell us where that came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>This commitment is underlined in the text of the revised joint Programme for Government where the Government give a clear undertaking that a planned programme of increases will be made in the period 1992 to 1994 so as to achieve a higher ODA/GNP contribution by the end of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> I would also stress that this decision was taken, however reluctantly, solely on the grounds of financial costs.  I would like to put on record my deep appreciation of the valuable contributions made to the work of the council by present and past membership in their function of providing advice on development co-operation matters.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting last May with the chairperson and representatives of the council to inform them of the Government decision and the reasons behind it.  I assured them on that occasion that the council would not be wound up until the end of December 1991 in order to allow them to complete their work programme for 1991 and to allow for the term of office of the present council to expire.  I repeated these points at a further meeting in October.</P>
    <P>While it has been found necessary for financial reasons to abolish the council at the end of this year, it is intended to retain a source of independent advice on development co-operation matters through the establishment of an informal independent committee.  I am in the process of establishing a committee on these lines and hope that it will be in place at the start of 1992.  I can assure Deputy Owen that it will not cost a fraction of what the existing council costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give some <Col N="2157" /> of my time to my colleague, Deputy Brennan.</P>
      <P>There is a growing fear about the future of the Sligo-Mullingar railway line. No one is going to come out and say it is for the chop.  That is not the way it will happen; it will be killed off by slow strangulation.  Already this year the maximum speed limits of the trains on this line have been curtailed to 50 mph, next year it will be 40 mph and the following year it will be 30 mph, thus bringing the service to an end.  I understand that the line from Sligo to Mullingar is the first designated for closure unless the Government provide the necessary money for essential track renewal and signalling work.  I am fully aware that the spending of this money is officially a matter for the board of CIE and Irish Rail.  The problem is that the Government subvention is not adequate to meet all the urgent needs of track renewal, so some part of the network has to be sacrificed.  A major track renewal programme between Sligo and Carrick-onShannon was started about a year ago and a special squad of workers recruited. However, this work was suddenly abandoned, presumably because of lack of funds.</P>
      <P>In view of the vital importance of the railway link to Sligo and the entire northwest, any threat to the line is not acceptable. Closure should not be contemplated. A major upgrading of the track, signalling systems and rolling stock is needed immediately.  When the Minister met the Sligo Chamber of Commerce last June he promised that priority funding for this essential work would be made available from the 1992 budget.  I am asking him to honour that promise now that the Estimates are being formulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware that the Government have to deal with exceptionally difficult budgetary constraints and that demands will be made on all Departments, including the Minister's, to prune their expenditure.  The trouble is that the <Col N="2158" /> Sligo-Mullingar railway line cannot wait until better times; it cannot even wait another year.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us an assurance that the urgently needed funding for this railway line will be provided.  I am raising this issue on a day when the morning train from Sligo was half an hour late arriving at Connolly Station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy Nealon for sharing his time with me.  I agree with everything he has said here tonight.  It is a shame to think that the Sligo railway line will be downgraded, particularly the segment from Mullingar to Sligo.  There is an excellent train service from Dublin to Mullingar. An extra train is put on in the mornings to bring people from Mullingar to Dublin to work.  As Deputy Nealon said, unfortunately the speed limit of the train from Mullingar to Sligo has been reduced to 50 mph and sometimes it is much less. The people of Sligo, Roscommon and Longford are deeply concerned about this service.</P>
      <P>I have spoken in this House previously about the Dublin to Sligo railway line, in particular the segment from Mullingar to Sligo.  As Deputy Nealon rightly said, a number of people had started work on upgrading that line and laying of new tracks.  I have been reliably informed that the money for this work has been diverted to the southern line which is used by more people.  If the railway line to Sligo is not upgraded fewer people will use our railways in the future.</P>

      <P>At present the policy in Europe is to upgrade railway lines in order to take more traffic off the roads. This is one of the reasons the Sligo line should be upgraded rather than downgraded. As Deputy Nealon rightly said, the train to Sligo is half an hour late most <Col N="2159" /> days.  This is not acceptable, especially in the case of people who have hospital appointments in Dublin.</P>

      <P>It has been indicated publicly on a number of occasions recently that no proposals have been made by the board of CIE to close or downgrade the Mullingar-Sligo segment of the Dublin-Sligo rail line and this remains the position.  It has also been made clear that the renewal of the track is a matter which falls entirely within the day to day administration and operations of Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the chairman of CIE that, following a review of their track renewal programme, Iarnród Éireann recently deferred some elements of work on the Mullingar-Sligo segment of the Dublin-Sligo line.  This has resulted in some speed restrictions being applied to some sections of the line between Mullingar and Sligo.  The distances of line where these speed restrictions apply vary between 0.5 mile and one mile.  While these restrictions have added ten-15 minutes to the journey time between Dublin and Sligo, the chairman of CIE has advised that maintenance work on the Mullingar-Sligo line is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More generally, I would like to emphasise that the Exchequer subvention to Coras Iompair Éireann in 1991 in respect of essential public services will amount to £108 million, which is well over £2 million per week.  This represents a very substantial level of support for public transport, particularly against the background of scarce Exchequer resources. <Col N="2160" /> Of this, over 80 per cent will be expended on railway services.  In addition, the Public Capital Programme for 1991 provides for capital expenditure by CIE of £36.2 million, of which £5.7 million has been allocated for expenditure on railway signalling and track replacement.  The allocation of these resources to individual capital programmes within the CIE group is a matter entirely for the board of CIE.</P>
    <P>As far as Sligo is concerned, I would like to point out that Sligo station has recently been upgraded as part of Iarnród Éireann's Transtrack reorganisation and will now cater for groupage and sundry traffic for the north Roscommon area and County Donegal.  I also understand that Iarnród Éireann propose to replace the existing freight gantry in Sligo station. The replacement gantry will be capable of lifting larger containers.  Higher operating speeds will also be possible with this new equipment.</P>
    <P>These projects represent substantial investments in the facilities at Sligo station and are a strong indication of Iarnród Éireann's commitment to the improvement of services and facilities in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the need to ensure that our herring fishery is properly organised this season, unlike last season when it was not properly organised.  This was not the fault of the Minister or the Department of the Marine; it was the fault of the fishermen's organisations and their associated producer groups.  As a result, the season last year was very lopsided and the total permissible quota was fished out in the western sector of the Celtic Sea, leaving no fish at all for the eastern sector about which I am mainly concerned, the Dunmore East fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to keep this matter under review in order to ensure that there is an even distribution of the catch and the season is spread out over the maximum time possible.  If the fishery, <Col N="2161" /> which extends from Hook Head in Wexford right around to Loop Head in County Clare, is properly organised people will be able to earn a decent living up to the middle of February next year. However, if there is a repetition of what happened last year, when there was gross overfishing in the western sector of the Celtic Sea, the income possibilities for people in the Dunmore East fishery will be destroyed.  This fishery is worth about £1 million to the people of Dunmore East, be they fishermen, processors, the workers on the quayside or businesses in the area.  It is essential that these people have a five or six month season so that they can get their just rewards.</P>
    <P>I also want to ask the Minister if he will encourage Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the IDA to endeavour to get new markets for roe.  That is the part of the fish that was selling particularly well over the past seven or eight years to the Far East, to Japan in particular.  That market seems to have collapsed to a considerable degree in the last year.  It is a very important part of fishermen's income.  The fish itself can be sold as fillets or as marinated herring to the Continent but the roe is an element which makes the herring fishery extremely profitable.  I would like to see those markets in the Far East, particularly in Japan, resurrected and maintained. Above all, I would like the Minister to oversee the operation in the entire Celtic Sea area to ensure there is no undue exploitation by any particular sector and that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West)</i>: I thank Deputy Deasy for his contribution. The 1991 herring quota for the Celtic Sea is 19,555 tonnes which includes a quota swop of 545 tonnes negotiated with France.  This is the highest quota in this area for a number of years and 6,161 tonnes were taken in the spring fishing <Col N="2162" /> leaving 13,394 tonnes for the autumn fishing which opened on 6 October last. Initially four ports in the region were open &mdash; Fenit, Dingle, Castletownbere and Cobh.  Dunmore East was opened on 20 October when it became apparent, based on scientific fishing, that the quality of the roe of the herring in that area was suitable and acceptable.</P>
      <P>A conservation box closure is set to come into force in the western sector from 1 November to 16 November inclusive. The purpose of such closure is to conserve the stock in that area during its most vulnerable spawning period. During the period of the box closure, the ports coming within the box will remain closed, leaving Cobh and Dunmore East as the only ports open for herring landings.  As Deputy Deasy has rightly said prices for herring roe have been down to date this autumn.  My officials both at the ports and in the Department are monitoring the situation on a continuous basis.  Indeed, I will be happy to bring to the notice of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the IDA the points the Deputy has raised in regard to that aspect.</P>
      <P>The Celtic Sea herring quota, as defined in the 1991 TACs and Quotas Regulation, relates to an area south of Loop Head in the west and Cahore Point, County Wexford, in the east.  There is no formal division within the fishery in terms of division of the quota.  However, given that this is primarily a roe fishery, the area roughly falls into two distinct areas from a spawning and management viewpoint: a western element from Dingle to Cork Harbour, which is an autumn fishery, and an eastern element from Cork Harbour to Dunmore East, which is a winter-spring fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objective in the management of the Celtic Sea herring fishing is to allocate the quotas available as evenly as possible over the main spawning season with a view to maximising income and employment both to the fishermen and the processors. I am satisfied, having made <Col N="2163" /> inquiries, that the present management regime in place will ensure that this is achieved to the end of 1991.</P>

      <P>So the Minister can guarantee there will be no overfishing this year in the western sector.</P>

      <P>I have examined the report referred to by the Deputy and the recommendation contained in it that an EC-funded project should be developed to help build a close working relationship <Col N="1949" /> between Irish and UK training authorities.</P>
      <P>In the context of the European Community, negotiations between Ireland and the United Kingdom have taken place over the years on the mutual recognition of qualifications.  These negotiations at EC level have resulted in a number of sectoral directives on the recognition of the qualifications of architects, nurses, veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and medical doctors.  A more general directive 89/48/EEC on the mutual recognition of regulated professions requiring three or more years higher education, came into effect this year.  This covers a wide range of regulated professions at this level not already covered by the sectoral directives.  The effect of these EC directives is to greatly increase the acceptance of Irish professional qualifications in the UK both by professional bodies and employers.  The benefit has been particularly significant in the case of Irish trained teachers seeking qualified teacher status in England and Wales where I understand that, since Directive 89/48/EEC was implemented in that jurisdiction, upwards of 1,000 Irish teachers have secured recognition.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are currently at an advanced stage for a second general EC directive on the mutual recognition of qualifications requiring education and training of less than three years higher education.  This will also have the effect of facilitating recognition of Irish qualifications at this level in the UK.</P>
      <P>At a bilateral level there is mutual recognition between Ireland and the UK of qualifications over a range of professions, particularly in the areas of accountancy and financial services.  The Deputy will also be aware that FÁS have recently made a joint certification agreement with City and Guilds whereby participants on a range of FÁS training courses qualify for certification issued under the joint authority of the two awarding bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will also be aware of the action I took in August to establish a national council for vocational awards whose main task will be to establish a framework of <Col N="1950" /> levels of qualification for training course run outside the third-level educational system.</P>
    <P>The new council will introduce a national system of certification classified by level and based on participants' competence. It will be more comprehensible to employers both here and in the UK.  I am confident that it will contribute greatly to removing any lack of knowledge among British employers about the meaning and quality of Irish education/ training qualifications.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department are preparing an information leaflet in relation to the leaving certificate which will outline the structure of the course, the subjects covered, the standard involved, the numbers of such subjects which would typically be taken by an Irish leaving certificate student and the levels of assessment used in the examinations.</P>
    <P>The statement will point out that the leaving certificate is the accepted qualification for entry to university and other third level institutions here and is used for recruitment to a variety of employments in Ireland.  It will also state that the leaving certificate is widely accepted for entry to third-level education in the UK.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the information leaflet be given wide circulation to include, for example, Irish embassies abroad, organisations catering for Irish emigrants, and employer representative organisations in Britain.</P>

      <P>An agreement has been reached with the school authorities to amalgamate the three existing schools in St. John's Parish, Kilkenny into two schools and to establish them on the basis of junior and senior co-education schools.  The senior co-ed school will be accommodated in the existing boys school and this will necessitate an extension of two permanent classrooms and some ancillary accommodation.  It is <Col N="1955" /> intended that the junior co-ed school will be accommodated in the existing girls and infants schools which will need upgrading and general improvements.  The project for the schools is at the initial stage of planning.</P>

      <P>Due to difficulties outside the Department's control progress on submission of the preliminary tender report has been slow due to difficulties which arose in determining the capacity of the lowest tender for the main contract to undertake the project.  This necessitated considerable exploring by the design team in order to ascertain whether the lowest tender could secure a guarantee of a bond.  In the event, the company were unable to secure a bond and they subsequently withdrew from the project.</P>
      <P>On 9 October 1991 the Department conveyed approval to the design team to proceed to an examination of the next lowest tender.  My Department are now awaiting the design team's report and recommendations.</P>

      <P>Phase I of Tallaght Regional Technical College is due for completion in early 1992.  The initial enrolment of over 400 full time day students will take place in September 1992.  The capacity of the college on completion of phase I will be 1,500 whole time equivalent students including 1,000 full time day students. The capacity will be increased to 2,000 whole-time equivalent students on completion of phase II.</P>
      <P>The structure of the college will be similar to that in the other regional technical colleges.  The principal took up duty on 1 September 1991.  Heads of schools of engineering, science and business studies have also been appointed and heads of department posts have been advertised recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following courses have been submitted to the National Council for Educational Awards and have been provisionally included in the central applications system list for the 1992-93 academic year: National Certificate in Business Studies (Options in Marketing, Languages and Finance); National Certificate in Computing; National Certificate in Science (Options in Applied <Col N="1957" /> Biology, Applied Chemistry); National Certificate in Engineering (Electronics) and National Certificate in Engineering (Mechanical) (Options in Production Systems, Control Systems).</P>
    <P>With regard to representation on the board the Deputy will be aware that I have introduced in the House a Bill to provide for the organisation and development of the regional technical colleges. This Bill includes provision for governing bodies for the colleges.  These provisions will of course, apply to the Tallaght college also.  Pending enactment of the legislation County Dublin Vocational Education Committee are directly discharging the relevant functions in relation to the college.</P>

Present also were representatives from the furniture manufacturers and the Department's professional and administrative staff.  The whole question of school furniture was discussed in detail.</P>

      <P>As indicated to the Deputy in my answer to his Questions Nos. 231 and 232 on 5 June 1991 any outcentre third level courses would have to be provided under the aegis of a regional technical college.  The establishment of courses in the vocational education committee third level college sector is a matter in the first instance for the vocational education committees in the areas where colleges are located.</P>
      <P>My Department has not received proposals for the establishment of specific third level courses in Castlebar.  I understand that County Mayo Vocational Education Committee has had discussion with the NCEA and with both Sligo and Galway regional technical colleges with a view to developing proposals but that it was not possible in the time available to prepare proposals for courses for introduction in September 1991.</P>
      <P>The position, overall, in relation to capital projects in the regional technical college sector is that the provision is totally committed to ongoing projects and accordingly there are no moneys available for such a project in 1991.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reference commending the use of a hospital in Castlebar in my answer of the 5 June last the position is that initial investigations have indicated that the building is worthy of further consideration.  However, a more detailed report on the condition of the building will be undertaken by my Department on receipt of a submission from County Mayo Vocational Education Committee indicating the proposed courses to be organised.</P>

      <P>The course committees make recommendations to the council which, in turn, make its recommendations to me.</P>
      <P>I should stress that the advice of the council has been accepted by me on the great majority of issues.  Important examples include the revised syllabuses in nine subjects introduced in phase I of the junior certificate, in a further five subjects in phase II and the council's recommendations on senior cycle provision.</P>
      <P>The council is, of course, advisory in its nature and I would have to reserve my position on the council's recommendations on any matter having regard to my overall responsibility for educational provision at both primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that I am arranging a series of meetings on the junior certificate with all the interested parties.</P>

      <P>I believe that in order to provide for equality of educational opportunity, it is necessary that enhanced educational provision be made for pupils who are educationally and-or socially disadvantaged.  It is also necessary to heighten awareness of gender equity issues and to develop practical ways to eliminate the imbalances that exist in the educational experiences of girls and boys.  It has been a major policy objective of mine since taking office to develop measures to promote equality of educational opportunity.  The following important measures have been undertaken to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>Funding for the special assistance scheme for schools in disadvantaged areas has increased by 300 per cent since 1987.  The home school links programme which I launched as a major part of this scheme is already having encouraging results.  This year I have expanded the programme to bring it to a total of 80 schools and arrangements are in hand to extend it to second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past three years some 325 additional teachers have been authorised for primary schools in disadvantaged <Col N="1968" /> areas and for remedial and special education.  A pilot school psychological service for primary schools has been initiated in the West Tallaght-Clondalkin area and in South Tipperary where there are some 28,000 pupils enrolled.  This development is being carefully monitored and evaluated.  In the present year 325 teaching posts were authorised in order to reduce class sizes in primary schools.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level some 120 schools have each been provided with the services of an extra teacher to assist in aspects of disadvantage within those schools.</P>
    <P>To reduce the PTR in post-primary schools a further 250 teaching posts were sanctioned this year.  I should add that, at present there are some 1,000 teachers approved for post-primary schools outside the normal quota provision to meet particular curricula, remedial and other needs.</P>
    <P>I have continued to expand the free books scheme aimed at helping needy children and have recently extended it to infant classes.  Over a quarter of a million children are now benefiting under the scheme at primary level and at post-primary level, with total expenditure now standing at over £4 million annually.</P>
    <P>I have created a special fund to foster and encourage greater participation in senior cycle and third level education-training programmes for students from disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>At the same time the various curricular initiatives have been aimed at providing courses more effectively planned to meet the needs of all our young people.</P>
    <P>In 1991, the additional resources provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have facilitated an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio in special schools, an expansion of the visiting teacher service to embrace additional clinical groups and the deployment of resource teachers to assist disabled in an integrated setting.  I recently established a special committee, representative of experts in the field of special education, to carry out a fundamental examination of the range and <Col N="1969" /> level of educational and other support services necessary in order to maximise the potential of disabled children.</P>
    <P>Measures to promote gender equity include action research on the integration of equal opportunities in the curriculum of teacher education, the establishment of working groups on the elimination of sexism and sex-stereotyping in textbooks and teaching materials, intervention projects in physics and chemistry and various measures designed to encourage girls to reappraise traditional subject and career choices.</P>
    <P>In 1990 I launched an equality pack which was sent to every primary and post-primary school in the country and included a booklet &ldquo;Department of Education &mdash; Gender Equity&rdquo; which outlines the policy of the Department on this issue.</P>

      <P>As part of the allocation of the additional teaching resources made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, it is intended to appoint six additional teachers to the visiting teacher service.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the existing service, which currently focuses only on children with visual and hearing impairment, will be developed into a generic service embracing other clinical groups.  As an initial step in this process, it is intended that the expanded service will embrace children with Down's Syndrome.</P>
      <P>However, in order to give practical effect to this arrangement, it was necessary to secure the prior agreement of the representative body of the existing visiting teachers, since it involved an extension of their role to include Down's Syndrome children.  I am happy that this agreement is now forthcoming and that arrangements for the expanded scheme can be put in place.  The visiting teachers are to be complimented on these positive responses.</P>
      <P>It is now intended that the six additional visiting teachers posts will be advertised this week and that interviews, selections and the taking up of positions will be completed as speedily as practically possible therefore.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>While child care assistants are utilised in schools, their role is not educational but rather one of attending to the physical needs of handicapped children.  As such, it has generally been considered that the provision of such assistants is a matter for the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>In 1979, a special school was introduced under which my Department funded the appointment of 86 child care assistants to special schools for handicapped children.  However, in more recent years, the embargo on public sector recruitment has meant that no further appointments could be made.</P>
      <P>The question of rationalising the delivery of child care assistant support will be one of the issues addressed by the special committee (under Declan Brennan) established to examine the educational provision for children with special needs. Among that committee's terms of reference is the task of examining and reporting on the linkages which exist between the various Departments operating in this field.</P>

      <P>The decision to abolish the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation was taken by the Government in the context of the need to find savings in all areas of public expenditure.  This step was taken with regret and only after the most careful consideration.</P>
      <P>When the council were informed of the Government's decision earlier this year it was indicated that they would be allowed to continue in existence until the end of December 1991.  This was to enable them to complete their work programme for 1991 and to allow for the term of office of the present membership of the council to expire.

      <P>The agreement reached in Luxembourg on 22 October between the EC and EFTA member states to create the European Economic Area (EEA) will result in the creation on 1 January 1993 of the largest single unified market in the world consisting of some 380 million consumers and accounting for 43 per cent of world trade.</P>
      <P>The EEA Agreement provides for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital among the 19 EC and EFTA states.  Institutional arrangements, including arrangements for an EEA Council at ministerial level, form part of the agreement and there is provision for increased co-operation in areas such as social policy, consumer protection, the environment, research and development and education.  The agreement also aims to contribute to the reduction of economic, social and regional disparities within the EEA.</P>
      <P>This agreement will provide a comprehensive framework for strengthening relations between the EC and its close neighbours in EFTA with whom it shares much in the political, economic, cultural and social spheres.  The agreement is a balanced one, providing benefits for all participants.  The extension of the Single Market to EFTA should result in a boost to economic activity throughout the EEA.  The agreement may also have significance as a possible model for wider co-operation between European states.</P>
      <P>Ireland enjoys excellent relations with the EFTA member states and welcomes the EEA agreement as an appropriately strong framework for EC-EFTA co-operation. We are well pleased to benefit from easier access to this larger market in goods and services, having already in 1990 a trade surplus of some IR£270 million with the EFTA countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the negotiations concern was nevertheless expressed by several member states, including Ireland, that the benefits of market integration would not be spread evenly throughout the EEA.  Together with Spain, Portugal and Greece, we therefore sought inclusion in the agreement of appropriate <Col N="1980" /> provisions to promote economic and social cohesion.  A cohesion fund to be set up by the EFTA states will be among the instruments to be used in this area. The fund will consist of 500 million ECU &mdash; £400 million &mdash; in grants and 1,500 million ECU &mdash; £1,200 million &mdash; in loans which will attract a 3 per cent interest rate subsidy.  These sums are to be committed over a five year period beginning in 1993. Ireland expects to benefit from the operations of the cohesion fund by amounts of approximately £50 million in grants and £150 million in soft loans.</P>
    <P>There was some concern also at possible disadvantages for Ireland arising in the fisheries sector of the agreement. However, the threat to the developing Irish fishing industry from tariff concessions on imports of herring, mackerel and salmon was averted when it was agreed that these species would be excluded from the liberalisation process. In addition, Ireland has made clear its claim to a portion of the extra fish resources &mdash; 11,000 tonnes by 1997 &mdash; that will be made available in Norwegian waters.</P>
    <P>These will be allocated among EC member states on the basis of cohesion criteria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN peace plan for Cambodia, embodied in the agreements signed in Paris on 23 October, constitutes a significant step in assuring for the people of Cambodia a secure and stable future, based on democratic institutions and respect for human rights.  Central to their successful implementation will be the readiness of all the parties involved to respect the obligations they have voluntarily assumed in putting their names <Col N="1983" /> to the Paris agreements.  No one underestimates the difficult task that lies ahead or the dangers which failure would entail.</P>
      <P>The agreements are founded on the desire for national reconciliation and on the right of self-determination of the Cambodian people, exercisable through free and fair elections.  It will be for the UN Secretary-General to propose the timetable for the UN operation, including preparations for and the holding of elections.  Provisional indications are that elections could take place early in 1993.</P>
      <P>The essence of the United Nations role during the transitional period is to ensure a neutral political environment in which the Cambodian people are assured the freedom to exercise their right to choose, in free and fair elections, those whom they wish to govern them.  In order to ensure this, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) will have under its direct supervision or control all those administrative agencies, bodies and offices which could directly influence the outcome of elections.  It will be responsible for confirming that political parties and candidates meet established criteria in order to qualify for participation in the election.  Adherence to a code of conduct established by UNTAC, in consultation with the Supreme National Council (SNC), will be one condition for such participation.  It will also be a requirement that party platforms be consistent with the principles and objectives of the agreements.  The Government believe that these provisions will ensure that there can be no return to the policies and practices of the past.</P>
      <P>The provisions on human rights in the Paris agreements provide strong and effective guarantees both as regards the transitional period and for the future. During the transitional period, UNTAC has a mandate to make provision for general human rights oversight, including the investigation of human rights complaints and, where appropriate, corrective action.  It will also have responsibility for the development and implementation of a programme of human rights education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" /> The principles for a new constitution for Cambodia are explicit and categorical on the protection of human rights and on the fundamental values on which the new constitutional order will rest.  In particular, they provide for a declaration of fundamental rights consistent with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international instruments.  Additionally, the principles provide for an independent judiciary empowered to enforce the rights under the new constitution.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Human Rights Commission will also continue to monitor the human rights situation in Cambodia closely.</P>
    <P>As a further guarantee, the agreements grant the signatories the right to call upon the competent organs of the UN in the event of violations of any of the obligations under the agreements, including serious human rights violations, to take such steps as are appropriate for their prevention and suppression.  In effect, this gives to the international community a permanent role in the monitoring of human rights in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with those who believe that those responsible for the unspeakable horrors which took place in Cambodia should be answerable for their actions before an appropriate tribunal.</P>
    <P>As I have stated to the House on an earlier occasion, the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide provides for the possibility of trial by an international penal tribunal.  However, this remains only a theoretical possibility, since there is at present no international penal tribunal with jurisdiction to try persons for genocide.</P>
    <P>A role for the International Court of Justice exists under the convention but only in the case of a dispute as between states parties to the convention.  This condition cannot be fulfilled until a Cambodian Government in a position to be party to such a dispute is in place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its partners in the European Community have consistently expressed concern at the abuse of human rights in Iraq.  On 3 April, we condemned the brutal repression in that country and on 28-29 June the European Council reiterated its concern about the fate of civilian populations, in particular the Kurds and the Shias.</P>
      <P>There is in fact already a force of 500 UN guards together with humanitarian teams deployed in Iraq by the United Nations since last April.  United Nations agencies are providing basic humanitarian services including provision of food, clean water, basic health and sanitation programmes to refugees, returnees and other vulnerable people in Iraq.</P>
      <P>The mandate of the UN guards is to protect UN personnel, assets and operations linked to the humanitarian programme, to monitor the general situation in Iraq and to report on incidents when they occur in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN Secretary General's executive delegate, has reported that the humanitarian programme, which he is administering on behalf of the UN, has been effective in protecting and caring for the refugees <Col N="1986" /> returning home and for other vulnerable groups in Iraq and he has paid tribute to the UN guards, who are playing a vital role in maintaining a climate of security in the region where they are present and whose presence is facilitating the return and resettlement of displaced persons. He has said, and I agree with him, that &ldquo;the right to food, water, shelter and adequate health care are amongst the most fundamental of all human rights and must be assured to all people in all areas&rdquo; and there must be no discrimination whatsoever in the enjoyment of those rights.</P>

The agreement committed the parties to facilitate and encourage economic, industrial, scientific and technological co-operation between the relevant Irish and Soviet organisations, enterprises and firms.  The agreement further provided for the convening of a joint commission to meet annually to consider means of advancing co-operation in various economic sectors of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>A declaration on the development and improvement of economic, industrial and scientific co-operation, intended to facilitate the expansion and development of bilateral economic relations as broadly as possible, was signed during my visit to the Soviet Union from 20 to 23 July 1991.</P>

      <P>An agreement for the avoidance of double taxation of air transport undertakings and their employees entered into force upon signature on 17 December 1986.  This agreement exampted air transport undertakings of either contracting party from all taxes chargeable by the other state on profits, income and capital gains.  The agreement was given domestic effect in the Double Taxation Relief (Air Transport Undertakings and their employees (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics)) Order, 1987 (S.I. No. 349 of 1987).</P>
      <P>An air transport agreement was signed on 29 September 1987.  This agreement sets out the modalities for the operation of air services between the two countries and the rights and responsibilities of the parties in connection with such air services.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> An amendment to this Air Transport Agreement of 1987 entered into force by means of diplomatic notes of 2 October 1991.  A protocol supplementary to the air transport agreement as amended entered into force upon signature on 2 October 1991.  This amended agreement provides for the further development of air transport relations between the two countries and for the addition of routes for air services.</P>
    <P>A protocol on political consultations as signed on 22 July 1991 during my visit to the Soviet Union.  This protocol is intended to enlarge and deepen political consultations on important international problems of mutual interest and on questions of bilateral relations.  Consultations are conducted regularly and on the basis of reciprocity at all levels.</P>
    <P>An agreement on cultural co-operation between Ireland and the Soviet Union was also signed on 22 July 1991 in Moscow.  This agreement provides for academic and youth exchanges, scholarships, reciprocal visits by cultural personalities, exchanges of exhibitions and co-operation between libraries, museums and galleries.  It is administered by a Joint Commission comprising representatives from both countries, which will meet biennially to draw up programmes for exchanges under the provision of the agreement.</P>

      <P>The powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake drainage works are derived solely from the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, and relate to the carrying out of works by means of comprehensive schemes for entire river catchment areas.  The commissioners have no power to undertake piecemeal works for the relief of particular areas in a catchment in advance of a comprehensive scheme.</P>
      <P>The Dunmanway area forms part of the Bandon catchment which is No. 25 of 28 catchments on the priority list of major catchments being considered for treatment under the Act but, in view of the extent of existing commitments, it is unlikely to be reached for consideration under the Act for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 Cork County Council requested the commissioners, in the light of their technical expertise, to act as consultants to the council in the examination of the causes of flooding in Dunmanway and to propose methods for providing increased protection from flooding for the town.  The commissioners completed this investigation and furnished their report to the council in May 1991.  It was clear from the outset that the investigation did not involve the commissioners in any commitment to <Col N="1992" /> undertake works for the relief of flooding in the Dunmanway area.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the prevention of flooding in Dunmanway only and its implementation is accordingly a matter for the local authority in the first instance. The provision of funds to the Office of Public Works for the implementation of the report does not, therefore, arise.</P>

    <P>The reasons for the delay were as follows: (a) the EC regulations governing the schemes were not finalised until July 1990 after all other cattle scheme applications had been issued in Ireland, (b) those regulations were so complex that discussions with the EC Commission Services were necessary this year to ensure <Col N="1998" /> that we were implementing them properly in Ireland and (c) there have been some difficulties in obtaining details of the milk quotas owned by certain applicants so that their eligibility for the schemes and the numbers of cows on which premium could be paid could be established accurately.  These problems have been largely resolved now, however, and payment of 1990 and 1991 grants under this scheme should start in November 1991 with all other 1991 cattle scheme payments.</P>

      <P>Short-time working usually takes the form of a short working week i.e. employees working either two or three days a week on a systematic basis for usually pre-determined periods of time.  The incidence of this type of working arrangement increased dramatically during the eighties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> In 1983 the unemployment benefit entitlements of systematic short-time workers were restricted.  The legislation provided that the entitlement of such workers would be limited so that the total number of days on which unemployment benefit is payable and the number of days worked would not exceed five &mdash; as opposed to six which is the normal benefit week.  The amount of benefit payable for each day of unemployment is at one-fifth the weekly rate &mdash; as opposed to one-sixth &mdash; and pay-related benefit is not payable.</P>
    <P>Those restrictions were introduced following an examination which showed that the workers concerned generally received more by way of take home pay and unemployment and pay-related benefit than if they were working full time. In addition, there was evidence that some workers were unwilling to return to full-time working when the need for short-time working had passed, giving rise to very lengthy periods of short-time working, and that in some instances short-time workers were working overtime on the days they were employed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from March 1989.  In July 1990, payment was disallowed following examination by a medical referee. Subsequently there were further medical examinations, including an independent <Col N="2005" /> medical consultant examination which was arranged by the independent social welfare appeals office at the request of the chief appeals officer.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the consultant's report, an appeals officer's decision, made in November 1990, which confirmed the original disallowance, was reversed. Both appeals hearings were oral, that is, the person was given the opportunity to state his case directly to the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The new appeals decision meant that benefit was restored with effect from July 1990.</P>
      <P>Following the favourable outcome of the second appeal, the person concerned applied for invalidity pension.  The Deputy made representations in support of this application.  I wish to make it absolutely clear that the Deputy's representations did not adversely influence the subsequent course of events.  The person concerned was called for a medical examination in connection with the invalidity pension application.  A new aspect had to be considered, <i>viz</i> was the person likely to remain permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>The medical referee indicated that the person concerned was not likely to remain incapable of work.  His findings also indicated that the person was, in his opinion, fit for work.  It was believed by the deciding officer that the medical examination, which occurred some time after the appeals hearing, should take precedence over the ruling in May.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the Deputy's question I have had the case re-examined. An appeals officer will be asked to review the latest findings to assess whether he might wish to revise his findings made in May of this year.  I am glad to say that in the interim benefit will be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the actions taken were in good faith and that they were not influenced by any unfair motive.  There is a difficult point at issue in this type of case.  Clearly appeals officers decisions are binding on deciding officers but the possibility that a person's medical condition can improve over time must also <Col N="2006" /> be admitted as an aspect that deciding officers must take into account.</P>
    <P>Having reconsidered the decision, however, a deciding officer has concluded that the interval between the hearing and the subsequent medical review was too short having regard to the special circumstances of this case.  This revised view allows the payments to be restored and to continue at least until the appeals officer reviews the case.</P>
    <P>The decision in relation to the invalidity pension application will also be reviewed by the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

Additionally, some 68 per cent of all old age non-contributory pension and 65 per cent of all widow's non-contributory pension recipients are in receipt of their pension at the full rate.</P>

On the basis of the report, the Commission has decided to organise hearings towards the end of 1991 with all parties involved.  When these hearing are over, the Commission will take a position on whether and how to integrate the gambling sector into the 1993 concept.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the improvement of county roads rests with the local authority concerned and the cost of such works falls to be financed by the authority from its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants provided annually by my Department.  The discretionary road grant allocation to Longford County Council in 1991 amounts to £1,454,000, including a supplementary grant of £350,000 for improvement works because of the special needs of the county.  I am satisfied that this is an equitable proportion of the overall funds available for such grants and I intend that the council will continue to get an equitable share of grants in the future.</P>

    <P>As I have pointed out before to the Deputy, the timing of issue of creditors payments is a matter for each individual agency to decide.  In considering the above figure the amount outstanding to creditors on any particular date is related to the timing of payments rather than an indication of financial performance.  The information relating to all voluntary hospitals is not readily available. However, it is estimated that the amount involved for the major voluntary hospitals would be £8 million.</P>

This action was considered necessary in response to the growing need to address deficiencies in this area.</P>

      <P>Since December 1988, approved staffing levels in the Southern Health Board have increased from 6,074 to 6,290 at December 1990 and to 6,327 at present.  This represents an increase of 253 posts over that period arising from various developments of service.</P>
      <P>My Department have been in regular contact with all agencies, including the Southern Health Board, throughout the current year and has continuously impressed on them the absolute necessity to operate services within approved financial budgets and the corresponding approved employment levels which I have already referred to.  While the majority of agencies have been able to manage their affairs within approved employment parameters, it is necessary for a minority to make adjustments to do so.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the undertakings which I announced in the House last February in relation to the maintenance of agreed levels of health services in 1991, the non-capital allocations of health boards will be adjusted to take account of approved increases in expenditure, including pay, increases in the rates of allowances and certain services-related items.  Health boards are now generally aware of the order of these adjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> As the Deputy will be aware, all agencies were notified in their letter of allocation for 1991 that expenditure must be contained within the limits of the allocation, as revised from time to time throughout the year.  Any expenditure excess arising in 1991 will be a charge against the 1992 allocation.  This position has been reinforced in meetings with the agencies throughout the year and I have again drawn specific attention to the difficulties which will arise for any agency carrying a deficit into next year.</P>

      <P>During the passage of the Adoption Bill there was agreement on all sides as to the importance of ensuring that people proposing to adopt in a foreign country are properly assessed beforehand. Indeed the Adoption Board, to whom all assessments must be submitted for final approval, has made it clear to the health boards and the adoption societies that the standard of the suitability assessment for a foreign adoption should be equivalent to that applicable in the case of an Irish adoption.  It is inevitable therefore that it will take some time for such assessments to be completed.  It is my intention that there should be no undue delay in processing applications.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, there are three post-primary schools in Carrickmacross with a total enrolment of 1,404 pupils.</P>
      <P>Following an examination of the overall post-primary accommodation situation in the centre, my Department decided that to proceed with three separate building projects would be contrary to their policy of rationalisation and would not be in the best long term interest of the pupils in the area.  In accordance with standard practice, discussions were initiated with the school management on the issue of rationalisation.</P>
      <P>The need for rationalisation has been accepted by all three post-primary schools in the centre and discussions and consultations among all the interested parties have been conducted at local level.  I would urge that further discussions take place at local level with a view to reaching a consensus on the future provision to be made for post-primary facilities in Carrickmacross.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department has agreed to grand-aid temporary accommodation at Inver College to meet its short term requirements.</P>

      <Col N="2031" /> This candidate entered to sit the 1991 leaving certificate examination as a repeat student in St. Joseph's College, Borrisoleigh, Thurles, County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Repeat students are required to pay £100 course fee and £100 examination fee.  The student paid the course fee but there is no provision for a refund of fees in the case of a pupil who does not complete the year's study.  He left the school before the examination fee was due to be paid and he did not, in fact, pay that fee.</P>
    <P>Having left St. Joseph's College he entered for the examination as an external candidate paying an examination entry fee of £139 i.e. £115 normal fee plus £24 late fee.  He subsequently sat the examination in three subjects.  Since he sat the examination a refund of the examination entry fee does not arise.</P>
    <P>In the unusual circumstances of the case however a refund of the £24 late fee will be considered on receipt of a request for such a refund from the applicant.</P>

      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, in its position paper on the senior cycle, proposed that students be given the option of <Col N="2033" /> choosing courses from both the leaving certificate and senior certificate programmes. The council also proposed that the transition year option would remain. In the context of an optional three-year senior cycle students have the following options at this level:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a two-year leaving certificate course;</P>
      <P>&mdash;transition year followed by two-year leaving certificate;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a two-year senior certificate;</P>

      <P>I have already indicated my general acceptance of the council's recommendations. This matter will be addressed in the forthcoming Green Paper on Education and will, therefore, be the subject of further discussion and debate.</P>
      <P>The option of a six-year cycle will be available to students who commenced their post-primary education this year and who will be starting their senior cycle programme in 1994-95.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>The concerns which gave rise to the EC Council Resolution of 29 May 1990 on this subject and the Recommendation of the European Parliament report which the Deputy refers to arose in the context of areas of the EC with large immigrant populations.  Such resolutions and recommendations are not binding on the member states and it is left to each member state to take whatever steps it deems necessary to deal with its own particular situation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that teachers generally are sensitive to the need to cultivate and foster in their pupils the concept of equality of people and the necessity to understand and accommodate different views on a wide range of issues.  I will be asking my Department to keep the matter under review in the light of possible changes that will be brought about by greater cohesion and integration in the post 1992 Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing syllabi at all levels of the educational system make considerable provision for the inclusion of the European dimension.  New syllabi are being introduced on a gradual basis and a conscious effort is being made to <Col N="2042" /> afford more overt treatment to the European dimension.  The most recent example of this is the new junior certificate in which the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment have placed strong emphasis on the development of European awareness in drawing up the new syllabi.  Of the new syllabi, history, geography and business studies have a particular important role to play in promoting the European dimension in education. When the NCCA will commence work on the reform of the leaving certificate syllabi, the same principle will obtain.  At primary level, the NCCA will adopt the same approach when introducing changes to the primary school curriculum. The NCCA will be targeting the core subjects of Irish, English and mathematics but it is in the subject area of social and environmental studies that the European dimension can perhaps be best emphasised.</P>
      <P>I attach considerable importance to the European dimension in higher education. The mobility of students and teachers in higher education has been facilitated by active participation of the institutions in EC-sponsored programmes such as ERASMUS and COMETT.  It is also important that the higher education institutions are made aware of the need to prepare students, especially those who cannot participate on the international mobility programmes, for the consequences of the completion of the internal market.</P>
      <P>The European Schools Day Competition, which is organised annually by my Department, aims to focus the attention of pupils and teachers on European integration.  Valuable travel prizes are awarded to senior cycle prize winners. The travel prizes enable the young people involved to travel to prize winners gatherings throughout Europe.  Each gathering provides the participants with the opportunity of learning about Europe by taking part in a range of educational, cultural and social activities.  Each year travel prizes are awarded to 16 senior cycle students at a cost of £8,500 (1991 rates).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> The colleges and agencies responsible for providing pre-service and in-service education for teachers devote considerable attention to European affairs in their courses.  My Department have made a grant available this year to Mary Immaculate Training College in Limerick to assist an exchange project of one month's duration to prepare student teachers for developing a basic curriculum on the European dimension in primary schools.  A grant was made available to the Teachers' Centre in Drumcondra as a contribution to the running of a European Conference on &ldquo;Integration and Change &mdash; Professional Development of Teachers in Europe&rdquo;.  My Department have also set funds aside to enable five teachers' centres to promote greater awareness of the European Dimension in Education.</P>
    <P>In view of our geographical peripherality, it is necessary that every opportunity be afforded to our young people and their teachers open up their minds to the challenges and opportunities offered by the European dimension.</P>

    <P>In accordance with a programme approved by Government for the provision of major sports facilities at national, regional and local level, the Custom House Docks Development Authority, as my Department's development agent for the project, have either acquired or agreed terms for approximately 90 per cent of the 12 acre site in the Custom House Docks area for the national sports centre and negotiations are ongoing for the acquisition of the <Col N="2045" /> remainder of the site.  The proposal envisaged procurement under a design, construct, part-finance and manage package with the State providing a payment of £3 million per annum from the national lottery over an agreed leasing period.

      <P>Provision for the payment of pensions by my Department to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pensions scheme for such dependants was introduced. Payment of pension benefits under the contributory scheme is dependent upon the soldier having been a member of the scheme and having paid the appropriate contributions as required by its terms.</P>
      <P>Membership of the contributory scheme was compulsory in the case of soldiers enlisting after 31 January 1978, and optional in the case of soldiers already serving at the time.  Soldiers in the latter category were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  It was made clear at the time that no benefits could be paid under the scheme to the dependants of solidiers who opted out of membership and that a further opportunity of joining the scheme would not be given at a later date.</P>
      <P>In fact, a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted in 1985 when all soldiers, as well as pensioners and the representatives of deceased soldiers, who had opted out of the scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme.  Unfortunately, some still chose not to do so.</P>
      <P>I have initiated an examination of the question of again re-opening options in relation to membership of the contributory scheme.  However, bearing in mind the possible implications for many other areas of the public service if membership options were re-opened for soldiers, I would not be too optimistic of a favourable outcome.</P>

      <P>As part of the process of completing the internal market in air transport within the EC Community, the EC Commission submitted to the Council of Ministers (Transport) in July 1991 draft Council Regulations governing the further liberalisation of this sector, entitled: (i) Licensing of Air Carriers; (ii) Access for Air Carriers to Intra-Community Air routes; and (iii) Fares and Rates for Air Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> In addition, the Commission has submitted draft Council Regulations amending: (i) Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3975/87 laying down the procedure for the application of the rules on competition to undertakings in the air transport sector; (ii) Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3976/87 on the application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices in the air transport sector.</P>
    <P>Council Regulation No. 3976/87 is to be revised by 31 December 1992.</P>
    <P>Broadly, the Commission's proposals provide for the harmonisation of rules among member states for the licensing of air carriers; the opening up of full traffic rights, including fifth freedom, seventh freedom and cabotage rights to all Community air carriers; the abolition of capacity sharing restrictions; the introduction of a double disapproval fares regime under which all fares would come into effect unless disapproved by both member states involved and the maintenance of exemptions from the rules of competition of the Treaty for certain categories of inter-airline agreements, decisions and concerted practices and the extension of the competition rules of the Treaty to domestic air transport.</P>
    <P>As the Commission's proposals are consistent with stated Government policy on the development of air transport, Ireland will be supporting the general thrust of the proposals.</P>
    <P>I should add that in January 1991, the Commission submitted to the Council a draft Regulation on Common Rules for the Allocation of Slots at Community Airports.  Negotiations at Council level on these proposals are at a very early stage, but we have already expressed our concern that certain aspects of the proposals could have possible major negative consequences on existing air services between Ireland and certain airports in other EC member states.  Similar concerns have been expressed by the majority of member states.</P>

      <P>It has been recognised for some time that a substantial amount of freight traffic which might have been expected to travel via the central and southern corridors travels instead through the northern corridor. This diversion of traffic is attributable to a number of interwoven factors which operate in favour of the northern ports, including shipping costs, frequency and capacity of shipping services, port charges, lower costs of Northern Ireland hauliers and so on.</P>
      <P>These problems are being tackled, <i>inter alia,</i> through a major programme of investment in transport infrastructure under the operational programme on peripherality.  A key objective of this investment is to reduce the transport cost disadvantages which Ireland's unique peripherality and island nation status imposes on Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>For the same reason, as explained in the reply to a parliamentary question last week, a formal application has been made on behalf of the Government for EC grant aid for mobile assets.</P>
